PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Wausau, Wisconsin. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the original Code as amended through Ordinance No. 61-5834 , adopted March 24, 2020, and the zoning ordinance , as adopted November 26, 2019. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, section 18.12.040 is section .040, located in chapter 18.12 of title 18. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
Title 1 - General Provisions 	1:1 
Title 2 - Administration and Personnel 	2:1 
Code Comparative Table 	CCT:1 
Code Index 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stands as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this republication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the republication. With this system, the republication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the republication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this republication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the republication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Title 2 - ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL  
Chapter 2.02 - GENERAL PERSONNEL POLICIES 
 
2.02.010 - Purpose. 
During 1974, the Human Resources Committee determined to undertake a general realignment and reorganization of the officers, officials and employees of the City. In 1975, the Human Resources Committee recommended to the Council that several existent ordinances be renumbered, amended or repealed, and that several new ordinances be created. As a result, chapter 2.08, a Charter ordinance adopted November 15, 1971, was repealed by chapter 2.06, a Charter ordinance adopted August 12, 1975, effective October 18, 1975. chapters 2.02, 2.08, 2.10 and 2.12 were renumbered, amended, repealed and recreated, and adopted August 12, 1975, effective October 18, 1975. 
The general scheme was to include those officers, officials and employees in separate ordinances, where a common factor applied to each of them. The common factor may be the appointing authority or state statutes, or that the official City "Table of Organization," (hereafter T/O), required creation of the ordinance. Each ordinance is quite similar, but each has differences. 
Several ordinances that pertained to individual offices and purported to be job descriptions were repealed, for most of their provisions were found in state law, other ordinances, or the general employment policies of the City. 
Past experience indicates the personnel policies established by these ordinances and the table of organization will need constant review. Frequent changes in federal and state laws will require some amendments. Other amendments will arise as the scope of various offices and positions expands or contracts to meet changing needs of the citizens, the Council and the municipal corporation. Amendments may only be made by action of the Common Council. Therefore, all City officers, officials and employees should anticipate and facilitate these continuing adjustments to the changing scope of the work. 
A quick-finder alphabetical index for the section that applies to the office or position is codified in section 2.02.020.

Many offices or job titles have been deleted from the Code book. They now appear in the T/O. 
(Ord. 61-4291 §1(part), 1975.)  
2.02.040 - Offices alternative to state law established. 
The statutes provide that certain offices shall be established in cities, or in the alternative, a City may abolish the office and assign to another the duties of such office. Accordingly, the membership of the Board of Public Works shall be the Attorney, Finance Director and Director of Public Works and Utilities. 
(Ord. 61-5735 §2(part), 2017: Ord. 61-4473 §1, 1980; Ord. 61-4291 §1(part), 1975.)  
2.02.050 - Appointment and compensation of aides, assistants and deputies. 
State law provides, and in some instances requires, that deputies be appointed. They shall be appointed by their respective superiors. 
In some instances department heads or other supervisory personnel appoint aides or assistants. The power to make such appointments arises out of the authority inherent to such positions of responsibility. 
No deputy, aide or assistant shall be granted compensation for services rendered as such unless the position appears in the T/O and the amount of the compensation appears in an adopted budget. 
(Ord. 61-4291 §1(part), 1975.)  
2.02.060 - Selection process prior to appointment. 
When a vacancy occurs in an office to which chapters 2.06, 2.08, 2.10 and 2.12 apply; the Appointing Authority shall promptly meet with the Director of Human Resources to discuss selection of an appropriate individual to fill that vacancy. The Director of Human Resources shall develop and execute a recruitment plan for the selection of a qualified individual to fill the position. Such system may include advertising the vacancy, testing applicants, interviewing applicants, establishing and weighting appropriate selection factors and designating qualified applicants. Recruitment and evaluation procedures shall be conducted in a manner recognized by the human resources profession as generally acceptable. The appointing authority, after consultation with the Director of Human Resources, shall then appoint to such position one of the person who has successfully been certified as qualified for the vacant position. 
(Ord. 61-5585 §1, 2013, File No. 13-0806; Ord. 61-4291 §1(part), 1975.)  
2.02.070 - Discrimination. 
No officer, official or employee shall discriminate against a job applicant or an employee in violation of any Federal, State or City law or regulation notwithstanding such are not enumerated in this chapter. Such discrimination shall be grounds for discipline. 
(Ord. 61-4291 §1(part), 1975.)  
2.02.080 - Procedures in employment relations. 
The Human Resources Committee shall: 
(a)  Jurisdiction. Have charge of all matters arising under Wis. Stats. ch. 111. 
(b)  Election, certification, decertification, fact finding and mediation. The Human Resources Committee shall direct the conduct on behalf of the City of all proceedings involving the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission relative to fact finding proceedings and mediations and relative to the election, certification and decertification of collective bargaining units, including proceedings for the determination of the number of employees, type of bargaining unit and eligibility of employees in the classified service to participate in such elections. 
(c)  Collective bargaining and negotiations. Collective bargaining and negotiations with certified bargaining units shall be carried on as the Human Resources Committee shall from time to time direct. 
(d)  Agreement. The agreements reached at the conclusion of such collective bargaining shall be reduced to writing and submitted in the form of a proposed ordinance or resolution to the Common Council for its approval, amendment or rejection. 
(e)  Enforcement. Upon direction of the Human Resources Committee, the City Attorney and/or labor negotiator shall be authorized to institute legal proceedings to prevent employees from continuing to engage in practices prohibited by or in violation of Wis. Stats. ch. 111 and to enforce any ordinance or resolution by the Common Council relating to agreements reached at the conclusion of collective bargaining procedures, as provided for in subsections (c) and (d). 
(f)  Employees not included in recognized bargaining units. The Human Resources Committee and Human Resources Director shall annually review the wages, hours and conditions of employment of all employees not represented by recognized City employee organizations and submit their recommendations to the Common Council each year for the following year. 
(Ord. 61-4382 §1, 1978; Ord. 61-4291 §1(part), 1975.)  
Chapter 2.03 - CODE OF ETHICS FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES 
 
2.03.010 - Declaration of policy. 
(a)  Moral and ethical standards among City public officials and employees are essential to the conduct of representative government; and, the Common Council believes that a code of ethics, to establish standards of conduct for government officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the impartial and responsible exercise of the public trust and avoid conflicts between personal interests and public responsibilities, will improve the quality and integrity of public service and promote, strengthen and nurture the faith and confidence of the citizens of this community in their public officials and employees. 
(b)  This code does not prevent any official/employee from accepting other employment or following any pursuit, which in no way interferes with the full and faithful discharge of his or her public duties. The Common Council recognizes that citizens who serve the City as public officials/employees retain their rights as citizens to interest of a personal or economic nature; that standards of ethical conduct for public officials/employees of the City need to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society and those conflicts which are substantial and material; and, that City officials/employees may need to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and/or their families, to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity or may need to maintain investments, when activities or investments do not conflict with the specific provisions of this section.

Such person may be guided by the opinion rendered by the board and the board is prohibited from issuing any complaint against any such person who acts in accordance with the opinion. Such person shall have the opportunity to present his or her interpretation of the facts at issue and of the applicability of provisions of this chapter before the advisory opinion is rendered. A material conflict of interest on the part of any person is deemed to exist whenever the person's action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to produce or assist in producing a substantial benefit, directly or indirectly, for the person or his or her immediate family or an organization with which he or she is associated or the matter in question is one in which the official/employee, in his or her private capacity, or a member of his or her immediate family or an organization with which he or she is associated, has a substantial interest;

The board may, however, make such records public with the consent of the individual requesting the advisory opinion or the organization or governmental body on whose behalf it is requested. A person who makes or reports to make public the substance of or any portion of an advisory opinion requested by or on behalf of the person is deemed to have waived the confidentiality of the request for an advisory opinion and any of the records obtained or prepared by the board, in connection with the request for an advisory opinion. 
(g)  Records obtained or prepared by the board, in connection with an investigation, are not open for public inspection, except that the board shall permit inspection of records that are made public in the course of hearing by the board to determine if a violation of this chapter has occurred.

(c)  Following the receipt of a verified complaint or upon the receipt of other information, whether or not under oath, that provides a reasonable basis for the belief that a violation of this chapter has been committed, or that an investigation of a possible violation is warranted, the board may investigate the circumstances concerning the possible violation. No investigation of any person may be commenced until it has been authorized by the board, by a majority vote, and until the person, who is the subject of the investigation, has been notified of the investigation, pursuant to subsection (c)(3) of this section.

(2)  If a verified complaint has been filed and the board finds probable cause to believe that a violation of this chapter, other than one contained in the complaint, has occurred, it may amend the complaint upon its own motion, to include such violations. If the complaint is so amended by the board, a copy of the amendment shall be sent to the person complained of within 48 hours.

During any investigation and during any hearing which is conducted to determine whether a violation of this chapter has occurred, the person under investigation or the accused may be represented by counsel of his or her choosing and the accused or his or her representative, if any, shall have an opportunity to challenge the sufficiency of any complaint, which has been filed against him or her, to examine all documents and records obtained or prepared by the board in connection with the matter heard, to bring witness, to establish all pertinent facts and circumstances, to question or refute testimony or evidence, including the opportunity to confront and cross examine adverse witnesses.

Chapter 2.20 - ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT

A uniform procedure for enforcement of municipal rules, regulations and laws is a purpose of this chapter. It also grants authority to certain department heads to cause actions to be initiated. This chapter does not apply to enforcement by Police Department personnel except as otherwise specifically provided. Wherever the term City Attorney appears, it includes assistants and special counsel. 
(Ord. 61-5616 §2(part), 2014; Ord. 61-4412 §1(part), 1979.)  
2.20.020 - Compliance. 
It is a policy of the City that compliance, not revenue, is an objective of the municipal code. It is determined to be in the public interest that City officials and employees exercise discretion, where appropriate, to obtain compliance without resorting to court action. 
(Ord. 61-4412 §1(part), 1979.)  
2.20.030 - Special inspection warrants. 
The City Attorney may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for special inspection warrants. Special inspection warrants provide for entry into premises where entry has been refused to an inspector. (See Wis. Stats. § 66.0119) 
(Ord. 61-4412 §1(part), 1979.)  
2.20.040 - Uniform ordinance violation citation.

(Ord. 61-5735 §6(part), 2017; Ord. 61-5616 §3(part), 2014; Ord. 61-5377 §3 (part), 2008; Ord. 61-4413 §1, 1979; Ord. 61-4412 §1(part), 1979.)  
2.20.045 - Enforcement of certain property violations. 
(a)  Findings. The Wausau City Council has determined that correction of certain minor, non-structural code violations concerning real property would be greatly enhanced by timely enforcement and the collection of a forfeiture designed to encourage code compliance, defray the administrative costs of enforcement, but which does not carry the additional burden of court costs on property owners, occupants, or other persons in charge of real property. The City Council finds that the issuance of warning letters in advance of enforcement of these minor, non-structural violations is a time-consuming and staff-intensive way to achieve code compliance and permits blighted or other unsightly conditions to linger in City neighborhoods to the detriment of the community and surrounding property owners and residents. This ordinance is enacted to encourage property owners, occupants, and other persons in charge of real property to exercise their responsibility to ensure that the following City ordinances governing the condition and maintenance of property are followed to improve conditions in City neighborhoods and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
(b)  Notice of property violation. In lieu of issuing a municipal uniform ordinance violation citation under section 1.01.025 for code violations set forth in subsection (c), officials authorized pursuant to sections 1.01.027 or 2.20.040 of this Code may issue a Notice of Property Violation to the real property owner, occupant, or other person in charge of the real property served by 1st class mail or as provided under Wis. Stat. s. 801.11(1)(a) and (b), (5), and (6). The Notice of Property Violation shall provide for a forfeiture upon stipulation as provided in subsection (c) and shall provide that such forfeiture shall be paid only upon the agreement or stipulation of the alleged violator to the violation and the forfeiture amount. 
(c)  Violations. The forfeiture upon stipulation for the following minor, non-structural code violations relating to real property defined in the respective code reference shall be in accordance with the following schedule: 
Location of waste container violations 	[6.44.040(c)] 	$30.00 
Waste container curbside hour violations 	[6.44.060] 	30.00 
Noncollectible materials 	[6.44.080] 	30.00 
Storing of refuse 	[6.44.090] 	30.00 
Failure to mow 	[6.48.010] 	30.00 
Removal of animal excreta 	[8.08.220] 	30.00 
Obstructions and encroachments prohibited 	[12.44.020] 	30.00 
Permits required, unapproved signs 	[15.48.030] 	30.00 
Signs on City property 	[15.48.120] 	30.00 
Unregistered, unlicensed and junk vehicles 	[16.04.035] 	50.00 
Off-street parking in yards 	[23.12.130] 	30.00 
Storage of recreational equipment in yards 	[23.12.133] 	30.00 
 
(d)  Stipulation to violation. An alleged violator noticed under subsection (b) may, but is not required to, enter into a stipulation of guilt or no contest to the violation and to the forfeiture set forth in subsection (c) by paying the stipulated amount within 14 days of the issuance date of the Notice of Property Violation. The amount of the stipulated forfeiture shall be paid in cash, money order, or bank check to the City Clerk. A stipulated forfeiture shall not be deemed timely where any payment made by check is dishonored by the bank. In the event the alleged violator elects not to enter into a stipulation with respect to the violation and pay the forfeiture as provided herein, the City may issue the alleged violator a municipal uniform ordinance violation citation pursuant to section 1.01.025, commencing an action in municipal court and providing the alleged violator the opportunity, among other things, to enter a plea of not guilty and to contest the alleged violation through trial. In such cases, the penalty for the violation upon successful prosecution shall include the costs of prosecution imposed as provided in section 1.01.025(c)(2) and chapter 2.19. 
(e)  Review of notice of property violation. An alleged violator may obtain review of the Notice of Property Violation by submitting a written request for review together with any relevant information and a copy of the notice to the Chief Inspector, zoning and inspection division within 14 days of the issuance date of the notice. The alleged violator will have 14 days from the date of an adverse decision on the request for review to enter into a stipulation of guilt or no contest to the violation and pay the forfeiture set forth in subsection (c) if he/she so elects. In the event the alleged violator elects not to enter into a stipulation, the City may issue the alleged violator a municipal uniform ordinance violation citation as provided in subsection (c). In the event the Chief Inspector finds in favor of the alleged violator, the Notice of Property Violation will be dismissed. The City elects not to be bound by Wis. Stats. ch. 68 with respect to administrative procedure in this regard.

Stats. § 68.10, and making a final determination thereupon. The chairman of the Public Health and Safety Committee, the chairman of the Capital Improvement and Street Maintenance Committee, and one citizen shall constitute the membership. The Mayor shall appoint the citizen member and in addition one alternate, who shall act only when a member of the Appeals Board is temporarily unable to serve or refuses, or may not serve, because of interest in or involvement in a prior determination on the subject matter of the appeal. Where there is doubt as to the propriety of acting, the member shall request an informal opinion of the City Attorney and act in accord with such opinion. 
(Ord. 61-4443 §1(part), 1980.)  
2.21.040 - Board—Procedures.

Chapter 2.22 - AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
 
2.22.010 - Purpose. 
(a)  Federal and state laws and administrative rules require employers, both public and private, to engage in certain personnel policies. Those same laws and rules likewise prohibit certain personnel practices by employers. 
(b)  Affirmative action has as its goal the more or less equal representation in employee groups throughout the United States of racial minorities, women, and the handicapped. Equal representation is generally defined as the same mix on the employee roster as each class or group represents in the local population mix; for example: If American Indians represent three percent of the population in the locality in which the employees reside, employee rosters should be composed of about three percent American Indians. The income and responsibility levels should also reflect proportionate ratios of each class or group; for example: If women represent 25 percent of the employees in a company, generally speaking, 25 percent of the supervisors, managers and executives should be women. 
(c)  Upon examination of the current roster of City employees, it is clear policies to achieve the aforesaid goals are required; therefore, the Common Council of the City declares its intention to comply with federal and state laws and regulations by adopting and implementing the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
(Ord. 61-4312 §1(part), 1976.)  
2.22.020 - Policy. 
The City shall, subject to the provisions of any and all lawful collective bargaining agreements, insure a policy of equal employment opportunity in all of its policies affecting recruiting, hiring, transfers, promotions, compensation, in-service education, layoff and recall practices, and all other benefits. These shall be administered without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, handicap, sex or age, except where sex or age is a bona fide occupational qualification. 
(Ord. 61-4312 §1(part), 1976.)  
2.22.030 - Dissemination of policy. 
Some or all of the following techniques shall be employed to achieve the widest possible dissemination of the program's existence and goals: 
(a)  Post appropriate materials on departmental bulletin boards; 
(b)  Conduct in-service affirmative action programs; 
(c)  Disseminate affirmative action information and materials in employee orientation programs; 
(d)  Inform recruiting sources in writing of the affirmative action program and request that these sources actively recruit from and refer underrepresented classes of persons for vacancies as they occur;

The goals and timetables shall be reviewed at least annually by the Diversity Committee to insure that the goals are attainable, significant, and measurable in accordance with economic conditions and the size of the work force. These goals and timetables shall be presented to the Diversity Committee for review. 
(b)  The Human Resources Director shall establish audit and reporting procedures for all departmental employment activities including, but not limited to, job interviews, selection, placement, promotions and terminations; measure the overall effectiveness of the affirmative action program; provide career counseling for all employees; and report quarterly to the Diversity Committee on problems, progress and the attainment of departmental goals and timetables. 
(c)  The City shall recruit persons from under represented classes for all positions. The following shall take place: 
(1)  Organizations which represent or are concerned with racial minorities, women, and the handicapped shall be contacted regarding job openings. 
(2)  The City shall cooperate with all federally funded manpower programs operating within the community. 
(3)  All high schools, institutes, colleges and universities in the community shall be appraised of this program and their support shall be solicited.

(3)  For every authority not specified in (1) or (2) of this subsection (c), the authority's Chief Administrative Officer is the legal custodian for the authority, but the officer may designate an employee of his or her staff to act as the legal custodian. 
(4)  Each legal custodian shall name a person to act as legal custodian in his or her absence or the absence of his or her designee. 
(5)  The legal custodian shall have full legal power to render decisions and to carry out the duties of an authority under Wis. Stats. § ch. 19, subch. 11, and this section. The designation of a legal custodian does not affect the powers and duties of an authority under this section. 
(d)  Public access to records. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (f), any person has a right to inspect a record and to make or receive a copy of any record as provided in Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1). 
(2)  Records will be available for inspection and copying during all regular office hours. 
(3)  If regular office hours are not maintained at the location where records are kept, the records will be available for inspection and copying upon at least 48 hours' advance notice of intent to inspect or copy. 
(4)  A requester shall be permitted to use facilities comparable to those available to City employees to inspect, copy or abstract a record. 
(5)  The legal custodian may require supervision during inspection or may impose other reasonable restrictions on the manner of access to an original record if the record is irreplaceable or easily damaged. 
(6)  A requester shall be charged a fee to defray the cost of locating and copying records as follows: 
(A)  The cost of photocopying shall be as provided in section 3.40.010(a). Said cost has been calculated not to exceed the actual, necessary and direct cost of reproduction. 
(B)  If the form of a written record does not permit copying, the actual and necessary cost of photographing and photographic processing shall be charged. 
(C)  The actual full cost of providing a copy of other records not in printed form on paper, such as films, computer printouts and audio or videotapes, shall be charged. 
(D)  If mailing or shipping is necessary, the actual cost thereof shall also be charged. 
(E)  There shall be no charge for locating a record unless the actual cost therefor exceeds $50.00, in which case the actual cost shall be determined by the legal custodian and billed to the requester. 
(F)  The legal custodian shall estimate the cost of all applicable fees and may require a cash deposit adequate to assure payment if such estimate exceeds $5.00. 
(G)  Elected and appointed officials of the City shall not be required to pay for public records they may reasonably require for the proper performance of their official duties. 
(H)  The legal custodian may provide copies of a record without charge or at a reduced charge where he or she determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest. 
(7)  Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 19.34, and the guidelines therein listed, each authority shall adopt, prominently display and make available for inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance of the public, a notice containing a description of its organization and the established times and places at which, the legal custodian from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information and access to records in its custody, make requests for records, or obtain copies of records, and the costs thereof. 
(e)  Access procedures. 
(1)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Wis. Stats. § 19.37. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under subsection (d)(6)(F). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(2)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(3)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in subsection (f). If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the Attorney General or a District Attorney. 
(f)  Limitations on right to access. 
(1)  As provided by Wis. Stats. § 19.36, the following records are exempt from inspection under this section: 
(A)  Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law; 
(B)  Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state; 
(C)  Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection; and 
(D)  A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret. 
(2)  As provided by Wis. Stats. § 43.30, public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this section. 
(3)  In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(A)  Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them; 
(B)  Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing; 
(C)  Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or discipline of any City officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a City officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure; 
(D)  Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention; 
(E)  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of City property, investing of City funds, or other City business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure; 
(F)  Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data; 
(G)  Communications between legal counsel for the City and any officer, agent or employee of the City, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the City or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under Wis. Stats. § 905.03. 
(4)  If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the City Attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the City Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgment of the custodian and the City Attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure. 
(g)  Destruction of records. 
(1)  City officers may destroy the following nonutility financial records of which they are the legal custodians and which are considered obsolete, after completion of any required audit by the bureau of municipal audit or an auditor licensed under Wis. Stats. ch. 442, but not less than seven years after payment or receipt of any sum involved in the particular transaction, unless a shorter period has been fixed by the State Public Records Board pursuant to Wis.

Stats. § 16.61(3)(e), and then after such a shorter period, except that water stubs, receipts of current billings and customers' ledgers may be destroyed after two years: 
(A)  Water and sewer stubs and receipts of current billings; 
(B)  Customer's ledgers; 
(C)  Vouchers and supporting documents pertaining to charges not included in plant accounts; 
(D)  Other utility records with the written approval of the State Public Service Commission. 
(3)  City officers may destroy the following records of which they are the legal custodian and which are considered obsolete, but not less than seven years after the record was effective unless another period has been set by statute, and then after such a period, or unless a shorter period has been fixed by the State Public Records Board pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 16.61(3)(e), and then after such a shorter period: 
(A)  Assessment rolls and related records, including Board of Review minutes; 
(B)  Contracts and papers relating thereto;

(D)  Financial reports other than annual financial reports;

(4)  Unless notice is waived by the State Historical Society, at least 60 days' notice shall be given the State Historical Society prior to the destruction of any record as provided by Wis. Stats. § 19.21(4)(a). 
(5)  Any tape recordings of a governmental meeting of the City may be destroyed, erased or reused no sooner than 90 days after the minutes of the meeting have been approved and published, if the purpose of the recording was to make minutes of the meeting. 
(h)  Preservation through microfilm. Any City officer, or the director of any department or division of City government may keep and preserve public records in his or her possession by means of microfilm or other photographic reproduction method. Such records shall meet the standards for photographic reproduction set forth in Wis. Stats. § 16.61(7)(a) and (b), and shall be considered original records for all purposes. Such records shall be preserved along with other files of the department or division and shall be open to public inspection and copying according to the provisions of state law and subsections (d) through (f).

A NOTE ON RECORDS RETENTION: The State Historical Society no longer has facilities to house records you do not have space for. Heretofore, it was possible to store your permanent records with them. Now if a record is to be retained by your municipality permanently it is incumbent upon your municipality to find a place in which to store it. Wis. Stats. § 19.21(4) now offers a method of destroying records which no longer have to be retained without the need to notify the Historical Society each time you destroy such records. This is accomplished by adopting a Records Retention Schedule and an Ordinance approved by them. Contact the State Historical Society for further information. The Schedule herein (for copyright reasons) is not in the format they wish you to use. 
NOTE OF CAUTION: In spite of (and "notwithstanding") this retention schedule, if the records you are considering to discard have anything to do with a state or federal grant or federal pass through money - Wisconsin Fund, Wisconsin Development Fund, Community Development Block Grant, Urban Development Block Grant, EPA, EDA, etc., contact the grant agency first. As a rule of thumb, do not even think about discarding these kinds of documents unless ten years have passed.

2.82.060 - Creation of historic districts. 
(a)  Criteria. For preservation purposes, the commission may select geographically defined areas within the City to be designated as either Class I or Class II historic districts. A historic district may be designated for any geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the City which: 
(1)  Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, state or community; or 
(2)  Is identified with a historic person or with important events in national, state or local history; or 
(3)  Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of architectural type specimens inherently valuable for the study of a period or periods, styles, methods of construction, indigenous materials or craftsmanship; or 
(4)  Is representative of the notable works of master builders, designers or architects. 
(b)  Review and adoption procedure historic districts. 
(1)  Historic Preservation Commission. 
(A)  The Historic Preservation Commission shall hold a public hearing when considering the designation of a historic district. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such hearing shall be given by publication as a class 1 notice under the Wisconsin Statutes in the official City paper. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the public hearing shall also be sent to the City Clerk and to the owners of record, as listed in the office of the City assessor, who are owners of property within the proposed historic district. Said notice is to be sent at least 40 days prior to the date of the public hearing. Following the public hearing, the Historic Preservation Commission shall vote to recommend, reject, withhold action on the designation of the historic district or to amend the boundaries of the proposed district. The commission shall have another public hearing in accordance with the procedures for hearing under this section if the commission votes to amend the boundaries. 
(B)  If within 30 days of the date of publication of notice of the public hearing under subdivision (1)(A) of this subsection, a petition objecting to the creation of the proposed historic district signed by at least one-third of the owners of lots within the boundaries of the proposed historic district as indicated in the notice is filed in the City Clerk's office, no further action shall be taken on the proposed historic district. It shall not be submitted to the Plan Commission for consideration nor shall it be submitted to the Common Council. For any proposed historic district, the Historic Preservation Commission may not consider a proposal to create a historic district containing any of the property within the proposed historic district as indicated in the notice within one year from the date of the initial notice, if such petition has been filed. 
(C)  If no petition or an insufficient petition having the signatures of less than one-third of the owners of lots within the proposed historic district is received, the recommendation of the Historic Landmark Commission shall be made in writing and shall be forwarded to the Plan Commission within 30 days following the close of the public hearing for consideration at the Plan Commission's next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(2)  Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall review the historic district recommendation of the commission and make a recommendation to the Common Council within 30 days. The Plan Commission shall consider the following factors in formulating a recommendation: 
(A)  Will the designation of the property as a historic district interfere with the orderly, coordinated, and harmonious development of the City; 
(B)  Will the designation of the property as a historic district conflict with parts of the master plan, official map or redevelopment plans; 
(C)  Will the designation of property as a historic district promote the general public health, safety and general welfare. 
(3)  The Common Council. The Common Council, upon receipt of the recommendations from the Plan Commission and historic landmark commission, shall either designate or reject the historic district at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Designation of the historic district shall be done by adoption of an ordinance setting forth the geographical boundaries of such district, which ordinance shall be recorded, at City expense, in the office of the county register of deeds. 
(c)  Amendment/alteration of historic district boundaries. A written request to the commission to amend or alter the boundaries of a historic district that has been created under this section may be made at any time by any property owner wishing to either include or exclude their property within the boundaries of a historic district. The commission may also consider amendments or alterations to historic district boundaries on the commission's own motion. The Historic Preservation Commission and Plan Commission shall follow the review and adoption procedures outlined in section 2.82.060(b)(1) and (2) in considering any request for amendment or alteration of historic district boundaries, except that only the owners of property included within the proposed amendment area shall be sent a copy of the required public hearing notice. The Common Council, upon receipt of the recommendations of the Plan Commission and Historic Preservation Commission, shall either amend, alter or not change the historic district boundary at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Amendment or alteration of historic district boundaries shall be done by ordinance setting forth the geographical boundaries affected, which ordinance shall be recorded, at City expense, in the office of the county register of deeds.

(Ord. 61-5826 §1, 2020, File No. 20-0109)  
2.82.070 - Construction, alteration or removal. 
(a)  Certificate of appropriateness required. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required before any construction, alteration or removal is undertaken on: 
(1)  A landmark; 
(2)  A building located upon a lot which includes a landmark; 
(3)  A building within a Class I historic district; 
(4)  A lot within a Class I historic district; 
(5)  A building upon a historic site. 
No owner, except an owner in a Class II historic district, shall perform or permit or cause to be performed any construction, alteration or removal involving such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by the commission. Owners in a Class II historic district shall apply for a certificate of appropriateness but the decision of the commission shall be advisory only and construction, alteration or removal may proceed after final decision by the commission or if the commission fails to act within the time prescribed in (c). 
(b)  Application for certificates of appropriateness. 
(1)  Every application for a building permit, including the accompanying plans and specifications, for which an application for a certificate of appropriateness is also required, shall be forwarded by the Building Inspection Department to the commission within two business days following receipt of the application by the Building Inspection Department. The Building Inspection Department shall not issue the building permit until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by the commission or if no determination has been made by the commission within the time prescribed in (c)(1). 
(2)  Application for review of construction, alteration or removal not requiring a building permit but for which an application for a certificate of appropriateness is required shall be made on a form prepared by the commission and available at the office of the Building Inspection Department. The application shall be filed with the Building Inspection Department and shall be forwarded to the commission within two business days following receipt by the Building Inspection Department. 
(c)  Determination by commission. 
(1)  The commission shall review the application and decide whether or not to issue a certificate of appropriateness within seven business days of the filing of the application for a building permit under subsection (b)(1) of this section or the application for a certificate of appropriateness under subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
(2)  The commission shall establish an ad hoc subcommittee of no less than three of its members to review applications for a certificate of appropriateness. The subcommittee review of the application shall take place within five business days of the filing of the application with the commission. A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued upon the signatures of a majority of the members of the subcommittee. If not reviewed within five business days, the application shall be deemed approved. 
(3)  Written notice of the approval or denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be provided to the applicant and Building Inspection Department within five business days following the commission's decision and shall be accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness in the case of an approval, which shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. If the commission denies the application, it shall, at the request of the applicant, cooperate and work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of appropriateness within the guidelines of this chapter. 
(d)  Determination of applicable standards for review. In reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness for property located within a historic district, the commission shall first determine whether the application involves a contributing structure or noncontributing structure, as defined in this chapter, and shall then apply the appropriate standards for review. 
(e)  Standards for review—Landmarks, historic sites, contributing structures, etc. The standards set forth in this subsection shall be applied by the commission in reviewing any application for a certificate of appropriateness involving a landmark, building upon a lot which includes a landmark, historic site, contributing structure, building upon a lot which includes a contributing structure within a historic district, or a lot located within a historic district. In such cases, the commission shall approve the application unless: 
(1)  In the case of a landmark, building upon a lot which includes a landmark or building upon a historic site, the proposed construction, alteration or removal would detrimentally change, destroy, or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature of the building which the proposed work involves; or 
(2)  In the case of any building or lot located in a historic district, the proposed construction, alteration or removal would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature of the building which the proposed work involves, or would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other buildings within such district; or 
(3)  In the case of the construction of a new building upon a historic site, the exterior of such building would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other buildings or improvements on such site. 
(f)  Standards for review—Noncontributing structure. The standards set forth in this subsection shall be applied by the commission in reviewing any application for a certificate of appropriateness involving a noncontributing structure or building upon a lot which includes a noncontributing building within a historic district. In such cases, the commission shall approve the application unless: 
(1)  In the case of proposed construction or alteration involving a noncontributing structure: 
(A)  If the proposed work is not done, there is a substantial likelihood that, due to the passage of time, the building will meet the criteria for and become a contributing structure within five years of the application for the certificate of appropriateness; and 
(B)  The proposed work would so substantially change the architectural features of the building as to prevent or impair the building from otherwise meeting the criteria for and becoming a contributing structure. 
(2)  In the case of proposed construction or alteration involving a building upon a lot which includes a noncontributing structure: 
(A)  If the proposed work is not done, there is a substantial likelihood that, due to the passage of time, the noncontributing structure upon the lot will meet the criteria for and become a contributing structure within five years of the application for the certificate of appropriateness; and 
(B)  The proposed work would result in a building which so adversely affects the appearance of or fails to harmonize with the appearance of the noncontributing structure upon the lot as to prevent or impair the noncontributing structure from otherwise meeting the criteria for and becoming a contributing structure. 
(3)  In the case of the proposed removal of a noncontributing structure or building upon a lot which includes a noncontributing structure, there is a substantial likelihood that, due to the passage of time, the noncontributing structure will meet the criteria for and become a contributing structure within five years of the application for the certificate of appropriateness. 
(g)  Standards for review—Economic hardship. In the case of any alteration or construction for which a certificate of appropriateness is required, the commission may deviate from the standards for review which may otherwise be applicable and issue the certificate of appropriateness if the failure to do so will result in an economic hardship to the property owner, based upon the following criteria: 
(1)  Rehabilitation of an architectural feature will result in a conflict with other municipal codes or state or federal laws; or 
(2)  Materials for rehabilitation are no longer available; or 
(3)  The cost of rehabilitation is prohibitive. 
(h)  Appeal. An appeal from the decision of the commission to deny a certificate of appropriateness under this chapter may be taken to the Administrative Review Board by the applicant. Such appeal shall be initiated by filing a petition to appeal, specifying the grounds therefor, with the City Clerk within 30 days of the date of the commission's written notice denying the application. The Administrative Review Board may reverse the decision of the commission and require the commission to issue a certificate of appropriateness by a favorable vote of a majority of its members. 
(Ord. 61-5506 §1(part), 2012; Ord. 61-5103 §2, 1998; Ord. 61-4961 §3, 1996; Ord. 61-4897 §1, 1995; Ord. 61-4808 §1(part), 1993.)  
2.82.080 - Demolition. 
(a)  Certificate of appropriateness required. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required before any permit to demolish any of the following may be issued: 
(1)  A landmark; 
(2)  A building upon a lot which includes a landmark; 
(3)  A building within a Class I historic district; 
(4)  A building upon a historic site. 
Every application for a demolition permit for which a certificate of appropriateness is required shall be forwarded by the Building Inspection Department to the commission within seven days following receipt of the application by the Building Inspection Department. The Building Inspection Department shall not issue the demolition permit until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by the commission. 
(b)  Determination by commission. Upon receipt of an application for a demolition permit from the Building Inspection Department, the commission may defer determination to issue a certificate of appropriateness for the proposed demolition for a period of up to 12 months from the time such application was filed, during which time the commission and the applicant may undertake discussions for the purpose of finding a method to save the subject building. At the end of this 12-month period, if no method of saving the subject building has been agreed to by the applicant and the commission, the commission shall decide whether or not to issue the permit to demolish the subject building under the standards set forth in subsection (d) of this section. Written notice of the approval or denial of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition shall be provided to the applicant and Building Inspection Department within seven days following the commission's decision and shall be accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness in the case of an approval, which shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. 
(c)  Hazardous structures or conditions. In the event that a landmark or building for which an application for a demolition permit has been received by the commission poses a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, as determined by the building inspector, the building inspector shall issue a permit for demolition within a reasonable period of time in light of the hazard to the public, but in no event longer than three months from the receipt of the application. 
(d)  Standards for review. In determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness for any demolition, the commission shall consider any or all of the following: 
(1)  Whether the building is of such architectural or historic significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the City and the state; 
(2)  Whether the building, although not itself a designated landmark, contributes to the distinctive architectural or historic character of the historic district as a whole and therefore should be preserved for the benefit of the people of the City and the state; 
(3)  Whether the building is of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense; 
(4)  Whether retention of the building would promote the general welfare of the people of the City and the state by encouraging study of American history, architecture and design or by developing an understanding of American culture and heritage; 
(5)  Whether the building is in such a deteriorated condition that it is not structurally or economically feasible to preserve or restore it, provided that any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner which is self-created or which is the result of any failure to maintain the building in good repair cannot qualify as a basis for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness; 
(6)  Whether any new building proposed to be constructed or change in use proposed to be made is compatible with the buildings and environment of the district in which the subject building is located. 
(e)  The owner of a building within a Class II historic district shall make application to the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering for an advisory certificate of appropriateness prior to the demolition of the building. The decision of the commission, or an Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the commission created pursuant to 2.82.070(c)2, is advisory only and demolition may proceed after final decision by the commission. Demolition may proceed in a Class II district if the commission or Ad Hoc Committee fails to act within 14 days of the application being submitted to the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering. 
(f)  Appeal. An appeal from the decision of the commission to deny a certificate of appropriateness for demolition may be taken to the Administrative Review Board by the applicant. Such appeal shall be initiated by filing a petition to appeal, specifying the grounds therefor, with the City Clerk within 30 days of the date of the commission's written notice denying the certificate of appropriateness. The City Clerk shall file the petition to appeal with the Administrative Review Board. The Administrative Review Board may reverse the decision of the commission and require the commission to issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition by a favorable vote of a majority of its members. 
(Ord. 61-5506 §2(part), 2012; Ord. 61-4961 §4, 1996; Ord. 61-4808 §1(part), 1993.)

(Ord. 61-4961 §5, 1996; Ord. 61-4808 §1(part), 1993.)  
2.82.100 - Maintenance of landmarks, historic sites and historic districts. 
(a)  Every owner of a landmark, building upon a lot which includes a landmark, or a building within a historic district or upon a historic site shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of such building and all interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend to cause the exterior portions of such building to fall into a state of disrepair. This provision shall be in addition to all other provisions of law requiring such building to be kept in good repair. 
(b)  Insofar as they are applicable to a landmark, building upon a lot which includes a landmark, or a building within a historic district or upon a historic site, designated under this chapter, any provisions of the plumbing code, the minimum housing and property maintenance code, building code, heating, ventilating and air conditioning code and regulations of the general ordinances may be varied or waived, on application by the appropriate board having such jurisdiction over such chapter or, in the absence of such board, by the Building Inspection Department, provided such variance or waiver does not endanger public health or safety. 
(c)  The Building Inspection Department shall enforce this chapter. 
(Ord. 61-4808 §1(part), 1993.)  
2.82.110 - Conditions dangerous to life, health or property.

Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit the necessary construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any landmark, building upon a lot which includes a landmark, or a building within a historic district or upon a historic site pursuant to order of any governmental agency or pursuant to any court judgment, for the purpose of remedying emergency conditions determined to be dangerous to life, health or property. In such cases, no approval from the commission shall be required. 
(b)  Other codes, regulations and ordinances. In acting on any certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall not have power to override housing, zoning or any other ordinances of the City. 
(Ord. 61-4808 §1(part), 1993.)  
2.82.120 - Penalties for violations. 
Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a forfeiture of up to $100.00 for each separate violation. Each and every day during which a violation continues may be deemed to be a separate offense.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide payment for the construction, reconstruction, improvement and preservation of the sidewalks, driveway approaches, streets, curbs, gutters, sewer and water mains in the City by the levy of special assessments therefor upon various classes of real estate, in a fair and equitable manner, through the application of a variety of formulas. All such levies shall be grounded in the exercise of the police powers of the City. No levies shall be grounded in the special assessment district concept, such as described in Wis.

3.24.030 - Assessment formula—General. 
(a)  The assessment shall be made on the adjusted front footage formula. In such formula, odd-shaped lots and cul-de-sac lots are adjusted to an average frontage equivalent to the frontage of a rectangularly shaped lot of the same depth. This method is declared and found to be a more equitable assessment method than the simple front footage method. The adjusted front footage method gives consideration to the depth and shape, as well as frontage, on the street improved. The plat example following illustrates how the method is used in practice. 
 
Lot A 	Corner lot—Assessable footage shall be based on the frontage of the short side. See Section 3.24.040. 
Lot B 	80 feet by 120 feet 	Adjusted front footage 	80.00 feet

Lot E 	6,600 square feet 
120 feet 	Adjusted front footage 	55.00 feet 
Lot F 	5,400 square feet 
120 feet 	Adjusted front footage 	45.00 feet 
Lot G 	4,600 square feet 
120 feet 	Adjusted front footage 	38.33 feet 
Lot H* 	8,000 square feet 
120 feet 	Adjusted front footage 	66.66 feet 
(Square footage amounts for Lots G and H are estimates) 
* Note that the assessable footage is further modified under Section 3.24.040(a). 
 
(b)  In the adjusted front footage formula in subsection (a) the lot depth figure of 120 feet has been used in the calculations. The figure of 100 feet is the average depth of lots in the City. However, in applying this formula to a specific block, the actual denominator used in the formula shall be the apparent, general lot depth of the block in which the lot is situated or 120 feet, whichever is less. Such apparent lot depth shall be determined by the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee and included in the schedule of the proposed assessments required by Wis. Stats. § 66.0703, subject to the usual control of the Common Council, set forth in the cited section of the statutes. 
(Ord. 61-4775 §1, 1992; Ord. 61-4765 §1(part), 1992; Ord. 61-4593 (part), 1986.)  
3.24.040 - Applying the adjusted front footage formula. 
One hundred twenty feet will be used throughout this section as the denominator for purposes of explaining the application of the formula. 
(a)  Odd-shaped lots. For odd-shaped lots, such as found on cul-de-sacs or triangular intersections, etc., the adjusted front footage is computed by dividing the area of the lot, up to a maximum distance of 120 feet from the street where the improvement is to be installed, by 120 feet. 
When the adjusted front foot formula is applied and results in an adjusted frontage which is greater than the actual frontage, then the assessable footage shall be the greater of the following: 
(1)  If the adjusted lot frontage is greater than the actual frontage, then the assessable footage shall be equal to the adjusted lot frontage but shall not exceed 1.5 times the actual lot frontage. 
(2)  If the adjusted lot frontage is less than the average lot frontage as determined by the Board of Public Works, then the assessable footage shall equal the average lot frontage. 
(b)  Approximately rectangular lots. For a lot which is approximately rectangular, the adjusted front footage is computed by averaging the front and back sides of the lot. If the lot is deeper than 120 feet, the width at the 120-foot depth is used for the back lot line. This method is limited to where the divergence between the front and rear lot lines is five feet or less. 
(c)  Rectangular lots. For the normal rectangular lot, the adjusted front footage is the actual front footage of the lot, using the 120-foot denominator. 
(d)  Shallow LOTS. For rectangular lots under 120 feet in depth, the adjusted front footage is determined by dividing the actual lot area by 120 feet. 
(e)  Neck lots. For lots which have a small frontage on a street, with a narrow strip running back 120 feet more or less, an adjusted front footage is determined by dividing the actual lot area by 120 feet. 
(f)  Corner lots. Corner lot assessments shall be based on the adjusted frontage of the short side. If the short side is the first side improved, the assessable footage shall equal the adjusted frontage of the short side. 
If improvements are made to both the long and short side at the same time, the assessable footage shall equal the adjusted frontage of the short side, plus the excess adjusted frontage of the long side as determined in section 3.24.040(f)(1) and (2). 
If the long side is the first side improved, there shall be an assessment levied for only the excess adjusted frontage on the long side as determined in section 3.24.040(f)(1) and (2). 
If prior assessments on the long side were levied under a previous assessment ordinance, and if those prior improvements have exceeded their design life, then the proposed improvements for the short side shall be assessed at the full amount under this ordinance. 
However, all corner lot assessments may be otherwise separately determined by the Board of Public Works which may levy special assessments or make such deductions as deemed reasonable and equitable for the specific improvement project, as authorized by Wis. Stats. § 66.0703(3). 
As one common example of discretionary action, if improvements such as sidewalk, curb and pavement, or utilities are not likely to be installed on the short side frontage within a reasonable planning period, then the Board of Public Works may determine it is in the public interest to assess the corner lot at the time of the initial improvements even if the improvements are adjacent to the long side frontage of the property. 
In such a case, assessments shall be determined based on the short side frontage plus any excess adjusted frontage on the long side, and no additional assessment shall be levied when improvements are installed on the short side, except for any previously unassessed excess adjusted frontage. 
In those areas where the property lines meet with an arc rather than at a point the frontage shall be computed as one-half the arc measurement plus the measurement of the short side. 
(1)  Maximum corner lot adjustment for large residential lots. Large residential lots shall have a maximum corner lot assessment adjustment based on a 100-foot by 150-foot adjustment parcel "split-out" of the total lot. Assessments shall be levied on both sides of the large lot for frontage in excess of the 100-foot by 150-foot adjustment parcel, but only when improvements are made to each side. 
When the short side is improved, the assessable footage shall be based on the sum of the frontage of the short side of the "split-out" adjustment parcel (100 feet) plus any additional total lot frontage in excess of that 100 feet. (e.g. assessable footage 100 feet + 30 feet = 130 feet) 
When the long side is improved, the assessable footage shall be based on the total lot frontage in excess of the long side of the "split-out" adjustment parcel (150 feet). No assessment shall be levied against the long side of the "split-out" adjustment parcel. (e.g. assessable footage = 25 feet) 
 
(2)  Maximum corner lot adjustment for large business, commercial, or industrial lots. Large business, commercial or industrial corner lots shall have a maximum corner lot assessment adjustment based on a 60-foot by 120-foot adjustment parcel "split-out" of the total lot. Assessments shall be levied on both sides of the large lot for frontage in excess of the 60-foot by 120-foot adjustment parcel; but only when improvements are made to each side. 
When the short side is improved, the assessable footage shall be based on the sum of the frontage of the short side of the "split-out" adjustment parcel (60 feet) plus any additional total lot frontage in excess of that 60 feet. (e.g. assessable footage = 60 feet + 30 feet = 90 feet). 
When the long side is improved, the assessable footage shall be based on the total lot frontage in excess of the long side of the "split-out" adjustment parcel (120 feet). No assessment shall be levied against the long side of the "split-out" adjustment parcel. (e.g. assessable footage = 40 feet). 
 
(g)  Double frontage lots. (See Lot B in the chart.) A double frontage lot assessment is an exception to the rule. Its assessment shall be for the first side served. The assessment shall be computed on the adjusted front foot method that conforms to the shape and size of the lot, except that if the lot is capable of division on a line roughly parallel to either of the abutting streets, into two or more lots upon which two or more principal buildings could be erected according to the regulations of the zoning district in which the lot is located, the assessment shall then be for both sides when served and at the adjusted front foot formula as conforms to the size and shape of the resulting "lot(s)." Any variance that may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals will be excluded from consideration in calculating lot division for purposes of assessment under this section. 
(Ord. 61-5104 §1, 2001, File No. 01-0135; Ord 61-5100 §1, 2001, File No. 01-0135; Ord. 61-4972 §1, 1997; Ord. 61-4775 §2, 1992; Ord. 61-4765 §1(part), 1992; Ord. 61-4593(part), 1986.)  
3.24.050 - Determination of assessment cost for new street construction. 
(a)  Residential assessment. The assessment for the initial installation of street, curb, gutter and pavement construction (see elsewhere in this Code for repair, reconstruction, replacement or widening assessment methods) shall be computed by multiplying the adjusted front footage, as provided in section 3.24.030, by the base charge per foot, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, as established from time to time by the Common Council. 
(b)  Business and industrial assessments. The special assessment for curb, gutter and pavement construction for all property with a business or industrial use, or for all property zoned for business or industrial use, shall be computed by multiplying the actual front footage by the base charge per foot for business and industrial property, as provided in subsection (c), as established from time to time by the Common Council. 
Nonconforming residential uses in business or industrial zones shall be assessed as a residential use according to sections 3.24.030, 3.24.040 and subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Annual review—Cost per foot. Each year, prior to introduction of the resolution authorizing letting of bids on public construction under this chapter, the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee shall establish a flat fee per foot to be levied pursuant to subsection (a) for residential uses and subsection (b) for business and industrial uses. In no case may such flat fee exceed the maximum cost of construction permitted under Wis. Stats. § 66.0703. 
(Ord. 61-4593 (part), 1986.)  
3.24.060 - Determination of assessment cost for street reconstruction. 
(a)  Residential assessment. The assessment for street reconstruction shall be computed by multiplying the adjusted front footage, as determined in sections 3.24.030 and 3.24.040, by the base charge per foot for new construction as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Business and industrial assessment. The assessment shall be determined by multiplying the actual front footage as defined in section 3.24.050(b), by the rate for reconstruction as determined in subsection (c) of this section, unless a different rate is determined by the Common Council. 
(c)  Annual review—Cost per foot. Each year, prior to introduction of the resolution authorizing letting of bids on public construction under this chapter, the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee shall establish a flat fee per foot to be levied pursuant to subsection (a) for residential uses and subsection (b) for business and industrial uses. In no case may such flat fee exceed the maximum cost of construction permitted under Wis. Stats. § 66.0703. 
(d)  Adjustment for design life. The assessment shall be further adjusted if the street to be reconstructed has not served its full design life. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the base charge per foot as provided in subsection (c) of this section by the ratio of the age of the improvement in years to the design life of the improvement in years, but in no case shall the ratio exceed one. For the purpose of adjusting the assessment formula for street reconstruction, the design life of a street shall be 35 years. 
Example: 
(1)  Concrete curb and gutter, asphalt pavement, gravel base: design life = 35 years. 
(2)  Base charge per subsection (c) of this section = $15.00. 
(3)  Actual street age = 20 years. 
(4)  Adjusted front footage = 100 feet. 
(5)  Assessment calculation = base charge x actual age x adjusted front footage. design life: 
$15.00 × 20 years / 35 years × 100 ft. = $857.14 
(Ord. 61-4765 §1(part), 1992; Ord. 61-4632 §1, 1988; Ord. 61-4593 (part), 1986.)  
3.24.070 - Drive approach construction. 
(a)  Residential drive approaches. 
(1)  New construction. One hundred percent of the cost is assessable; 
(2)  Street reconstruction. Fifty percent of the drive approach costs will be assessed to the property owner and 50 percent will be borne by the City. 
(b)  Business and industrial drive approaches. 
(1)  New Construction. One hundred percent of the cost is assessable; 
(2)  Street reconstruction. Cost of reconstructed drive approaches shall be assessed 50 percent to the property owner and 50 percent to the City, to a maximum of 25 feet in width, with the cost of any additional width borne by the owner. 
(Ord. 61-4593 (part), 1986.)  
3.24.080 - Sidewalks—New construction and reconstruction. 
(a)  General assessment procedure. The amount to be levied against an abutting property shall be determined by dividing the total project cost by the total assessable frontage of properties abutting the improvement, and multiplying the resulting rate by the abutting frontage of the individual parcels. 
(b)  [Costs established by resolution.] Costs for new or replacement sidewalk construction to be assessed to the abutting properties shall be established by a resolution adopted by the Common Council. 
(c)  Adjustment for design life. When a sidewalk is reconstructed which has not served its full design life, and adjustment shall be made by multiplying the total assessable cost by the ratio of the actual age of the sidewalk in years to the design life in years, but in no case shall the ratio exceed one. The design life of a sidewalk shall be 25 years. 
(Ord. 61-4775 §4, 1992.)  
3.24.090 - Determination of assessment cost for sanitary sewer, lift station, water main construction and booster stations. 
(a)  General method of determining cost for sanitary sewer and water main construction. The amount to be levied against an abutting property shall be determined by multiplying the adjusted front footage (as determined in sections 3.24.030 and 3.24.040) of the individual parcel abutting the street or right-of-way to be improved or so improved by the assessable cost per foot, which is determined by dividing the total cost of the project for the blocks, block, or part thereof by the total number of feet of assessable frontage on both sides of the street. 
The total cost of the project may include, but shall not be limited to all construction and excavation costs; including rock removal and supplementary bedding; dewatering costs; and survey, inspection and engineering costs if applicable and so authorized. 
(b)  Exceptions. 
(1)  Cost based on eight-inch mains. Assessments for sanitary sewer and water main construction shall be based upon the cost of installation of eight-inch mains, notwithstanding larger pipe actually installed. 
(2)  Corner lots. Assessable footage shall be determined according to section 3.24.040. 
(3)  Large lots, and industrial and commercial assessments. For lots with an area of 20,000 square feet or more, or for industrial or commercial properties, the assessment for the improvements shall be based on the area of the property benefited, or by other methods of assessment deemed to be fair and equitable by the Board of Public Works. 
(4)  Unplatted area. The Board of Public Works shall apply the general guidelines of the adjusted front footage formulas of sections 3.24.030 and 3.24.040, and this section. 
(c)  Lift stations. Lift stations may be fully or partially assessed to the properties of the area which they serve. Lift stations may be assessed by the area method, the front foot method, the per lot or per dwelling unit method, or by any other methods deemed to be fair and equitable by the Board of Public Works. The assessments shall be levied in districts served by lift stations and are based on present and future capital, operational and maintenance costs as recommended by the Sewer Utility Commission. 
(d)  Booster stations. Booster stations may be fully or partially assessed to the properties of the area which they serve. Booster stations may be assessed by the area method, the front foot method, the per lot or per dwelling unit method, or by any other methods deemed to be fair and equitable by the Board of Public Works. The assessments shall be levied in districts served by booster stations and are based on present and future capital, operational and maintenance costs as recommended by the Wausau Waterworks Commission. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §3, (part); Ord. 61-4775 §5, 1992; Ord. 61-4638 §1, 1988; Ord. 61-4593 (part), 1986.)  
3.24.100 - Connection fee for sanitary sewer and water main improvements. 
(a)  When a property is benefited by connecting private service laterals to a sanitary sewer or water main, either previously existing or newly constructed, and where no assessments for the sanitary sewer and water main improvements have been previously levied against the property, the Board of Public Works shall cause a connection fee to be charged to the benefited property in lieu of the special assessment normally charged to abutting owners. 
(b)  For previously existing mains, the connection fee shall be based on the current special assessment costs for similar construction, and for new mains the connection fee shall be based on the actual project costs for new construction determined in accordance with section 3.24.090. 
(c)  The connection fee shall be charged when recently annexed properties are to be connected to existing mains, or when properties not previously assessed by normal special assessment procedures are connected to mains. 
(d)  Payment for the connection fee shall be a lump sum payment made in advance of the City's/utility's granting permission to connect to the mains owned by the City/utility. However, the City may by resolution approve an installment payment plan as normally used for special assessments in accordance with section 3.24.120. 
(e)  When a connection fee is levied for an improvement not previously assessed by the City, and where the improvement was already 100 percent assessed to a project developer or where the improvement was constructed and financed solely by a developer under the direction of the City but without direct City cost, then the City may refund the connection fee to the project developer in accordance with the following: 
(1)  A "project developer" shall refer to a person, persons or business organization which financed at least 50 percent or more of the total project cost. 
(2)  A connection fee may be refunded to a project developer who qualifies as stated above providing the connection fee is collected by the City within ten years from the year in which the improvement was constructed. 
After ten years has elapsed, any claims for refunds shall be invalid. 
(3)  A request for refund of a connection fee shall be made in writing by the original project developer who was either assessed for the project or solely financed the project. 
(4)  No person(s) other than the original project developer shall be eligible to claim or receive a refund. The City, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether a refund shall be made after examining evidence and testimony. The City may request additional information from the developer other than that specified herein. A finding of incomplete or unsubstantiated evidence may be grounds for denial of the claim for refund. 
(5)  To qualify for a connection fee refund, a project developer must be able to substantiate his claim by either: 
(A)  Producing a record of the assessment originally levied by the City indicating the original improvement was fully assessed by the City to the developer; 
(B)  Submitting a sworn affidavit stating the developer paid for improvements serving properties other than his own for which he received no previous reimbursement. 
The affidavit should be filed immediately after completion of the improvement, and refiled or amended at the time of the claim. 
Incorrect claims or untruthful statements shall subject the affiant to penalties of law. 
(6)  The amount of the refund shall be calculated according to subsection (b) above, less a fee of ten percent of the total to be paid to the City for administration expenses. 
(7)  The payment of the refund may be in a lump sum or in installments, as the City may direct at the time of the claim. 
(Ord. 61-4593 (part), 1986.)  
3.24.110 - Service laterals required, initial installation and replacement. 
(a)  Prior to the improvement of a City street by the installation of curb, gutter, pavement or other permanent surfacing, utility laterals and service pipes shall be laid from the mains or utility tunnels to the abutting property. Where the work is done by City forces or by public contract let by the City, the cost of such installation shall be borne 100 percent by the property served. Extended time for payment, if any, shall be the same as for the street improvement. The City shall follow the procedures of Wis. Stats. § 66.0703, as to notice, plans, estimates and levies for special assessment for the work. 
(b)  Laterals and service pipes for non-City-owned utilities may be required to be installed prior to the street improvement. The installation shall be by resolution of the Common Council for each street on a project-by-project basis. 
(c)  Sewer laterals which are replaced in conjunction with major street reconstruction or as deemed necessary by the proper City officials are subject to be fully or partially assessed to the affected property owners. (The property owner is still fully responsible for all care/replacement of sewer laterals as specified under section 19.20.150.) In cases where the lateral was recently replaced by the property owner and replacement is completed at the direction of the City, an adjusted assessment shall be levied based on a 20-year life. The adjusted assessment shall not be less than 25 percent of the fully assessed lateral replacement fee for that year. Laterals greater than 20 years old are not eligible for adjustment. Assessments under this provision are applicable to chapter 3.24. This provision shall not be in effect for projects prior to December 31, 1997.

3.24.120 - Assessment paid by installments. 
(a)  Special assessments for the improvements provided for in this chapter may be paid over a period of five years following the year of installation. 
(b)  Special assessments for the improvements provided for in this chapter may be paid over a period in excess of five years only in those instances where the Common Council finds it to be in the public interest to construct a project and impose special assessments for the improvement upon real estate whose present or foreseeable use in the immediate future is not directly related to or dependent upon the improvements. 
(Ord. 61-4593 (part), 1986.)  
3.24.130 - Assessment prior to annexation. 
(a)  As a condition of annexation, and prior to action by the City Council on any proposed annexation ordinance, a tender must be made to the City for unremunerated improvements made by the City from which benefits have accrued to the property petitioned or would have been received by such property but for the fact that said land was outside of the City when the improvements were made. 
(b)  Such tender must be made in cash, agreed to on an installment basis in accordance with City policies in effect at the time of such request for annexation, or, at the City's prerogative, an agreement may be entered into providing for payment. 
(c)  The benefits which must be paid are those which could have been assessed on a special assessment basis, whether under the police power or under the special benefit procedures, had the area to be considered for annexation been in the City at the time the improvements were made, and include but are not limited to new street construction, curb and gutter, sanitary sewer, water main, and any other improvements. 
(d)  Should the annexation ordinance fail, then in that event any tender shall be returned to the petitioner unless the improvements are already benefiting the property, in which case the tender shall be retained and enforced by the City.

Chapter 5.18 - ADULT-ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS 
 
5.18.010 - Purpose. 
It is a lawful purpose of the Common Council of the City to enact regulatory ordinances protecting and promoting the general welfare, health and safety of its citizens. The Common Council deems it necessary to require licensing and regulation of adult-oriented establishments, namely, adult book stores, because many such establishments install booths with doors in which patrons can view adult-oriented movies or video tapes or film or view other forms of adult entertainment and that it has been found in many localities that viewing booths in such establishments are used by patrons for engaging in sexual acts, particularly between males, which results in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in said booths. Pathogenic agents responsible for sexually transmitted diseases have all been isolated at one time or another from body fluids, which have been found to be frequently present in viewing booths in adult-oriented book stores. It is thereby necessary for the Common Council to regulate adult-oriented book stores for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

If the licensee fails to appear after service of the notice to appear, the matter shall be scheduled for a suspension/revocation hearing. Service of the notice to appear shall be by first class mail sent to the agent, if the licensee is a corporation or a limited liability company, to the licensee if an individual, or to any partner if the licensee is a partnership. If the notice is returned by the Post Office as undeliverable, the notice may be left with any employee found on the licensed establishment at least 24 hours before the date and time of the scheduled appearance before the Public Health and Safety Committee.

For purposes of determining previous violations, the period shall be measured from the dates of violations that resulted in an imposition of a forfeiture or a conviction. For the purpose of determining whether or not a previous violation has occurred, if more than one violation occurs at the same time, all those violations shall be counted as one violation. The assignment of points is delegated to the Chief of Police or his designee.

No dangerous animal may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or structure on the premises of the owner or caretaker that would allow the animal to exit the premises of its own volition. No dangerous animal may be kept in a house or structure when the windows are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacles preventing the animal from exiting the structure. 
(B)  Outdoor confinement. All owners or caretakers of a dangerous animal must maintain on the property a pen or kennel as provided in this subsection. The pen or kennel shall be child proof from the outside and animal proof from the inside. A strong metal double fence with adequate space between fences (at least two feet) shall be provided so that a child cannot reach into the animal enclosure. Such pen or structure must have secure sides and a secure top attached to all sides. The pen or structure shall be locked with a key or combination lock when the animal is within the structure.

The cost of a microchip or other device shall be at the expense of the owner or caretaker. An owner or caretaker wishing to contest an order under this section shall proceed as provided in subsection (f). 
(2)  Upon issuance of an order declaring an animal to be a prohibited dangerous animal, the owner or caretaker shall remove the animal from the city with five days after the date of the order.

The owner or caretaker shall also present evidence to the Police Department showing that he or she has notified the Police Department or other law enforcement agency of the animal's new residence, including the name, address and telephone number of the new owner and advised that the animal is a prohibited dangerous animal. 
(f)  Appeal process for dangerous and prohibited dangerous animal. 
(1)  Whenever an owner or caretaker wishes to contest an order of the Chief of Police or the Chiefs designee to declare an animal dangerous under subsection (c) or prohibited dangerous under subsection (e), he or she shall, within five days after receipt of the order, deliver to the City Clerk, a written objection to the order, addressed to the Public Health and Safety Committee, stating specific reasons for contesting the order. Upon receipt of the written objection, the matter shall be placed on the agenda for the Public Health and Safety Committee to be reviewed at the next regular meeting, unless the appeal is filed within four days of the next meeting in which case it shall be heard at the following meeting, or at the discretion of the chair of the Public Health and Safety Committee at a specially scheduled meeting. The Public Health and Safety Committee shall act as a quasi-judicial body allowing the animal's owner or caretaker an opportunity to present evidence as to why the animal should not be declared dangerous or prohibited dangerous. The City elects not to be bound by Wis. Stats. ch. 68 with respect to administrative procedure in this regard. 
(2)  After the hearing, the owner or caretaker shall be notified of the Public Health and Safety Committee's determination. 
(3)  If the owner or caretaker wishes to further contest the determination, he or she may, within five days of receiving the Public Health and Safety Committee's decision, seek a review of the decision by the circuit court. 
(g)  Notification. 
(1)  The owner or caretaker of a dangerous animal shall notify the Police Department immediately if a dangerous animal is at large. 
(2)  The owner or caretaker of a dangerous animal shall notify the Police Department with 24 hours if the dangerous animal has bitten or inflicted injury upon another animal or human being, or has died. 
(3)  No owner or caretaker may sell or transfer possession of a dangerous animal to another person without first notifying the person to whom the dangerous animal is being sold or transferred of the fact that such animal is a dangerous animal. The owner or caretaker shall also provide the Police Department with the name, address and telephone number of the new owner of the dangerous animal. If the dangerous animal is sold or transferred to a person outside the city, the owner or caretaker shall present evidence to the Police Department showing that he or she has notified the Police Department or other law enforcement agency of the animal's new residence, including the name, address and telephone number of the new owner and advised that the animal is a dangerous animal. 
(4)  The owner or caretaker shall update the City Clerk and the Police Department within five days upon moving the dangerous animal to another location. 
(h)  Impoundment. 
(1)  Pending any investigation as to whether an animal is a dangerous or prohibited dangerous animal or pending a hearing on an appeal under subsection (f) of either determination, the animal must be securely confined in a humane manner either on the premises of the owner or caretaker, with a licensed veterinarian or other appropriate facility such as the local humane society. The owner or caretaker of any animal impounded on the premises of the owner or caretaker must comply with the restrictions set forth in subsection (d)(3) and (d)(5)-(d)(7). The Chief of Police or the Chiefs designee may order impoundment of the animal pending his/her investigation and through any appeal hearing under subsection (f), pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 173.13(1). If an animal is determined to be dangerous, it may remain impounded until the owner or caretaker has complied with all restrictions set forth in subsection (d) or until such time as the chief of Police or the Chiefs designee determines the animal may be safely returned to its owner or caretaker and upon payment of all costs and expenses under subsection (h)(2). If an animal is determined to be a prohibited dangerous animal, it may remain impounded until the owner or caretaker provides the Police Department adequate assurances that the animal will be removed from the City as provided in subsection (e)(2), insertion of a microchip or other device for identification purposes, and upon payment of all cost and expenses under subsection (h)(2). Any animal that has been impounded and remains unclaimed by its owner or caretaker for more than seven days after written notice by certified mail has been sent to the owner or caretaker to his/her last known address advising that a determination has been made that the animal may be returned to the owner or caretaker upon compliance with the requirements of this subsection may be humanely euthanized pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 173.23. Any owner or caretaker aggrieved by the impoundment order of the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee may appeal such decision in the same manner and under the same procedures as set forth in subsection (f). 
(2)  The owner or caretaker of the animal shall be liable to the city for the costs and expenses of impounding an animal unless the Chief of Police or the Chiefs designee fails to declare the animal dangerous or prohibited dangerous or the determination is ultimately overturned by the Public Health and Safety Committee or a reviewing court. 
(3)  The owner or caretaker of an animal confined on the premises under subsection (h)(1) shall immediately notify the Police Department if the animal is loose, unconfined, has attacked or bitten or injured another animal, or has attacked, bitten or injured a human being or has died.

(4)  The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee shall make a reasonable attempt to promptly notify the owner or caretaker in writing of any impoundment under this subsection if he or she can be identified and located with reasonable effort. Mailing written notice to the owner's or caretaker's last known address shall satisfy this requirement. 
(i)  Destruction. Any dog that has caused serious injury to a person or a domestic animal on two separate occasions off the owner's premises, without reasonable cause may be destroyed as a result of a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction as specified under Wis. Stats. § 174.02(3). The City Attorney may petition an appropriate court to obtain a court order to destroy such a dog.

9.04.140 - Purpose. 
Various groups have for years urged the City to adopt and enforce an ordinance controlling pornographic material within the City limits. The success of such an ordinance depends on strict adherence to the constitutional limits on restricting free speech and expression. Legal challenges to such ordinances are regular and often expensive. A City ordinance is of limited geographical reach. Minors who are City residents find easy access to neighboring jurisdictions. If material that may not be sold in the City is readily available in the area, there is little reason to engage in expensive and time-consuming legal proceedings. To meet this problem, Marathon County has enacted a pornography ordinance, Number 95. It is the intention of the Common Council that by adoption of the county ordinance, effect be given it within the City of Wausau, including Section VI, which states that upon adoption of the county ordinance, by a municipality located within the county, the District Attorney will enforce the terms and provisions of the ordinance as a county ordinance, having full force and effect within said municipality, including the City of Wausau.

A work shall be considered "obscene" if an average person applying contemporary Marathon County standards would find that the work taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex, or portrays sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and if taken as a whole, does not have serious literary, artistic political, or scientific value. 
"II. Any person violating paragraph I.(a)—(d) above, shall upon a finding of guilty pay a forfeiture of not less than $200.00, nor more than $1,500.00, plus costs per day for each day any of the aforementioned acts occur for the first offense. Forfeitures for subsequent offenses shall be not less than $500.00, nor more than $2,500.00, plus costs per day for each day any of the aforementioned acts occur. 
"III. This ordinance shall be enforced under Wis. Stats. § 66.0114 or ch. 288, by the Marathon County District Attorney, or his assistants, unless the municipality wherein the illegal act occurs elects to adopt its own ordinance dealing with the subject matter, and fails to adopt this ordinance. 
"IV. For the purposes of this ordinance: 
(A)  Descriptions or depictions of illicit sex or sexual immorality shall mean: 
(1)  Human genitals in the state of sexual stimulation or arousal;

(D)  Sexual conduct shall mean acts of masturbation, homosexuality, sexual intercourse or physical contact with a person(s clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or, if such person be a female, her breast. 
(E)  Sexual excitement shall mean the condition of human male or female genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal. 
(F)  Sado-masochistic abuse shall mean flagellation or torture by or upon a person clad in undergarments, a mask, or bizarre costume, or the condition of being fettered, bound or otherwise physically restrained on the part of one so clothed. 
(G)  All other terms, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall have the meaning as commonly understood within Marathon County, Wisconsin. 
"V. It shall be the sole responsibility of each person who deals in such products or items referred to in this ordinance to personally ascertain the true age of each person to whom he or she makes such items available. To do so such person shall be expected to rely upon an official Wisconsin identification card, as distributed through the office of the Register of Deeds, of the various counties of the State of Wisconsin. 
"VI. The City of Wausau hereby consents the Marathon County District Attorney may prosecute any violations hereof as a county violation. 
"VII. A person acts knowingly if he has a general knowledge of, or reason to know of, a belief or ground for belief, which warrants further inspection or inquiry of the character and consent of any material described herein which is reasonably susceptible of examination. 
"VIII. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected."

(a)  Findings. The Wausau City Council finds that certain premises within the City require and receive a disproportionate amount of police and City Inspection and Zoning Department services, place an undue and inappropriate burden on City taxpayers, and constitute public nuisances. Nuisance activity contributes to the general decay of an affected neighborhood and negatively impacts law-abiding residents in these neighborhoods, as well as the economic values of all properties in the vicinity of this activity. Often this disproportionate devotion of City resources is due to a property owner's own actions or failure of the property owner to accept and exercise sufficient responsibility for and over the actions of occupants, guests, agents or employees that reside in or frequent the premises. This ordinance is enacted to encourage property owners to recognize their responsibility to ensure that activities occurring on their premises conform to the law and do not unduly burden the City's Police and Building and Zoning Department and to provide a mechanism for the City to take action against property owners who chronically, routinely, actively, consistently, or often fail to ensure their premises do not require a disproportionate devotion of City resources.

State Law reference— For statutory provisions authorizing cities to require connections with sewer or water mains, see Wis. Stats. § 281.45. 
 
13.16.010 - When required. 
Whenever a sewer or water main becomes available to any building used for human habitation, the owner or his agent shall be notified by registered mail of the requirements to connect to the sewer or water system. Compulsory connection regarding water will be defined under section 19.24.070 of this Code. Connection requirements regarding sewers will be defined under section 19.36.070 of this Code. 
(Ord. 61-4544 §1, 1984.)  
13.16.020 - Contents of notice. 
The notice required by section 13.16.010 shall direct the owner or his agent to connect the building to such main or mains in the manner prescribed by the plumbing inspector and to install such facilities and fixtures as may be reasonably necessary to permit passage of sewage incidental to such human habitation into the sewerage system and to furnish an adequate supply of pure water for drinking and prevent creation of a health nuisance. 
(Ord. 61-4544 §2, 1984; prior code §10.13(2).)  
13.16.030 - Plumbing inspector may cause connection at expense of owner. 
If the owner or his agent fails to comply with the initial notice as defined per section 13.16.010, an order will be issued by the plumbing inspector requiring connection within 90 days from receipt of this order by registered mail. Failure to comply with this order may cause the connection to be made under contract by the City, and the expense thereof shall be assessed as a special tax against the property. 
(Ord. 61-4544 §3, 1984.)  
13.16.040 - Installment option. 
The owner or his agent may, within 30 days after completion of the work, file a written option with the Clerk stating that he cannot pay the cost of connection in one sum and electing that such sum be levied in five equal annual installments, with interest at the rate of eight percent per year from the completion of the work. 
(Ord. 61-4173 -A § 1, 1970; prior code §10.13(4).)  
13.16.050 - Privies and cesspools prohibited after connection with sewer. 
After connection of any building used for human habitation to a sewer main, no privy, cesspool or waterless toilet shall be used in connection with such human habitation. 
(Prior code §10.13(5).)  
13.16.060 - Service pipes to be protected. 
No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause injury to or disintegration of the service pipe, unless adequate means of protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be approved by the Director of Public Works and Utilities. Service pipes passing through curb or retaining walls shall be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space or pipe casing, not less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The space between the service pipe and channel or pipe casing shall be filled and lightly caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material, and made impervious to moisture. 
In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected against injury by carefully hand tamping the ground filling free from hard lumps, rocks, stones, or other injurious material around and at least 12 inches over the pipe. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §13 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-4289 §3, 1975; prior code §17.23(1).)  
13.16.070 - Size of piping. 
All water supplies shall be of undiminished size from the street main in to the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve the piping shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an equitable distribution of water supply for the greatest probable number of fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously. The size of water service piping shall be based on the estimated maximum rate of flow through the water service piping. The maximum flow rate shall be estimated by the following procedure: 
(a)  Determine the number of each type of fixture to be installed in the building; 
(b)  Determine the usage of each fixture as either private or public. 
(1)  Usage is to be classified as private when used for living quarters only, 
(2)  Usage is to be classified as public when used for any purpose other than living quarters; 
(c)  Determine the fixture units for each type of fixture by reference to Table 1. 
(d)  Determine the total fixture units by multiplying the number of each type of fixture by its respective number of fixture units and totaling. In using this method, allowance should be made for fixtures to be installed at a future date; 
(e)  By reference to Table 2, the total fixture units in any system with either flush tank or flush valves can be converted to maximum rate of flow in the water service piping. In converting, the next greatest number of fixture units should be used; 
(f)  Where water consuming equipment not listed in Table 1 is to be used, its GPM rating is to be added to the maximum rate of flow determined as outlined in (e). This total is then used in determining the size of water service piping and meter. 
In Tables 3 to 7 is a tabulation of the regular water service piping sizes for the estimated maximum rate of flow determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (f). Knowing the maximum estimated rate of flow and the length of service piping required, the proper size water service piping and meter can be selected. At the time of installation where it has been determined that water pressure may drop below 35 psi, the larger listed size shall be required. 
(Ord. 61-4184 §2, 1971; prior code §17.23(2).) 
Editor's note— Tables as referenced above are on file in the City Clerk's office.  
13.16.080 - Service pipe requirements. 
(a)  Service connections between one and two inches internal diameter shall be made by brass corporation cock. Water service pipes connecting with corporation in water main in street shall be no smaller than one inch internal diameter and shall be of "K" copper water tube. Each service pipe to have a brass curb stop and iron box at sidewalk, terminating above surface of ground. All service pipes to be laid in ground below action of frost, seven feet below surface. 
(b)  Service connections larger than two inches internal diameter shall be made by inserting a tee or tapping sleeve and valve on/in the water main. Each service pipe is to have a gate valve and iron box at sidewalk except tapping sleeves and valves which shall be at the point of connection, terminating above surface of ground. All service pipes are to be laid in ground below action of frost, seven feet below surface. 
(c)  A straight gate valve or globe valve shall be installed inside the foundation wall of each building where the meter is installed. Service of one and one-half inches or over shall have a full size bypass around the meter. 
(d)  Any other connections with City water mains can only be made by special permit of the Director of Public Works and Utilities upon authority of the commission.

13.24.010 - Temporary meter supply—Deposits. 
An applicant for temporary water supply on a metered basis shall make and maintain a monetary deposit of not less than $50.00 for each meter installed, as security for payment for use of the supply. The charge for setting the valve and furnishing and setting the meter will be $60.00. The volumetric charge shall be calculated using the highest volumetric rate for residential customers. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §23 (part), 2019) (Prior code §17.18.)  
13.24.020 - Installation. 
(a)  General. Meters will be furnished and placed by the utility and are not to be disconnected or tampered with by the consumer. All meters shall be so located that they shall be protected from obstructions and permit ready access thereto for reading, inspection, and servicing. No water meter shall be installed in any location not easily accessible, or in one which is or may be unclean, or in any manner hazardous to employees of the utility in the discharge of their duties. If during reconstruction of, or addition to, an existing potable water distribution system it is found that the water meter is located in a below-the-floor meter pit, the meter shall, at that time, be raised out of the pit and equipped with full-flow ball valves on both the inlet and outlet to the meter. The City plumbing inspector may at any time order the relocation of existing meters located in pits or extremely difficult areas of access. Water meters shall not be installed below plumbing fixtures, nor shall any water meter be installed in any toilet room. Water meters shall not be installed below stairways, landings, showrooms, or other platforms. All piping within the building must be supplied by the consumer. Where additional meters are desired by the consumer, he shall pay for all piping and an additional amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance and depreciation. 
(b)  Multi-family units. Water meter service to multi-residential building units shall be readily accessible to City personnel during normal working hours. All meters shall be installed in the common portion of the basement or common utility rooms not located in the individual living units. Where individual meters are desired per living units, the meters shall be clustered or banked together in a common accessible location as noted above. For ease of wiring to the outside, dedicated conduit(s) shall be provided sufficient in size to carry remote meter wiring to an outside receptacle(s). All requirements for meters contained in subsection (a) of this section shall also apply to multi-family units.

Repair or any damage to a meter resulting from the carelessness of the owner of the premises, his agent, or tenant, or from the negligence of any one of them to properly secure and protect same, including any damage that may result from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to be injured from the presence of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the consumer or the owner of the premises. 
(Prior code §17.29(2)(b).)  
13.24.060 - Service piping for meter settings. 
In installing new service piping (or changing service piping where consumers have been on a flat rate), if meters are to be set, the consumer shall, at his expense, provide the proper connections for the meter. The Director of Public Works and Utilities should be consulted as to the type and size of meter setting. A gate, ball or plug valve equal in size to the service piping shall be provided on the inlet side of the meter. A gate, ball or plug valve equal to or larger than the meter size shall be provided on the outlet side of the meter. Service piping of one and one-half inches or over shall have a full size valved bypass around the meter. Meter connections will be provided by the water utility. In the event the meter is not installed at the time of piping, a nipple of standard length as determined by the Director of Public Works and Utilities, will be provided and later removed for the insertion of the meter into the supply line. 
No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §26 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-4184 §5, 1971; Ord. 61-4099 §16, 1968; prior code §17.30.)  
13.24.070 - Failure to read meters. 
Where the utility is unable to read a meter after two successive attempts, the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed, or the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding quarter will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding month. Only in unusual cases or where approval is obtained from the customer shall more than two consecutive estimated bills be rendered. 
If the meter is damaged or fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past year unless there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method. 
(Prior code §17.33.)  
13.24.080 - Complaint meter tests. 
If a customer requests, the utility shall promptly make an accuracy test in addition to the periodic or installation test if 24 months or more have elapsed since the last complaint test of the same meter in the same location. If less than 24 months have expired, the customer shall deposit with the utility 50 percent of the cost of the meter test. If the meter is found to be over or under registering by more than two percent the deposit shall be refunded. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §27 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-4289 §8, 1975; prior code §17.34.)  
Chapter 13.28 - WATER CHARGES 
 
13.28.010 - Unit of service defined. 
A unit of service consists of any residential or small commercial aggregation of space or area occupied for a distinct purpose, such as a residence, apartment, flat, store, or office, which is equipped with one or more fixtures for rendering water service, separate and distinct from other users. Each unit of service shall be regarded as one consumer and the surcharge for additional consumers on a meter, when authorized, assessed accordingly. 
(Prior code §17.36(1).)  
13.28.030 - Multiple buildings. 
When a consumer's premises has several buildings each supplied with service and metered separately, the full service charge will be billed for each meter separately, and the readings will not be cumulated. If these buildings are all used in the same business and are connected by the consumer, they can be metered in one place. If the utility, for its own convenience, installs more than one meter, the readings will be cumulated for billing. 
(Prior code §17.36(3).)  
13.28.040 - Charges for water wasted due to leaks. 
When the meter registers losses due to pipe leaks, the utility shall determine whether or not the defect in the piping or equipment was known to the customer or, being known, he had used his best efforts to correct the conditions. If the Director of Public Works and Utilities determines that the loss occurred without the consumer's knowledge or, having known about it, he had tried to correct the condition, the utility may determine as nearly as possible what is the amount of the loss by comparison with the use of the water during a like period, and the excess may be billed at the lowest step in the rates. If, however, the consumer knew of the leak and failed to give proper attention to it, the utility will bill for the total consumption shown by the meter at regular rates. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §28 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-4099 §12, 1968; prior code §17.25.)  
13.28.050 - Refunds of deposits. 
All moneys deposited as security for payment of charges arising from the use of temporary water supply on a metered basis, or for the return of sprinkling valve wheel or reducer, if the water is used on any unmetered basis, will be refunded to the depositor on the termination of the use of water, the payment of all charges levied against the depositor and the return of the wheel and reducer. 
(Prior code §17.22.)  
13.28.060 - Water rents. 
All water rents shall be paid in such manner and at such time as the Wausau Waterworks Commission ("commission") shall determine. All water rates, whether by schedule or meter, which shall not be paid within 30 days after the same shall become due and payable, shall become a lien upon the premises receiving the service, and if remaining unpaid shall be collected as a special tax in the next tax roll, pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0809(3). 
(Ord. 61-5822 §29 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-4289 §10, 1975; prior code §17.08.)

During reasonable hours, any officer or authorized employee of the utility shall have the right of access to the premises supplied with service for the purpose of inspection or for the enforcement of the utility's rules and regulations. At least once every 12 months the utility will make a systematic inspection of all unmetered water taps for the purpose of checking waste and unnecessary use of water. 
(Prior code §17.35.)  
Chapter 13.36 - REPAIRS 
 
13.36.010 - Mains. 
The utility reserves the right to shut off the water in the mains temporarily, to make repairs, alterations or additions to the plant or system. When the circumstances will permit of sufficient delay, the utility will give notification, by newspaper publication or otherwise of the discontinuance of the supply. No rebate or damages will be allowed to consumers for such temporary suspension of supply. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §31 (part), 2019; (Prior code §17.40.)  
13.36.020 - Replacement and repair of service pipe. 
The service pipe from the main to and through the curb stop, but not including the outlet joint of the curb stop, will be maintained and kept in repair and when worn out, replaced at the expense of the utility. The property owner shall maintain the service pipe from the curb stop to the point of use and can be billed for any water which has not passed through the meter and has been wasted by leakage or defective pipes and fixtures, as estimated by the Director of Public Works and Utilities. 
If a consumer fails to repair a leaking or broken service pipe from curb to a point of metering or use within such time as may appear reasonable to the Director of Public Works and Utilities after notification has been served on the consumer by the Director of Public Works and Utilities, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs have been completed. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §32 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-4184 §6, 1971; Ord. 61-4099 §11, 1968; prior code §17.24.)  
13.36.030 - Thawing frozen services. 
Frozen services shall be thawed out by and at the expense of the utility except where the freezing was caused by contributory fault or negligence on the part of the consumer such as reduction of the grade or undue exposure of the piping in the building or on consumer's property, or failure to comply with water utility specifications and requirements as to depth of service, lack of sufficient back fill, etc. 
Following the freezing of a service, the utility shall take such steps and issue such instructions as may be necessary to prevent the refreezing of the same service. No charge will be made for rethawing if the instructions are followed. In case it is necessary to allow the water to flow to prevent refreezing the consumer must make provision for proper disposal of the waste water. 
For the period in which the water is allowed to run the consumer will be billed according to his meter readings, but in no event to exceed the average amount paid in the corresponding billing periods of the previous two years. A new consumer will be charged the average bill for other consumers of the same class receiving service under comparable conditions.

The control authority may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs), to implement the requirements of 13.62.030 and apply them in industrial wastewater discharge permits. 
The approving authority reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in section 13.62.001 of this chapter. 
(2)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all persons of the regulated industrial categories. 
The categorical pretreatment standards, if more stringent than other limitations imposed in this chapter, shall immediately supersede the limitations of this chapter. The pretreatment coordinator shall notify all affected persons of the applicable reporting requirements of the Act, particularly 40 CFR Part 403.12. 
(3)  Deadline for compliance with categorical standards. Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is otherwise specified. Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall be considered existing industrial users. 
New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time not to exceed 90 days) new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(4)  Equivalent limits. 
(A)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the POTW may convert the limits to equivalent limits expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration. 
(B)  A POTW shall calculate equivalent mass-per-day limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual long-term daily production, such as the average daily production during a representative year. New sources shall use projected production in place of actual production. 
(C)  A POTW shall calculate equivalent concentration limits by dividing the mass limitations derived under subdivision (B) by the average daily flow rate of the industrial user's regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year. 
(D)  The same production of flow figure shall be used in calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. 
(E)  Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits shall notify the POTW within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change. 
(5)  Removal credits. The Act 40 CFR, Part 403.7, allows removal credit for certain pollutants limited by the categorical pretreatment standards. The pretreatment coordinator may consider a written request from a person impacted by the categorical pretreatment standards. If the wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of such pollutants limited by the categorical pretreatment standards, the pretreatment coordinator may apply to the state and federal authorities in accordance with the Act. Removal credits will not be taken into consideration until authorization is received from the state or federal agencies, and the specific pollutant discharge limits are amended by this chapter. 
(6)  Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are suspected of using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

13.62.040 - Control of prohibited wastes. 
(a)  Wastewater discharge permits. 
(1)  Required permits. All significant users, new or existing, proposing to connect to or contribute wastewater to the POTW shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit before connecting to or discharging to the POTW. If the significant use has multiple regulated outfalls, a separate permit is required for each regulated outfall. 
(2)  Permit application. Persons required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit or maintain an existing permit shall complete and file an application, in the form prescribed by the commission, with the pretreatment coordinator. 
All new significant industrial users shall submit a permit application at least 90 days prior to connecting to the system or contributing wastewater to the POTW. Copies of the wastewater permit application may be obtained from the office of the: 
Director of Public Works and Utilities 
407 Grant Street 
Wausau, WI 54403 
In support of the application, the applying person shall submit the following information: 
(A)  Name, address and location (if different from the address);

(D)  Description of activities, facilities and plant processes on the premises including all materials stored or used which are, or could be, discharged to include, but not be limited to, raw materials, intermediate materials, catalysts, products and byproducts, and other materials as required. Furthermore, the description shall include solvents, chemicals and cleaning agents that may be introduced into the treatment system via accidental spill or mishap; 
(E)  Each product produced by type, amount and rate of production; 
(F)  A baseline report shall be submitted with the permit application by industrial users subject to categorical standards to provide data required for the application. The industrial user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process, and shall: 
(i)  Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentrations shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
(ii)  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The pretreatment coordinator may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial discharger that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sample techniques or through a minimum of one grab samples where the discharger demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
The discharger shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
(iii)  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. 
If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the discharger should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow the use of the combined wastestream formula according to 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(iv)  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the sampling and analytical techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the WDNR. 
(G)  Time and duration of wastewater contribution; 
(H)  Average, daily and 15-minute peak wastewater flow rates, including daily, monthly and seasonal variations, if any; 
(I)  The nature and concentration of any pollutants in the discharge which are limited by any City, state or national categorical pretreatment standards, and a statement regarding whether or not the pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is required for the user to meet applicable pretreatment standards; 
(J)  Number of employees and hours worked; 
(K)  Any other information as may be necessary to evaluate the permit application; 
(L)  All permit applications shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user. 
(3)  Permit processing. 
(A)  The pretreatment coordinator will evaluate the data furnished with the permit application. Further requests for additional information may be made until the application is complete. Within 90 days after all information is complete, a written response to the application will be prepared to address any concerns, terms or conditions that may be appropriate for meeting the requirements of this chapter, and may require the industrial user to obtain a wastewater discharge permit. A permit shall be obtained by the industrial user if any one of the following conditions prevail: 
(i)  The user discharges wastewater which, or will, contain one or more pollutants with conditions as defined in section 13.62.030(a) of this chapter; 
(ii)  The user discharges wastewater which, or will, contain one or more pollutants as listed in section 13.62.030(b)(1) of this chapter;

(iv)  The user is or will be discharging wastewaters with concentrations of BOD and/or TSS higher than normal wastewater concentrations; 
(B)  The approving authority will notify the user, by certified mail, of one of the following: 
(i)  A wastewater discharge permit shall be issued to the user and become effective within five days of the date of issuance; or 
(ii)  A wastewater discharge permit shall be denied to the user for reasons as specified; or 
(iii)  A wastewater discharge permit shall not be required of the user unless a change in operations occurs which may affect wastewater constituents and characteristics or more stringent limitations are required. 
(4)  Permit fees and charges. The commission will adopt fees and charges for the recovery of costs from the users of the City's POTW for the implementation of the requirements of this chapter. 
The utility bills the permit fees and charges directly to the significant industrial users both in the City and also those in contracted municipalities that discharge to the Wausau POTW via sewer system connections. Permit fees will be evaluated and amended as necessary to reflect current costs. The fees for regulated customers are defined in chapter 13.64.020. 
The charges for laboratory analysis of the sample will be charged to each user on a case-by-case basis reflecting the actual charges for commercial laboratory costs. Other charges that may be billed to specific users include costs for processing requests for removal credits for categorical pretreatment standards. The above fees and charges relate only to matters in this chapter. 
(5)  Permit modifications. Within nine months of the promulgation of national categorical pretreatment standards the wastewater discharge permit of industrial users subject to such standards or requirements shall be revised to require compliance with such standards within the time frame prescribed by such standards. 
Where an industrial user subject to national categorical pretreatment standards has not previously submitted an application for a wastewater discharge permit as required by this chapter, the industrial user shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements. 
In addition, the industrial user with an existing wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator within 180 days after the promulgation of applicable national categorical pretreatment standards the information required by this chapter. 
The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the City during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements identified in this chapter are modified or as other just causes exist. The industrial user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(6)  Permit conditions. Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this chapter and all other applicable regulations, user charges and fees established by the City. The permit shall contain the following conditions:

The review process will evaluate any violations of compliance schedules, report completeness and accuracy, and other pertinent information germane to the reissuance of the permit. 
(8)  Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific industrial user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or changed operation without the approval of the commission. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit. 
(9)  Appeals procedure. A user desiring to appeal to the commission regarding the pretreatment limitations, pretreatment requirements or conditions of an issued wastewater discharge permit shall file petition for appeal with the approving authority within 20 days of the issuance date of the permit or modification thereof. If the user does not file a petition for appeal within that time, the issued permit is final. 
(b)  Reporting requirements for permittee. 
(1)  Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW any user subject to categorical pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report which shall include the following information: 
(A)  Indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by categorical pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements; 
(B)  The average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such categorical pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements; 
(C)  The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the industrial user into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a registered professional qualified to certify the report. 
(2)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(A)  Are required to be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator by: (i) any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard; (ii) in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge of wastewater to the POTW; (iii) any significant noncategorical user shall submit to the POTW semiannual compliance reports. The reports are to be submitted according to the dates specified in each users permit. 
(B)  The reports required in this subsection (b) shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
The POTW shall require that frequency of monitoring which is necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(C)  The sampling and analysis for the periodic compliance reports that are required from the significant industrial user may be performed by the approving authority in lieu of the significant industrial user. Where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, the significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
(D)  If any industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this subsection (b)(2) monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
In cases where a local limit requires compliance with Best Management Practices or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation required by the utility to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(E)  The periodic compliance reports shall include the following information: 
(i)  A record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow allowed by the permit; 
(ii)  Concentration and daily quantity of pollutants in the wastewater discharge which are controlled by this chapter, by the categorical pretreatment standards and/or others as required by the permit; 
(iii)  When flows and/or pollutant concentration or quantities exceed the requirements of this chapter and permit limitations, a discussion as to the reason for the result and how the situation is to be corrected shall be given; 
(iv)  Any projected changes in production quantity and schedule which could change discharge characteristics in the future period; 
(v)  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the POTW in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report required shall contain a reasonable measure of the users long-term production rate. 
(vi)  Documentation associated with Best Management Practices required by the facility's permit. 
For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required shall include the user's actual average production rate during the reporting period. 
(3)  Signatory requirements. All wastewater discharge permit applications and industrial user reports must contain the following certification statement and be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user. "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering information, the information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(4)  Sampling and analysis violation requirements. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the POTW within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the POTW within 30 days. The industrial user is not required to resample if: 
(A)  The POTW performs sampling at the industrial users at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(B)  The POTW performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling or if the utility has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User. 
(5)  Accidental or slug discharges. Users shall notify the POTW superintendents immediately (at any hour of the day or night by the fastest and most effective means possible) upon having a slug or accidental discharge or violation of this chapter that could cause problems to the POTW, in order to enable countermeasures to be taken by the City to minimize damage to the POTW and the receiving waters. The notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions taken by the user. 
Within five days of the date of occurrence, the user shall submit to the pretreatment coordinator a detailed written statement describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. 
(6)  Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under section 13.62.030(a)(18). 
For the purposes of this requirement, substantial changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases or decreases of 25 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. Industrial Users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug Discharge. 
(7)  Bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps to be taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass. 
(8)  Hazardous waste notification. 
(A)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director, and the DNR Bureau of Solid and Hazardous Waste Management in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. 
(B)  Dischargers are exempt from the hazardous waste notification requirement during a calendar month in which they discharge 15 kilograms or less of nonacute hazardous wastes. Discharge of any quantity of acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. 
(C)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the pretreatment coordinator, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(D)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(E)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(9)  Effect of an upset. 
(A)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of subdivision (9)(B) of this subsection are met. 
(B)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(i)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(ii)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(iii)  The user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
a.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance, 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue, 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance. 
(C)  In any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(D)  The user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with the pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(c)  Pretreatment. 
Required facilities. Users shall provide the necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations or pretreatment requirements. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the utility shall be provided, operated and maintained at the industrial user's expense. 
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator and to the Wisconsin DNR for review, and shall be acceptable to the utility and the Wisconsin DNR before construction of the facility. 
The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable as required by the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the utility prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes. All records relating to compliance with any applicable pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements shall be made available to officials of EPA, Wisconsin DNR or pretreatment coordinator upon request. 
If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the applicable pretreatment standards, the user shall include in the pen application the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
The following conditions shall apply to this schedule: 
(1)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, and completing construction). No increment shall exceed nine months. 
(2)  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the pretreatment coordinator. 
This progress report shall include, at a minimum, whether or not the user complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which the user expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established. 
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the pretreatment coordinator. 
(d)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided as required by chapter ILHR 82, Wis. Admin. Code, for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the utility, and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(e)  Admission to property. 
(1)  The Director of Public Works and Utilities, POTW superintendent, pretreatment coordinator, their designated representatives, the Wisconsin DNR and the EPA, shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and records examination and copying, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The personnel shall not inquire into any industrial processes, including metallurgical, chemical, oil refining, ceramic, paper or other processes, except as they affect the kind and source of discharge to the system. 
(2)  While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in subsection (e)(1) of this section, all personnel shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the user, not inconsistent with the inspection process. 
(3)  Specific easements for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sanitary sewer lying within the easement may be required. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on the easement shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved. 
(f)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public and governmental agencies without restrictions unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the approving authority, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user under Wis. Stats. § 134.90(1)(c). 
When confidentiality is requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available, upon written request, to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the WPDES permit, State Disposal System permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the industrial user furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
Information accepted by the authority as confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the authority until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §44 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-5655 §1, 2015, File No. 11-0507; Ord. 61-5636 §3(part), 2014; Ord. 61-5476 §1, 2011, File No. 11-0507; Ord. 61-5054 §1, 1999; Ord. 61-5001 §1(part), 1998; Ord. 61-4859 §1(part), 1994.)  
13.62.050 - User wastewater monitoring and analysis. 
(a)  Monitoring of user wastewater. Monitoring shall conform to the following standards: 
(1)  All user wastes discharged into the system shall be subject to periodic inspection to include but not be limited to, inspection of records related to monitoring, sampling and analysis of such wastewater kept by the user and a determination of the volume, character and concentration, by the pretreatment coordinator as often as deemed necessary by utility. 
Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City or their representative ready access at all times to all parts of the premises for purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. 
The volume of flow shall be determined from the metered water consumption of the user or from a wastewater metering survey. Sampling may consist of either instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. The costs of such testing and flow determination shall be charged to the user. 
(2)  The user discharging wastes into the system shall install and pay for a suitable control manhole or access facilities to facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. 
Such equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times by the user. 
(3)  The control manhole or access facilities shall be located and maintained on the user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Director of Public Works may allow such access to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the approval of the local governing body, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(4)  When more than one user can discharge into a common lateral, the local or Director of Public Works and Utilities may require installation of separate control manholes or access facilities for each user. When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Director of Public Works and Utilities may require that separate control manholes or access facilities be installed for each separate discharge. 
(5)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the control manhole or access facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Director of Public Works and Utilities requirements and all applicable standards and specifications. 
A location plan and construction details of the control manhole or access facilities shall be submitted to the Director of Public Works and Utilities for review and approval prior to construction. 
(6)  Except as designated in subsection (a)(7) of this section, the volume of flow used for computing user charges shall be the metered water consumption of the industrial user as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the utility. 
(7)  Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the pretreatment coordinator or POTW superintendent, if this volume cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned and maintained by the user. 
Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the utility. 
(b)  Analysis of user wastewaters. All laboratory analysis for all required monitoring shall be performed by laboratories certified by the Wisconsin DNR and in accordance with NR 219 Wis. Admin. Code and procedures established pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto. Any alternate sampling or analytical procedures must have Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources approval.

13.62.060 - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  Emergency suspension of service and discharge permits. The utility may, for good cause shown, suspend the wastewater treatment service and the wastewater discharge permit of a person when it appears to the utility that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens: 
(1)  An imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons; or 
(2)  Substantial danger to the environment; or 
(3)  Interference with the operation of the POTW; or 
(4)  Violation of any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter, or any wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant to this chapter. 
Any user notified of the suspension of the City's wastewater treatment service and/or the user wastewater discharge permit shall immediately cease all discharges. In the event of failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall commence judicial proceedings or take such other measures deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection. 
The City shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the user of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above. 
(b)  Accidental or slug discharges. If the discharge did cause pass through, interference with the operation of the wastewater system or POTW and/or damage in the wastewater system or if it is documented that the industry has repeatedly caused pass through, interference with the operation of the wastewater system or POTW at the POTW, the utility may serve the industry with a written notice of violation, order the industry to show cause why enforcement action should not be taken, or, depending on the severity and extent of the violation, commence legal action against the user for legal and/or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(c)  Notice of noncompliance. Any user that violates any condition or limitation of this chapter or the waste-water discharge permit may be issued a notice of noncompliance by the utility, except where significant noncompliance defined in subsection (i) of this section justifies immediate issuance of a notice of violation. The notice of noncompliance will explain the nature of the noncompliance and require that the user, within 30 days of the date of the notice, file a plan for correcting the noncompliance. 
If the pretreatment coordinator approves the submitted plan and the user complies with the submitted plan to correct the violation, no further action may be taken against the user. If the user does not submit a plan acceptable to the utility, fails to submit a plan or does not comply with the submitted plan, the utility may take action in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Notice of violation. Any user that violates any condition or limitation of this chapter, the wastewater discharge permit, or has failed to provide an acceptable plan for expeditious corrective action as required under the notice of noncompliance, may be served by the utility with a written notice of violation via registered mail (return receipt requested). Within 30 days of the receipt date of the issuance of the violation notice, the user must submit to the pretreatment coordinator an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof. Included in this plan must be a schedule for a pollution prevention audit to be conducted at the users facility (if none has been conducted within the past three years). 
If the pretreatment coordinator approves the submitted plan and the user complies with the submitted plan to correct the violation, no further action may be taken against the user. 
If, however, the user does not comply with the plan or if the plan does not correct the violation, the commission has the option to do any of the following: take legal action against the industry for the imposition of forfeitures and recovery costs for damage incurred as a result of the user's discharge, revoke the user's wastewater discharge permit, and/or discontinue sewer service to the user. 
(e)  Show cause hearing. A show cause hearing shall be conducted as follows: 
(1)  If the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the utility may order any alleged violator to show cause before the commission why sewer service should not be terminated. A notice shall be served on the alleged violator specifying the charges and the time and place of the hearing thereon. 
The notice shall be served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least eight days before the hearing. Service shall be made as indicated in Wis. Stats. § 801.11. 
(2)  The approving authority may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate some person, excluding a member, to be the hearing examiner to: 
(A)  Issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in any such hearing; 
(B)  Take testimony and rule on the introduction of evidence; 
(C)  File findings of fact and conclusions of law with the approving authority. 
(3)  At any public hearing, testimony taken before the commission shall be under oath and recorded stenographically or electronically. The transcript shall be made available to any person upon payment of the charges therefor. 
(4)  After the commission has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the violator directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed, or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated, and such further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate. 
(f)  Legal action. Any discharge in violation of this chapter shall be considered a public nuisance. The commission shall bring an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief to abate the nuisance and enforce this chapter. 
(g)  Pretreatment coordinator jurisdiction limited. The orders issued to a user in another municipality by the pretreatment coordinator shall be countersigned by the Director of Public Works and Utilities if such orders are to be grounds for any enforcement action under this chapter except for enforcement action taken pursuant to subsection (e)(2)(B) of this section. Where plans, etc., are to be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator for approval, the pretreatment coordinator shall act thereon within ten working days after receipt thereof. 
This subsection is not a waiver by the utility of any right it may have to commence any action, legal or equitable, to enforce any right, duty or obligation, it, another utility, municipality, or a user, may possess or be subject to. 
(h)  Right of appeal. Any user or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the commission on any matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. 
In the event that such inquiry is by a user and deals with matter of performance or compliance with this chapter or deals with a wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant to this chapter for which enforcement activity relating to the alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a user request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply. Appeal of any final judicial order entered pursuant to this chapter may be taken in accordance with local and state law. 
(i)  Annual publication. The commission shall publish, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the utility by March 31 of each year, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous year, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. 
For the purpose of this provision, a significant industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria, while a non-significant industrial user has been in significant noncompliance if criteria in subsections (3), (4), or (8) apply: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements of the industrial user's wastewater for the same pollutant taken during a six-month period exceeded by any magnitude, any numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including an instantaneous limit; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined as those in which 33 percent or more of all the measurements of the industrial user's wastewater for the same pollutant taken during a six-month period equaled or exceeded the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including an instantaneous limit multiplied by either 1.4 for BOD, TSS, and fats, -oil and grease; 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH; or exceeded a pH limit by .4 standard units); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer-term average) that the pretreatment coordinator determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under this section to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, required reports containing all required monitoring results and other information such as baseline monitoring reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation or group of violations which may include a violation of Best Management Practices, which the pretreatment coordinator determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(j)  Recordkeeping and records retention. All discharges subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve for no less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of a user in connection with its discharge and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established. 
All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of any enforcement or litigation activities brought by the City pursuant to this chapter shall be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitations with respect to any and all appeals have expired. The utility will retain all records for the same length of time. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §46 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-5636 §4(part), 2014; Ord. 61-4859 §1(part), 1994.)  
13.62.070 - Penalties—Costs. 
(a)  Civil penalty. Any user who is found to have violated any order or provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules and regulations issued under this chapter, may be fined up to $1,000.00 (40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(vi)(a)), per day for each violation. Each day of violation may be deemed a separate offense and subject to a separate forfeiture. 
In addition to the civil penalty provided in this chapter, the commission may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit of law against the person found to have violated this chapter, or the orders, rules and regulations issued under this chapter. 
(b)  Costs of damage. Any person found to be responsible for a deleterious discharge into the system, which discharge causes damage to the system, upsets the POTW process and/or seriously impairs the quality of the receiving stream, shall become liable to the utility and/or City for any expense, loss or damage caused by the violation or discharge. 
The City may add to the user's charges and fees the costs assessed for any cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Any refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
(c)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other documents filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or who falsified, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction be punished by the imposition of a civil penalty not to exceed limits as stated in this chapter. 
(d)  Injunctive relief. The utility may petition for injunctive relief to compel compliance with the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and the orders, rules and regulations issued under this chapter. This section shall not be construed as to waive the City's abilities to refer criminal violations to the appropriate prosecuting agencies. 
(Ord. 61-5822 §47 (part), 2019; Ord. 61-4859 §1(part), 1994.)  
13.62.075 - Special Provision—Amalgam reduction—Dental professionals. 
(a)  This section applies to any dental office that places or removes amalgam. If work in a dental office is limited to work that does not involve placing or removing amalgam, such as orthodontics, periodontics, oral and maxillo-facial surgery, endodontics, prosthodontics, or which are identified by the utility or Marathon County Health Department as being de-minimum contributors, then the section does not apply.

Chapter 13.64 - SEWER SERVICE CHARGES[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
State Law reference— For statutory provisions pertaining to sewerage system service charges, see Wis. Stats. § 66.0821. 
Note— Prior Ordinance History: Ords. 61-5799, 61-4070, 61-4075, 61-4079, 61-4289, 61-4326, 61-4415, 61-4452, 61-4532 and 61-4606, 61-5456 and prior code §§23.01 through 23.05, 23.07 and 23.08. 
 
13.64.010 - Purpose. 
It is found and determined that a sanitary sewer system is necessary for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the general public and more specifically, the citizens and residents of the City. It is the intention of the City and the utility that all interrelated chapters of this Code be liberally construed with the provision of this chapter and specifically chapter 13.62 and that chapter 13.62 takes precedence over any or all pre-existing agreements inconsistent with this governing regulation. 
The utility will ensure that sewer rate structure is equitable amongst all users to recover actual costs associated with operation, maintenance, and replacement costs. A rate review shall be performed once every two years and the rate structure will provide sufficient funds to cover all operating costs. Excess revenue collected from a user class will be redistributed to the appropriate cost category for the following year as reasonably feasible. The utility will render a sewer bill that reflects costs associated with the users demand on the system. 
(Ord. 61-4734 §1, 1991; Ord. 61-4646 §1(part), 1988; Ord. 61-4612 §1 (part), 1987.)  
13.64.015 - Definitions. 
The definitions in section 13.62.020 are adopted and are applicable to this chapter. 
(Ord. 61-4681 §1(part), 1989; Ord. 61-4646 §1(part), 1988; Ord. 61-4612 §1(part), 1987.)  
13.64.020 - Basis for charges. 
To pay for such a system there is imposed a service charge upon each user of the sewerage system as provided in this section. 
(a)  Charges for non-monitored customers are as follows: 
(1)  With no sewer meter. A minimum quarterly charge based on the size of the water meter plus the volume rate as noted in subdivision (3) of this subsection. 
Water Meter Size
in Inches 	Minimum Quarterly
Charge
10/1/2020 	Minimum Quarterly
Charge
7/1/2021 	Minimum Quarterly
Charge
10/1/2022 
5/8 or 5/3 	$23.06 	$29.06 	$34.58 
¾ 	23.06 	29.06 	34.58 
1 	31.13 	39.23 	46.68 
1¼ 	43.36 	54.63 	65.01 
1½ 	50.28 	63.35 	75.38 
2 	84.18 	106.06 	126.21 
3 	151.98 	191.49 	227.88 
4 	248.15 	312.67 	372.07 
6 	489.84 	617.20 	734.46 
8 	770.50 	970.83 	1,155.29 
 
(2)  With a sewer meter. A customer that meters the discharge will pay a flat monthly fee of $88.50 for the first such metering device and $44.25 for each additional metering device installed on the premises, effective on October 1, 2020; $111.51 for the first such metering device and $55.76 for each additional metering device installed on the premises, effective on July 1, 2021; and $132.70 for the first such metering device and $66.35 for each additional metering device installed on the premises, effective on October 1, 2022. All such metering devices shall be approved by the utility's director prior to installation. The volume rate shall also apply. 
(3)  Volume rate. All volume as recorded by the water meter each quarter shall be charged to the customer at the rate of $3.75 per 100 cubic feet effective on October 1, 2020; $4.73 per 100 cubic feet, effective on July 1, 2021; and $5.63 cents per 100 cubic feet, effective on October 1, 2022, except as noted in subdivision (4) of this subsection. 
(4)  Residential customer. Charges to residential customers shall be based on actual volume as recorded by the water meter each quarter. 
Adjustments may be made to the billed sewer volume on a case-by-case basis provided it can be verified that a significant portion of the usage was not discharged to the sanity sewer and will only be considered based upon a written request. 
In the case where a residential customer is served only with sewer service and a water meter has not been installed to record water usage, the user will pay a flat fee per quarter for sewer service. The flat fee is determined by adding the 5/3 meter minimum quarter charge, plus the current volume charge times 2,000 cubic feet which is an estimate of the average household usage of water from a private water supply. The flat fee charge shall be $98.09 per quarter, effective on October 1, 2020; $123.60 per quarter, effective on July 1, 2021; and $147.08 per quarter, effective on October 1, 2022. 
(5)  Nonresidential customer. Charges to nonresidential customers shall be on actual volume as recorded each quarter. (A volume credit may be granted for water not discharged to the sanitary sewer provided the volume is metered and approved by the utility.) 
In the case where a nonresidential customer is served only with sewer service and a water meter has not been installed to record water usage, the user will pay a flat fee per quarter for sewer service. The flat fee is estimated by comparing with similar metered businesses in the City. The estimate will take into consideration size, nature, and other comparable units of business. This estimate will be prepared by the Director of Public Works and Utilities. The utility may order the installation of a private water meter to record the volume of private water usage and this will be the basis for sewer billings. 
(6)  Permit fee. The permit fee for one regulated outfall is $177.00 per month and $17.70 per month for each additional regulated outfall effective on October 1, 2020; $223.00 per month and $22.30 per month for each additional regulated outfall, effective on July 1, 2021; and $265.39 per month and $26.54 per month for each additional regulated outfall, effective on October 1, 2022. 
(b)  Charges for monitored customers are as follows: 
(1)  Minimum charge. A customer that meters the discharge will pay a flat monthly fee $177.00 for the first such metering device and $88.50 for each additional metering device installed on the premises, effective on October 1, 2020; $223.00 for the first such metering device and $111.51 for each additional metering device installed on the premises, effective on July 1, 2021; and $265.39 for the first such metering device and $132.70 for each additional metering device installed on the premises, effective on October 1, 2022. All such metering devices shall be approved by the utility's director prior to installation. If the water meter is the basis for determining volume of waste discharge, the minimum monthly charge will be one-third of the minimum quarterly charge per the water meter size as shown in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, but not less than $44.25 per month, effective on October 1, 2020; $55.76 per month, effective on July 1, 2021; and $66.35 per month, effective on October 1, 2022. 
(2)  Volume charge. All volume per bimonthly billing shall be charged to the customer at the rate of $2.03 per 100 cubic feet, effective on October 1, 2020; $2.55 per 100 cubic feet, effective on July 1, 2021; and $3.04 per 100 cubic feet, effective on October 1, 2022. 
(3)  Concentration charge. The customer shall be charged $0.34 per pound for each pound of BOD 5 material and $0.49 per pound for each pound of suspended solids and $4.63 per pound for each pound of phosphorus and $0.53 per pound for each pound of aluminum the customer discharges to the sanitary sewer, effective on October 1, 2020; $0.43 per pound for each pound of BOD 5 material and $0.62 per pound for each pound of suspended solids and $5.83 per pound for each pound of phosphorus and $0.67 per pound for each pound of aluminum the customer discharges to the sanitary sewer, effective on July 1, 2021; and $0.51 per pound for each pound of BOD 5 material and $0.74 per pound for each pound of suspended solids and $6.94 per pound for each pound of phosphorus and $0.85 per pound for each pound of aluminum the customer discharges to the sanitary sewer, effective on October 1, 2022. 
(4)  Monitoring fee. The monitoring fee for one monitored outfall is $177.00 per month and $14.75 per month for each additional regulated outfall, effective on October 1, 2020; $223.00 per month and $18.59 per month for each additional regulated outfall, effective on July 1, 2021; and $265.39 per month and $22.12 per month for each additional regulated outfall, effective on October 1, 2022. 
(5)  Volume and concentration determination. Monitoring and sampling control facilities shall be constructed on each lateral discharging industrial wastes to the sanitary sewer system. Concentration billing for BOD 5 and TSS may be based on samples or on the latest reported concentration numbers of NR 101 reporting forms submitted to the DNR, where no samples are available. 
(6)  Flow monitoring. Flow shall be recorded for each day a flow occurs. 
(7)  Sampling and analysis frequency. Three consecutive 24-hour composite samples shall be taken and analyzed on three consecutive production days each 30-day period. 
(8)  Analysis of wastes. Laboratory analysis of monitored waste samples shall consist of biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids to be performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standard Methods." 
(9)  Who shall collect data. All significant industrial users shall conduct or cause to be conducted all required tasks to provide the utility with the required data. The utility may verify the data. 
(10)  Reporting of volume and concentration data. Daily volume recordings and concentration data reports shall be submitted in writing to the utility by the tenth of the month following the data collection. 
(11)  Billing determination. The utility shall summarize all data for bimonthly billings. The normal procedure for determining the strength data shall be to take the arithmetic average of the concentrations and proportionate to the total bimonthly volume to arrive at total pounds. (Average concentration as milligrams per liter multiplied by flow in millions of gallons multiplied by the factor for weight 8.345/gal pounds.) However, irregularities noted with the concentration as compared with the flow may constitute other means of determining the concentration billing data at the discretion of the utility. 
(12)  Reclassification review. A monitored customer may request the utility to reclassify the customer to nonmonitored on the grounds that during 12 consecutive months of monitoring, the cost of required monitoring exceeded the utility's concentration charge. Documentation of costs for monitoring must accompany the request for review. The discharge is still liable for compliance monitoring and associated fees for a three-year period following reclassification. If, during the three years, the concentration of the discharge changes to the point that monitoring should be resumed and the discharge fails to inform the utility, the utility may back bill the entire period during which the customer was classified nonmonitored at the current rate of billing for monitored customers less the charges paid as a nonmonitored customer. The customer may also be subject to a forfeiture. A condition for reclassification is that the discharger has fully complied with all provisions of section 13.62.050 for a 12-month period. 
(13)  Reduction in monitoring frequency. Written requests for permission to reduce monitoring frequency as stipulated in subdivision (7) of this subsection may be granted by the Director of Public Works and Utilities. The requests by the monitored customer must clearly demonstrate the following: 
(A)  The cost of monthly monitoring is unreasonable in relation to the utility's concentration charge; 
(B)  Previously submitted concentration values must be constant; 
(C)  Compliance monitoring by the utility checks with reported concentrations. 
However, the minimum monitoring frequency is three consecutive production days each four-month period. The most recent strength data on file with the utility at the time of billing will be used to determine concentration billing. 
(c)  Charges for nonmonitored customers outside of City limits. 
(1)  Nonmonitored customers located outside of the corporate limits of the City served with sanitary sewer service directly by the utility are subject to codes, policies, regulations and charges as established and set forth below. (This chapter applies to the remaining area of Town of Stettin Sanitary District 1 not annexed to Wausau.) 
(2)  Minimum quarterly charge for metered sewer service. A minimum quarterly charge shall apply to each unit of business in a building or complex plus the volume charge as noted in subdivision (3) of this subsection. The basis for this charge will relate to comparable business in Wausau and/or number, size and type of plumbing fixtures. (The meter or meters used to record the volume of wastewater discharged to the sewer may not necessarily be the basis for the minimum charge, but the combined minimum charge for each unit of business per building or complex shall not be less than the related minimum charge per meter used to record the wastewater volume.) Residential units may apply and be granted metered sewer service. Each living unit shall be assessed a quarterly minimum charge per a 5/3 meter size.

Hauled waste generated outside of Wausau's sewer service area and nondomestic in nature (such as industrial process wastes) is restricted from dumping at Wausau's WWTP without written approval. (Wastes potentially toxic in nature or waste generally not acceptable for treatment at municipal WWTP regardless of origin shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. Contract haulers should not convey such wastes without prior written approval if it is the intent to dispose at Wausau's WWTP.) All hauled wastes are subject to the conditions and charges established and delineated below. All septic haulers shall receive written authorization to dump at Wausau's WWTP. Existing septic haulers at time of adoption of this Code will have complied with this requirement.) Dumping will only occur at Wausau's WWTP at a designated manhole or station. All septic haulers are required to report all waste loads delivered to Wausau's WWTP. Procedures regarding entering plant grounds, dumping, and reporting requirements are subject to change and will be addressed by policy by the Director of Public Works and Utilities or commission. Upon demand, the utility will have the right to inspect state-required hauling records to confirm origin and disposal of hauled wastes.

Chapter 15.56 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
 
15.56.010 - Authority. 
(a)  This ordinance is adopted by the Common Council under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 62.234. This ordinance supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under Wis. Stats. § 62.23, relating to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in Wis. Stats. § 62.234, Wis. Stats. § 62.23, applies to this ordinance and to any amendments to this ordinance. 
(b)  The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the Common Council. 
(c)  The Common Council hereby designates the Stormwater Management Administrator or appointee, to administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. 
(d)  The requirements of this ordinance do not pre-empt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(1)  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals including those authorized under Wis. Stats. §§ 281.16 and 283.33. 
(2)  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under Section NR 151.004 of the Wisconsin Administrative Code.  
15.56.020 - Findings of Fact. 
The Common Council finds that uncontrolled runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Uncontrolled runoff can: 
(a)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(b)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(c)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads. 
(d)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading. 
(e)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities. 
(f)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes. 
(g)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.  
15.56.030 - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The general purpose of this ordinance is to establish runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth. 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
(b)  Intent. It is the intent of the Common Council that this ordinance regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state and construction site erosion control. This ordinance may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The Common Council recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this ordinance is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Wis. Stats. § 281.16, for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the Common Council, it is the intent of this ordinance that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.  
15.56.040 - Applicability and jurisdiction. 
(a)  Applicability. 
(1)  Where not otherwise limited by law, this ordinance applies to land disturbing construction activity meeting any of the criteria in this paragraph, unless the site is otherwise exempt under paragraph (2).

Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity WPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Stormwater Management Administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.  
15.60.100 - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The Stormwater Management Administrator shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under these requirements as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with these requirements. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the Stormwater Management Administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination, and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The Stormwater Management Administrator shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The Stormwater Management Administrator has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Stormwater Management Administrator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the Stormwater Management Administrator access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of these requirements. A person who is the operator of a facility with a WPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by these requirements. 
(7)  If the Stormwater Management Administrator has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of these requirements, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with these requirements or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.  
15.60.110 - Requirements to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
Stormwater Management Administrator will adopt requirements identifying BMPs for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the State. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the WPDES permit.  
15.60.120 - Watercourse protection. 
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.  
15.60.130 - Notification of spills. 
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Stormwater Management Administrator within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.  
15.60.140 - Enforcement. 
(a)  Notice of violation. Whenever the Stormwater Management Administrator finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of these requirements, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation: 
(1)  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting. 
(2)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges. 
(3)  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist. 
(4)  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property. 
(5)  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs. 
(6)  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor, and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.  
15.60.150 - Appeal of notice of violation. 
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received within 30 days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the Board of Public Works shall take place within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the municipal authority or their designee shall be final.  
15.60.160 - Enforcement measures after appeal. 
In the event of an appeal upheld by the municipal authority, the violation must be corrected within the timeframe as established by the municipal authority. If the violation is not corrected in said timeframe, then representatives of the City shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.  
15.60.170 - Cost of abatement of the violation. 
Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within ten days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the City by reason of such violation. Interest at the rate of nine percent per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the 31st day following discovery of the violation.  
15.60.180 - Injunctive relief. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of these requirements. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of these requirements, the authorized enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.  
15.60.190 - Cost alternatives. 
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by these requirements, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory action, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.  
15.60.200 - Violations deemed a public nuisance. 
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of these requirements is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.  
15.60.210 - Criminal prosecution. 
Any person that has violated or continues to violate these requirements shall be subject to a forfeiter of not less than $100.00 nor more than $5,000.00 per violation; each day such violation exists shall be deemed a separate violation. 
The authorized enforcement agency may recover all attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of these requirements, including sampling and monitoring expenses.  
15.60.220 - Remedies not exclusive. 
The remedies listed in these requirements are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state, or local law, and it is within the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies.

(Ord. 61-5602 §1, 2013, File No. 12-0206) 
(d)  Authorization of rent abatement. 
(1)  Eligibility. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any agreement, whether oral or written, tenants and provider agencies shall be eligible to abate a portion of the total rental payments, in accordance with this section and pursuant to the order of the Public Health and Safety Committee or by written agreement of the parties, if the landlord of the residential premises fails to comply with an order of the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering to correct by the original due date, unless such due date is found to be unreasonable upon appeal to the Public Health and Safety Committee, a violation which is "rent impairing" as that term is defined in this chapter. Any such order of the Inspection and Zoning Division shall specifically state that uncorrected violations may be eligible for abatement in addition to any other penalties provided by law. A tenant's eligibility to abate rent shall apply only to the eligible tenant(s) or successor tenant(s) upon whose rented premises the uncorrected rent impairing violation exists or to any eligible tenant(s) or successor tenant(s) in a building with an uncorrected rent impairing violation in a common area.

Where an award is made and rent has been paid by both a tenant and a provider agency, the tenant's portion of the award shall be up to but not greater than the amount of rent the tenant has paid. Where the award amount is less than or equal to the amount of rent the tenant paid, the tenant shall receive all of the award. No rent may be abated pursuant to this ordinance until abatement is awarded by the Public Health and Safety Committee or authorized by written agreement of the parties. 
(2)  Other remedies. The right of a tenant to abate a portion of the rent as established by this section shall not preclude or affect in any way the tenant's right to abate under Wis. Stats. ch. 704; nor shall it preclude or affect in any way the tenant's or landlord's right to any of the remedies provided by the laws of the State of Wisconsin and the Wausau Municipal Code pertaining to the relationship of landlord and tenant. 
(3)  Designation of rent impairing violations. The Common Council shall adopt a list of violations of the provisions of chapter 16 of the Wausau Municipal Code and the Wis. Admin. Code ch. SPS 321 and 362, to be classified as "rent impairing" as above defined. Said list shall contain a brief description of the condition constituting the violation, the section of the ordinances violated and the percentage range of any possible rent abatement. The Public Health and Safety Committee may at any time recommend a change in the number of violations, their descriptions or the percentage of possible rent abatement for a particular violation but no such change shall be made except in the manner set forth above. 
(4)  Schedule of rent impairing violations. A tenant authorized to abate rent shall do so in accordance with the schedule which follows at the end of this section, with the precise amount to be set by the Public Health and Safety Committee after notice and hearing pursuant to subsection (5). The maximum total abatement authorized pursuant to this ordinance shall not exceed 95 percent of the periodic rental payment, except where the premises have been vacated pursuant to an order of the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering or pursuant to any other tenant right to remove from residential rental premises secured under Wisconsin law. 
(5)  Procedure. 
(A)  Application for authorization for rent abatement. An eligible tenant who may be entitled to abate a portion of his/her rental payment under this ordinance shall have 30 days from mailing of the notice of possible eligibility by the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering to file a request for a hearing on authorization for rent abatement. The request shall be in writing on a form approved by the Public Health and Safety Committee, shall state with specificity the name and address of the landlord and the alleged rent impairing violation(s) and shall be filed with the City Clerk. The application shall be accompanied by a fee as provided in section 3.40.010(a) made payable to the City Treasurer, which fee shall be recovered from the landlord if abatement is ordered. The time and place for the hearing shall be the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Public Health and Safety Committee, but not prior to the end of the 30-day filing period. Notice of the hearing including a statement of the time, place and nature of the hearing shall be mailed to the landlord and tenant(s) at least ten days prior to the hearing. 
(B)  Role of the Public Health and Safety Committee. 
(i)  The Public Health and Safety Committee shall have the authority to conduct hearings on requests for authorization for rent abatement and to determine the exact amount of rent, if any, which may be abated pursuant to this ordinance. 
(ii)  The Public Health and Safety Committee shall have the authority to administer oaths and to issue subpoenas pursuant to WI SS 885.01 at the request of the parties and shall be responsible for the fair, orderly and impartial conduct of the rent abatement hearing and the preservation of the exhibits and the record therein. 
(C)  Conduct of hearing. The Public Health and Safety Committee shall conduct the hearing on the request for authorization for rent abatement, shall administer oaths to all witnesses and may issue subpoenas upon request of the parties. So far as practicable the rules of evidence in WI SS 227.45 shall be followed. The landlord and the tenant may be represented by counsel or other representative, may call and examine witnesses and cross-examine witnesses of the other party. All proceedings and testimony shall be recorded on tape. If a review is sought of the committee's decision, a copy of the tape recordings shall be supplied to anyone requesting the same at the requester's expense. If either party requests a stenographic recording and transcription, the Committee shall make the necessary arrangements, but the expense shall be borne by the requesting party. In the hearing, the tenant(s) shall have the burden of proving to a reasonable certainty by the greater weight of the credible evidence, i.e. by the preponderance of the evidence, that the landlord failed to correct (a) rent impairing violation(s) by the due date in an order of the Inspection and Zoning Division. It is the landlord's burden to show by the preponderance of the evidence that any rent impairing violations were negligently or willfully caused by the tenant or the tenant's guests or that the tenant's refusal to allow entry prevented the landlord from making the corrections in a timely manner. Thereafter, the tenant has the burden to show that any such refusal was reasonable under the circumstances. Either party may present additional evidence on the nature, extent and seriousness of violations, the length of time conditions existed and the extent to which the tenant was deprived of the full use of the rented premises, to assist in determining the percent of abatement which should be allowed. 
(D)  Decision. 
(i)  If, on the evidence at the hearing, the Public Health and Safety Committee finds that the landlord failed to comply with an order of the Inspection and Zoning Division to correct by the original due date a "rent impairing" violation as that term is defined in subsection (c), the Committee shall order that the rent be abated retroactive to the date of the initial inspection in order to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance and to provide fair and equitable compensation to the tenant(s) for the diminished value of the rented premises due to the landlord's continued violation of the City of Wausau's building/housing codes. Any such abatement shall be established in accordance with the Schedule of Rent Impairing Violations referenced in subsection (d)(4). In setting the exact percentage of abatement the Committee shall consider the nature, extent and seriousness of the particular condition(s), the total number of rent impairing violations at issue, the length of time the condition(s) existed and the extent to which the condition(s) deprived the tenant(s) of full use of the rented premises. If the Committee finds that the landlord's failure to comply with the order of the Inspection and Zoning Division by the due date was caused by factors wholly outside the landlord's control and if the Committee further finds that the landlord has taken affirmative steps to minimize the impact of the uncorrected rent-impairing condition(s) on the tenant(s), any sums reasonably expended by the landlord in that regard should be considered in setting the percentage of abatement and may operate to reduce the final abatement percentage below the minimum percentage listed for the item(s) in the Schedule of Rent Impairing Violations in subsection (d)(4). The Committee shall not authorize rent abatement for any condition(s) found to be caused either negligently or willfully by the tenant or his/her guests, nor shall abatement be ordered for any period of time after the tenant has unreasonably refused entry to the landlord for the purpose of correcting the condition(s) giving rise to the violation(s). 
(ii)  If, after the hearing, the Committee finds that the landlord did not fail to comply with an order of the Inspection and Zoning Division to correct a rent impairing violation by the due date or that the rent impairing violations were caused by the tenant or the tenant's guests or that the tenant unreasonably refused entry for the purpose of correcting a rent impairing violation, the Committee shall enter an order denying the request for authorization to abate rent for any items negligently or willfully caused by the tenant or guests of the tenant or for any items which remained uncorrected due to the tenant's unreasonable refusal to allow entry for repair purposes. 
(iii)  The decision and order of the Committee shall contain written findings and shall be mailed to the parties within ten days of completion of the hearing or as soon thereafter as possible. The failure to issue and mail a decision within ten days shall neither deprive the Committee of jurisdiction to render a final decision in the matter nor affect the validity thereof. 
(iv)  The holder of the landlord's interest in the premises at the time of the decision and order of the Committee is issued and the holder or holders of the landlord's interest during the period of time that the right to continuing abatement remains in effect are bound by the order and by the applicable provisions of this chapter relating to rent abatement. 
(6)  Petition for reconsideration. Within ten days after service by first-class mail of the decision of the Committee, either party may file with the City Clerk, a written petition for reconsideration specifying in detail the grounds for the relief sought. The Committee may on their own motion reconsider the decision or order a hearing on reconsideration without the filing of a written petition. 
(A)  Reconsideration will be granted only on the basis of a material error of fact or law or an error in the calculation of an award amount, or 
(B)  Copies of the petition shall be served by first class mail by the petitioner on all parties, who may file replies within seven days after service by mail of the petition. 
(C)  Within 21 days of the filing of the petition, the Committee shall enter an order denying reconsideration or an order granting reconsideration disposing of the petition without a hearing or shall order a rehearing, which shall be held within 20 days. The failure to issue a decision within the above time period shall not deprive the Committee of jurisdiction to render a decision on reconsideration or affect the validity thereof. If no order is entered within 21 days of the filing of the petition, the petition shall be deemed denied. 
(D)  Upon rehearing, if any, proceedings shall conform to those in section (d)(5) et seq. relating to an original hearing. 
(E)  The filing of a petition for rehearing shall not suspend or delay the effective date of the original decision and order, and the order shall take effect on the date fixed by the Committee and shall continue in effect unless the petition is granted or until the order is superseded, modified, or set aside as provided by law. 
(7)  Request for modification. If, subsequent to a decision by the Committee ordering rent abatement, substantial further deterioration or substantial improvement occurs in any rent impairing conditions which were the subject of the original order, the applicant, landlord or any successor tenant may request modification of the rent abatement amount. Only one such request for modification may be made by each eligible individual, which request shall follow the procedures in section (d)(5) et seq. relating to the original application. 
(8)  Enforcement. Whenever, in the judgment of the Public Health and Safety Committee, the judicial enforcement of the ordinance is necessary, the Committee shall in writing request the City Attorney to enforce the ordinance in the name of the City of Wausau. 
(9)  Appeal. All orders of the Public Health and Safety Committee shall be final administrative determinations and shall be subject to review in court as by law may be provided. Any party to the proceeding may seek review thereof within 30 days of service by first-class mail of the final determination of the Committee. In addition, written notice of any request for judicial review shall be given by the party seeking review to all parties who appeared at the proceeding before the Committee, with said notice to be sent by first class mail to each party's last known address. 
The institution of the proceeding for judicial review shall not stay the decision and order of the Committee; however the reviewing court may order a stay upon such terms as it deems proper. 
(e)  Successor tenant. 
(1)  A successor tenant is entitled to abate rent pursuant to the order of the Public Health and Safety Committee issued in accordance with this chapter, provided that at the time the tenancy commences there exists an uncorrected rent impairing violation which was determined or is in the process of being determined by the Committee to be abatable. 
(2)  In order to be deemed a successor tenant under this ordinance, an otherwise eligible individual must advise the landlord in writing, with a copy to the Inspection and Zoning Division of her or his intent to exercise his or her rights as a successor tenant, no later than 15 days after receipt of written notification by the landlord which conforms to the requirements of section 16.04.037(g). If said written notification is given at or prior to the time the rental agreement is entered into, the successor tenant's notice of intent must be given no later than 15 days after the commencement of the successor tenancy. 
(3)  Failure to provide the landlord with a timely written notice of intent to become a successor tenant forfeits a tenant's right to proceed to abate rent as a successor tenant under this chapter, except where the landlord has failed to provide the written notification of the tenant's right to abate rent pursuant to subsection (2) above. In cases where the landlord fails to provide written notice as required, an otherwise eligible tenant may assert the rights of a successor tenant at any time during the tenancy or in any action relating to or arising out of the tenancy. 
(f)  Duration of abatement. 
(1)  Authorization to abate a portion of the rent pursuant to subsection (d) for failure of a landlord to correct a rent impairing violation ceases upon certification by the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering that said violation has been satisfactorily corrected. Where more than one rent impairing violation has been authorized for rent abatement and partial correction has been certified, authorization to abate continues for the uncorrected rent impairing violations, until such time as their satisfactory correction has been verified. 
(2)  If abatement is authorized, the landlord must promptly repay any rent previously paid by the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant and apportioned to rent impairing violations from the date of the original inspection by the Inspection and Zoning Division at which said violations were discovered. 
(3)  If the landlord fails to promptly reimburse the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant as required in subsection (2) above, the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant may enforce the order requiring reimbursement as follows: 
(A)  The tenant, provider agency or successor tenant may deduct the amount previously paid and subsequently determined to be apportioned to rent impairing violations from future rental payments. 
(B)  If the total of future rental payments payable for the balance of the tenancy is less than the reimbursement required in subsection (2) above or if the tenant or successor tenant no longer resides at the premises in question, the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant shall recover from the landlord the amount not reimbursed in accordance with the order of the Committee plus costs of collection including reasonable attorney fees. Nothing in this ordinance shall prohibit a tenant from collecting double damages if not being reimbursed for abated rent meets the definition of a security deposit violation under ATCP 134.02 (11) and ATCP 134.06. 
(4)  The failure of a landlord to promptly reimburse the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant as required in subdivision (2) above and the failure of either a landlord, tenant or a provider agency after a decision by the reviewing court on judicial review, to pay monies wrongfully not reimbursed or return monies wrongfully abated shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and shall be punishable as provided in this section. 
(5)  Rent abatement awarded in a decision and order of the Public Health and Safety Committee shall accrue during the period when either a tenant or a successor tenant is entitled to the exclusive possession and occupancy of an affected dwelling unit. Under no circumstances shall there be recovery by both a tenant and a successor tenant for the same period of time. 
(g)  Rent abatement and code violations disclosure. The landlord or any person authorized to enter into a rental agreement shall exhibit to the prospective tenant, prior to the time a rental agreement is entered into, the following: 
(1)  A copy of any official notice of outstanding violation(s) of chapter 16 of the Wausau Municipal Code or Wis. Admin. Code ch. SPS 321 and 326 of which the said landlord or person has actual notice and which affects the subject rental building regardless of the location of the violation(s) or defect(s) therein; 
(2)  A copy of any Public Health and Safety Committee decision and order which affects the subject rental unit or any common areas of the subject rental building. 
(3)  The failure by a landlord to comply with the provisions of this subsection regarding written notice of a successor tenant's right to abate rent shall not be subject to the penalties set forth as provided in this section. 
In addition, prior to the time a rental agreement is entered into, the landlord shall advise the prospective tenant in writing of a successor tenant's right to abate rent pursuant to the order aforementioned until authorization to abate ceases as provided in subsection (f) above. In cases where the rent abatement request is pending at the time the rental agreement is entered into, the landlord shall provide the successor tenant written notification of a successor tenant's rights when the case has been decided and shall exhibit a copy of the decision and order to the successor tenant upon receipt thereof. 
Finally, at the time occupancy commences the landlord shall exhibit to the tenant (formerly, prospective tenant) a copy of all additional official notices referred to in subdivision (a) above and a copy of all decisions and orders referred to in subdivision (b) above, if any have been issued since the signing of the rental agreement. Similarly, at the time of occupancy the landlord shall provide the required written notice of a successor tenant's rights with respect to all such additional official notices and decisions. 
The written notice of successor tenant's rights shall specifically state in underlined or otherwise emphasized print the following: "If you wish to become a successor tenant and to abate rent in accordance with section 16.04.037 of the Wausau Municipal Code you must provide your landlord and the Inspection and Zoning Division with written notice of that intent within 15 days of receiving written notification from your landlord of your right as a successor tenant to abate rent. Failure to provide your landlord with timely written notice forfeits your right to be a "successor tenant" and to abate rent as a successor tenant under section 16.04.037 of the Wausau Municipal Code." 
(h)  Prosecution. It is the intent of this section that any use of abatement will not prohibit the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering from prosecuting violations of the code relating to said property. 
(i)  Penalty. 
(1)  Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall upon conviction be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $150.00 nor more than $900.00, unless a different penalty is specifically provided, with each separate day of violation to be considered a separate offense. 
(2)  Any person who shall fail or neglect to comply with any lawful order of the Public Health and Safety Committee issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a violation of this section, and every day or fraction thereof on which such person shall fail or neglect to comply with such order, shall be deemed a separate offense. 
(j)  Severability. In the event that any section of this ordinance shall be declared or judged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections of this ordinance, which shall be in full force and effect as if the said section or said sections were not originally a part thereof. 
(k)  Effective date of ordinance. This ordinance shall be effective and apply to all orders written by the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering on or after April 1, 2012. Any amendments to this ordinance relating to rent abatement shall be effective and apply to all orders written by the Inspection and Zoning Division of the Department of Engineering 90 days after the publication of this ordinance as amended.

16.04.039 - Residential rental licensing. 
(a)  Findings. The Common Council finds that a significant percentage of housing code and fire code violations occur at residential rental dwelling units located within the City and that the conditions which exist at these units adversely affect the individuals residing in such units, the neighborhoods in which they are located and the residents living nearby. As a reasonable and necessary means of realizing the purposes and objectives of this Title 16, Housing Code, as well as to prevent blighted conditions in City neighborhoods and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public the Common Council has determined that it is necessary to establish a program of regularly scheduled inspections within designated districts which demonstrate evidence of blight, high rates of building code complaints or violations, deteriorating property values, or increases in single-family home conversions to rental units. 
(b)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this section. 
(1)  Habitability violation shall have the same meaning as in Wis. Stats. § 66.0104(1)(ah). 
(2)  Department means the City of Wausau Division of Inspection and Zoning. 
(3)  Designated Neighborhood Stabilization and Enhancement District means that area defined in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 66.0104 and adopted by resolution by the Common Council. 
(4)  Dwelling means a building which includes one or more distinct living units. It does not include rest homes, convalescent homes, nursing homes, hospitals, assisted living centers, hotels, motels, or properties owned or operated by the City of Wausau or its Community Development Authority. 
(5)  Unit means any independently rented living space whose term of lease is 30 days or greater. 
(c)  Regularly scheduled inspections. The City hereby establishes a program of regularly scheduled inspections of all residential rental dwelling units located within a designated neighborhood stabilization and enhancement district. 
(d)  Inspection. Inspections shall only be conducted: 
(1)  In an occupied dwelling unit with consent from an adult tenant or adult designee present at the time of the inspection; 
(2)  In a vacant dwelling unit with consent from the owner or owner's agent who is present at the time of the inspection; or 
(3)  Upon obtaining a special inspection warrant pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0119. 
(e)  Abatement. Code violations identified during the residential rental dwelling unit inspection shall be abated within the time ordered by the Department to prevent re-inspections and associated re-inspection fees. The time to abate or cure a habitability violation will be not less than 30 days; however, where the habitability violation exposes a tenant to imminent danger, the City may require an abatement or cure period of less than 30 (days). 
(f)  Inspection fee. The Department will charge a fee for the residential rental unit inspection or reinspection as approved by the Common Council and set forth in the City of Wausau Fees and Licenses Schedule pursuant to section 3.40.010(a) of this Code. Such fee will not exceed those permitted pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0104(e). Unpaid inspection fees will be collected as a special charge as provided in Wis. Stats. § 66.0627 and entered on the tax roll if unpaid, or may be collected in any other manner allowed by law. The enactment of this ordinance shall constitute notice to property owners of such charge. 
(g)  Inspection upon request or complaint. All properties in the City, including residential rental dwelling units, shall remain subject to inspection requests. None of the inspection provisions in this section shall prohibit, condition, or otherwise limit any inspection conducted pursuant to this code or other applicable law. The Department will inspect residential rental dwelling units based on tenant or citizen requests or complaints. 
(h)  Notice of inspection. 
(1)  The Department shall serve written notice of the date and time of any inspection to be conducted under this section by mailing such notice by first class mail at least 21 calendar days prior to the date of the inspection. The Department shall mail the notice to the occupants of each residential dwelling unit, the owner, and the authorized contact person to the addresses provided on the residential rental contact registration as provided in section 16.04.030 of this Code. In the case of multiple owners of the same property, notice to any one of the owners or the authorized contact person shall comply with the notice requirement under this section. 
(2)  Should the tenant, owner, authorized contact person of the owner of the residential rental dwelling unit, or other person in control of the dwelling unit refuse admittance to the Department for purposes of the inspection or any re-inspection the Department may proceed to obtain a special inspection warrant pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0119. 
(i)  Severability. If any provision or portion of this section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected thereby. 
(Ord. 61-5814 §2, §3, 2019, File No. 93-0717) (Prior: Ord. 61-5702 §1, 2016; Ord. 61-5654 §1, 2015, File No. 13-1115; Ord. 61-5645 §1, 2014; Ord. 61-5601 §1, 2013, File No. 13-1115)

21.12.060 - Development agreements. 
A development agreement is a written agreement entered into by and between the City and a subdivider for the construction, installation, dedication, and provision of improvements in connection with a subdivision and payment for the various costs in connection with the needed infrastructure. Development agreements are intended to clearly identify the subdivider's costs and the City's costs related to the infrastructure needed to develop a proposed subdivision and to establish a schedule for the installation and payment of this infrastructure. The subdivider shall be responsible for infrastructure improvement costs including but not limited to the following: 
(a)  Eight-inch standard sanitary sewer mains, laterals to the street right-of-way line, lift station fees which are as provided in section 3.40.010(a), and any other sanitary sewer related fees. Oversize sanitary sewer mains will generally be cost-shared by Wausau Water Works. 
(b)  Eight-inch standard water mains, hydrants, booster station fees which are as provided section 3.40.010(a), water main tap fees, and any other water supply related fees. Oversize water mains will generally be cost-shared by Wausau Water Works. 
(c)  All storm sewer mains, inlets, and detention basins in accordance with an approved stormwater management plan. The City may cost-share in certain oversize trunk storm sewer mains. 
(d)  Standard curb and gutter shall be a six-inch concrete curb with a 24-inch gutter, drive approaches, and sidewalk in accordance with City standard specifications and recommendations. Mountable curb and gutter, where approved by the City Engineer, shall be designed in accordance with the standards provided by the City Engineer. Streets without curb and gutter (a rural-section) may be constructed where approved by the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee and shall be designed in accordance with the standards provided by the City Engineer. Pavement shall be a minimum of three inches of bituminous asphalt over a minimum of eight inches of crushed aggregate base course. In some streets the pavement or base course may have to be of greater thickness or employ a layer of free-draining aggregate and edge drains. Temporary streets, culs-de-sac, and hammer-head turnarounds may be allowed to meet lower design standards where approved by the City Engineer. 
(e)  Street lighting designed and located in accordance with the recommendations and standards provided by the Director of Inspections and Electrical Systems. 
Development agreements are intended to provide some degree of flexibility for the City and subdivider in meeting the infrastructure needs of the proposed subdivision. All infrastructure costs directly related to the proposed subdivision, including City staff and contracted engineering costs and inspection fees, will be the responsibility of the subdivider. Agreements can be structured that require the subdivider to install the improvements, provide for the City to install the improvements, or a combination thereof. All infrastructure design work shall be approved by the City and all inspection work shall be performed by the City or under a contract with the City. City costs for the development of a subdivision will usually be limited to only the marginal cost for over-sizing certain infrastructure and installing infrastructure to serve a larger service area than the proposed subdivision. A development agreement shall be executed by the subdivider and signed by the Mayor on behalf of the City before the final plat, as approved by the Common Council, is signed by the Mayor.

21.16.010 - Preservation of natural and cultural features. 
In all subdivisions, due regard shall be given to the preservation of natural features such as large trees, watercourses, wetlands, historical and similar features. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.16.020 - Unsuitable land. 
No land shall be subdivided for residential use which, after investigation and recommendation by the City Engineer, is found to be unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or bad drainage, adverse earth or rock formation or topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the future residents of the community. The City's determination as to suitability shall be final. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.16.040 - Unsuitable land for dedication—Procedure. 
Whenever a preliminary plat includes a proposed dedication of land to public use and the Common Council, after investigation and recommendation by the City Engineer, finds that such land is not required or not suitable for public use, the Common Council may either refuse to approve such dedication or require the rearrangement of lots in the proposed subdivision to include such land. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.16.050 - Reservation of public spaces and sites—Preliminary plat. 
Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes a proposed street, highway, or parkway or proposed site for a park, playground, school, or stormwater management area or other public use as indicated on the official map of the City, the comprehensive plan or other adopted plan, the subdivider shall dedicate such space or reserve such space on the preliminary plat unless it is determined by the City that such space is no longer needed. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.16.080 - Acquisition of land within a proposed plat for public use. 
The Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee and Plan Commission shall consider all preliminary plats and adopted plans, maps, and studies authorized by the Common Council to determine the need for acquisition for public use of any of the land included in the preliminary plat. Land may be acquired for public school sites, stormwater management, parks, playgrounds or other public recreation areas, or any other public purposes as provided by law. 
(a)  Referral to public body. The Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee shall refer the plat to the public body concerned with the potential public use and acquisition for its consideration and report. The Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee and Plan Commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public body 30 days for reply. If the public body recommends acquisition of land for public use it shall provide the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee with a map showing the boundaries and area of the plat proposed to be acquired and an estimate of the time required to complete the acquisition. 
(b)  Notice to subdivider. Upon receipt of a recommendation to acquire a portion of the plat, the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee shall notify the subdivider who shall designate on the preliminary plat that area proposed to be acquired by the public body. If the preliminary plat is approved by the Common Council with the recommended reservation, the area to be acquired shall be shown as "reserved for public acquisition" on the final plat. 
(c)  Duration of land reservation. Acquisition of land designated on the preliminary or final plat as "reserved for public acquisition" shall be initiated by the public agency involved within eight months of notification, in writing, by the subdivider that he intends to develop the property designated as "reserved for public acquisition." The letter from the subdivider shall be accompanied by a sketch plan of the development proposed for the reserved property and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of the public agency to initiate acquisition of the reserved property within the eight-month period shall result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the property involved and freeing of the property for development. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.16.085 - Required dedications for park purposes. 
(a)  Relation of land required for population. It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that nine-tenths of an acre of land be devoted to park and recreational purposes for each 100 persons residing within the City. 
(b)  Subdividers must provide for parks. In order that open space and sites for public use may be properly located and preserved as the community develops, and in order that the costs of providing the public park sites necessary to serve the additional families brought into the community by subdivision development may be most equitably proportioned on the basis of the additional need created by the individual subdivision, every subdivider who subdivides land shall dedicate a portion of such land, pay a fee, or do both as set forth as follows, for the purpose of providing park lands to serve future residents of such subdivision: 
(1)  Outside the corporate limits but within the City's extraterritorial plat limits, after consideration by the Plan and Park Commissions and Park and Recreation Committee and determination by the Common Council that a portion of the plat or planned development is required for such park and recreation sites, the developers may be required to dedicate such area to the municipality having jurisdiction. 
(2)  Within the corporate limits of the City, where feasible and compatible with the comprehensive plan for the City park system, the developer shall dedicate land to the public to provide for the park and recreation needs of the plat, land division, planned development, or unified development in accordance with the formula in subdivision (3) of this subsection. 
(3)  The amount of land to be so provided and dedicated shall be determined on the basis of nine-tenths of an acre per 100 population per formula. The total population of the subdivision planned, development or unified development shall be determined by summing the population per lot or dwelling unit based on the following formula: 
Population Formula 
Lots Within An: 	Population Per Lot: 
I-R District 	3.4 
R-1 District 	3.4 
R-2 District 	3.4 
R-3 and R-3-1 Districts 	4.0 
R-4-1 District 	Area of lot (in square feet), divided by 1,500 square feet, multiplied by 1.6 or a total of 12.8, whichever is less 
R-4-2 	Area of lot (square feet), divided by 2,500 square feet, multiplied by 1.6 
R-4 District 	Area of lot (in square feet), divided by 1,500 square feet, multiplied by 1.6 
Planned Development or Unified Development 	Sum of population per proposed dwelling unit: Single-family unit—3.4 persons, duplex unit—2.0 persons and apartment unit—1.6 persons 
 
(4)  In the event that dedication would result in sites too small to be usable, or if the comprehensive plan for the City park system calls for such public sites to be located elsewhere, or if such sites would not otherwise be suitable as determined by the Common Council, after consideration by the Plan Commission and park recreation committee, a payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication shall be required. The amount of such fee shall be as provided in section 3.40.010(a). 
(5)  The procedure for determining whether the subdivider is to dedicate land, pay a fee, or both, shall be as follows: 
(A)  At the time of filing a preliminary plat for approval, the subdivider shall, as part of such filing, indicate a preference to dedicate property for park and recreational purposes or to pay a fee in lieu thereof. A land dedication for this purpose shall appear on the preliminary plat map as submitted. 
(B)  At the time of the preliminary plat map approval, acting after consideration of the recommendations of the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee, Plan Commission and Park Committee, the Common Council shall determine, as a part of such approval, whether to require a dedication of land within a subdivision, payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both. 
(6)  The Common Council shall accept a land dedication or require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, upon consideration of the following: 
(A)  Topography, geology, soils, access, and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; and 
(B)  Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; and 
(C)  The comprehensive plan for the City park system. 
(7)  Where payment of a fee is required, such payment shall be made in a lump sum prior to the recording of a final plat or certified survey map, or prior to issuance of any building permit for an R-4, R-4-1, or R-4-2 development, planned development or unified development. As an alternative, the developer may pay 50 percent of the total amount and file an agreement and performance bond, with a two-year limit for the unpaid balance, with the City Clerk. 
All existing and future fees received under the ordinance codified in this section shall be segregated in an interest bearing account and the interest generated therefrom shall accrue to that account. 
Land dedication shall appear on preliminary and final plats. Prior to issuance of building permits for a planned development or unified development where there is no plat, dedication of public lands shall be by deed. 
(8)  The determination of the Common Council as to whether land shall be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. 
(9)  When a replat or a certified survey creates additional residential building lots, the owners of said additional lots shall pay a fee as provided in section 3.40.010(a), per additional lot, to the City prior to the recording of the final plat or certified survey. 
(10)  If the comprehensive park plan shows that no additional parkland is needed in that neighborhood or that additional parkland in that neighborhood is not feasible to purchase, then the money generated in lieu of land may be used to purchase park property elsewhere within the City limits or within the City's extraterritorial plat limits, so as to benefit the neighborhood. 
(Ord. 61-5605 §34(part), File No. 13-1109; Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)

(1)  The court shall not vacate any alleys immediately in the rear of lots fronting on county trunk highways without the prior approval of the County Board, or on state trunk highways without the prior approval of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. 
(2)  The court shall not vacate any parts of the plat which have been dedicated to and accepted by the public for public use, except as provided in section 21.16.120. 
(b)  The vacation or alteration of a plat shall not affect any restrictive covenant applying to any of the platted land, unless otherwise stipulated by judgment of the court. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.16.120 - Vacation or alteration of parkland. 
Following a recommendation by the park and recreation committee, Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee, and Plan Commission, the Common Council may vacate parkland dedicated on a plat, certified survey map, or other instrument of description, as follows: 
(a)  Plat. If the parkland or playground was dedicated by a recorded plat and the parkland or playground so dedicated was never developed or used by the City as a public park or playground, the Common council may apply for the vacation of the parkland or playground in a manner consistent with Wis. Stats. § 236.43(3). 
(b)  Certified survey maps and other instruments. If the parkland or playground was dedicated by a certified survey map or other instrument, the City may vacate or alter its parkland or playground areas and may sell, trade, or swap parkland or playground parcels, regardless of whether the parkland or playground has been developed, used, or recognized by the City, to any third party or parties the City deems appropriate, for more desirable and suitable parkland or playground area(s) or other consideration. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.16.180 - Subdivisions created by successive divisions. 
Where it is not practicable to require that a final plat of a subdivision created by successive divisions be filed in accordance with this title, the Common Council may, in lieu thereof, order an assessor's plat to be made under the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 70.27 and may assess the cost thereof as provided in such section. Regardless of the type of plat filed, any such subdivision shall comply with all the provisions of this title to the extent that they may reasonably be applied. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.16.200 - Replats. 
A replat of all or any part of a recorded subdivision may not be made or recorded except after proper court action has been taken to vacate the original plat or the specific part thereof. However, a replat may be made and recorded without taking court action to vacate the original plat or part thereof when all the parties interested in such replat agree thereto in writing, and the replat is in accordance with all applicable provisions of this title and has been approved by the Common Council. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)

(c)  Minor streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and sewer systems, and to require the minimum amount of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. 
(d)  The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable layout. 
(e)  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless the Common Council, following a recommendation by the City Engineer, determines that such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. 
(f)  In business and industrial developments the streets shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.040 - Access to major arterial streets. 
Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed major arterial street, the number of minor streets entering a major arterial street shall be kept to a minimum. The Common Council may require that access to the major arterial street be limited by one or more of the following means: 
(a)  A parallel street supplying frontage for lots backing onto the major street, such lots to be provided with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line; 
(b)  A series of culs-de-sac, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the major street; 
(c)  A marginal access street or service drive, separated from the major street by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points; 
(d)  Two adjacent lots may be required to share a driveway; 
(e)  Corner lots may be required to gain access from an intersecting street rather than the major arterial street. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.050 - Width of streets. 
Right-of-way and paving widths of all streets shall be established by the Common Council, following a recommendation by the City Engineer. The following widths shall serve as a guide for proposing new and upgraded permanent and temporary streets and culs-de-sac and other types of turnarounds associated with subdivision activity: 
	Paving -
Face-to-Face 	R.O.W. 
Diameter of end of cul-de-sac 	70— 90 ft. 	100—120 ft. 
		
L-Type, T-Type, Y-Type, Branch 	** 	** 
		
Minor Street 	32—36 ft. 	60 ft. 
		
Collector street 	42—53 ft. 	80 ft. 
		
Major arterial street 	48—61 ft. 	100 ft. 
** The right-of-way and paved area for these types of turnarounds shall allow for a fire truck with a wheelbase of 25 feet to turn around with no more than one backing maneuver. 
 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.060 - Street grades. 
The grade of major arterial and collector streets shall not exceed six percent unless necessitated by exceptional topography and approved by the Common Council following a recommendation by the City Engineer. The grade of all other streets shall not exceed ten percent unless necessitated by exceptional topography and approved by the Common Council following a recommendation by the City Engineer. The minimum grade of all streets shall be four-tenths of one percent. Pedestrian ways shall not exceed 12 percent grade unless steps of an approved design are to be constructed. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.070 - Vertical curves. 
All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length in feet equivalent to 15 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade for major arterial streets and one-half of this minimum length for all other streets. No vertical curve less than 50 feet in length is required. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.080 - Horizontal curves.

A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on major arterial streets and collector streets. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.100 - Culs-de-sac and other types of turnarounds. 
(a)  The use of culs-de-sac and other types of turnarounds in street layouts shall be limited to portions of developments which, due to unusual shape, size, location, or topography, may better be served by culs-de-sac or other types of turnarounds than by continuous streets as recommended by the City Engineer. 
(b)  A street with a cul-de-sac or other type of turnaround shall not be longer than 500 feet, measured on its centerline unless, by reason of topography or other circumstances beyond the control of the developer, the Common Council, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, finds a greater length to be justifiable. 
(c)  Where use of a cul-de-sac is allowed, the following statement shall be placed on the final plat to alert future lot owners of the City's snow plowing policy, "All owners of Lots...(Lots fronting on a cul-de-sac) should take notice that it is the City of Wausau's policy to plow snow to the outside curb area of cul-de-sac streets. The snow will not be removed by the City. This may result in a large quantity of snow being plowed to the curb and driveway area of said lots. It is the lot owner's responsibility to clear snow plowed into driveway areas." 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.110 - Additional street right-of-way needed. 
Where a new subdivision abuts an existing street of inadequate right-of-way width, additional right-of-way width may be required to be dedicated by the subdivider to meet the purposes and requirements of this title. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.120 - Street intersections. 
(a)  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 70 degrees shall not be acceptable. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the Common council. 
(b)  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet should be discouraged. 
(c)  Where the grade of any street at the approach of an intersection exceeds seven percent, a leveling area should be provided having not greater than four percent grade at a distance of 50 feet measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street. 
(d)  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the City Engineer to provide adequate sight distance. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.130 - Alleys.

(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.150 - Stormwater easement and drainage right-of-way. 
Where a subdivision is traversed by a nonnavigable water course such as a drainage way, channel, or stream, the Common Council, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, may require the dedication of a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such water course, and of such width or construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose of conveying stormwater. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow. However, where necessary, as determined by the Common Council, these easements may be used for the installation of subsurface, storm sewers. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.155 - Floodplain of navigable waters and building setbacks. 
Where any portion of a proposed subdivision abuts or contains navigable water, as determined by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Zoning Administrator may order the subdivider to establish the location of the floodway and floodplain as defined in chapter 23.56. If applicable by state law to the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall also show the location of a 75-foot building setback line from all points along the ordinary high water mark as determined by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.160 - Residential blocks. 
(a)  Blocks should have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be allowed in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways. 
(b)  The proposed lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks should be such as are appropriate for the existing environmental conditions of the locality where the plat is proposed, for the provision of safe and efficient public services and facilities and for the type of residential development contemplated in the subdivision. Block lengths in residential areas should generally not exceed 1,800 feet nor be less than 400 feet in length. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterial streets and collector streets should be not less than 1,000 feet in length. 
(c)  Pedestrian ways, not less than ten feet wide, may be required by the Common Council to provide circulation or access to parks, schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.170 - Nonresidential blocks. 
Blocks designed for commercial or industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be determined suitable by the Common Council for the prospective use. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)

(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.230 - Lot frontage. 
Every lot shall front on or abut a public street. Lots with access only to private drives or streets shall be permitted only with the approval of the Common Council. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.240 - Drainage requirements. 
Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots and to minimize soil erosion and surface water pollution. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.260 - Resubdivision of parcels. 
In case a tract is subdivided into parcels containing one or more acres, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the resubdivision of any parcels into smaller lots in accordance with the provisions of this title. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1 (part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.270 - Lot lines. 
Lot lines shall follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross them. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.280 - Double frontage and reversed frontage lots. 
Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from major arterial streets, commercial and industrial areas or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.20.290 - Outlots. 
The establishment of outlots shall be discouraged except to transfer ownership of stormwater detention basins.

21.24.010 - Submission—Purpose. 
Every proposed subdivision shall be submitted to the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee and Plan Commission for tentative or conditional approval in the form of a preliminary plat prior to the submission of a final plat. The preliminary plat is not intended to be a final plat and must be prepared in such form as not to be confused with a final plat. Its purpose is to show graphically all facts needed to enable the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee and Plan Commission and other public bodies to determine whether the proposed layout of the land in question is satisfactory from the standpoint of the public interest. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a qualified surveyor, trained and experienced in the layout of subdivisions. 
The graphic and descriptive items in this chapter are normally required to be shown on the preliminary plat and the accompanying application for approval. The lack of information under any item specified herein, or improper information supplied by the applicant, shall be cause for disapproval of a preliminary plat. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.24.020 - Formal application for approval of preliminary plat.

Chapter 21.28 - FINAL PLATS 
 
21.28.010 - Final plat may constitute a portion of the approved preliminary plat. 
A final plat may constitute only a portion of the approved preliminary plat provided that the public improvements to be constructed in the area covered by the plat are sufficient by and of themselves to accomplish a proper development and to provide adequately for the health, safety, and general welfare of the future residents therein and for adequate access to contiguous areas. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)

(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
Chapter 21.30 - ASSESSORS' PLATS 
 
21.30.010 - Purpose. 
The United States Government originally intended to divide the continental United States into sections of land, each measuring approximately one mile square. The United States Government also provided the sections would exist as they were monumented by the original surveyors. Due to the surveying methods employed and available equipment, difficult terrain, and the configuration of the planet Earth, all sections were not surveyed to the desired degree of accuracy. Many sections of land are short or long in measurement. By example, it is impossible for all 40 parcels within a section of land (640 acres) to contain 40 acres each, have 90-degree angles and measure 1,320 feet square. Numerous metes and bounds descriptions appear in deeds assuming such measurements were correct. These boundary discrepancies have caused many disputes. 
Many land owners believe their respective land parcel has been surveyed because it is shown in the City Assessor or County Treasurer's plat book; however, only those land parcels which have been surveyed and recorded as a subdivision plat or certified survey map and filed in the register of deeds office constitute a record survey. 
Although a substantial percentage of the City is presently supported by record surveys and monumentation, there are areas where accurate location of property boundaries is difficult if not impossible. Some land parcels in the City exist only by metes and bounds land description. In the past, some land parcels were surveyed within the City but not recorded as a plat or certified survey map. Many land owners later cannot remember who the surveyor was and cannot recall if they were given a map of the survey. Also many land owners have staked their own property without the benefit of a recorded survey and have caused confusion as a result. Every land parcel within the City should be described and located by a recorded survey map or plat. 
It is essential the parcel be located as described by deed and that buildings and structures, if any, are constructed within the parcel boundaries. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.30.020 - Benefits. 
An assessor's plat survey benefits the property owner. By clarifying boundaries, title determinations are made definite, financing is more easily obtained, transfer of title is readily accomplished, taxation and special assessments are equitably ascertained. The primary advantage to the owner is the confidence his property is accurately located and described, free of any discrepancies which may have existed by reason of a deed description not supported by a survey map or plat of record. 
The distinct advantages of an assessor's plat over other types of surveyed plats or maps are: All property boundary discrepancies are reconciled in entirety within the area covered by the plat; no future problems concerning property boundaries are likely. An assessor's plat survey provides mutual benefits to the individual property owner and the City. 
The City initiates an assessor's plat survey based upon the recommendations of the Director of Public Works (or City Engineer) and the City Assessor. Where an assessor's plat survey is made, the cost attributable to each parcel therein for such survey is substantially less than the cost of surveying each parcel separately. It is reasonable the City share in the cost of the assessor's plat survey, for public works projects and street improvements must be located and constructed within definite property lines. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.30.030 - Who may order. 
Wis. Stats. § 70.27 grants the City authority to order a survey of areas within the City whenever any area of platted or unplatted land is owned by two or more persons in severalty, and when, in the judgment of the Council, the description of one or more of the different parcels thereof cannot be made sufficiently certain and accurate for the purposes of assessment, taxation or tax title procedures without noting the correct metes and bounds of the same, or when such gross errors exist in lot measurements or location that difficulty is encountered in locating new structures, public utilities, or streets. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.30.040 - Assessor's plat survey procedures. 
(a)  The Director of Public Works (or City Engineer) in cooperation with the assessor and Zoning Administrator shall select areas which, in their judgment, require resurveying due to evidence of deed discrepancies, lack of lot staking, or boundary disputes between owners. 
(b)  Their recommendations shall be referred to the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee of the Common Council for discussion. 
(c)  The Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee shall recommend to the Common council those areas, if any, to be surveyed. 
(d)  Upon approval by the Common Council, a date shall be scheduled for a public hearing. A notice of the hearing shall be mailed by certified mail to all owners of record. Where the owners of record cannot be found, the notice shall be mailed to the tenants of the property to be surveyed. 
(e)  The proposed assessor's plat survey project shall be explained by the City officials to those who appear at the hearing. Maps of the areas to be surveyed along with a listing of the property owners and a schedule of estimated special assessment charges shall be available for inspection by any interested person. 
(f)  After report of the Capital Improvements and Street Maintenance Committee and adoption of a final resolution by the Common Council, the assessor's plat survey shall be let under contract to a registered land surveyor, for those Council approved areas. 
(g)  The surveyor making the plat shall survey and lay out the boundaries of each parcel, street, alley, lane, roadway or dedication to public or private use, according to the records of the register of deeds and whatever evidence may be available to show the intent of the buyer and seller. In the chronological order of their conveyance or dedication, he shall set temporary monuments to show the results of such survey and make a map thereof to a scale of not more than 100 feet per inch. The owners of record of lands in the proposed plat shall be notified by registered letter mailed to their last known address, in order that they have opportunity to examine the map, view the temporary monuments, and make known any disagreement with the boundaries as shown by the temporary monuments. It is the duty of the surveyor making the plat to reconcile any discrepancies revealed so the plat, as certified to the governing body, is in conformity with the records of the register of deeds as nearly as is practicable. When boundary lines between adjacent parcels, as evidenced on the ground, are mutually agreed to in writing by the owners of record, such lines shall be the true boundaries for all purposes thereafter, even though they may vary from the descriptions previously of record. Such written agreements shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds for Marathon County. On every assessor's plat, as certified to the governing body, shall appear the volume, page and document number of the metes and bounds description of each parcel as recorded in the office of the register of deeds, which shall be identified with the number or letter by which such parcel is designated on the plat, except that lots which have been conveyed or otherwise acquired but upon which no deed is recorded in the office of the register of deeds may be shown on an assessor's plat and, when so shown, shall contain a full metes and bounds description. (Wis. Stats. § 70.27(5)) 
(h)  The surveyor shall stake all lot corners, for each parcel in the assessor's plat, with iron pipe monuments, after all discrepancies have been reconciled with the property owners involved. 
(i)  After completion of the field survey, the surveyor shall prepare a final map of the assessor's plat and forward it to the state of Wisconsin for approval. 
(j)  When the state of Wisconsin returns the approved assessor's plat map, the City Clerk shall publish a notice in the local newspaper advising the public the plat will be displayed at City Hall for 30 days for public inspection. During this 30-day inspection period, the owner of any parcel within the assessor's plat may file an objection or request for correction with the City Clerk. The Common Council cannot approve the assessor's plat for record until any such objections are satisfied by stipulation of the owners, or judgment of a court of record, should a suit for correction be filed by any owner. 
(k)  Upon completion of the foregoing procedures and final approval of the assessor's plat by the Common Council, the plat shall be delivered to the surveyor in order that he may record it with the register of deeds. A copy of the approved final plat shall be provided by the City through the City Engineer's office to all affected property owners without charge. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.30.050 - Costs of assessor's plat. 
The actual and necessary costs and expenses of making assessors' plats shall be paid by the City, and all or any part of such cost may be charged to the land, without inclusion of improvements, so platted in the proportion that the last assessed valuation of each parcel bears to the last assessed total valuation of all lands included in the assessors' plat, and collected as a special assessment on such land, as provided by Section 66.0703 of the Wisconsin Statutes. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.30.060 - Certified land surveyor responsibilities. 
It is the primary responsibility of the surveyor performing the assessor's plat survey to locate property corners in conformity with record deeds wherever possible. If any property corners or lines located by deed description do not fit existing property improvements, the surveyor must cooperate with the adjoining owners to locate a property line which is acceptable by mutual agreement between them. After completion of the staking of each land parcel, the surveyor prepares an assessor's plat or map of his survey. This plat or map is then recorded in the Marathon County register of deeds office as an official record document after it has been approved by the state of Wisconsin and the City. After recording, each land parcel contained within the plat or map is referred thereafter by a lot number of such plat, notwithstanding some other description on the deed for the parcel. The record deeds are cross referenced on the recorded plat for each parcel surveyed. 
Chapter 59 of the Wisconsin Statutes provides any land surveyor, retained by an individual or corporation to perform a survey, must file a true and correct map or plat of such survey in the office of the county surveyor within 60 days of its completion. Such law also provides that while engaged in surveying, the land surveyor and his assistants shall not be liable for trespass upon any private property, but shall be liable for any actual damage done to the land or property, such as cutting of trees, without the permission of the owner. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
21.30.070 - Property owner responsibilities. 
It is the responsibility of the property owner to protect his lot stakes from disturbance or destruction. Each property owner should, at least annually, check the location and condition of his lot stakes. They are a valuable asset to him when property improvements are made, when the property is sold, or when neighbors make improvements, install fences or request zoning variances. 
(Ord. 61-5217 §1(part), 2003, File No. 02-0413.)  
Chapter 21.32 - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

23.02.74—23.02.79 - Reserved.  
23.02.80 - Overlay zoning districts. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish overlay zoning districts wherein certain additional requirements are superimposed on the underlying standard zoning districts set forth above in this title. Each overlay district is intended to address a special land use circumstance beyond those addressed by the underlying zoning district. Special requirements include protections against natural hazards, protections of valued natural and cultural resources, and guidelines for unique development situations. Any nonconforming situation (lot, use, structure, and/or site) shall adhere to the provisions of article V. 
(2)  How to use sections 23.02.80 to 23.02.93. 
(a)  A given property may lie within one or more overlay zoning district based on its geographic location. The provisions of this article are intended to be consulted before issuance of any building permit, site plan approval, conditional use permit, zoning permit, zoning change, or land division to ensure the intended use meets all of the requirements of any applicable overlay district, in addition to the underlying standard zoning district. For each overlay district established in this article, a definition of the resource or geographic area is provided, followed by the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing the resource or geographic location, the method of delineating the boundaries of the overlay district, and the development regulations. 
(3)  For the purpose of this title, the following overlay zoning districts are hereby established. 
(a)  (PUD) Planned Unit Development Overlay Zoning District. 
(b)  (SW) Shoreland-Wetland Overlay District. 
(c)  (F) Floodplain Overlay District. 
(d)  (W) Well Head Protection Overlay District. 
(e)  (RE) River Edge Overlay District. 
(f)  (WD) Woodland Overlay District. 
(4)  Map of Overlay Zoning Districts. 
(a)  Except where otherwise indicated in this article, the overlay zoning districts are represented on the Official Zoning Map, adopted and from time to time amended by the City of Wausau.  
23.02.81 - Planned Unit Development Overlay Zoning District. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development standards pertaining to the underlying standard zoning district. In exchange for such flexibility, it is anticipated that development within a Planned Unit Development Overlay District will reflect the City's planning policies as set forth in the City's Comprehensive Plan and offer one or more of the following advantages: 
(a)  Positively contribute to the appearance and function of land uses and site design in the area 
(b)  Promote a greater level of architectural quality and be compatible with other structures in the area 
(c)  Conserve and protect environmentally sensitive areas, areas of natural beauty, and natural green spaces 
(d)  Preserve the cultural and historic character and significance of existing structures or areas 
(e)  Provide substantial buffers and transitions between incompatible land uses and densities 
(f)  Reduce congestion on streets and improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation 
(g)  Development would not conflict with or cause overload on such facilities as schools, highways, police, fire, or utility services. 
(h)  Insure proper maintenance and preservation of any common areas for recreation and esthetic enhancement. 
(2)  Intent. Planned Unit Developments are intended to encourage, promote, and provide improved environmental design by allowing for greater freedom, imagination, and flexibility in the development of land, while ensuring substantial compliance with the basic intent of this title and the City of Wausau Comprehensive Plan. To this end, planned unit developments allow diversification and variation in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces, and heights of structures in developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and cohesive unified projects. The Planned Unit Development Overlay District shall allow development to be designed, reviewed, approved, constructed, and managed as approved by the Common Council rather than required by the underlying zoning district. 
(a)  The City may permit flexibility in the types of uses, area and yard requirements, off-street parking, and/or other regulations set forth in this title by use of exceptions/base standard modifications subject to the demonstration of their appropriateness for the area under consideration. 
(b)  It is not intended that the City will automatically grant exceptions/base standard modifications in a Planned Unit Development Overlay District, and it is expected the City will grant only such exceptions when they are consistent and comparable with benefits to the community that result from the Planned Unit Development. 
(c)  The City may require, as conditions of approval, any reasonable stipulation, limitation, or design factor which will promote suitable development in the Planned Unit Development Overlay District. 
(d)  A public hearing process is required to review a request for a Planned Unit Development. This process will essentially combine the process for a Zoning Map Amendment (for the General Development Plan (GDP) Step) with that required for a Conditional Use (for the Specific Implementation Plan (SIP) Step), with several additional requirements. See section 23.10.44 for the General Development Plan and Specific Implementation Plan requirements. 
(3)  Provision of flexible development standards for Planned Unit Developments. 
(a)  Permitted location. 
1.  Planned Unit Developments shall be permitted with the approval of a Planned Unit Development Overlay Zoning District, specific to the approved Planned Unit Development, within all zoning districts. 
(b)  Flexible development standards. 
1.  The following exemptions to the development standards of the underlying zoning district may be provided with the approval of a Planned Unit Development. 
a.  Land use requirements. 
i.  All land uses listed as Residential Land Uses under 23.03.06, Institutional Land Uses under 23.03.12, Mixed-Use Buildings under 23.03.08, or Commercial Land Uses under 23.03.10 in article III may be permitted within a Planned Unit Development. 
b.  Density, intensity, and bulk requirements. 
i.  All requirements listed in article IV, bulk regulations and article II for density, intensity, and bulk regulations within the SR-2, SR-3, SR-5, SR-7, DR-8, TF-10, TDR-12, MRL-12, MRM-20, MRH-50, I, NMU, SO, SMU, UMU, DPMU, DHMU, and DRMU Zoning Districts may be waived within a Planned Unit Development. 
c.  Landscaping requirements. 
i.  All requirements listed in article VIII may be waived within a Planned Unit Development. 
d.  Parking and loading requirements. 
i.  All requirements listed in section 23.06.06 and 23.06.07 may be waived within a Planned Unit Development. 
(4)  Applicability. Locations that may be deemed appropriate for a Planned Unit Development Overlay District include, but are not limited to: 
(a)  Transitional locations that involve a mix of different land uses where new development is proposed in a location of preexisting uses and buildings 
(b)  Infill locations in a developed area that involve parcels that may have been bypassed during the normal course of urbanization or that have been cleared 
(c)  Redevelopment locations where first or subsequent uses and/or structures are to be replaced by new uses and/or structures 
(d)  Development locations where base zoning standards may not be appropriate and/or needed, and where the developer and community will benefit from a greater level of flexibility in land use and bulk controls 
(5)  [Reference for requirements.] See section 23.10.44 for the General Development Plan and Specific Implementation Plan requirements. 
(6)  [Exempt.] Planned Unit Developments are exempt from the requirements of section 23.06.02 Group and Large Developments.  
23.02.82—23.02.89 - Reserved.  
23.02.90 - Shoreland-Wetland Overlay Zoning District. 
(1)  Statutory authorization, findings of fact, statement of purpose and title. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35 and 61.351 for villages or Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 and 62.231 for cities and Wis. Stats. §§ 87.30 and 144.26. 
(b)  Findings of fact and purpose. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipality would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to: 
1.  Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare; 
2.  Maintain the storm and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands; 
3.  Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
4.  Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat; 
5.  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and 
6.  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities.

The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the municipality shall be in full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see 23.02.90(4), for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this ordinance. 
(b)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13), applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.12(4)(a), applies. 
(c)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
1.  This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35, 62.23 or 87.30, which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
2.  This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.

Where a provision of this ordinance is required by a standard in chapter NR 117, Wis. Admin. Code, and where the ordinance provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the chapter NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance. 
(e)  Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected. 
(f)  Annexed areas. The County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effect administered by the municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982 unless any of the changes as allowed by Wis. Stats. § 59.692(7)(a)(1—3) occurs. These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. The County shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the Municipal Zoning Administrator. 
(3)  Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District. 
(a)  Shoreland-Wetland zoning maps. The following maps are hereby adopted and made part of this ordinance and are on file in the office of the Municipal Clerk:

(b)  District Boundaries. 
[1.]  The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the municipality which are five acres or more and are shown on the final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made a part of this ordinance and which are: 
a.  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the municipality shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this ordinance. 
b.  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this ordinance. Floodplain zoning maps adopted in section 23.02.90(3)(a) above shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas. 
2.  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. The following watercourses within the City, which appear as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps, have been found by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to be nonnavigable: 
a.  Bos Creek upstream from Campus Drive; 
b.  Jim Moore Creek upstream east of the SW ¼ of Sec. 18, T29N, R8E. 
3.  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped, is in error. If Department staff concur with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands designated in section 23.02.90(3)(b)4. and (3)(b)5., the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period. 
4.  Filled Wetlands. Wetlands which are filled prior to the date on which the municipality received final wetland inventory maps, in a manner which affects their wetland characteristics to the extent that the area can no longer be defined as wetland, are not subject to this ordinance. 
5.  Wetlands Landward of a Bulkhead Line. Wetlands located between the original ordinary high water mark and a bulkhead line established prior to May 7, 1982 under Wis. Stats. § 30.11 are not subject to this ordinance.

(1)  Statutory authorization, finding of fact, statement of purpose and title. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The zoning ordinance codified in this title is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 and 87.30. 
(b)  Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of the City of Wausau would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
1.  Protect life, health and property; 
2.  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of taxpayers; 
4.  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
6.  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
7.  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
8.  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
9.  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(d)  Title. This title shall be known as the floodplain zoning ordinance for the City of Wausau, Wisconsin. 
(e)  General provisions. 
1.  Areas to be regulated. This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
2.  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the Letter of Map Change process (23.02.91(8)) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Inspections Department, City of Wausau. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
a.  OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on the FIS 55073CV000A and FIS 55073CV000B 
i.  Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55073C0145F, 55073C0378F, 55073C0379F, 55073C0380F, 55073C0382F, 55073C0383F, 55073C0401F, 55073C0402F, and 55073C0412F, dated 07/22/2010; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated 07/22/2010, volume number 55073CV000A. 
ii.  Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 55073C0384G, 55073C0392G, 55073C0403G, 55073C0411G dated September 28, 2018; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 28, 2018, Volume number 55073CV000B. Approved by: The DNR and FEMA 
3.  Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
a.  The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM. 
b.  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM. 
c.  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
4.  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsection a. or b. below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to 23.02.91(8). The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to 23.02.91(7)(c)1.b. and the criteria in a. and b. below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to 23.02.91(8). 
a.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
b.  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
5.  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to 23.02.91(8). 
6.  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
7.  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022, applies. 
8.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
a.  This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; Wis. Stats. § 61.35 for villages; or Wis. Stats. § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
b.  This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. 
9.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Admin. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance. 
10.  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance. 
11.  Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected. 
12.  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Marathon County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Admin. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location. 
(2)  General standards applicable to all floodplain districts. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding. 
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this ordinance and all other requirements in 23.02.91(7)(a)2. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages. 
(a)  Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses. 
1.  No floodplain development shall: 
a.  Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height; or 
b.  Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost. 
2.  The Zoning Administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of 23.02.91(8) are met. 
(b)  Watercourse alterations. No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and FEMA regional offices, and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The standards of 23.02.91(2)(a) must be met and the flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation and pursuant to 23.02.91(8), the community shall apply for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR through the LOMC process. 
(c)  Chapters 30, 31, Wis. Stats., development. Development which requires a permit from the Department, under Wis. Stats. chs. 30 and 31, such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and amendments to the floodplain zoning ordinance are made according to 23.02.91(8).

(xxx)  Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
(yyy)  Unnecessary hardship means where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance.

23.02.92 - Well Head Protection Overlay Zoning District. 
(1)  Purpose. The consequences of certain land use activities, whether intentional or accidental, can seriously impair groundwater quality. The purpose of the well head protection overlay district (WH) is to help protect municipal well groundwater resources from contamination by certain land use activities. This is accomplished by imposing certain land use restrictions upon the area located within the approximate groundwater recharge area of the City municipal wells. The restrictions imposed upon the property within this overlay district are in addition to the regulations governing the underlying residential, commercial, industrial or other zoning districts or any other provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
(2)  General provisions. 
(a)  The regulations established by this overlay district are intended to either prohibit certain land uses that might otherwise be permitted in the underlying zoning districts or to allow certain activities as a conditional use that might otherwise be permitted in the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  The uses prohibited in the well head protection overlay district are activities that, as a result of normal operations or accidents, may impair groundwater quality. These prohibitions are intended to provide a reasonably high degree of assurance that, within the municipal well recharge area, discharges of contaminants into the groundwater supply will be minimized. These preventive measures are important since groundwater clean-up is often prohibitively expensive, and liability for such clean-up is often hard or impossible to establish. 
(c)  The uses prohibited within a well head protection overlay district are prohibited based upon the pollution experience of the individual uses, the operational methods and technology generally employed by that type of use, or the materials or products commonly handled by these uses. As the technology of identified uses changes to nonrisk materials or operational methods, the list of prohibited land uses may be amended to reflect these changes. 
(3)  Establishment of districts. For purposes of minimizing the potential for groundwater contamination in close proximity to the municipal wells, two zoning districts are established: The Well Head Zone A (WH-A) and the Well Head Zone B (WH-B). 
(a)  Zone WH-A is identified as the primary source of water for recharge of the municipal well aquifer and as the area from which groundwater contaminants are most likely to be transmitted to the municipal wells. Zone WH-A is more restrictive than Zone WH-B. 
(b)  Zone WH-B is identified as a secondary source of water for recharge of the municipal wells aquifer and as an area where there is a lower probability of surface contaminants reaching the municipal well fields. Zone WH-B is less restrictive than Zone WH-A. 
(4)  Permitted and prohibited uses. 
(a)  Well Head Zone A (WH-A). All principal and accessory uses which are permitted uses within the underlying zoning districts are permitted within Zone A of the well head protection overlay district except the following uses, which are specifically prohibited and those uses identified as conditional uses in section (5):

42.  Underground petroleum products storage tanks for industrial, commercial, residential or other uses; 
43.  Woodworking and wood products. 
(b)  Well Head Zone B (WH-B). All principal and accessory permitted uses within the underlying zoning districts are permitted within Zone B of the well head protection overlay district except those uses identified as conditional uses in subsection (5) below and underground petroleum products storage tanks for residential use. Said tanks are specifically prohibited in Zone B. 
(5)  Conditional uses. 
(a)  The following conditional uses may be allowed in the WH-A Zone subject to the provisions of section 23.10.32:

(a)  For nonconforming buildings, structures or uses which were nonconforming prior to being designated as part of a well head protection overlay district, the regulations in article V apply. 
(b)  For nonconforming buildings, structures or uses which are made nonconforming through establishment of a well head protection overlay district, the regulations identified in article V also apply; however, these regulations may be modified to meet the particular circumstances surrounding the particular building, structure, or use through the conditional use process as identified in section 23.10.32.  
23.02.93 - River Edge Overlay Zoning District. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the river edge overlay district is to help protect the water quality and scenic resources of the Wisconsin River by reducing soil bank erosion, establishing building setback regulations, and regulating signs near the river's edge. The establishment of this district is intended to help promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the community. 
(2)  General provisions. The restrictions imposed upon property within, and in certain cases adjacent to, the river edge overlay district are in addition to the regulations governing the underlying residential, commercial, industrial or other zoning districts or any other provisions of the Wausau Municipal Code. The river edge overlay district establishes building setback and sign regulations that are generally more stringent than those of the underlying zoning district. 
(3)  Establishment of district. To implement the purpose and general provisions of this title, the RE, river edge overlay district, is established. The area encompassed by this zoning district is located from the ordinary high water mark of the Wisconsin River inland a distance of 50 feet on any property so designated on the City of Wausau zoning map by the Wausau common council. The location of the ordinary high water mark shall be determined by the director of inspections and electrical systems in consultation with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
(4)  Permitted and conditional uses. The provisions of the river edge overlay district do not affect the underlying permitted or conditional uses which are allowed in the respective underlying zoning districts nor the other regulations governing land use in those districts except as specifically described herein. Only those uses which are allowed in the underlying zoning district as a permitted or conditional use may be considered for establishment within the RE district. 
(7)  Yard requirements. No building may be constructed nor may an existing building be expanded within the river edge overlay district unless the construction or expansion activity is approved following a public hearing before the City plan commission and in accordance with section 23.10.32 of the Zoning Code governing conditional uses. 
(5)  Nonconforming buildings and uses. Any lawfully existing building, structure or use which does not conform to the regulations of a mapped river edge overlay district may be continued subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  For nonconforming buildings, structures or uses which were nonconforming prior to being designated as part of a river edge overlay district, the regulations of article V apply. 
(b)  For nonconforming buildings, structures or uses which are made nonconforming through establishment of a river edge overlay district, the regulations identified in article V also apply; however, these regulations may be modified to meet the particular circumstances surrounding the particular building, structure or use through the conditional use process as identified in Section 23.10.32.  
23.02.94 - Woodland Overlay Zoning District. 
(1)  Purpose of woodland protection requirements: Woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions. These include atmospheric benefits such as removing air-borne pollutants, carbon dioxide uptake, oxygen production, and evapotranspiration returns. Water quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates (particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus) and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and velocities. Woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources. Woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers, greatly reducing runoff-related soil erosion. Woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities which further reduces soil erosion. Finally, under proper management techniques, woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources. 
(2)  Definition: Woodlands are areas of trees whose combined canopies cover a minimum of 70 percent of an area of one acre or more, as shown on the most recent available air photos for the City of Wausau and its environs. Woodlands shall not include tree lines, tree farms, or orchards. 
(3)  Determination of woodland boundaries: Upon the proposal of development activity on any property as part of an annexation, conceptual land division, annexation, site plan, or general development plan, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of section 23.10.42. This analysis shall depict the location of all woodland areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of subsection (2), above. 
(4)  Mandatory woodland protection requirements: Woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the following activities: 
(a)  Removal of dead, dying, damaged, or diseased trees. 
(b)  Vegetation management, including removal of invasive species. 
(c)  Any Passive Outdoor Recreation land use. 
(d)  The cutting of up to 30 percent of the woodland area as approved on a site plan, general development plan, preliminary plat, or certified survey map. 
1.  Cutting over 30 percent of the woodland area can be exceeded in some instances with the approval of a conditional use permit or Planned Unit Development.  
23.02.95—23.02.99 - Reserved.  
ARTICLE III. - LAND USE REGULATIONS 
 
23.03.01 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to indicate which land uses may locate in each zoning district and under what requirements; and which land uses may not locate therein. Certain land uses may locate in a given district as a matter of right upon compliance with special regulations for such a land use. A further distinction is made for land uses which may locate in a given district only upon obtaining a conditional use or temporary use permit.  
23.03.02 - Regulation of allowable uses. 
The allowable land uses for each zoning district are established in article II of this title. Detailed descriptions and regulations for uses are found in sections 23.03.06 through 23.03.30. Even if a land use may be indicated as permitted by right or requiring a conditional use in a particular district, such a land use may not necessarily be permitted or permissible on any or every property in such district. No land use is permitted or permissible on a property unless it can be located on it or implemented in full compliance with all of the applicable standards and regulations of this title or unless an appropriate variance has been granted pursuant to section 23.10.51. For land uses not specifically listed, the Zoning Administrator shall make an interpretation to identify a comparable use or determine if an amendment to this title is necessary. 
(1)  Principal land uses permitted by right. Principal land uses listed as permitted by right (designated by the letter "P" in section 23.03.05) are permitted per the general land use requirements of this article; per the density, intensity, and bulk regulations of the specific zoning district in which they are located; per any additional requirements imposed by applicable overlay districts; per all other applicable requirements of this title; and per any and all other applicable City, county, state, and federal regulations.

(a)  Findings. The Common Council of the City of Wausau hereby finds as follows: 
1.  The location, siting, design, construction and use of adult-oriented entertainment businesses can have adverse impacts on the surrounding area. 
2.  Adult-oriented entertainment businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of worship, children attending licensed daycare homes, persons using public parks, and children and other persons attending public schools. 
3.  Adult-oriented entertainment businesses can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area where such businesses are located, taxing local law enforcement services. 
4.  Adult-oriented entertainment businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the value of the residential housing in the area in which such businesses are located. 
5.  The concentration of adult-oriented entertainment businesses in one area can have a substantially detrimental effect on the area in which such businesses are concentrated and on the overall quality of urban life.

(5)  On-site connections. The entire development shall provide walkways for full and safe pedestrian and bicycle access within the development. 
(a)  Walkways shall provide pedestrian access through or around off-street parking areas from street sidewalks to building entries. Walkways shall be located and aligned to directly and continuously connect areas or points of pedestrian origin and destination, and walkways shall not be located and aligned solely based on the outline of a parking lot configuration unless such configuration allows for direct pedestrian access. 
(b)  Design requirements. 
1.  Walkways shall have an acceptable dust-free surface not less than five feet in width and shall be grade-separated from the parking lot or otherwise delineated with pavement markers, planters, or alternate paving materials. 
2.  The entirety of the on-site pedestrian walkway system shall be marked and defined using pavement treatments, signs, lighting, median refuge areas, and landscaping as appropriate and as consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the building code, as approved by the Zoning Administrator. 
3.  Where the pedestrian walkway crosses drive aisles or internal roadways, the pedestrian crossing shall emphasize and place priority on pedestrian access and safety. 
4.  The material and layout of the pedestrian walkway shall be continuous as the pedestrian access crosses the driveway, with a break in continuity of the driveway paving and not in the pedestrian access way.  
23.06.05 - Visibility standards. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of public and private rights-of-way so as to promote the safety and general welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for the provision of vehicular visibility. 
(2)  Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to all new development or redevelopment. 
(3)  Review and approval. Through the site plan review process (see section 23.10.42), the Zoning Administrator, shall review and approve all development for conformance with this section. 
(4)  Vision triangle at public streets. A vision triangle extending 20 feet from all public street right-of-way intersections shall be maintained for local street intersections and 30 feet when the intersection includes collector or arterial streets. If the street intersection is curved, the vision triangle distance shall be maintained as if the right-of-way where extended to create a 90 degree corner. No wall, fence, structure, utility structure or appurtenance, or vegetation shall be permitted within such vision triangle which materially impedes vision between the height of two and one-half feet and eight feet with the exception of fencing, which shall be no greater than 30 percent opaque. Development in the DPMU, DHMU, and DRMU Districts and developments located on streets with signalized intersections shall be exempt from this requirement. 
(5)  Vision triangle at alleys and driveways. A vision triangle extending ten feet from alleys and driveways shall be maintained. No wall, fence, structure, utility structure or appurtenance, or vegetation shall be permitted within such vision triangle which materially impedes vision between the height of two and one-half feet and eight feet. Development in the CMU District shall be exempt from this requirement.

10.  Other facilities proposed. 
(5)  Minimum number of required off-street parking spaces. 
(a)  Off-street parking requirements for each land use are generally tied to the use's capacity and gross floor area or the number of employees at the subject property during the largest work shift. 
1.  The term "capacity" means the maximum number of persons that may be accommodated by the use as determined by its design or by state building code regulations, whichever number is greater. 
2.  The term "employees on the largest work shift." means the maximum number of employees working at the facility during a single given day, regardless of the time period during which this occurs, and regardless of whether any such person is a full-time employee. The largest work shift. may occur on any particular day of the week or during a lunch or dinner period in the case of a restaurant. 
3.  The term "gross floor area" shall mean the total floor area inside the building envelope on all levels of a building. 
(b)  A garage stall shall be considered a parking space. 
(c)  One reserved parking space shall be provided for each service vehicle used by the operation during business hours. 
(d)  See Figure 23.06.06a for a summary of the number of parking spaces required by land use. 
(6)  Parking requirement exceptions in the DHMU and DRMU Districts. 
(a)  Within the DHMU and DRMU Districts, the parking requirements of this title are hereby waived. However, when off-street parking facilities are provided, such facilities shall meet the requirements of this title, except in respect to the required number of spaces. Residential uses need only provide evidence of the availability of off-street public or private parking in the amount of one parking space per dwelling unit within 1,000 feet of the unit. 
(7)  Parking requirement modification in the NMU and UMU Districts. 
(a)  Within the NMU and UMUM Districts, the parking requirements listed in Figure 23.06.06a can be reduced by up to 50 percent as determined by the Plan Commission through a conditional use permit, planned development, or site plan review.

(8)  Limit on the number of off-street parking spaces provided. No site plan may be approved for a multi-family or nonresidential use which contains more than 125 percent of the development's minimum number of required parking spaces, except as granted through a conditional use permit. (See Figure 23.06.06a for a summary of the minimum and maximum parking requirements by land use.) Consideration of the following factors shall be given in considering a conditional use permit request: 
(a)  This provision shall not apply to lots in which less than 25 parking spaces are required. 
(b)  The proposed development has unique or unusual characteristics (such as high sales volume or low parking turnover) which creates a parking demand that exceeds the maximum ratio and does not typically apply to comparable uses. 
(c)  The lot is designed to allow for more intensive future site development. 
(d)  Pedestrian and bicycle connectivity is provided through the lot and connects to adjacent local and regional transit, pedestrian, and bicycle facilities. 
(e)  The need for additional parking cannot be reasonably met through provision of on-street or shared parking with nearby uses. 
(9)  Parking studies. The Zoning Administrator has the ability to require a parking study to determine parking requirements. Where a parking study is required, the study shall contain information on the anticipated number of employees, customers, visitors, clients, shifts, events, or deliveries to the use, and may refer to other studies or similar situations elsewhere. 
(10)  Screening requirements. The following requirements shall apply to all uncovered parking areas except as otherwise provided for by this section: 
(a)  Off-street parking areas abutting a public street. 
1.  Any off-street parking area shall provide a minimum five-foot green area in the front yard setback between the lot line and the paved surface of the parking lot. Plant material shall consist of evergreen and deciduous species. The green area shall be well maintained and plantings shall be promptly replaced if dead or diseased. 
2.  Non-planted areas of this green area shall not be paved, but shall either be covered with a weed barrier and mulch, planted with ground cover, or both. 
(b)  Off-street parking areas abutting residential districts. Any off-street parking area shall provide a solid fence, solid wall, or dense hedge/evergreen shrub border at least five feet high and not more than eight feet in height along all lot lines abutting a residential district, except in required front yards. Where the parking area abuts an alley, a five-foot green area, as required in subsection (a)1., above, may be substituted for the required fence, wall, or hedge. 
(c)  Off-street parking areas abutting other off-street parking areas. 
1.  Except for single family and two family dwelling units, any off-street parking area abutting another off-street parking area shall provide a five-foot minimum green area between the lot line and the parking area. This green area shall be landscaped with a combination of shrubs, trees, and ground cover. 
2.  Where either or both adjoining properties are less than 60 feet in width, parking areas on either property which is less than 60 feet in width may be constructed to the lot line without a parking area setback or green area required. 
(d)  Landscaping used to meet these requirements shall count toward the landscaping required for paved areas in article VIII. 
(11)  Locational prohibitions for off-street parking areas. 
(a)  On a lot containing a single family or two family dwelling unit, off-street parking shall not be located between the principal structure and a street right-of-way, except within residential driveways leading to a legal parking space. 
(b)  No private parking shall occur on street terraces, publicly-owned driveways, or any other areas located within a public right-of-way. 
(c)  In any waterfront yard, parking is prohibited. 
(12)  Setbacks. 
(a)  The distance from an off-street parking area to the property line of an abutting property shall meet the required setbacks for principal buildings. Distances vary by zoning district. See article II for each district's distances. 
(b)  Existing parking areas that do not meet the requirements of this title may be maintained or repaired at their setback as of the effective date of this title. 
(13)  Parking space design for single and two family uses. 
(a)  Legal spaces. 
1.  Parking spaces must be provided either within a garage, in a driveway, or as uncovered parking spaces meeting the requirements of this section. See Figures 23.06.06b and 23.06.06c. 
Figure 23.06.06b: Covered Parking Requirements   
Figure 23.06.06c: Uncovered Parking Requirements   
 
2.  Driveway parking spaces. Driveways may be used for parking only when said driveway leads to legal parking stalls. A driveway parking space may be used for no more than one required parking space, provided that the space is at least eight feet wide and 18 feet deep. 
3.  Uncovered parking spaces (not located in driveways). 
a.  No more than four uncovered parking spaces shall be permitted per lot. Where no garage is provided, a shed shall be provided per the requirements of section 23.03.06(1)(d), section 23.03.06(5)(d), section 23.03.06(6)(d), and section 23.03.06(7)(d). 
b.  Uncovered parking spaces shall meet principal structure setbacks and shall be screened per section 23.06.06(10). See Figures 23.06.06d and 23.06.06e. 
c.  Uncovered parking spaces shall be surfaced in accordance with this title within 365 days of building permit issuance. If not dust-free during the permitted 365 days, a minimum aggregate base of four inches is required. Uncovered parking spaces shall follow the surfacing requirements of section 23.06.06(20). 
d.  On interior lots, one uncovered parking space is permitted alongside a garage provided said space is not located between the building and the street or the building and the rear lot line and provided said space meets the side setbacks for accessory structures established in article II. Parking spaces must be screened from view per section 23.06.06(10). See Figure 23.06.06d. 
e.  On corner lots, one uncovered parking space is permitted alongside the garage provided said space is not located between the building and the street and provided said space meets the side setbacks for accessory structures established in article II. Parking spaces must be screened from view per section 23.06.06(10). See Figure 23.06.06e. 
(b)  Lots shall not exceed maximum the impervious surface ratio for the applicable zoning district. 
(c)  If no garage is provided, each dwelling unit shall provide one shed of no less than 80 square feet in order to store yard maintenance equipment or other items typically stored in a garage.

(14)  [Parking space design.] Parking space design for residential uses served by individual driveways (single-family detached, twin house, duplex, townhouse, and some multi-plex's) are regulated as follows: 
(a)  Driveway parking spaces. 
1.  Driveways shall be considered legal, "stacked" (meaning in front of one another) parking spaces for all required stalls. A driveway parking space need not lead to a legal parking space. 
2.  Required parking spaces may be located in a driveway and/or in a garage. There shall be no limit on the number of driveway spaces, provided that each space is at least eight feet wide and 18 feet deep. 
(b)  Off-street parking spaces on small lots may be stacked for the same building unit. 
(c)  Except for driveways leading to legal parking spaces, parking is not permitted in the front yard. 
(d)  Driveway parking spaces are permitted with the following setbacks: 
1.  Front yard setback: no less than the setback of the front façade of the principal structure. 
2.  Side yard setback between the front and rear façades of the principal structure: no less than six inches. 
(e)  Rear yard parking spaces are permitted with the following setbacks: 
1.  Side yard setback past the rear façade of the principal structure and the rear lot line: per the side setbacks for accessory structures established in article II. 
2.  Rear yard setback: per the rear setbacks for accessory structures established in article II. 
(f)  Uncovered parking spaces situated beyond the rear façade of the principal structure must be screened with a minimum of five-foot tall vegetation, solid fencing, or other material that creates a solid screen, impervious to sight from adjacent properties, excluding views from the side of the lot where access is provided. 
(g)  Uncovered parking spaces shall follow the surfacing requirements of section 23.06.06(20). Uncovered parking spaces shall be constructed in accordance with this title within 365 days of construction. If not dust-free during the permitted 365 days, a minimum aggregate base of four inches is required. 
(15)  Off-street parking and traffic circulation standards for multi-family and nonresidential uses. 
(a)  Circulation. The site shall be designed to provide for the safe and efficient movement of all traffic entering, exiting, and circulating on the site. Circulation patterns shall conform to the general rules of the road. All traffic control measures shall meet the requirements of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(b)  Surfacing. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall follow the surfacing requirements section 23.06.06(20). 
(c)  Drainage. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall be designed in such a manner so as to not have a negative surface water drainage impact on adjacent properties and to meet the requirements of title 15.56 of the City of Wausau Municipal Code. 
(d)  Marking. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall be marked, striped, and maintained in a clear and visible manner which clearly indicates parking spaces, pedestrian walkways, and other designated areas. 
(e)  Curbing. A minimum six-inch-high curb shall be installed around all parking areas and internal landscape islands, except as follows: 
1.  Where bio-filtration and/or bio-retention methods of stormwater management are utilized as part of an approved grading and drainage plan, alternatives to the installation of curbing may be considered by the Engineering Department, provided that measures are taken to protect the landscaping from vehicular circulation damage. 
2.  For industrial uses within industrial zoning districts, curbing is only required adjacent to buildings, planting islands, required front yards, and where necessary to prevent any part of a vehicle from extending over or beyond any pedestrian paths or rights-of-way. 
(f)  Access. 
1.  Each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway that is wide enough to provide a safe and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking space without directly backing or maneuvering a vehicle into any pedestrian way or arterial or collector street. 
a.  Parking, loading, and traffic circulation areas serving less than six parking spaces may back into local streets, but shall not back into collector or arterial streets. Refer to the traffic control requirements of section 23.06.06. 
2.  All off-street parking and traffic circulation facilities shall be designed with an appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley, in a manner which least interferes with traffic movements. 
3.  No driveway across public property or requiring a curb cut shall exceed a width of 40 feet at the property line. 
(g)  Lighting. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas serving six or more cars shall be lit to ensure their safe and efficient use during evening hours. An illumination level between 0.4 and 1.0 foot-candles is recommended but shall not exceed the standards of section 23.06.21. 
(h)  Signage. All signage located within, or related to, required off-street parking or traffic circulation shall comply with the requirements of article IX. 
(i)  Landscaping and screening. Parking lots shall meet the screening requirements of sections 23.06.06(10). Landscaping used to meet this requirement shall count toward the landscaping required for paved areas in article VIII. 
(j)  Minimum permitted throat length. 
1.  Refer to Figure 23.06.06f below to determine the minimum permitted throat length of access drives serving parking lots as measured from the right-of-way line along the centerline of the access drive. 
2.  In no case shall the throat length be less than the required setback.

(d)  Design theme. The design theme for the Downtown Historic Mixed-Use District is based on its historical, pedestrian-oriented development pattern that incorporates retail, residential, and institutional uses. Building orientation and character includes minimum setbacks at the edge of the sidewalk, multi-story structures, use of alleys for access, and on-street or other off-site parking. The design theme is characterized by a variety of architectural styles popular at the time, including Italianate, Romanesque, and Neoclassical, in a two- or three-story format with office, storage, or residential located over commercial. The façades of these buildings have a traditional main street storefront appearance, are relatively small in scale, have street yard and side yard setbacks of zero feet, have prominent horizontal and vertical patterns formed by regularly spaced window and door openings, detailed cornice designs, rich detailing in masonry coursing, window detailing and ornamentation, and are predominately brick, stone, or wood. Exterior building materials are of high quality. Exterior appurtenances are minimal. Exterior colors are harmonious, simple, and muted. Exterior signage blends, rather than contrasts, with buildings in terms of coloring (complementary to building), location (on-building), size (small), and number (few).

23.08.21—23.08.29 - Reserved.  
23.08.30 - Landscaping requirements. 
Landscaping shall be provided based on the following requirements for building foundations, paved areas, street frontages, yards, and bufferyards. 
(1)  Building foundations. 
(a)  For every 100 linear feet of building foundation, the landscaping installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 23.08.30d. 
(b)  Tall trees shall not be used to meet building foundation landscaping requirements. 
(c)  Building foundation landscaping shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip line is located within ten feet of the building foundation. 
(d)  Building expansions shall be subject to the same landscaping formula requirements as new buildings (see Figure 23.08.30d). The formula shall not be applied to portions of the building foundation developed prior to the adoption of this ordinance. 
(e)  The measurement of the building foundation may be simplified as the smallest single rectangle that contains the entire building perimeter, except that the sides of the building facing an adjacent public street, where the actual perimeter shall be measured. 
(2)  Paved areas. 
(a)  For every ten off-street parking stalls or 10,000 square feet of pavement (whichever yields the greater landscaping requirement), landscaping shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 23.08.30d. 
(b)  Paved area landscaping shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip line is located within ten feet of the paved area. Said area does not have to be provided in one contiguous area. Plants used to fulfill this requirement shall visually screen parking, loading, and circulation areas from view from public streets. 
(c)  A minimum of 30 percent of all points shall be devoted to medium or tall trees, or a combination of such trees, and a minimum of 40 percent of all points shall be devoted to shrubs. 
(d)  Parking lot design. 
1.  Interior parking lot landscaping shall be required for any parking lot with more than 20 parking spaces. Internal parking lot landscaping shall be accomplished by the installation of landscaped planter islands or other types of landscaping application approved by the Zoning Administrator. 
2.  Landscaped planter islands shall be required at the ends of all parking rows, driveway entrances, and at intermediate locations such that there is a maximum of 180 feet between islands. See Figure 23.08.30a. 
a.  Landscaped planter islands are required where two rows of parking stalls meet at a right angle. See Figure 23.08.30b. 
Figure 23.08.30a: Requirements for Islands 
 
  
Figure 23.08.30b: Parking Rows at Right Angles 
 
3.  Each landscaped planter island shall be no less than 125 square feet in area and seven feet in width, measured from the back of the curb. For double-parking rows, each landscaped planter island shall be no less than 250 square feet in area. The seven-foot width requirement may be reduced to accommodate the triangular shape resulting from angled parking. 
a.  Exception. A continuous seven-foot wide landscape strip may be provided between double parking rows in place of landscaped planter islands. 
b.  See Figure 23.08.30c. 
Figure 23.08.30c: Interior Landscaping 
 
4.  All islands shall be crowned for positive drainage, unless bio-retention methods of stormwater management are utilized per a stormwater management plan approved by the Department of Public Works. 
5.  One shade tree or tall deciduous tree shall be provided for every island and for every 40 linear feet of continuous landscape strip. Medium or low trees (evergreen or deciduous) may be used to supplement deciduous shade trees in locations that may not support healthy shade tree or tall deciduous tree growth. This determination shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. For double-row parking, two shade trees or tall deciduous trees shall be required for each island. 
a.  Trees shall be a minimum of two inches in caliper and not less than six feet tall at planting. 
b.  Shrubs shall be a minimum of 18 inches at planting. 
6.  In addition to the required trees and shrubs, islands shall be planted with grass, low ground cover, shrubs, flowers, decorative stone/river rock, mulch, or a combination thereof. Mulches and decorative stone shall be installed so that the loose material will not erode, fall, be plowed, or be otherwise transported onto paved surfaces. 
7.  To ensure proper visibility within the parking lot, shrubs shall be no higher than two feet and the branches of trees shall start no less than six feet from the ground, unless located in areas that do not affect driver visibility. 
(e)  Parking lot screening required by section 23.06.06(10) shall count toward the landscaping requirements of this section. 
(f)  Paved area expansions shall be subject to the same landscaping formula requirements as new paved areas (see 23.08.30d). The formula shall not be applied to paved areas developed prior to the adoption of this ordinance. 
(3)  Street frontages. 
(a)  For every 100 linear feet of street frontage of a developed lot abutting a public street right-of-way, the landscaping installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 23.08.30d. 
(b)  Street frontage landscaping shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip line is located within ten feet of the public street right-of-way. 
(c)  Landscaping shall not be located within a public right-of-way. Landscaping shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian visibility. See section 23.06.05. 
(d)  A minimum of 50 percent of all points shall be devoted to decorative or medium trees, or a combination of such trees. 
(e)  In the case of any new principal building, building expansion, new paved area, or paved area expansion on a previously-developed site, a percentage of the landscaping points specified in Figure 23.08.30d shall be required. For new paved areas and expansions, the required percentage shall be equal to the percentage of the paved area expansion as compared to the existing paved area square footage. For new buildings and expansions, the required percentage shall be the percentage of the building expansion as compared to the existing building square footage. 
(4)  Yards. 
(a)  For every 1,000 square feet of gross floor area of all principal and accessory buildings on the site, the landscaping installed shall at a minimum meet the number of landscaping points specified in Figure 23.08.30d. 
(b)  Landscaping required by this section is most effective if located away from other areas required for landscaping such as building foundations, street frontages, paved areas, protected green space areas, or bufferyards. 
(c)  The intent of this section is to provide yard shade and to require a visual screen of a minimum of six feet in height for all detached exterior appurtenances (such as HVAC, utility boxes, standpipes, stormwater discharge pipes and other pipes). 
(d)  Building expansions shall be subject to the same landscaping formula requirements as new buildings (see Figure 23.08.30d). The formula shall not be applied to portions of buildings developed prior to the adoption of this ordinance. 
(5)  Bufferyards. A bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier. It includes an area, together with the combination of plantings, berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances (e.g. dirt, litter, noise, glare, signs, and incompatible land uses, buildings, or parking areas). 
(a)  The required level of bufferyard opacity is listed in Figure 23.08.30e. Detailed bufferyard requirements are listed in Figure 23.08.30f. Opacity is a quantitatively-derived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the abutting property. The required level of opacity indicated is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts. 
(b)  Bufferyards shall be located along (and within) the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another. Bufferyards shall not be required in front yards or along public street frontages. 
(c)  To ensure that the year-round screening objectives are fulfilled, only the plant classifications in Figure 23.08.40b listed as "Appropriate for Screening" shall count toward bufferyard point totals, unless non-screening plants are used in combination with a solid fence or a berm of six feet or more, in accordance with Figure 23.08.30f. 
(d)  Reduction of required bufferyard width. 
1.  Intent. This subsection is intended to allow for the reduction of the required width of a required bufferyard where the presence of permanently protected green space or similar areas provides equivalent permanent screening and separation benefits as would be provided by the otherwise required bufferyard. 
2.  Where the minimum permitted width for the required bufferyard is not available under the current or proposed state of development, the Zoning Administrator, may reduce the width required for the bufferyard to that currently available on the site, provided that the portion of the site that requires a bufferyard contains one or more of the following: 
a.  Steep slopes that contain retaining walls or rip-rap. 
b.  Permanently undevelopable green space or other permanently protected green space designated on site plans such as a native or restored prairies or park savannas, wetlands, bodies of water, floodplains, drainageways, upland woods, stormwater basins, or other natural resource protection areas, including areas protected by covenants or conversation easements. 
3.  If there is permanently protected green space located on an adjoining property adjacent to the portion of a site that requires a bufferyard, the Zoning Administrator, may reduce the width required for the bufferyard. The reduction shall consist of no more than one foot for every three feet of permanently protected green space on the adjoining property, as measured from the property line at a right angle into said adjacent property. There shall be no reduction in the number of landscape points required. 
(e)  Use of required bufferyard and landscaped areas. 
1.  Any and all required bufferyards or landscaped areas may be used for passive recreation activities. Said areas may contain pedestrian or bike trails provided that no required landscaping material is eliminated; the total width of the required bufferyard, or the total area of required landscaping, is maintained; and all other regulations of this title are met. 
2.  No swimming pools, tennis courts, sports fields, golf courses, or other such similar active recreational uses shall be permitted. 
3.  No parking, buildings, outdoor light fixtures, and no outdoor display of storage of materials shall be permitted. 
4.  Paving in such areas shall be limited to that required for necessary access to or across the subject property or for a passive recreational use such as paved multiuse trails or pedestrian walkways. 
(6)  Determination of landscaping requirements. 
(a)  The requirements of this article are additive to each other and any other landscaping or screening requirements in this title. 
(b)  Landscape points used to meet one requirement (e.g. building foundations, paved areas, street frontages, yards, or bufferyards) shall not be used to meet another requirement. 
(7)  Measurement and calculation. 
(a)  Landscaping point values shall be doubled for mature existing landscape plantings that are retained and protected with the development of the site. Existing plantings eligible for double point values shall be determined by the City's Urban Forestry staff. 
(b)  In calculating the number of required landscaping points under the provisions of this section, all areas and distances on which required calculations are based shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of square feet or linear feet. 
(c)  Any partial plant derived from the required calculations of this section (for example: 23.3 shade trees) shall be rounded up to the next whole plant (for example: 24 shade trees). 
(8)  Utility easements. Landscaping materials, fences and berms located within a duly recorded utility, stormwater, or a pedestrian easement shall not count toward meeting a landscaping requirement, unless authorized otherwise by the City and the easement holder. However, the width of such areas may be counted as part of a landscaping width requirement for bufferyards. 
(9)  Other green space areas. Green space areas not used for landscape plantings other than natural resource protection areas shall be graded and seeded or sodded with an acceptable maintainable seed mix, restored to native vegetation. Alternatively, such areas may be maintained in crop production if a principal use exists on-site and if approved by the Zoning Administrator.

Species suitable for landscaping and compatible with local climate and soil factors are listed in Figure 23.08.40a. Plant species native to Wisconsin are noted by an asterisk (*). This list is not intended to be exhaustive, and the Zoning Administrator, shall review proposals for the applicability of species not listed and is authorized to approve appropriate similar species. See Figure 23.08.40b for species appropriate for specific and common landscaping situations (e.g., planting under power lines), and Figure 23.08.40c for a list of species to use sparingly or to avoid.

1 " Species to Use Sparingly" may be used as part of an overall landscaping plan, but only if the number of individual plants does not constitute more than 1 plant per 20 total plants within the same plant classification. For example, if a landscaping plan includes a total of 20 Tall Deciduous Trees, no more than 1 of those 20 trees may be classified as a "Species to Use Sparingly." The purpose of this provision is to encourage plant species diversity throughout the City. 
2 " Prohibited Species" shall not be included as part of any landscaping plan that is subject to City review per section 23.08.20. The purpose of this provision is to limit the planting of species that are invasive, have invasive tendencies, or that may perpetuate or spread disease. 
  
23.08.41—23.08.49 - Reserved.  
23.08.50 - Standards for rain gardens and bioswales. 
(1)  Definition. 
(a)  Rain gardens can serve both as landscaping and stormwater management features on a building site, where appropriately designed and sited. A rain garden is a shallow, depressed garden that is designed and positioned on a site to capture stormwater runoff and allow for the infiltration of water back into the ground. Rain garden plants are carefully chosen for their ability to withstand moisture extremes and potentially high concentrations of nutrients and sediments that are often found in stormwater runoff. A well designed and maintained rain garden serves as an attractive component of an overall landscaping plan for a development site. 
(b)  Bioswales can serve both as landscaping and stormwater management features on a building site, where appropriately designed and sited. A bioswale is a linear, vegetative stormwater runoff conveyance system that is designed to store and infiltrate water from small storm events back into the ground and direct water from heavy rain events to appropriate storm sewer inlets or other management facilities. The flow of water being conveyed through a bioswale is slowed down, allowing for municipal storm systems to more effectively manage heavier rain events and help reduce the risk of flooding on or off-site. Water being infiltrated or conveyed via a bioswale is also filtered by the vegetation within it, generally improving both ground and surface water quality. 
(2)  Requirements. 
(a)  The installation of a rain garden or bioswale may contribute to the overall stormwater management plan for a development site and count toward meeting the City's landscaping guidelines. Rain gardens and bioswales may count for 20 points for every 20 square feet for yard, building foundation, and/or paved area requirements, provided the following requirements are met. Rain gardens and bioswales shall count for no more than 100 points of the required landscaping per site. 
(b)  Detailed plans shall be provided that show all proposed dimensions of the rain garden or bioswale including length, width, depth, and slope of depression; location of the rain garden or bioswale on the lot relative to hard-surfaced areas, downspouts, and site topography; characteristics of the soil underlying the rain garden or bioswale; description of planting media; the species, number, and size at time of installation of all vegetation proposed for the rain garden or bioswale; and information on any other materials that will be used to line the rain garden or bioswale. 
(c)  Installation shall not be proposed for any of the following areas of a site: 
1.  Areas where there is known soil contamination unless the rain garden or bioswale is proposed to be constructed with an under-drain; 
2.  Areas where the characteristics of the soil would not allow for the proper infiltration of water into the ground; or 
3.  Areas where there are expected to be high levels of foot traffic, unless such areas are protected from foot traffic. 
(d)  The owner of the site shall demonstrate that the rain garden or bioswale is properly maintained, specifically: kept free of trash, weeds, debris, and dead or dying plants; any pipes associated with the rain garden or bioswale will be inspected on an annual basis and kept free of debris; and by the beginning of every spring dead plant materials will be cut back or removed. 
(e)  Bioswales and rain gardens shall be generously (and appropriately) vegetated to qualify for landscaping points. If bioswales and rain gardens (or portions thereof) are lined with turf but do not include other vegetation, then they will not count toward meeting landscaping point requirements. 
(f)  Rain gardens and bioswales may serve as a component of an overall stormwater management plan for a site only if detailed plans, calculations, and specifications are submitted and approved by the Department of Public Works. Detailed plans shall include the location and description of all other stormwater management facilities serving the site, particularly those to which any bioswale will be directed.  
23.08.51—23.08.59 - Reserved.  
23.08.60 - Installation requirements. 
(1)  Installation. Any and all landscaping and bufferyard material required by the provisions of this title shall be installed on the subject property, in accordance with the approved site plan within 365 days of the issuance of an occupancy permit for any building on the subject property. 
(2)  If existing plant material meets the requirements of this article and will be preserved on the subject property following the completion of development, it may be counted as contributing to the landscaping requirements and worth double the landscaping point value per plant. 
(3)  All landscaping and bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn or native ground cover unless such vegetation is already fully established. 
(4)  The exact placement of plants and structures shall be depicted on the required detailed landscaping plan submitted to the City for its approval. Such plant and structure location shall be the decision of each property owner provided the following requirements are met: 
(a)  Evergreen shrubs shall be planted in clusters to maximize their chance for survival. 
(b)  Where a combination of plant materials, berming, and fencing is used in a bufferyard, the fence and/or berm may be located toward the interior or exterior of the subject property and at least 50 percent of the required landscaping points shall be located toward the exterior of the subject property. 
(c)  A property owner may establish through a written agreement, recorded with the Register of Deeds that an abutting property owner agrees to provide on the immediately abutting portion of his or her land a partial or full portion of the required bufferyard, thereby relieving the developer of the responsibility of providing the entire bufferyard on his property. Responsibility for maintenance of bufferyard landscaping shall be included as part of this agreement. 
(d)  Under no circumstance shall landscaping or bufferyard materials be selected or located in a manner resulting in the creation of a safety or visibility hazard. 
(e)  The restrictions on types of plants listed in this article shall apply. 
(5)  Upon completion of the approved landscape improvements, a certification of compliance shall also be submitted by the owner or agent. 
(6)  Maintenance. 
(a)  The continual maintenance of all required landscaping and bufferyard materials shall be a requirement of this title and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which said materials and plants are required. This requirement shall run with the property and shall be binding upon all future property owners. Development of any or all property following the effective date of this title shall constitute an agreement by the property owner to comply with the provisions of this section. 
(b)  The owner of the premises shall be responsible for the watering, maintenance, repair, and replacement of all landscaping, fences, and other landscape architectural features on the site. All planting beds shall be kept weed-free. Plant material which has died shall be replaced with equivalent vegetation within 12 months.

ARTICLE IX - SIGNAGE 
 
23.09.01 - Purpose. 
(1)  The purpose of this title is to establish standards for the fabrication, erection, and use of signs, and to regulate the location, type, size, and height of signage for all properties within the City of Wausau. The adoption of this title reflects the formal finding of fact by the City of Wausau Plan Commission and Common Council that regulation of signage advances the following compelling governmental interests: 
(a)  Reduce signage that the City has determined to be a cause of unsafe traffic and visibility conditions for pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and passengers. 
(b)  Protect pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and passengers from injury caused by the faulty and uncontrolled construction and use of signs within the City. 
(c)  Protect pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and passengers from injury caused by distractions, obstructions, and hazards created by certain signs or by cluttered, distracting, or illegible signage. 
(d)  Promote the public welfare, health, and safety of all persons using public thoroughfares and rights-of-way within the City of Wausau in relation to the signage displayed thereon, or overhanging, or projecting into such public spaces. 
(e)  Preserve the value of private property by assuring the compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses. 
(f)  Assure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of public streets and other public structures and spaces are protected by exercising reasonable controls over character and design of signage. 
(g)  Advance the aesthetic goals of the City throughout the community and ensure the effectiveness and flexibility in the design, creativity, or use of signage without creating a detriment to the general public. 
(2)  Furthermore, this title leaves ample and adequate alternative channels of commercial speech communication for the messages portrayed on advertising signs - namely, distributed print media, broadcast media, and point-of-purchase display - and is narrowly defined so as to limit said prohibition to commercial speech on exterior signage and signage intended to be viewed from beyond the boundaries of a site. 
(3)  The penalties of the City of Wausau Municipal Code may be applicable to violations of the provisions of this title. 
(4)  Any sign authorized by this title may contain a noncommercial message. 
(5)  Signs that fail to comply with the requirements in this title are subject to the penalties found in section 23.10.60.  
23.09.02 - Reserved.  
23.09.03 - Definition of a sign. 
(1)  Definition of a sign. In this title, the word "sign" means any object, device, display, structure, or part thereof, situated or visible from outdoors, which is used to advertise, identify, display, direct or attract attention to an object, person, institution, organization, business, product, service, event, or location by any means, including words, letters, figures, designs, logos, symbols, fixtures, colors, illumination, or projected images. 
(2)  Signs do not include: 
(a)  Traffic control and other government messages located within a right-of-way. 
(b)  Decorations that are incidentally and customarily associated with any national holiday or religious holiday, or with any community festival or similar event. 
(c)  Flags which do not contain a commercial message, commercial logo, or commercial colors.

23.09.12—23.09.14 - Reserved.  
23.09.15 - Sign setback, height, measurement, and flexibility. 
(1)  Sign setbacks. Signs must be located on-site, outside of the vision triangle, and must not be located within any street right-of-way, unless otherwise specified or approved by the Plan Commission. Each sign type must be setback in a location consistent with Figure 23.09.11a, Figure 23.09.11b, Figure 23.09.11c, and Figure 23.09.11d. 
(2)  Sign height. 
(a)  The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from the average ground level adjacent at the base of the sign to the top of the highest attached component of the sign, or from the centerline grade of the nearest adjacent public road, if such information is supplied with the permit application and confirmed by the Zoning Administrator, whichever is higher. 
(b)  The average ground level is defined as the average elevation of the ground upon which the sign supports are placed, except when the sign supports rest upon a berm or other area elevated above the surrounding ground. In such cases, the average elevation of the base of such berm or other area shall be considered as the ground level. 
(3)  Minimum ground clearance. All on-building and pedestrian signs shall have a minimum clearance of 14 feet above a drive, alley, or street and a minimum of eight feet above a sidewalk, path, trail, or other ground-level surface. 
(4)  Measurement of sign area. The measurement of sign area is based on the arrangement of sign copy and sign background: 
(a)  In the case of a freestanding sign (including three-dimensional objects), sign area shall include the total sign area(s) that can be viewed from any single vantage point. i.e., for a typical freestanding sign that faces two directions, only the largest sign face visible from any single vantage point shall count toward the total permitted sign area. Sign area shall not include any elements of the sign structure designed solely for support of the sign structure and located below or to the side of the sign message. Examples of parts of a freestanding sign structure which are exempt from the sign area include the sign base and the supporting columns, posts, or poles. 
(b)  For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy which are attached to a background surface with one or more neutral surface colors, sign area shall be measured as the sum of the smallest rectangle or as the sum of the irregular shapes enclosing each letter or related copy. See Example 1 in Figure 23.09.15b. 
1.  If an exact sign area calculation is not provided by the sign manufacturer, then the sign shall be measured using the smallest rectangles method. 
2.  If an exact sign area calculation is provided by the sign manufacturer, then the applicant has the option to use the sum of the irregular shapes enclosing each letter or related copy to calculate the sign's total area. 
(c)  For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy which are attached to a background surface with one or more non-neutral background colors, sign area shall be measured as the sum of the smallest rectangles and right triangles enclosing entire sign message and any and all non-neutral background color areas. See Example 2 in Figure 23.09.15b. 
(d)  For signs comprised of letters and related copy surrounded by one or more sign background colors on a single panel, frame, or cabinet, the sign area shall be measured as the smallest single rectangle enclosing the entire sign message and any and all background color areas. See Example 3 in Figure 23.09.15b. 
(e)  For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy surrounded by one or more sign background colors on individual panels, sign area shall be measured as the smallest single rectangle enclosing the entire sign message and any and all background color areas. See Example 4 in Figure 23.09.15b. 
(f)  Groupings of related smaller signs may be counted as one sign. In such cases, sign area shall be measured as the smallest single rectangle enclosing the individual signs and any and all background color areas. See Example 4 in Figure 23.09.15b. 
(g)  For signs comprised of one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane. See Figure 23.09.15a.

(d)  Revocation shall not result in total or partial reimbursement of permit fees paid.

(a)  If the Zoning Administrator determines that any sign exists in violation of this title, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the sign permit holder or the owner of the property on which the sign is located.

(b)  If notification is sent and the violation is not corrected within 60 days, the Zoning Administrator shall revoke the permit for any sign which is in violation of this title. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to cause removal of such sign. 
(c)  The expense of removing such sign shall be charged to the owner of the property on which the sign is located. If the owner fails to pay such expense within one month of being billed therefore, or has not made arrangement for payment satisfactory to the City Attorney, then such expense shall become a lien on the property and shall be placed upon the tax roll.

(h)  Limited effect on a favorable ruling on an appeal. 
1.  No ruling by the Zoning Board of Appeals on an appeal finding a particular land use to be conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the ruling on the appeal, unless a building permit is issued and development commenced within that period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period. 
2.  A ruling by the Zoning Board of Appeals on an appeal finding a particular land use to be conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the ruling was issued. The ruling shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate ruling has not been issued. A favorable ruling shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or more. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate that the subject conditional use was operational during this 365-day period of time. 
(13)  Revocation of an approved conditional use. 
(a)  Upon approval, the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed conditional use meets all general and specific conditional use requirements in the site plan required for initiation of development activity on the subject property per section 23.10.42. Once a conditional use is granted, no erosion control permit, site plan, certificate of occupancy, or building permit shall be issued for any development which does not comply with all requirements of this Title. 
(b)  Any conditional use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this shall be considered in violation of this Title and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties.

The City shall provide the property owner with appropriate served notice to consider revocation. City staff shall provide written findings of fact in relation to the factors listed in subsection (8). 
(14)  Time limits on the development of conditional use. 
(a)  Unless extended as a condition of approval, the start of construction of any and all conditional uses shall be initiated within 365 days of their approval by the Plan Commission and shall be operational within 730 days of said approval. For the purposes of this section, "operational" shall be defined as the granting of a certificate of occupancy for the conditional use. 
(b)  Failure to initiate development within this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of the conditional use. 
(c)  Prior to such a revocation, the applicant may request an extension of this period. Said request shall require formal approval by the Zoning Administrator and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification, as determined by the Plan Commission. However, as a condition of approval, the 365-day and/or 730-day time limits may be extended for any specific period to accommodate phased or multi-stage development. 
(15)  Discontinuing an approved conditional use. Any and all conditional uses which have been discontinued for a period exceeding 365 days shall have their conditional use invalidated automatically. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate that the subject conditional use was operational during this period. 
(16)  Change of ownership. All requirements and conditions of the approved conditional use shall be continued regardless of ownership of the subject property. 
(17)  Modification, alteration, or expansion. 
(a)  Modification, alteration, or expansion of any conditional use without approval per the process in this subsection shall be considered in violation of this Title and shall be grounds for revocation of said conditional use approval per subsection (13), above. 
(18)  Recording of conditional use requirements. Except for conditional use approvals for temporary uses, a certified copy of the authorizing resolution, containing identifiable description and any specific requirements of approval, shall be recorded by the City. The City shall record modifications, alterations and expansions as well as expired or revoked conditional use permits. 
(19)  Formerly approved conditional uses. A use now regulated as a conditional use which was approved as a legal land use, either permitted by right or as a conditional use, prior to the effective date of this Title, shall be considered as a legal, conforming land use so long as the previously approved conditions of use and previously approved site plan are followed. Any modification of the previously approved conditions of use or site plan shall require application and City consideration under this section. 
(20)  Limited conditional uses. A limited conditional use is any development, activity or operation for which a conditional use permit has been approved that is limited to a specific operator or property owner, or to a specific date or event upon which the conditional use permit either expires or is required to be reviewed and reapproved. The Plan Commission may require any proposed conditional use request to be a limited conditional use. The Plan Commission shall specify which of the following characteristics, based on substantial evidence, are present that create the need for the limited conditional use: 
(a)  A particular aspect of the specific land use. 
(b)  A particular aspect of the proposed operation (including, but not limited to, operating hours). 
(c)  A particular aspect of the proposed location. 
(d)  A particular aspect of the proposed site design. 
(e)  A particular aspect of the adjacent property or of the surrounding environs. 
(f)  Any other reason(s) the Plan Commission deems specifically relevant and material.

(a)  Definition. A successor conditional use is a land use which has been granted a conditional use permit by the City, which is proposed to undergo one or more of the following changes: 
1.  Changing from the specific use originally permitted by the conditional use to another operation of the same use within 365 days of the ending of the original use. For example, changing from one restaurant to another is permitted. However, changing from a restaurant to a tavern is not permitted even though both are considered indoor commercial entertainment land uses under section 23.03.10(8). Likewise, changing from a drive-through restaurant to a drive-through bank is not permitted, even though both are considered a Drive-Through under In-Vehicle Sales and Service in section 23.03.10(10). 
2.  A change in the ownership of the subject property. 
3.  A change in the ownership of the business or other operator of the land use. 
4.  Other changes explicitly identified in a previously issued conditional use permit that are identified as acceptable successor conditional uses.

1.  Reduces the costs and time needed to approve a successor conditional use. 
2.  Verifies that the proposed change is a valid successor conditional use. 
3.  Creates a record that the proposed change is approved. 
4.  Provides the land use and City with a list of all applicable requirements. 
(c)  Proposed expansions are not eligible. Any physical enlargement of a previously approved conditional use in terms of buildings, structures, activity areas, and/or any expansion of the conditions of operation beyond the limits of site plans, floor plans and conditions of operation (i.e. peak traffic) approved through the conditional use process shall not be eligible for treatment as a successor conditional use and must seek an amendment to its conditional use permit through the conditional use process. 
(22)  Conditional use permit hearing procedure. 
(a)  Chairman. The Chair of the Commission shall preside over the public hearing and may impose reasonable limitations on evidence or testimony, including but not limited to, reasonable time limits.

23.10.45—23.10.49 - Reserved.  
23.10.50 - Interpretations. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to assign responsibility for the official interpretation of the provisions of this title, and to describe the required procedure for securing such interpretation. 
(2)  Initiation of request for an interpretation. Proceedings for an interpretation may be initiated by any of the following 4 methods: 
(a)  An application of the owner(s) of the subject property or authorized agent of the owner(s) of the subject property. 
(b)  A recommendation of the Plan Commission to the Common Council. 
(c)  By action of the Common Council. 
(d)  By request of the Zoning Administrator. 
(3)  Application. A zoning interpretation application contains all of the following: 
(a)  Clear indication of the text of this title for which the interpretation is requested and the specific questions the applicant has regarding said text. 
(b)  If the requested interpretation relates to the application of this title to a specific property, the additional following information may be required (digital files should be submitted whenever possible): 
1.  A map of the subject property depicting: 
a.  All lands for which the interpretation is requested and all other lands within 100 feet of the boundaries of the subject property. 
b.  Current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. 
c.  All lot dimensions of the subject property. 
d.  A graphic scale and a north arrow. 
2.  A written description of the reason for the requested interpretation and how the proposed interpretation relates to type of activities, buildings, and structures currently located on, and proposed for, the subject property. 
3.  A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site plan shall conform to the requirements of section 23.10.42. 
(c)  If the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular land use under the provisions of this title, a series of written responses to the following questions: 
1.  How is the subject land use in general harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the City's Comprehensive Plan, this title, and any other plan, program, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration (pursuant to official notice) by the City? 
2.  How is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought? 
(4)  Review by Zoning Administrator. 
(a)  The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills the requirements of this title. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the Zoning Administrator, shall notify the applicant. 
(b)  The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written justification for the proposed interpretation provided in the application to determine whether the requested variance is in harmony with the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
(c)  The Zoning Administrator shall forward a report to the applicant indicating the interpretation of the Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator, determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Administrator, shall note this determination in the report. 
(5)  Standards for review. This title shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the Common Council as noted in this title and the Comprehensive Plan. The intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this title is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed, modified, or existing land use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this title shall proceed as follows: 
(a)  Articulate certain public purpose(s) underlying the standard(s) for which an interpretation is required. (Rationale: Before any zoning interpretation is made, there must be an explicit discussion of certain purpose(s) for which the regulation was initially imposed. Each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public. Each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact. A sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed. It is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated.) 
(b)  Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public. There is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use, and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use, or which allows a use to be enlarged, or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the Chapter. Design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this title is to be prohibited. 
(c)  Determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that person's land use proposal. If an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted, and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party (i.e. the abutting landowners, the public at large, and/or a future property owner or renter), such an interpretation may be appropriately made. Any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this title. Similarly, any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this title. Any interpretation which will result in any reduction of a normally required bufferyard or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this title has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements. 
(d)  This title has been carefully designed by the Common Council to combine maximum achievement of public goals, and the protection of abutting property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options. Persons interpreting this title should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the Common Council. 
(e)  In addition to the applicant's response to the questions required by subsections (5)(a) through (d), above, the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters: 
1.  No interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the Common Council on an application for an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, the Official Zoning Map, or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation. 
2.  No interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right, a special use, or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted or conditional in the zoning district of the subject property (see article II). 
3.  No interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject property's zoning district (see article II). 
4.  No interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district, or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category (see article II). 
5.  If the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject property's district than to a use permitted by right, then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to section 23.10.32. 
(6)  Effect of a favorable land use interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure. A favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this title. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, required site plans, special use permits, conditional uses, and certificates of occupancy. 
(7)  Limitations on favorable land use interpretation. 
(a)  No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation, unless a building permit is issued and development has begun within that period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period. 
(b)  An interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued. The interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued. A favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or more.  
23.10.51 - Variances. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which enable the City to hear and decide requests for permitted variation from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the public interest; where owing to special factors, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this title shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; as provided for by Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(e)(7). 
(2)  Variance types. Variances from the regulations of this title shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals only in accordance with the standards established in this section. Variances may be granted only if the existing use of the building or property is a permitted use in the district where the requested variance is located or a conditional use for the activity has been approved by the Common Council. Variances may be granted only in the following instances and in no others: 
(a)  To permit any yard or setback less than a yard or a setback required by the applicable regulations; 
(b)  To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than 80 percent of the required area and width; 
(c)  To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required facilities for two or more uses, provided that substantial use of the facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same days of the week; 
(d)  To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or 20 percent of the applicable regulations, whichever number is greater; 
(e)  To increase by not more than 25 percent the maximum distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served; 
(f)  To increase by not more than ten percent the maximum gross floor area of any use so limited by the applicable regulations; 
(g)  To permit a reasonable variation in the height restrictions on fences; and 
(h)  To permit reconstruction, remodeling or additions necessary for the physical wellbeing of a person so handicapped as to make the structure unsuitable in its present configuration for his safe or reasonable use; 
(i)  To permit a detached accessory building or structure to be constructed to a height in excess of the principal building or structure; 
(j)  To permit a variance from the adopted Height Limitations Zoning Map that will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this title would result in unnecessary hardship, and such relief will do substantial justice, be in accord with the spirit of title 22, and not create a hazard to the safe, normal operation of aircraft. 
(3)  Initiation of request for approval of a variance. Proceedings for approval of a requested variance shall be initiated by an application of the owner(s) of the subject property or authorized agent of the owner(s) of the subject property. 
(4)  Application. Variance applications shall contain the following (digital files should be submitted whenever possible, if applicable): 
(a)  A map of the subject property depicting: 
1.  All lands for which the variance is proposed and all other lands within 100 feet of the boundaries of the subject property. 
2.  Current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. 
3.  All lot dimensions of the subject property. 
4.  A graphic scale and a north arrow. 
(b)  A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site plan shall conform to the requirements of section 23.10.42. 
(c)  Written description of the proposed variance, including evidence that the application is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
(5)  Review by the Zoning Administrator.

(a)  Within 60 days after the holding of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall make its findings per the following based on Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(e)7: 
1.  The variance will not be contrary to the public interest. 
2.  Substantial justice will be done by granting the variance. 
3.  The variance is needed so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed. 
4.  Due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship. 
5.  The variance will not allow any alteration of an historic structure, including its use, which would preclude its continued designation as an historic structure. 
(b)  The Zoning Board of Appeals may request further information and/or additional reports from the Zoning Administrator, and/or the applicant. The Zoning Board of Appeals may take final action on said request for approval of the requested variance at time of its initial meeting, or said proceedings may be continued from time-to-time for further consideration. 
(c)  If the Zoning Board of Appeals fails to make a determination within 60 days after said public hearing, then the request for the variance shall be considered denied. 
(d)  Following final action by the Zoning Board of Appeals in granting a variance, the approved variance shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of the order, unless the building permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration of a building is started, or the use is commenced within such period. 
(8)  Effect of denial. No application for a variance which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 365 days from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or material change of circumstances found valid by the Zoning Administrator. 
(9)  Limited effect of a variance. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals has granted a variance, such approval shall neither change the use classification of the building or premises, nor give it any status as a nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the variance. Granting of a variance shall be considered as unique to the variance granted, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed variance. 
(10)  Stay of proceedings. An application for a variance shall stay all legal proceedings furthering enforcement of any provisions of this title from which the applicant is requesting a variance, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals after the request for the variance has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals, or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator, and on due cause shown.

23.10.53 - Administration and enforcement of performance standards. 
Determinations necessary for administration and enforcement of performance standards set forth in this article range from those which can be made with satisfactory accuracy by a reasonable person using normal senses and no mechanical equipment, to those requiring great technical competence and complex equipment for precise measurement. It is the intent of this title that: 
(1)  Where determinations can be made by the Zoning Administrator, using equipment normally available to the City or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made before notice of violations is issued. 
(2)  Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable for the City to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures shall be available for causing corrections or apparent violations of performance standards, for protecting individuals from arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable administration and enforcement of performance standard regulations, and for protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for administration and enforcement. 
(a)  The Zoning Administrator shall give written notice to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violations. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the Zoning Administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator. 
(b)  The notice shall state that failure to reply or to correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator within the time limit set constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this title. The notice shall further state that upon request of those to whom it is directed, technical determination as described in this title will be made, and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such determinations shall be charged against those responsible for the violation, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is determined that no violation exists, the cost of the determination will be paid by the City.
