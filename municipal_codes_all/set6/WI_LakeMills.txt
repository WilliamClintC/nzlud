activities, whether or not such activities arise form their City roles
or positions, except that elected officials may not receive and retain
any such payments from a lobbyist or from a business or
organization or local government that employs a lobbyist.

entities other than the City, and said services arise from the
incumbents' City employment, and the compensation and expenses
related thereto are paid for or reimbursed by the City, all monies
received by the incumbent from other persons or entities for those
services shall be paid promptly to the City Treasurer. [Amended

under Ch. 11, Wis. Stats., transportation, lodging, meals, food or
beverages, or reimbursement thereof or payment or
reimbursements of costs permitted and reported in accordance
with Ch. 11, Wis. Stats.
(6) If an incumbent receives anything of value not authorized by this
section, the incumbent shall not retain it but shall within 10 days of
receipt thereof deposit the money or the equivalent cash value of
anything of value with the City Treasurer or return the payment or
thing to the payer or giver. [Amended 12-18-2012 by Ord. No.
1103]
(7) If the receipt of anything of value is permitted under this
Subsection I, whenever an incumbent receives anything of value
from, or has any fee or expense waived or reduced by, a person or
entity other than the City in connection with the incumbent's
official duties, the incumbent shall, within 10 days of the
occurrence, file a written report of such receipt with the City Clerk.

A. Any incumbent who has or whose immediate family member has a

or City Officer, or any board, committee, commission, subcommittee or
ad hoc committee, and who participates in discussion or
recommendation, or who gives an official opinion to such body, shall
disclose on the records of such body the nature and extent of such
interest. This provision requiring disclosure of interests shall not apply
if the incumbent disqualifies herself or himself from participating in
discussion of the matter and from otherwise taking action on the
matter.
B. Any incumbent shall disqualify herself or himself from discussing and
voting, or from taking any official action in a matter under
consideration by the City if such matter involves the incumbent's or the
incumbent's immediate family member's financial or personal interests
to the extent that such interests conflict or appear to conflict with the
incumbent's official duties or would impair or reasonably be expected to
impair the incumbent's independence of judgment or actions.
§ 71-5 LAKE MILLS CODE § 71-6
1:76
C. In the event that an incumbent is required to disqualify him or herself
from participating on a matter that comes for official action before the
City, or in the event that the incumbent voluntarily disqualifies himself
or herself, the incumbent shall perform the following duties of
disqualification:
(1) If the incumbent is a member of the City Council, the incumbent is
not required to disclose in writing the reasons for disqualification,
but the incumbent shall not participate in formal or informal
discussion of the item from which he or she has disqualified himself
or herself from action. Such disqualification from acting applies
equally to discussions both before and at the meeting at which the
item is to be considered. At such meeting, the incumbent shall
remove himself or herself temporarily from his or her seat on the
Council when the item comes before such body, and shall take a
seat in the audience or exit the meeting. The minutes of the
meeting shall reflect this temporary disqualification of the
incumbent from the Council, but no reason needs to be given
directly to the Council or the public for such temporary
disqualification, unless the incumbent chooses to voluntarily state
his or her reasons for disqualifying him or herself from
participating in an item before the Council.
(2) If the incumbent is a member of the City Council, and if the
incumbent is absent from the meeting at which the incumbent
would have otherwise disqualified himself or herself, the incumbent
shall notify the City Clerk in advance of the meeting of such
absence and such disqualification, and the notice of disqualification
shall then be made a part of the minutes of the Council meeting.
Failure to so notify the Clerk shall be considered a violation of this
section.
(3) If the incumbent is the City Manager, the incumbent shall disclose
in writing the reasons for his or her disqualification to the City
Attorney and Council President, who will then decide whether they
will act jointly in the City Manager's stead in discharging any duties
from which the City Manager has disqualified himself or herself, or
whether they will bring the matter to the Council in closed session,
if appropriate, for the purpose of substituting the Council's action
in the City Manager's stead in discharging the duties from which
the City Manager has disqualified himself or herself under this
section.
(4) If the incumbent is a Department Director, the incumbent shall
disclose in writing the reasons for disqualification to the City
Manager and the City Attorney. The City Manager shall then act in
the Director's stead in discharging duties for which the Director
has disqualified himself or herself under this section, and the City
Manager may delegate the actual decision or action to a
subordinate of that Director, if warranted, in the case of
disqualification by the Police Chief or Fire Chief.
§ 71-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 71-6
1:77
(5) If the incumbent is an employee under the supervision of a
Department Director, the incumbent shall disclose in writing the
reasons for disqualification to the Department Director and the
City Attorney. The Department Director shall then act in the
employee's stead in discharging duties for which the employee has
disqualified himself or herself under this section.
(6) If the incumbent is the City Attorney, the incumbent shall follow the
requirements of the Supreme Court Rules that pertain to conflicts
of interest, disclosure and disqualification, and if the incumbent
requires guidance with regard to options to pursue under these
rules, the incumbent may seek an ethics opinion of the standing
ethics board of the Wisconsin State Bar.
(a) In addition, if the procedures would not otherwise conflict with
the Supreme Court Rules or Ethics Opinion, the City Attorney
shall develop standardized procedures for obtaining outside
counsel or prosecutors to act in the City Attorney's stead and
such persons shall be funded from the City Attorney's budget
out of monies allocated for professional services.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Attorney is authorized
to seek outside legal opinions or consultation, when in the City
Attorney's professional opinion, such opinions or consultations
are warranted, and the fees for such services shall likewise be
funded from the City Attorney's budget out of monies allocated
for professional services.
(c) Finally, if outside legal assistance is required due to the
specialized area of law or long-term assistance necessary to
meet the needs of the City, the City Attorney is authorized to
seek an appointment by the Council of a special counsel to
represent the City in the limited matter to which the
appointment specifically pertains. Funding sources for such
special counsel shall be determined by the Council at the time
of any appointment.
(7) If the incumbent is a member of a City board, committee,
commission, subcommittee or ad hoc committee, the incumbent is
not required to disclose in writing the reasons for disqualification,
but the incumbent shall not participate either prior to or at the
meeting in formal or informal discussion of the item from which he
or she has disqualified himself or herself from action, and the
incumbent shall remove himself or herself temporarily from his or
her seat on the Board, committee, commission, subcommittee or ad
hoc committee when the item comes before such body. The
incumbent shall take a seat in the audience or exit the meeting
room during discussion of the item from which the incumbent has
disqualified himself or herself. The minutes of that meeting shall
reflect this temporary disqualification of the incumbent from the
§ 71-6 LAKE MILLS CODE § 71-6
1:78
§ 71-7. Effect of disqualification on voting requirements.
body, but no reason needs to be given directly to the body or the
public for such temporary disqualification.
(8) If the incumbent is a member of a City board, committee,
commission, subcommittee or ad hoc committee, and if the
incumbent is absent during the meeting at which he or she would
have otherwise been required to temporarily disqualify himself or
herself from action on an item, the Chair or President or presiding
officer of the body shall be notified in writing prior to the meeting
that the incumbent, although absent from the meeting, is
disqualifying himself or herself from all discussion and action on
the particular item. This notification shall be made part of the
minutes of that meeting. Failure to so notify the appropriate person
of the disqualification, despite the member's absence, shall be
considered a violation of this section.
A. If an incumbent may not cast a vote due to a conflict of interest, and if
the incumbent has disqualified himself or herself from the vote, the lack
of vote by the incumbent shall be recorded as an abstention, and such
vote shall not be counted for determining: (1) the number of "members
present" if passage of that measure requires a favorable vote by a
majority or other fractional vote (i.e., 2/3 or 3/4) of the members
"present"; or (2) the presence of a quorum for purposes of that
particular vote.
B. If the vote requires that all members of the body be counted for
purposes of determining whether a majority of all the members voted,
as opposed to whether a majority of the members "present" voted, the
disqualified member's disqualification shall not be counted as a portion
of the total number of members for purposes of determining: (1)
whether a majority were present for quorum reasons for that vote; or
(2) whether a favorable vote was cast by a majority of the members or
other required fractional number of the total members.
C. By way of example, under Subsection A, if a body has five members and
a 2/3 vote of the members present is required, and one member is
absent and one member is disqualified and the vote is two in favor and
one against a measure, the disqualified person's lack of vote will not be
counted among the number of members "present," so the resulting vote
will be recorded as 2-1 and the measure will pass because a 2/3 vote of
the members present had voted in favor of the measure.
D. By way of example, under Subsection B, if a body has five members, but
one vacancy exists and only four members may then be present to vote
on any measure before the body until the vacancy is filled, the total
number of all members is still considered to be five. If one member is
disqualified and a simple majority vote is required for the measure to
pass, the majority of all members required for the vote to pass would be
three votes in favor. The three voting members at the meeting cast a
§ 71-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 71-7
1:79
§ 71-8. Ethics Board.
vote of 2-1. Under this scenario, only two members voted in favor of
the measure, but since three were needed, the measure fails. If, under
Subsection B, a body has five members, but one member is disqualified
from voting due to a conflict of interest, and a 2/3 or 3/4 vote is
required of all members, that disqualified member is not counted for
the purpose of determining if the required number of votes were cast
for the measure to pass.
E. Notwithstanding the foregoing subsections, if the effect of the
disqualification on the official duties is so pervasive and so permanent
in nature that a reasonable person would believe that a de facto
vacancy exists in the office or position, the incumbent is encouraged to
remove the source of the ongoing disqualification or resign.
A. The Ethics Board of the City of Lake Mills is hereby abolished and recreated.
The newly created Ethics Board shall consist of five members
who shall serve without compensation from the City.
B. All members of the Ethics Board shall be at least 18 years of age, be
residents of the City, and during their terms on the Ethics Board, no
member may hold any elective office in, be employed by, or be a
contracted, appointed official with the City of Lake Mills.
C. Each member of the Ethics Board shall have experience with the types
of situations presented when applying an ethics code to specific facts.
To satisfy the need for specialized experience, each applicant for
consideration for appointment to the Ethics Board shall meet one or
more of the following qualifications:
(1) Currently serving, or have in the past served, in an elective or
appointive office in a governmental entity;
(2) Currently are or have been employed by a governmental entity and
have been subject to similar ethics codes in such employment;
(3) Currently are licensed to practice law in the State of Wisconsin; or
(4) Possesses qualifications and experience similar to those listed in
this subsection.
D. The members of the Ethics Board shall be appointed by the Council
President to three-year terms, commencing on May 1 in the year of
appointment, subject to confirmation by the Council, except that of
those first appointed, two of the members shall be appointed for one
year, two members shall be appointed for two years, and the remaining
member shall be appointed for three years.
E. The members of the Ethics Board shall take and file an oath of office
prior to entering into their duties.
§ 71-7 LAKE MILLS CODE § 71-8
1:80
§ 71-9. Advisory opinions.
F. The Ethics Board shall elect its own Chair, Vice Chair and Secretary and
shall develop written rules of procedure to be submitted to the Council
for approval.
G. The Ethics Board shall have the powers and duties as set forth in
§ 19.59(5)(a) and (b), Wis. Stats., and its duties also include making
recommendations to the City Council for further action as appropriate.
H. The Ethics Board shall meet when it has business to conduct and it may
adjourn its meetings from time to time.
I. The Ethics Board may make recommendations with respect to
amendments to the Code of Ethics of the Lake Mills Municipal Code.
J. The City Attorney shall furnish the Board whatever legal assistance is
necessary in the carrying out of its functions.
K. The reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the Board may be
compensated if such expenses are approved by the City Council
through either a previously adopted budget or special action of the
Council.
A. When an incumbent has doubts as to the applicability of a provision of
this section to a particular situation in which he or she is or may
become involved, or definitions of terms used in the code, the
incumbent should apply in writing to the Ethics Board for an advisory
opinion and be guided by that opinion when given. The requester of an
ethics opinion shall include in such a request all pertinent information
regarding his or her interpretation of the facts at issue and of the
applicable provision(s) of the code before such advisory opinion may be
issued. It is prima facie evidence of intent to comply with this section
when a person refers a matter to the Ethics Board and abides by the
advisory opinion, if the material facts are as stated in the opinion
request.
B. When a request for an advisory opinion is made, the name of the
requester and the nature of the request may, at the requester's option,
be kept confidential. When confidentiality is requested, the Board shall
hear and determine the request in closed session. The agenda for the
meeting shall identify the session as a closed session to hear a request
for a confidential opinion pursuant to this section and § 19.59, Wis.
Stats.
C. When confidentiality is requested, the report of the Board shall also be
kept confidential, but the Board shall prepare a redacted summary of
the report as a public document; however, if the requester requests in
writing that the full report be made public, the entire opinion or report
shall become a part of the public record.
§ 71-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 71-9
1:81
§ 71-10. Complaints.
D. If the requester makes public any portion of the opinion or report, all
confidentiality is waived by the requester and the Board shall release
the full report with the redacted portions restored.
E. If the Ethics Board cannot meet in a timely manner, and a request for an
ethics advisory opinion has been submitted, the City Attorney may act
to provide such advisory opinion as if the City Attorney has the powers
and duties of the Ethics Board in this section. In addition, the City
Attorney shall provide a report in writing to the Ethics Board of the fact
that such request was made and if the requester has requested that the
request for the advisory opinion remain confidential, the City Attorney
shall nonetheless provide all information contained in the request and
the advisory opinion to the Board so that the Board may have such
information for the Board's records and use in accordance with this
section, as if the Board had actually met and provided the advisory
opinion.
A. Any resident of the City may complain to the Ethics Board about the
activity of any person or entity covered by the Code of Ethics in the
Lake Mills Municipal Code, pursuant to the rules and procedures of the
Ethics Board, which have been approved by the City Council. If a
complaint is brought under this section against any member of the
Ethics Board, the City Council shall hear the complaint, acting as the
Ethics Board, and following the same rules, procedures and precedents
of the Ethics Board.
B. The Ethics Board will charge the total costs of its proceedings to the
person bringing a complaint, if the Ethics Board determines that the
complaint was without merit, was frivolous in nature, or was brought
for the purpose of harassing the subject of the complaint.
C. The Ethics Board, or City Council when acting as the Ethics Board, may
issue subpoenas and administer oaths.
D. No action may be taken on any complaint which is filed later than 12
months after a violation of this Ethics Code is alleged to have occurred.
E. If the Ethics Board cannot act due to a lack of quorum or any reason
other than when a complaint is brought against a member of the Ethics
Board and the City Council is acting in its place, then complaints may
be submitted to the City Attorney, and if upon investigation, the City
Attorney finds probable cause to believe that the conduct that is the
subject of the complaint is in violation of the this chapter, the City
Attorney shall forward said complaint and any investigative materials to
the District Attorney for prosecution under Wis. Stats. § 19.59(8). If the
District Attorney fails to commence an action under § 19.59(8)(c) within
30 days after receiving a verified complaint forwarded under this
section from the City Attorney, or if the District Attorney refuses to
commence such action, the person who originally submitted the
§ 71-9 LAKE MILLS CODE § 71-10

§ 71-11. Sanctions.
Violation of any provision of this Ethics Code should raise conscientious
questions for the incumbent concerned as to whether voluntary resignation
or other action is indicated to promote the best interests of the City of Lake
Mills. If the Ethics Board determines that any person or entity has violated
any provision of this code, the Board may, as part of its report to the Council,
make any of the following recommendations:
§ 71-12. Other responsibilities of public office.
Nothing in this chapter supersedes or limits the responsibilities of public
officials and employees to be aware of and to abide by the other laws
affecting their conduct as public officials or employees. These other laws,
include, but are not limited to, §§ 19.59 and 946.10 through 946.18, Wis.
Stats., which apply to various violations for conflict of interest, bribery,
misconduct in public office, corrupt means to influence official actions, and
private interests in public contracts.

A. Municipal Court established. There is hereby created and established a
Lake Mills Municipal Court under the provisions of Chapter 755 of the
Wisconsin Statutes which is incorporated by reference, including any
amendments, as though the chapter were written in its entirety herein.
(1) The Municipal Court hereby established shall be known as the
"Municipal Court for the City and Town of Lake Mills."
(2) To permit the Court herein established to become a court with two
member municipalities, both the City and the Town of Lake Mills,
pursuant to § 755.01(4), Wis. Stats., shall enact identical
ordinances and shall enter into an agreement pursuant to
§ 66.0301, Wis. Stats, for the exercise of powers relating to the
creation and administration of this Court.
(3) For purposes of creating this Court, the City and Town
acknowledge and agree that the terms of this chapter shall
constitute the terms of the agreement under § 66.0301, Wis. Stats.,
and that this chapter shall serve as the agreement as if it were
written and separately executed between the City and Town of
Lake Mills.
(4) This Court may not be abolished during any term for which a judge
has already been elected. Either the City or Town may abolish this
court, effective at the end of a judge's term of office, by adopting an
ordinance repealing that municipality's ordinance. Such ordinance
shall be in effect on December 1 in the year preceding the May 1
expiration of the judge's term, so that potential candidates for
judge are aware of the change in the status and jurisdiction of the
court. Any municipality that has not so acted to repeal its ordinance
shall also, prior to December 1 in the year preceding the May 1
expiration of the judge's term, amend its ordinance in a manner
that preserves the Municipal Court's jurisdiction for that
municipality, commencing on May 1.
B. Municipal judge. Such Court shall be under the jurisdiction of and
presided over by a Municipal Judge, who shall be an attorney licensed
to practice law in Wisconsin, and who shall reside in either the City of
Lake Mills or the Town of Lake Mills at the time of his or her election
and throughout his or her term of office.
(1) Such Municipal Judge shall be elected at large in the spring
election for a term of four years commencing on May 1. All

§ 8.11(1)(a), Wis. Stats., and such primary election shall be held on
the third Tuesday of February as provided in § 5.02(22), Wis. Stats.
(3) Because a Municipal Court has previously been established by the
City of Lake Mills, and because the Judge presiding over the Court
has been elected to a term of office until May 1, 2010, the Judge of
the previously established Municipal Court shall preside over the

Mills until the end of the existing term.

to fill a vacancy, take and file the official oath as prescribed in
§ 757.02(1), Wis. Stats., and at the same time execute and file an official
bond in the amount of $5,000. The Judge shall not act until the oath and
bond have been filed as required by § 19.01(4)(c), Wis. Stats., and the
requirements of § 755.03(2), Wis. Stats., have been complied with.
E. Salary and administrative costs. The salary of the Municipal Judge shall
be fixed by the City Council of the City of Lake Mills, and such salary
shall be in lieu of fees and costs. No salary shall be paid for any time
during a term for which such Judge has not executed the official bond or
official oath, as required by § 755.03, Wis. Stats., and filed pursuant to
§ 19.01(4)(c), Wis. Stats. The City Council annually shall by separate
ordinance allocate funds for the administration of the Municipal Court,
and shall provide for a location for records for the Municipal Court, and
shall provide office space for 16 hours per week for the Court Clerk
within City-owned or controlled facilities, such that persons having
business with the Court may access the Court Clerk during regularly
scheduled business hours.
F. Jurisdiction. The Municipal Judge of the Municipal Court shall have
such jurisdiction as provided by §§ 755.045 and 755.05, Wis. Stats., and
as otherwise provided by State Law. The Municipal Judge is authorized
to issue inspection warrants under § 66.0119, Wis. Stats.

and the total amount of the forfeiture, fees, penalty assessment,

any. The treasurer of each municipality shall disperse the fees as

Whenever the City Council shall declare its intention to improve any street
in which water, gas or sewer, or any of them shall have been previously
laid or are to be laid, the Council shall also by resolution require water,
sewer and gas service pipes to be first laid in such street, at the cost of
the property fronting thereon, from the sewer, water and gas mains in such
street to the curbline on either or both sides thereof, at such intervals as
the Council shall direct along that part of said street to be improved, except
at street and alley crossings. Such work may be done by contract or by the
City directly without the intervention of a contractor, under the municipalowned
utility, under the supervision of such utility. The Director of Public
Works shall keep an accurate account of the expense of putting in service
A. Sewers. The subdivider or owner of land will be required to pay the
actual cost of all necessary sewer extensions, including engineering

the actual cost of all necessary water main and lateral extensions,
including engineering costs, on a special assessment basis.

of land shall be, by such Treasurer, entered in the tax roll as a special tax
against said lot or parcel of land, and the same shall be collected in all
respects as are other taxes upon real estate.
§ 161-3. Surfacing of gravel streets.
Before any blacktop hard surfacing is ordered on residential streets, the
property owners shall request that curb and gutter be installed and pay
the actual cost, including engineering, on a special assessment basis, or
the City may on its own initiative order curb and gutter constructed on a
special assessment basis, unless from an engineering standpoint curb and
gutter is not practicable. Curb and gutter and sidewalk replacement to City
streets shall be assessed pursuant to § 161-4 of this article at the rate as
determined by the City Council of the City.

The City may directly perform any class of public construction, or any part
thereof, without submitting the same for bids.
§ 161-6. Public works contracts.
Unless § 161-5 applies, all public construction, the estimated cost of which
exceeds $25,000, shall be let by contract to the lowest responsible bidder;
all other public construction shall be let as directed in this section.
A. Such work may be done under the supervision of the Public Works
Director. The Public Works Director shall keep an accurate account of
the expense of any such work performed directly by the City, and shall
report the same to the Board of Public Works.
B. Whenever any class of public work or any part thereof may be done
directly by the City without submitting the same for bids, the Board of
Public Works, or its designee, shall keep an accurate account of the cost
of the public work, including the necessary overhead expense. Upon the
completion of the work described, the Board of Public Works, or its
designee, shall make a complete report of the work to the Council,
stating in detail the items of cost and the total cost of doing the work.
The City Clerk shall publish the report as a part of the proceedings of
the Council.
C. For purposes of this section, the Board of Public Works may delegate its
duties by designating either the Public Works Director or the City
Manager to act in its stead whenever the Board of Public Works is
required to perform duties under Subsection B. Such designation shall
be carried out by adopting a resolution that shall remain in effect for all
such reporting requirements until such time as the Board of Public
Works shall revoke such delegated authority through the adoption of a
resolution revoking the same.

not apply to public construction if the materials for such a project are
donated or if the labor for such a project is provided by volunteers.

reconstruction of public facilities when damage or threatened damage
thereto creates an emergency in which the public health or welfare of
the City is endangered. Such determination as to emergency shall be
determined by resolution of the Board of Public Works. Whenever the
City Council determines by majority vote at a regular or special meeting
that an emergency no longer exists, this subsection no longer applies.

time as the Board of Public Works shall revoke such delegated authority
through the adoption of a resolution revoking the same. [Amended
12-18-2012 by Ord. No. 1103]

(1) The cost of photocopying shall be as determined from time to time
by the City Manager. Said cost shall be calculated not to exceed the
actual, necessary, and direct cost of reproduction.

1:135
§ 190-6. Limitations on right to access.
(1) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal
custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably
describes the requested record or the information requested.
However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as
to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does
not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally,
but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the
request is commenced under § 19.34, Wis. Stats.
(2) Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the
person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state
the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the
request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required
under § 190-4F(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable
identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private
residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or
regulations so require.
B. Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as
practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the
requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole
or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after
conferring with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is
so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the
request may first be required to itemize his request in a manner which
would permit reasonable compliance.
C. A request for a record may be denied as provided in § 190-6. If a request
is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a
written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the
requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written
request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a
written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written
denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the
record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review
upon petition for a writ of mandamus under § 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or
upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney.
A. As provided by § 19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt
from inspection under this section:
(1) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal
law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
(2) Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law
enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require
exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a
condition of receipt of aids by the state;
§ 190-5 LAKE MILLS CODE § 190-6
1:136
(3) Computer programs, although the material used as input for a
computer program or the material produced as a product of the
computer program is subject to inspection; and
(4) Pursuant to § 905.08, Wis. Stats., a record or portion of a record
containing information qualifying as a trade secret as defined in
§ 134.90(1)(c), Wis. Stats. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
B. As provided by § 43.30, Wis. Stats., public library circulation records
are exempt from inspection under this section.
C. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of record which is
not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after
conferring with the City Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in
part, only if he determines that the harm to the public interest resulting
from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the
requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be
refused include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which
were necessary and given in order to obtain the information
contained in them.
(2) Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.
(3) Records of current deliberations concerning employment,
dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or
discipline of any City officer or employee, or the investigation of
charges against a City officer or employee, unless such officer or
employee consents to such disclosure.
(4) Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or
prevention.
(5) Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of
City property, investing of City funds, or other City business
whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require
nondisclosure.
(6) Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data
of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a
substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person
referred to in such history or data.
(7) Communications between legal counsel for the City and any officer,
agent or employee of the City, when advice is being rendered
concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the
City or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to
become involved, or communications which are privileged under
§ 905.03, Wis. Stats.

§ 190-8. Preservation through microfilm.
Any City officer or the director of any department or division of City
government may, subject to the approval of the City Council, keep and
preserve public records in his possession by means of microfilm or other
photographic reproduction method. Such records shall meet the standards
for photographic reproduction set forth in § 16.61(7)(a) and (b), Wis. Stats.,
and shall be considered original records for all purposes. Such records shall
be preserved along with other files of the department or division and shall
be open to public inspection and copying according to the provisions of
state law and of §§ 190-4 through 190-6 of this chapter.

D. If a record contains information that may be made public and
information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record
shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the
information that may not be made public from the record before
release. The custodian shall confer with the City Attorney prior to
releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the City
Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgment of
the custodian and the City Attorney there is no feasible way to separate
the exempt material from the nonexempt material without reasonable
jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record
shall be withheld from disclosure.
A. General Records Schedule adopted. The City of Lake Mills hereby
adopts, by reference, the Wisconsin Municipal Records Schedule
(hereinafter, "Records Schedule"), pertaining to the retention and
destruction of public records, and approved by the State of Wisconsin
Public Records Board (hereinafter, "Records Board") on August 27,
2018. A copy of the Records Schedule will be kept on file in the City of
Lake Mills Clerk's office located at 200D Water Street, Lake Mills,
Wisconsin and made available for public viewing during normal
business hours.
B. Other records. In the event the City of Lake Mills creates a record not
contemplated by the Records Schedule, the City of Lake Mills may,
subject to the Records Board's prior approval, either adopt an
applicable records retention schedule set forth by the Records Board, if
available, or create its own retention schedule pertaining to the record.

Zoning regulations  See Ch. 660.
§ 240-1. Findings of fact.
A. The City Council finds that adult-oriented establishments operating in
the City require special licensing by the City in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such
businesses as well as the citizens of the City.
B. Based a review of studies conducted in Phoenix AZ, Garden Grove CA,
Los Angeles CA, Whittier CA, Indianapolis IN, Minneapolis MN, St. Paul
MN, Cleveland OH, Oklahoma City OK, Amarillo TX, Austin TX,
Beaumont TX, Dallas TX, Houston TX, Newport News VA, Bellevue WA,
Seattle WA, New York NY, St. Croix County WI, and the Report of the
Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually
Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics
obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the findings
incorporated in City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41
(1986); Coleman A. Young v. American Mini-Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50
(1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v.
Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's a.m., 120 S.

Somerset, 316 F.3d 702, 2003 WL 132541 (7th Cir. 2003), the City finds
that adult-oriented establishments are frequently used for sexual
liaisons of a casual nature and unlawful sexual activities including
prostitution.
C. It has been documented that entertainers in adult-oriented
establishments offer to perform sexual acts for patrons, and that sexual
contact occurs between patrons and other employees of adult-oriented
establishments.
D. There is convincing documented evidence that booths, rooms or
cubicles in adult-oriented establishments have been used by patrons for
the purpose of engaging in specified sexual activities or in high-risk
sexual behavior and configuration of the interior of the premises is an
important factor in combating such activities.

E. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published reports
that have been considered by the City relating to the subject of sexually
transmitted diseases and the concern over sexually transmitted
diseases is a legitimate concern of the City in order to protect the
health and well-being of its citizens.
F. There has been a steady increase in several types of sexually
transmitted diseases since 1986.
G. Researchers have found that contracting sexually transmitted diseases
may increase a person's vulnerability to human immuno-deficiency
virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome) and some types of cancer.
H. AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease which destroys the body's
immune system.
I. The State of Wisconsin Division of Health reports that as of June 30,
1999, 4,217 cases of AIDS were reported in the state, including 2,507
that resulted in death and new cases of HIV infection have been
reported in Wisconsin each year.
J. The City is concerned with the protection of its minors from exposure to
age-inappropriate, sexually explicit materials and offenses.
K. Licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to
ensure that the operators and employees of adult-oriented
establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that
operators and employees do not knowingly allow their establishments
to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
L. Information relating to pending charges and convictions of the
applicants is desired to further the City's interest in controlling the
secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments.
M. There is convincing documented evidence that adult-oriented
establishments have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses
around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them,
causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values.
N. The City Council has reviewed studies of the secondary effects of adultoriented
establishments and has concluded that if unregulated, they
present an increased risk of prostitution, high-risk sexual behavior and
crime, deleterious effects upon existing businesses and surrounding
residential areas, and decreased property values.
O. The City Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects
and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry;
protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life;
preserve the property values and character of surrounding
neighborhoods.

§ 240-2. Purpose and intent.
Based upon the findings stated above, it is the intended purpose of the
City to regulate adult-oriented establishments to promote the health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations for the operation thereof so as to
minimize secondary effects of these establishments on the community. The
provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor intent of imposing
a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including adult-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors
and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their intended market.
The promotion of obscene materials which is not protected by the First
Amendment is subject to criminal sanctions under the state's penal code.
§ 240-3. Definitions.
The following terms have the meanings indicated:
ADULT ARCADE  Any place to which the public is permitted or invited,
wherein coin, slug, electronically, or mechanically controlled or operated
still or motion picture machines, projectors, computers, or other imageproducing
devices are maintained to show images to five or fewer persons
per machine at any one time, and where the images so displayed are
distinguished or characterized by depicting or describing specified sexual
activities.
P. It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities
protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content-neutral
ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult-oriented
establishments.
Q. It is not the intent of the City Council to condone or legitimize the
promotion of obscene material, and the City Council recognizes that the
law prohibits the promotion of obscene materials. The City Council
expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce antiobscenity
laws against any such illegal activities in the City.
R. Restricted hours of operation will allow law enforcement personnel to
concentrate on crime prevention during high crime hours and/or low
staffing hours by relieving them of enforcement duties relative to
prostitution, loitering, and criminal activity associated with adultoriented
establishments.
S. Prohibition of alcohol beverages on the premises will reduce the need
for law enforcement resources to respond to alcohol related problems
upon the premises, will reduce high-risk sexual activity and will
contribute to the reduction of secondary effects of adult-oriented
establishments.

serving as an employee until the new license is granted.

1:161
does not apply to alarms or alarm systems installed for the sole purpose of
alerting occupants of a given building or structure to a potential hazard.
§ 246-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards and
regulations applicable to burglar, fire and holdup alarm systems, alarm
businesses and alarm users. Both society in general and public safety in
particular will be aided by providing a useful and usable system of private
security which properly balances quick response by law enforcement and
fire protection personnel with minimization of time spent on alarms which
are false or otherwise not the intended function of private security systems.
The intent of this chapter is to minimize the amount of unwarranted time
and effort expended by the various departments by responding to false
alarms and to provide for a more efficient operation of emergency service
by the City.
§ 246-3. Definitions.
Within this chapter, the following terms, phrases and words and their
derivations have the meanings given herein.
ALARM SYSTEM  Any assembly of equipment or devices which, by means
of its design, is intended to warn of a hazardous or criminal incident to
which public emergency services are expected to respond. The term "alarm
system" shall include, but is not limited to, burglar alarm systems, holdup
alarm systems, and fire alarm systems. If the system emits an audible signal
or a signal by means of a lighting device, it shall be within the definition of
an alarm system and shall be subject to this chapter. The system shall be of
the type that shall not cause false alarms to be emitted due to power failure.
ANSWERING SERVICE  A telephone answering service providing among
its services the service of receiving on a continuous basis through trained
employees emergency signals from alarm systems, and thereafter
immediately relaying the message by live voice to the dispatch center of the
Police, Fire or Ambulance Departments.
AUTOMATIC DIALING DEVICE  An alarm system which automatically
sends over regular telephone lines by direct connection or otherwise a
prerecorded voice message or coded signal indicating the existence of the
emergency situation that the alarm system is designed to detect.
DIRECT CONNECT SYSTEM  An alarm system which has the capability of
transmitting system signals to the Police Department or Fire Department.
FALSE ALARM  Any alarm signal, whether transmitted or relayed to the
Police Department, when an actual emergency does not exist.
FALSE ALARM  The activation of an alarm system through mechanical
failure, malfunction, improper installation or the negligence of the owner
or lessee of an alarm system or of his employees or agents or other
undetermined cause when an actual emergency does not exist. "False
§ 246-1 LAKE MILLS CODE § 246-3
1:162
alarm" does not include alarms caused by tornadoes or other violent
climatic conditions.
INTERCONNECT  To connect an alarm system to a voice grade telephone
line, either directly or through a mechanical device that utilizes a standard
telephone, for the purpose of using the telephone line to transmit an
emergency message upon the activation of the alarm system.

means of its design, is intended to warn of any variations in temperature,
humidity, water systems, electrical systems, sewage systems, or
communications systems.

rules as may be necessary for the implementation of this chapter. The
Council may, by resolution, adopt such rules from time to time.

telephone dialing device to the telephone lines of the Police Department or

§ 246-6. Direct connections to Police Department and Fire
Department.
Direct connections to the Police Department and Fire Department are
prohibited, unless such installation is approved by the Chief of Police or Fire
Chief, respectively. All direct connections permitted shall be in compliance
with the standards of this chapter and any related rules adopted by the City
Council.
§ 246-7. Testing.
A. No alarm business or alarm system designed to transmit emergency
messages to the Police Department or Fire Department shall be tested
or demonstrated without prior notification and approval of the Police
Department or Fire Department dispatcher. Alarm businesses or alarm

policies of the Police Department or Fire Department.
§ 246-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 246-8
1:163
§ 246-8. Fee for answering false alarms.
A. Generally. Each false alarm requires response of public safety
personnel, involves unnecessary expense to the City, increases the risk
of injury to persons or damage to property and diminishes the overall

public nuisance.
B. Intentional. No person shall intentionally cause the activation of an
alarm device knowing that no criminal activity, fire or other emergency
exists.

corporation or other entity possessing an alarm system with alarm
device(s) at one or more locations within the City shall pay to the City a

year. Separate accounts shall be kept for false alarms relating to
criminal activity and false alarms for fire or other emergencies:
(1) The City shall not charge for one false alarm activated during a
one-year period, such period of time to be from the date of the first
or initial alarm, and terminate 365 days later.
(2) Fees.

each three-hundred-sixty-five-day period according to the

A. The City Council of the City of Lake Mills finds that the initial issuance
fee of $10,000 for reserve "Class B" liquor licenses, which has been
mandated by laws of the State of Wisconsin, exceeds the actual cost of
licensing the activity, and the fee thereby generates additional revenue
for the City. The Council also finds that it is in the interest of the public
welfare to use this additional revenue to:
(1) Provide economic incentives for new businesses with "Class B"
liquor licenses to locate in the downtown area;
(2) Encourage licensees to improve the interior or exterior of licensed
premises that reuse or redevelop existing structures in the
downtown area;
(3) Attract tourists to the City; and
(4) Generally enhance the economic and cultural climate by
redeveloping existing structures in the downtown of the City.
B. Within one year after any reserve "Class B" combination liquor license
is granted for which the initial issuance fee of $10,000 has been paid to
the City Clerk, the licensee may file an application with the Clerk for an
economic development grant of up to $9,500. [Amended 12-18-2012
by Ord. No. 1103]
C. The applicant that meets the initial grant criteria under Subsection B
shall state in its grant application how it has met the eligibility criteria
for an economic development grant by stating which of the following
applies to its establishment:
(1) Location in the downtown area of the City, with the downtown area
meaning a property that fronts on Commons Park or that is located
within one block of Commons Park.
§ 249-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 249-10
1:177
(2) The applicant has improved the exterior of the structure since
applying for the license. Photographs that show the exterior before
and after the improvements should be included with the grant
application.
(3) The applicant has improved the interior of the structure since
applying for the license. Photographs that show the interior before
and after the improvements should be included with the grant
application.
D. The Clerk shall verify the accuracy of the information with respect to
the criteria listed in Subsections B and C, and shall determine the
amount of the grant for which the applicant may be eligible by
determining which of the following conditions have been met by the
applicant: [Amended 12-18-2012 by Ord. No. 1103]
(1) Locating in the downtown area shall be valued at $4,000 under the
grant.
(2) Improving the exterior of the structure shall be valued at $2,500
under the grant, provided the actual value of the improvements
completed, excluding signage, is equal to or greater than $2,500.
(3) Improving the interior of the structure shall be valued at $3,000
under the grant, provided the actual value of such improvements is
equal to or greater than $3,000.
E. The Clerk shall determine whether the licensee is operating in
compliance with the approved license. The Clerk may require the
recommendation of the Building Inspector, Police Chief, and Fire
Inspector in making such determination. If the Clerk determines that
the licensee is so operating, the Clerk shall authorize the approval of
the economic development grant in accordance with Subsections B, C
and D and in an amount not to exceed a maximum of $9,500.
[Amended 12-18-2012 by Ord. No. 1103]
F. If the Clerk determines that the applicant is not in compliance with the
approved license, or the applicant has not met the eligibility criteria
under Subsection B or C, no economic development grant may be
authorized and the Clerk shall provide the applicant with written notice
of such determination of noncompliance. [Amended 12-18-2012 by
Ord. No. 1103]
G. If the applicant disagrees with the Clerk's determination of
noncompliance or ineligibility, the applicant may file a written notice of
appeal within 10 business days with the Clerk, who shall relay the
notice of appeal to the City Council which shall hold a hearing at which
the Council may affirm or reverse the Clerk's determination.
[Amended 12-18-2012 by Ord. No. 1103]
H. If the Clerk's determination is upheld by the Council, appeal may be
made to circuit court pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 753.04. If the Clerk's
§ 249-10 LAKE MILLS CODE § 249-10
1:178
determination is reversed by the Council, the Clerk shall authorize the
payment of the economic development grant. [Amended 12-18-2012
by Ord. No. 1103]
I. If the applicant for a grant under this section has already received a
grant for any of the purposes listed in Subsection D, that applicant may
not receive any future grant money for the same purpose for which the
money has already been granted. If either the interior or the exterior of
the structure at which the licensed premises is located is improved
after receiving the reserve license, but a grant has already been
awarded for locating the business downtown, the applicant may still
apply for grant money for the improvements made, provided the
application is received within one year of the issuance of the reserve
liquor license.

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AT LARGE  To be off the premises of the owner and not under the control
of some person either by leash or otherwise restrained or confined to a

private property which may be about the owner's premises.
DOMESTICATED ANIMAL  An animal that does not possess a wild nature,
and such animal that has been developed by humans from a naturally
occurring species through long-term selective breeding of a captive
A. The City Council finds that it is necessary to regulate the ownership of
certain animals and to prohibit the possession of other animals because
of the City's interest in and duty to protect and promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of its residents.
B. The City Council finds that the ownership and certain treatment of
many animals are already regulated by the state, and where the state
statutes already address an area of regulation adequately, the City
Council finds it unnecessary to further regulate such matters through
the Municipal Code.
C. The City Council deems it necessary, however, to regulate in areas of
local concern where the state has not regulated the possession and
treatment of certain animals, and to promote and encourage
responsible pet ownership, while discouraging and deterring the
possession or treatment of animals which creates a nuisance or
potential threat to residents and their property.
D. The City Council finds that most animals within the City of Lake Mills
are the property of the State of Wisconsin, because they are wild
animals, and except for the purpose of prohibiting the private
ownership of such animals within the City, the Council's primary intent
in this chapter is to establish regulations applicable to the possession
and treatment of domesticated, non-wild animals.

moving of a building shall designate the route to be taken, the
conditions to be complied with and shall limit the time during which
said moving operations shall be continued.
B. Moving damaged buildings. No building shall be repaired, altered or
moved within or into the City that has deteriorated or has been
damaged by any cause (including such moving and separation from its

§ 279-8 LAKE MILLS CODE § 279-9
1:204
the Public Works Director, inspect the streets and highways over which
said building has been moved and ascertain their condition. If the
removal of said building has caused any damage to any street or
highway, the person to whom the permit was issued shall forthwith
place them in good repair as they were before the permit was granted.
On the failure of the said permittee to do so within 10 days thereafter
to the satisfaction of the governing body, said body shall repair the
damage done to such streets and hold the person obtaining such permit
and the sureties on his bond responsible for the payment of same.
E. Conformance with code. No permit shall be issued to move a building
within or into the City and to establish it upon a location within the City
until the Building Inspector has made an investigation of such building
at the location from which it is to be moved and is satisfied from such
investigation that said building is in a sound and stable condition and of
such construction that it will meet the requirements of this Building
Code in all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs,
improvements and remodeling, with reference to such building, shall be
submitted to the Building Inspector, and he shall make a finding of fact
to the effect that all such repairs, improvements and remodeling are in
conformity with the requirements of this Building Code and that when
same are completed, the building, as such, will so comply with said
Building Code. In the event a building is to be moved from the City to
some point outside of the boundaries thereof, the provisions, with
respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for proposed
alterations to such building, may be disregarded.
F. Bond.
(1) Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way
in this City, the party applying therefor shall give a bond to the City
in a sum, to be fixed by the Building Inspector, and which shall not
be less than $25,000. Said bond is to be executed by a corporate
surety or two personal sureties to be approved by the governing
body or designated agent conditioned upon, among other things,
the indemnification to the City for any costs or expenses incurred
by it in connection with any claims for damages to any persons or
property, and the payment of any judgment, together with the costs
or expenses incurred by the City in connection therewith, arising
out of the removal of the building for which the permit is issued.
(2) Unless the Building Inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to be
a fact that the excavation exposed by the removal of such building
from its foundation shall not be so close to a public thoroughfare as
to permit the accidental falling therein of travelers or the location,
nature and physical characteristics of the premises and the falling
into such excavation by children under 12 years of age unlikely, the
bond required by Subsection F(1) shall be further conditioned upon
the permittee erecting adequate barriers and within 48 hours,
filling in such excavation or adopting and employing such other
means, devices or methods approved by the Building Inspector and
§ 279-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 279-9
1:205

less than $1,000,000, together with property damage insurance in a
amount not less $500,000, or such other coverage as deemed
necessary.

include exterior elevations of the building and accurate
photographs of all sides and views of the same and in case it is
proposed to alter the exterior of said building, plans and
specifications of such proposed alterations and after a view of the
building proposed to be moved and of the site at which it is to be
located, that the exterior architectural appeal and functional plans
of the building to be moved or moved and altered, will not be so at
variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and
functional plan of the buildings already constructed or in the
course of construction in the immediate neighborhood or in the
character of the applicable district established by the zoning
ordinances of the City or any ordinance amendatory thereof or
supplementary thereto, as to cause a substantial depreciation in
the property values of said neighborhood within said applicable
district. In case the applicant proposes to alter the exterior of said
building after moving the same, he shall submit, with his
application papers, complete plans and specifications for the
proposed alterations. Before a permit shall be issued for a building
to be moved and altered, the applicant shall give a bond to the
City's Planning Commission, which shall not be less than $1,000 to
be executed in the manner provided in Subsection F hereof to the
effect that he will, within a time to be set by the Planning
Commission, complete the proposed exterior alterations to said
building in the manner set forth in his plans and specifications. This
bond shall be in addition to any other bond or surety which may be
required by other applicable ordinances of the City. No occupancy
permit shall be issued for said building until the exterior alterations
proposed to be made have been completed.
(2) Upon application being made to the Building Inspector, he shall
request a meeting of the Planning Commission to consider
applications for moving permits which he has found comply, in all
respects, with all other ordinances of the City. The Planning

permit in question and/or the owner of the lot on which it is
proposed to locate the building in question, together with any other

There is hereby established a uniform system of numbering houses and
buildings fronting on all streets, avenues and public ways in the City, and all
houses and buildings shall be numbered in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
§ 286-2. Numbering system designated.
A. Street designation. Lake Street shall constitute the base line for
numbering along all streets running north and south, and Main Street
shall constitute the base line for numbering along all streets running
west and east.

numbers within the first block shall be from 100 to 199 and the
numbers in each succeeding block shall increase from the base line
in units of 100, namely the first block shall be 100 through 199, the
second block shall be 200 through 299, the third block shall be 300

number shall be assigned to each 25 feet of frontage. In blocks or
equivalent space longer than 750 feet which is not intersected by a
street, if extended, the total length of space divided by 25 shall be
used to determine the feet of frontage assigned to each number.
(2) Where blocks of different lengths occur on opposite sides of a
street, the numbers on both sides shall be assigned on the basis of
the shorter blocks, unless the City Manager otherwise determines.
C. Lot and building numbering.
(1) All lots and houses on the north and west sides of all streets shall
be numbered with odd numbers, each commending with the
hundred assigned to that block, and shall increase from the base
line one number for each 25 feet of frontage or fraction thereof,
except as provided in Subsection B above. Where any building has
more than one door serving a separate occupant, providing the
building is 25 feet or more in width. If the building is not 25 feet or
more in width and the entrances are not that far apart, the next
consecutive number shall be marked fractional. Buildings fronting
on two or more streets shall have a number assigned only to the
main entrance, unless other entrances serve different occupants.
(2) Where only one number can be assigned to any house or building,
the owner, occupant or agent of such house or building, who shall
desire distinctive numbers for the upper and lower portion of any
such house or building, or for any part of such house or building,
fronting on any street, shall use the suffix "A," "B," "C," etc., as may
be required.
D. All streets not extending through to the base line shall be assigned the
same relative numbers as if the said street had extended to the said
base line.
A. The City Council shall cause the necessary survey to be made and there
shall be assigned to each house and building located on any street,
avenue, alley or highway in the City, its respective number under the
uniform system provided for in this chapter. When the said survey shall
have been completed and each house and building has been assigned to
its respective number or numbers, the owner, occupant or agent shall
place or cause to be placed upon each house or building controlled by
him the number or numbers assigned under the uniform system
provided for in this chapter.
B. Such number or numbers shall be placed within 20 days after the
assigning of the proper number. Replacements of numbers shall be
procured for and by the owner. The numbers used shall be not less than
three inches in height.
§ 286-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-3
1:237
§ 286-4. Numbering required.
Whenever any house, building or structure shall be erected or located in
the City after the entire work of establishing a uniform system of house
numbering has been completed, in order to preserve the continuity and
uniformity of numbers of the houses, buildings and structures, it shall be the
duty of the owner to procure the correct number or numbers as designated
from the Building Inspector for the said property and to immediately fasten
the said number or numbers so assigned upon said building, as provided
by this chapter. No building permit shall be issued for any house, building
or structure until the owner has procured from the Building Inspector the
official number of the premises.
§ 286-5. Map maintained. [Amended 12-18-2012 by Ord. No. 1103]
For the purpose of facilitating a correct numbering, a map of all streets,
avenues and public highways within the City showing the proper numbers
of all lots or houses fronting upon all streets, avenues or highways shall be
kept on file in the office of the Clerk or Engineer. This map shall be open to
inspection of all persons during the office hours of the Clerk.
§ 286-6. Enforcement.
C. The numbers shall be conspicuously placed immediately above, on or at
the side of the proper door of each building so that the number can be
seen plainly from the street. Whenever any building is situated more
than 50 feet from the street line, the number of such building shall be
conspicuously displayed at the street line, near the walk, driveway or
common entrance to such building and upon the gate post, fence, tree,
post or other appropriate place so as to be easily discernible from the
sidewalk.
D. It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to inform any party
applying therefor of the number or numbers belonging or embraced
within the limits of said lot or property as provided in this chapter. In
case of doubt as to the proper number as to be assigned to any lot or
building, the Building Inspector shall determine the number of such lot
or building.
A. It shall be the duty of all police officers of the City to report violations of
this chapter.
B. If the owner or occupant of any building required to be numbered by
this chapter shall neglect for the period of 20 days to duly attach and
maintain the proper number on such building, the Chief of Police shall
serve upon him a notice requiring such owner or occupant to properly

notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken place, and
the provisions of this subsection governing the consent of the Council to
such change shall apply.
G. The grantee shall, at all times during the operation of this franchise, be
subject to all lawful exercise of the police power as may be hereafter

B. The grantee shall, at its own expense, extend CATV service to new
housing units developed within the City within six months of occupancy.
A. A Cable Television System Regulatory Board consisting of seven
members which shall be appointed by the City Council is hereby
created. The Regulatory Board shall be known as the "Lake Mills CATV
Regulatory Board." Upon creation of the Board, two Board members
shall be appointed for one-year terms; two Board members shall be
appointed for two-year terms; and three Board members shall be
appointed for three-year terms. Thereafter, all members shall be
appointed for three-year terms. In the event a Joint Regulatory Board is
created as provided in Subsection B of this section, the members of that
Board shall be appointed annually by the City Council.
B. In the event any town whose boundaries are located entirely or partially
within the Lake Mills Power and Light District shall adopt an ordinance
in substantially the same form as this chapter, which ordinance shall
also provide for a regulatory board, and in the further event that said
town or towns provide for the creation of a joint regulatory board, then
in that event the Regulatory Board created hereunder shall be known as
the Lake Mills Joint CATV Regulatory Board. Each municipality
participating in the Lake Mills Joint CATV Regulatory Board shall make
appointments to the Board in accordance with the following formula:
The number of Board members to which each municipality shall be
entitled shall be determined by multiplying the total number of Board
members by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
dwelling units located in a given municipality which units have
subscribed to the CATV service, and the denominator of which shall be
the total number of dwelling units in the municipalities who are
appointing members to the Lake Mills Joint CATV Regulatory Board,
which dwelling units have subscribed to the CATV service. If the
product resulting from application of the foregoing formula is not a
whole number, then the product shall be rounded off to the nearest
whole number. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, each municipality appointing members to the Lake Mills Joint
CATV Regulatory Board shall be entitled to at least one representative
on said Board.
C. Annually, the City Council shall approve the budget of the Lake Mills
CATV Regulatory Board of the Lake Mills Joint CATV Regulatory Board,
as the case may be. The Board shall operate on a fiscal year beginning
on January 1 and concluding on the following December 31. In the event
of the creation of a Lake Mills Joint CATV Regulatory Board, the budget
for such Board shall be approved by all participating municipalities, and
each participating municipality shall contribute proportionately to the
annual budget. The proportionate share of the annual budget which
shall be contributed by each municipality shall be determined by
multiplying the total proposed budget by a fraction, the numerator of
§ 311-8 LAKE MILLS CODE § 311-9
1:246
which shall be the number of dwelling units located in a given
municipality which units have subscribed to the CATV service, and the
denominator of which shall be the total number of dwelling units in
the municipalities who are contributing to the budget which dwelling
units have subscribed to the CATV service. At the conclusion of each
fiscal year or at the termination of the Lake Mills Joint CATV Regulatory
Board should that occur during a fiscal year, any budgeted but unspent
funds shall be returned to the participating municipalities on a prorated
basis.
D. The functions and duties of the Lake Mills CATV Regulatory Board or
Lake Mills Joint CATV Regulatory Board, as the case may be, shall be as
follows:
(1) To resolve disputes or disagreements between subscribers and the
grantee after investigation should the subscriber and grantee not
first be able to resolve their dispute or disagreement.
(2) To receive and audit reports submitted to the City as required by
this chapter, as well as such other correspondence as may be
submitted to the City concerning the operation of the CATV service
so as to insure that the necessary reports are completed and filed
pursuant to the terms of this chapter.
(3) To review rules and regulations adopted by the grantee incident to
providing service to subscribers.
(4) To assure that all tariffs, rates and rules pertinent to the operation
of the CATV service in the City are made available for inspection by
the public at reasonable hours and upon reasonable request.
(5) To review rates and recommend any change to the City Council as
provided herein.
(6) To plan and develop production and programming on any dedicated
access channels.
(7) To solicit, review and provide recommendations to the City Council
to insure compliance with this chapter.
(8) To insure that the grantee makes public access channels available
to all residents of the City on a nondiscriminatory basis and to
advise the grantee on procedural rules for this purpose.
(9) To assure that the operation of the public access channels are free
of program censorship.
(10) To perform such other duties as the City Council may assign, or as
may be otherwise provided herein.
(11) To annually prepare and submit an operating budget to the
approving municipalities.

1:247
§ 311-10. Removal of equipment.
§ 311-11. Joint use by City and utilities.
(12) To adopt rules of operation, including rules relating to financial
matters such as place of depository for board finances, method of
authorization of expenditures, and so on.
E. The Lake Mills CATV Regulatory Board shall be authorized to expend
such funds as had been approved in its operation budget for the
maintenance and improvement of the system. No funds may be
expended except as had been approved by the participating
municipalities as evidenced by the annual operating budget.
F. Any assets held by the Lake Mills CATV Joint Regulatory Board at the
termination of that Board's existence shall be sold or otherwise
disposed of at the highest possible price, and the net proceeds received
from the sale or disposition of such assets shall be returned to the
participating municipalities in proportion to each participating
municipality's contribution to the Board's annual budget as averaged
over the three-year period next preceding termination of the Board.
A. Following the grantee's commencement of service through Andover of
its CATV system, the grantee, upon request of the City Council, shall
promptly remove from the public streets or City properties where they
are located all or any part of the facilities so located when one or more
of the following enumerated conditions occur:
(1) The grantee ceases to provide a substantial continuous amount of
the services required in this chapter for a period of three months.
(2) The grantee fails to construct said system as provided herein.
(3) The franchise expires, or is revoked pursuant to notice as provided
herein.
B. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the City
shall provide grantee with written notice delivered to the local office of
the grantee setting forth one or more of the occurrences herein
enumerated, and scheduling a public hearing to be held by the Lake
Mills CATV Regulatory Board. No action shall be taken by the City
Council until after receipt and consideration of the recommendation of
the Lake Mills CATV Regulatory Board.
C. Any order issued by the City Council providing for the removal of
property owned by the grantee shall specify a date for removal, which
date shall be at least seven days next following service of the order
upon the grantee. If the grantee fails to comply with the order, the City
shall be entitled to remove the personal property of the grantee, and
shall be entitled to reimbursement for all costs so incurred.

reasonable, practicable and upon payment of reasonable rental
therefor; provided, that in the absence of agreement regarding such
joint use, the City Council shall provide for arbitration of the terms and
conditions of such joint use and the compensation to be paid therefor,
which award shall be final. This City shall, in accordance with the
authority granted by Chapter 196, Wisconsin Statutes, provide
reasonable access to utility poles and utility easement areas in order to

Board to hold a public hearing on the application for renewal. The
public hearing shall be conducted, and a finding and recommendation
of the Lake Mills CATV Regulatory Board shall be forwarded to the City
Council within 60 days thereof. After receipt of the findings and
recommendations of the Lake Mills CATV Regulatory Board, the City
Council shall proceed to determine whether the grantee has
satisfactorily performed its obligations under the franchise. To
determine satisfactory performance, the Council shall consider
technical developments and performance of the system, programming,
other services offered, cost of services and any other matters relevant
to the operation and performance of the grantee. The Council shall
consider the grantee's annual reports made to the City and the FCC and
industry performance on a national basis.
D. The City Council shall determine whether the grantee's application for

that period of time shall not constitute an automatic renewal of the
§ 311-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 311-12
1:249
§ 311-13. Initial system installation schedule.
franchise. If the Council finds the grantee's performance satisfactory,
a new franchise will be granted pursuant to this section, as may be
amended from time to time, for a period not to exceed 10 years.

according to the franchising procedures adopted by the Council.
A. The grantee shall make application to the Federal Communications
Commission for all licenses and permits required by the Federal

vacation, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of
street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines
and tracks or any other type of structure or improvement when
required by the City Council. Any property or equipment owned or used
by the grantee no longer needed in connection with the system shall be
removed by the grantee at its own expense.
K. All installations by the grantee of cables and incidental equipment shall
comply in all respects with all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of

enact reasonable regulations regarding the installation and
maintenance of the facilities of the grantee.

who so request such switching devices as are necessary to permit a
subscriber to use the subscriber's own antenna. Such devices shall

state of the art and with no interference to signals received by the
subscriber off the air.
Q. The City, in its use and maintenance of such wires and fixtures of the

costs as provided in § 311-14 of this chapter. The grantee shall provide
a performance bond in an amount to be set by the Council to insure
payment for such removal.
T. It shall be the right of all subscribers to receive all available services
insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are
honored. In the event that the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild,
modify, or sell the system, or the Council gives notice of intent to
terminate or failure to review this franchise, the grantee shall act so as
to insure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service
regardless of the circumstances.
U. The grantee may be required to interconnect its system with any other
broadband communications facility. Such interconnection shall be made
within the time limit established by the Council. The interconnection
shall, at the Council's discretion, be accomplished according to the
method and technical standards determined by the Council, in a
manner consistent with applicable FCC standards.
A. When the franchise is revoked pursuant to this chapter, or expires and
is not renewed, the City shall have the right to acquire the grantee's
cable system. Should the City decide to purchase the cable system, it
shall do so at a price not to exceed its then fair value. In determining
the fair value of the system, the original cost of all tangible and
intangible property, as well as the salvage value, the book value, the
replacement cost, the cash flow, and other factors may be considered.
Under no circumstances shall any valuation be made for "good will" or
for any right or privilege granted by these franchise regulations.
Payment for the cable system shall be rendered to the grantee within
120 days after the City has exercised its rights in this area.
B. In the event the determination of fair value cannot be negotiated or
determined, said value shall be determined by an impartial arbitration
procedure pursuant to Chapter 788, Wis. Stats., wherein the grantee
and the City shall each choose an arbitrator and the arbitrators chosen
shall choose the third and the valuation determined by said arbitrators
shall be considered the fair value at which the system will be offered to
the City. The determination of the value of the system shall be
decreased by the amount of any damages sustained by the City in
connection with revocation or expiration, including without limitation,
§ 311-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 311-15
1:253
§ 311-16. Rates.

the system for a temporary period after revocation. The cost of the
arbitration procedure shall be shared equally between the City and the
grantee.
C. The City shall have 90 days to exercise the right of first refusal to
purchase the system, said ninety-day period commencing on the day the
fair market value of the system is determined either through
negotiation or the arbitration procedure. If the City does not exercise
its option to purchase and the system is not sold to another operator
who has obtained a franchise from the City in a reasonable period of
time, the grantee, upon request by the City, shall promptly remove all
its plant, structures and equipment; provided, however, that in the
event the City determines not to exercise its right of first refusal it shall
not unreasonably refuse to renew or grant a cable television franchise
during a reasonable interim period. While transfer of the system and
franchise is being negotiated, arranged or ordered, the grantee may be
required to continue service to the public unless for reasons beyond the
control of the grantee said operation will be economically unfeasible to
the grantee.
A. Rate schedule.
(1) The rates charged to subscribers shall be fair and reasonable so as
to allow the grantee a reasonable return on its investment, but in
all events, said rates shall be determined and approved by the City
Council.
(2) The initial rate schedule shall be approved by the City at the time of
the granting of the franchise. Thereafter, the rate schedule
approved by the City at the granting of the franchise shall remain in
effect for the first two years of operation of the system. For the
purpose of determining the two-year time period under this
subsection, the operation shall be deemed to have commenced one
year after the date of award of the franchise, or at such time as
construction necessary to make cable television service available to
50% of the homes in the City has been completed, whichever shall
first occur. Completion of construction shall include not only the
required installation of equipment, but shall be interpreted to
require the satisfactory receipt of all signals by subscribers.
(3) _____
(a) No increase in rates shall be allowed unless a written notice
shall first be given by the grantee to the City at least 90 days
prior to the proposed effective date for the increase. Upon
receipt of a request for increase of rates, the City shall refer
the matter to the Lake Mills CATV Regulatory Board for review
and recommendation. The City Council shall determine
§ 311-15 LAKE MILLS CODE § 311-16

whether or not a public hearing shall be held to consider
such proposed rate increase; provided, however, that the City
Council may direct the Lake Mills CATV Regulatory Board
to hold said public hearing if it deems such a hearing to be
appropriate. Any request for a rate increase by the grantee
shall include the following current financial reports, which
shall reflect the operations of the City cable television system:
[1] Balance sheet.
[2] Income statement.
[3] Cash flow statement.
[4] Statement of sources and application of funds.
[5] Detailed supporting schedules of expenses, income, assets
and other items as may be required.
[6] Statement of current and projected subscribers and
penetration.
(b) The grantee's accounting records applicable to the City system
shall be available for inspection by the City at all times. The
City shall have access to records of financial transactions for
the purpose of verifying burden rates or other indirect costs
prorated to the City operation. The documents listed above
shall include sufficient detail and/or footnotes as may be
necessary to provide the City with the information needed to
make accurate determinations as to the financial condition of
the system. All financial statements shall be certified as
accurate by an officer of the grantee.
(4) After consideration of the information supplied and after public
hearing, the City Council, in its sole discretion, may approve the
rate increase, deny the rate increase, or, if more than one type of
rate is requested to be increased, approve the increase in part and
deny the increase in part. The criteria for the City Council's
decision in such matters shall be the establishment of rates which
are "fair and reasonable" to both the grantee and its subscribers
and shall be generally defined as the minimum rate necessary to
meet all applicable costs of service, including fair return on all
invested capital, assuming efficient and economical management.
B. Miscellaneous provisions.
(1) Advance charges.
(a) The grantee may require subscribers to pay for each month of
basic service and FM service in advance at the beginning of
each month. No other advance payment or deposit of any kind
shall be required by the grantee for basic subscriber service.
No deposit or advance payment of any kind shall be charged
§ 311-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 311-16
1:255
for the provision of any converter without prior approval of
the City Council. Additional advance payments may be made
available, as an option, by the grantee to subscribers. Nothing
in this provision shall be construed to prohibit charges for
initial installation and reconnection.
(b) The grantee may make available or require advance charges or
deposits for various additional services, provided that the City
Council has authorized such charges or deposits, pursuant to
§ 311-16A of this chapter.
(2) Termination of service:
(a) If any subscriber fails to pay a properly due monthly subscriber
fee, or any other properly due fee or charge, the grantee may
disconnect the subscriber's service outlet. Such disconnection
shall not be effected until 10 days after adequate written notice
of the intent to disconnect has been delivered to the subscriber
in question. After disconnection, upon payment of the
delinquent fee or charge and the payment of a reconnection
charge, the grantee shall promptly reinstate the subscriber's
cable service.
(b) Upon termination of service to any subscriber, the grantee
shall promptly remove all of its facilities and equipment from
the premises of such subscriber upon his written request. The
service will be disconnected at the poles if aboveground or at
the connection box if underground so that such disconnection
shall be outside rather than inside the home. For multiplefamily
dwellings, such disconnection shall be made in the
basement or other appropriate service area outside the living
area itself. Any such removal shall be at no cost to the
subscriber.
(3) Refunds to subscribers and programmers.
(a) If the grantee fails to provide any material service requested
by a subscriber or programmer, the grantee shall, after
adequate notification and being afforded the opportunity to
provide the service promptly, refund all deposits or advance
charges paid for service in question by said subscriber or
programmer.
(b) If any subscriber terminates any monthly service during the
first 12 months of said service because of the failure of the
grantee to render the service in accordance with the standards
set forth in this franchise, the grantee shall refund to such
subscriber an amount equal to the monthly service charge
multiplied by the fraction of the twelve-month period for which
the subscriber will not be receiving service.

1:256
§ 311-17. Service of municipal and public buildings.
The grantee shall provide, without charge, one outlet to the City office
building, the public library and all public and parochial schools in the City
that are passed by its cable. If more than one outlet is required at any of said
locations, the grantee shall install same at the cost of time and materials
only and in no event will there be a monthly service charge at such location.
§ 311-18. Franchise payments.
A. For use of the streets and other facilities of the City for the operation of
the cable communication system and for supervision thereof by the City,
the grantee shall pay to the City an amount equal to 3% of the grantee's

payable 1/2 thereof at the end of each semiannual period. The
semiannual anniversary shall be the last day of June and the last day of
December of each year, and each semiannual payment shall be paid
within 60 days thereafter.

financial information in regard to the grantee as may be required by the
City.
C. The City shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income records
and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under this section; provided, however, that such audit shall
take place within 12 months following the close of each of the grantee's
fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the City as a result of the
audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the
grantee by the City which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
D. In the event that any franchise payment, recomputed amount or other
payment is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore
specified, interest shall be charged from such date at the prevailing
prime interest rate as that rate is set by the First Wisconsin Bank of
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
E. Payments of compensation made by the grantee to the City pursuant to
the provisions of this section shall not be considered in the nature of a
tax but shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are now or
hereafter required to be paid by any law of the United States, the State
of Wisconsin, the City of Lake Mills or Jefferson County.
F. In the event this franchise shall be terminated or forfeited prior to the
end of the basic fifteen-year term, the grantee shall, within 30 days,
submit to the City Council a financial statement prepared as above

required percentage of gross annual receipts, and the grantee shall
pay to the City not later than 30 days following the termination of the
franchise a like percentage of such gross receipts.
A. Grantee shall maintain a business office and telephone listing in the
Lake Mills area for the purpose of receiving inquiries and complaints

complaints within 48 hours of their receipt and shall in good faith
attempt to resolve them within 48 hours after notice. Grantee shall
maintain a record of each complaint and shall grant the City access to
such records and shall include a statement regarding the resolution or
nonresolution of the complaint supported by reasons for the action
taken.
B. Grantee shall provide a customer service office which shall be located
in the Lake Mills area, so that service response can be on a twenty-fourhour
basis at no charge.
C. In the event of the failure by the grantee to resolve complaints, the
CATV Regulatory Board and City Council may review complaints, other
than those relating to program content. Failure of the grantee to
resolve complaints may also be cause for revocation of the franchise.
D. In all brochures and other written material, the grantee shall state the
fact that a complaint procedure has been established and shall state the
mailing address and telephone number of the office handling inquiries
and complaints, as well as the municipal officer to whom such inquiries
and complaints shall be directed.
E. When there have been similar complaints made or where there exists
other evidence which, in the judgment of the City Council, casts doubt
on the reliability or quality of cable service, the City Council shall have
the right and authority to compel the grantee to test, analyze and report
on the performance of the system at the expense of the grantee. Such
test or tests shall be made and the reports of such test or tests shall be
delivered to the City no later than 14 days after the City Council
formally notifies the grantee. Such report shall include the following
information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special
test; what system component was tested; the equipment used and
procedures employed in said testing; the results of such tests; and the
method in which such complaints were resolved. Any other information
pertinent to the special test shall be recorded.
(1) Said tests and analyses shall be supervised by a professional
engineer, not on the permanent staff of the grantee. The aforesaid
engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the
City such records with a report interpreting the result of the tests
and recommending actions to be taken by the City.

1:258
§ 311-20. Construction of system.
§ 311-21. Liability of grantee; insurance and indemnity.
(2) The City's right under this provision shall be limited to requiring
the tests, analyses, and reports covering specific subjects and
characteristics based on said complaints or other evidence when
and under such circumstances as the City has reasonable grounds
to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests
be performed to protect the public against substandard cable
service.
F. The City Council may establish rules and regulations which provide for
fines to be levied against the grantee when, in the judgment of the City
Council, the grantee has failed to satisfactorily perform according to
the terms of this section.
A. The grantee shall, within 60 days of the date of the award of the
franchise, perform and submit all required registrations and application
with the appropriate governmental agencies regulating able systems.
B. The grantee shall, within 90 days of the date of the award of the
franchise, furnish to the City complete plans and specifications for the
construction of its plant and distribution system for approval by the
City.
C. Failure to comply with any of the time limits by the grantee as set forth
in this section, unless such time limits are extended by the City Council,
shall be grounds for revocation of the franchise.
D. The grantee shall make provisions in the installation of its system to
provide for connection with other systems where such service is
available.
E. The grantee shall make no material change in the operation of the
system from that approved by the City Council in granting the franchise
except upon prior written approval of the City Council. At least two
weeks prior to making a request for a material change in operations,
the grantee shall cause to be published in the official City newspaper
prominent notice of the request, including a description of the nature of
the changes and a concise statement for the reasons therefore.
A. The grantee shall indemnify and save the City, its agents and employees
harmless from and against all loss, liability, damage and expenses,
including attorneys' fees, sustained by the City on account of any suit,
judgment, execution, claim or demand arising out of the installation,
operation or maintenance of the cable communication system
authorized herein, whether or not any act or omission complained of is
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this section and any franchise
granted hereunder; including, but not limiting said indemnity to, claims
for personal injuries, death or property damages, expense of
§ 311-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 311-21
1:259
investigation and litigation or claims and suits arising hereunder, and
claims based on copyright violation or infringements or violation of
proprietary rights.
B. The grantee shall carry and at all times maintain on file with the City
Clerk and at all times keep in force a public liability policy of insurance,
insuring such grantee and the City against any and all liability arising
from such installation and/or operation, with limits of liability of not less
than $500,000 for property damage and $1,000,000 for any one person
for personal injury, death, or other damages attributable to the
installation and/or operation of the cable communication system. Such
policies of insurance or certificates thereof by a company licensed to do
business in the State of Wisconsin shall be filed with the City Clerk prior
to the commencement of installation. Such policy or certificate shall
provide that the City shall be notified 30 days in advance of the
cancellation or termination of the policy. The City Council reserves the
right to approve the policy and increase minimum limits of liability
based upon inflationary factors and other causes to be determined by
the City Council.
C. The grantee, upon receipt of due notice in writing from the City, shall
defend at its own expense any action or proceeding against the City in
which it is claimed that injury or damages arose from the grantee's
activities or failure to act in the installation, maintenance or operation
of its cable communication system.
D. Surety bond.
(1) The grantee shall maintain and, by its acceptance of this franchise,
specifically agree, that it will maintain throughout the term of this
franchise a faithful performance bond running to the City with a
good and sufficient surety approved by the City Attorney in the sum
of $100,000 conditioned that the grantee shall well and truly
observe, fulfill and perform each term and condition of this
franchise and of the grantee's proposal and that in case of any
breach, the City shall be entitled to recover from the principal and
sureties thereof the amount of all damages including all costs and
attorney's fees incurred by the City proximately resulting from the
failure of the grantee to well and faithfully observe and perform any
and all of the provisions of this franchise. After the grantee has
provided service to all residents of the City requesting such
service, and the system is approved by the City Council, the
grantee may make application to the City Council for reduction of
its bond and if the City Council approves the installation of the
system and is satisfied that all residents of the City requesting
service have been provided such service by the grantee, the City
Council may reduce the amount of such bond but is not required to
do so.
(2) No recovery by the City of any sum by reason of the bond required
herein shall be any limitation upon the liability of the grantee to the
§ 311-21 LAKE MILLS CODE § 311-21
1:260
§ 311-22. Additional requirements.
The grantee shall comply with all conditions imposed by the Federal
Communications Commission and by the State of Wisconsin. Failure to
obtain any required licenses or to comply with all such conditions shall
be grounds to revoke the franchise without liability assigned to the City.
Copies of all documents filed with other government bodies, including but
not limited to the FCC and the State of Wisconsin, shall be furnished to the
City concurrently.
§ 311-23. Revocation of franchise.
City, except that the sum received by the City be reason of the bond
required herein shall be deducted from any recovery which the City
might have against the grantee.
A. In addition to all the rights and powers reserved by the City, the City
expressly reserves the right to revoke, terminate and cancel the
franchise and all rights and privileges to the grantee hereunder in the
event that:
(1) The grantee violates any material provision of this chapter, any
material provision of the grantee's proposal, the grant of franchise,
or any rule, order or determination of the City made pursuant to
this chapter, except where such violation is without fault or through
excusable neglect;
(2) The grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its
debts, or is adjudged a bankrupt;
(3) A receiver or trustee has, at least 120 days beforehand, been
appointed to take over and conduct the business of the grantee,
whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other
action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall
have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or
unless:
(a) Within 120 days after his election or appointment, such
receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the
provisions of this chapter and remedied all defaults
thereunder; and
(b) Such receiver or trustee, within 120 days, shall have executed
an agreement, duly approved by the court having jurisdiction
in the premises, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and
agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this chapter;
or
(4) There has been a change in the control of the grantee without first
obtaining written consent of the City Council, or where such
consent has been sought and denied or not given;
§ 311-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 311-23
1:261
(5) The grantee attempts to evade any of the material provisions of this
chapter or practices any fraud or deceit upon the City; or
(6) The grantee fails to have service available to all of the residential
structures in all areas of the City.
B. Such revocation, termination and cancellation shall occur only after
public hearing has been conducted by the City Council. The City
Council may, but is not required, to refer such matters to the CATV
Regulatory Board for review and recommendation. If as a result of said
public hearing, the City Council approves and recommends revocation,
termination and cancellation, the City Council shall provide written
notice of its decision to the grantee. The written notice shall include a
statement specifying the steps, procedures of acts which the grantee
must undertake to perform in order to avoid revocation, termination or
cancellation. In the event the grantee strictly complies with each step,
procedure or action required by the City Council, the revocation,
termination and cancellation shall not take effect. In the event the
grantee fails to strictly comply with each step, procedure or act
required of the City Council, the revocation, termination and
cancellation shall take effect at the expiration of 30 days after receipt of
the written notice without further notice of the grantee. Such
revocation, termination and cancellation shall in no way affect any of
the City's rights under this chapter or any provision of law. In the event
that such revocation, termination and cancellation depends upon a
finding of fact, such finding of fact, as made by the City Council, shall be
conclusive; provided, however, that before the franchise may be
revoked, terminated and cancelled under this section, the grantee must
be provided with an opportunity to be heard before the City Council.
C. In the event that the City revokes, terminates and cancels this
franchise, pursuant to the appropriate provision of this chapter, the City
shall have the right to purchase the grantee's cable system in
accordance with the provisions of § 311-15 of this chapter. After
purchasing the grantee's cable system, the City shall have the right to
sell said system to another operator if the City so chooses.
D. Whenever this franchise shall set forth any time for any act to be
performed by or on behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of
the essence and any failure of the grantee to perform within time
allotted shall be sufficient grounds for the City to revoke this franchise.
E. If grounds for the revocation of this franchise exist, the City Council
may pass a resolution imposing any penalty or sanction, not amounting
to revocation, upon the grantee; provided, that said penalty or sanction
not amounting to revocation is agreed upon by both the grantee and the
City Council. If no agreement is reached between the grantee and the
City Council, the City Council shall decide whether or not to revoke the
grantee's franchise.

1:262
§ 311-24. Preferential or discriminatory practices prohibited.
The grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate
against subscribers, programmers, or general citizens on the basis of race,
color, religion, national origin, creed, or sex. Nothing in this provision shall
be construed to prohibit the reduction or waiving of charges in conjunction
with promotional campaigns for the purpose of attracting subscribers, nor
shall this provision be interpreted to prohibit the establishment of a
graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any
subscriber or programmer included within a particular classification shall
be entitled.
§ 311-25. Right of privacy.
The grantee shall not reveal to any third party any information or data
concerning any specific subscriber. Any information or date revealed to
third parties shall be limited to gross data relating to all subscribers,
without identification as to individual subscribers.

which the grantee proposed to devote to local programming, the types
of local programs it proposes to originate and a provision that the
grantee shall submit to the City Council each year a proposed

Administration and Enforcement
§ 402-5. Inspections.
The Building Inspector may make inspections to determine the condition
of dwellings, dwelling units, and premises located within the City, in order
that they may perform their duty of safeguarding the health and safety of
the occupants of dwellings and of the general public. For the purpose of
making such inspections, the Building Inspector may enter, examine, and
survey, at proper times after due notice, all dwelling units, rooming units
and premises. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, or
the person in charge thereof, shall give the Building Inspector access to
such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit and its premises, at proper
times after due notice, for the purpose of such inspection, examination and
survey. Every occupant of a dwelling unit or dwelling shall give the owner
thereof or his agent or employee, access to any part of such dwelling or
dwelling unit, or its premises, at all reasonable times for the purpose of
making such repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance
with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 402-6. Enforcement; orders, hearings.
A. Notice. Whenever the Building Inspector determines that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any
such provision which affects the safety of any such occupants or the
safety of the general public, the Building Inspector shall give notice of
such alleged violation to the person or persons responsible therefor,
and to any known agent of such person, as thereinafter provided. Such
notice shall:
(1) Be put in writing;
(2) Include a statement of the reasons why it is being issued;
(3) Allow a reasonable time for the performance of any act it requires;
(4) Be served upon the owner or his agent, or the occupant, as the case
may require; provided, that such notice shall be deemed to be
properly served upon such owner or agent, or upon such occupant,
if a copy thereof is sent by registered mail to his last known
address, or if a copy thereof is posted in a conspicuous place in or
about the dwelling affected by the notice, or he is served with such
notice by any other method authorized or required under the laws
of the State of Wisconsin;
(5) Such notice must contain an outline of remedial action which, if
taken, will effect compliance with this chapter.
B. Hearing. Any person affected by any such notice issued by the Building
Inspector may request and shall be granted a hearing on the matter
before the Zoning Board of Appeals, provided such person shall file with
§ 402-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 402-6
1:315
§ 402-7. Violations and penalties; reinspection fees. [Amended
4-6-2010 by Ord. No. 1061A]
Any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter or any order, rule
or regulation made hereunder shall be subject to an applicable penalty as
provided in § 1-19 or Chapter 80, Article IV, of this Code. If a complaint
of a violation of the requirements in this chapter or Chapter 279, Building
Construction; Chapter 286, Buildings, Numbering of; Chapter 292,
Buildings, Unsafe; or Chapter 581, Swimming Pools, is received, it shall be
handled as follows:
the Building Inspector and the Zoning Board of Appeals, within 30 days
of the receipt of such notice, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds
thereof. The Zoning Board of Appeals, upon receipt of the notice of
appeal, shall arrange a time and place for the hearing and shall give the
aggrieved party written notice thereof. At such hearing, the aggrieved
party shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show cause why
such notice should not be complied with.
C. Order. After such hearing, the Board shall sustain, modify or withdraw
the notice, depending upon its findings as to whether the provisions of
this chapter have been complied with. If the Board shall sustain or
modify such notice, it shall be deemed to be an order. Any notice served
pursuant to Subsection A shall automatically become an order if a
written petition for a hearing is not filed in the office of the Building
Inspector within 30 days after such notice is served. After a hearing in
the case of any notice suspending any permit required by this chapter,
when such notice has been sustained by the Board, the permit shall be
deemed to be automatically revoked if a petition for hearing is not filed
in the office of the Building Inspector within 10 days after such notice is
served.
D. Record of proceedings. The proceedings at such hearings, including the
findings and decision of the Board shall be summarized, reduced to
writing and entered as a matter of public record in the offices of the
Board. Such record shall also include a copy of every notice or order
issued in connection with the matter. Any person aggrieved by the
decision of the Board may seek relief therefrom in any court of
competent jurisdiction, as provided by the laws of this state.
E. Emergencies. Whenever the Building Inspector finds that an emergency
exists which requires immediate action to protect the public health he
may, without notice or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of
such an emergency and requiring that such action be taken as he deems
necessary to meet the emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions
of this chapter, such order shall be effective immediately, but upon
petition to the Building Inspector, he shall be afforded a hearing as soon
as possible in the manner provided in Subsection B. After such hearing,
depending upon the findings as to whether the provisions of this
chapter have been complied with, the Board shall continue such order
in effect, or modify it, or revoke it.
§ 402-6 LAKE MILLS CODE § 402-7
1:316
A. As an alternative to issuing a municipal citation that is subject to the
general penalty in § 1-19 of this code, the following enforcement
method may be used if, after inspection, the Building Inspector
determines that a violation exists in the Housing Code, and if it is
determined that the nature of such violation is not such as to threaten
imminent danger to the public health, safety, peace, peace, morals,
decency or welfare, but that the offense requires that correction orders
be issued as follows:
(1) Correction order. The Building Inspector, or his or her designee,
may issue a correction order reciting the existence of a building
code violation under this chapter or Chapter 279, Building
Construction; Chapter 286, Buildings, Numbering of; Chapter 292,
Buildings, Unsafe; or Chapter 581, Swimming Pools, and requiring
the owner or occupant of the premises to correct, remove or abate
the condition described in the order within the time period
specified therein.
(2) The correction order shall be served personally on the owner of the
property, as well as the occupant, if different from the property
owner, or at the option of the inspecting officer, the notice may be
mailed to the last known address with a return receipt. If the owner
or occupant cannot be served, the order may be served by posting
it on the main entrance of the premises and by publishing as a
Class 3 notice under Chapter 985 of the Wisconsin Statutes. The
time limit specified in the order runs from the date of completion of
service or publication.
(3) If the recipient of the correction order fails or refuses to comply
within the time period prescribed, the inspecting officer may issue
reinspection fees in accordance with this section.
B. The purpose of reinspection fees is as follows:
(1) To assist the City in paying the costs of enforcing its associated
zoning, housing, building, public nuisance, and other codes;
(2) To promote the appropriate regulation and control of buildings and
real estate in the City;
(3) To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the City;
(4) To help protect the character and the social and economic stability
of the City by eliminating public nuisances or other propertyrelated
violations;
(5) To help protect the value of land and buildings in the City;
(6) To help remedy problems associated with public nuisance and real
estate-related code violations in the City.
§ 402-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 402-7
1:317
C. Findings. In enacting the alternative enforcement of public nuisance,
zoning, housing and building regulation and other ordinances through
the issuance of correction orders and by charging reinspection fees, the
City Council finds that the cost of enforcement of the City codes related
to these codes is greater than the estimated revenues from reinspection
fees expected to be received under this section.
D. Reinspection fee. To compensate for inspection and administrative
costs under this section, a fee of $50 may be charged to the owner or
occupant of property for any reinspection by a City of Lake Mills
Building Inspector, or his or her designee, to determine compliance
with an order to correct conditions in violation of specified sections of
the Housing Code in this chapter or Chapter 279, Building
Construction; Chapter 286, Buildings, Numbering of; Chapter 292,
Buildings, Unsafe; or Chapter 581, Swimming Pools, of the Municipal
Code, except no fee shall be charged for the reinspection when
compliance is recorded. A fee of $100 may be charged for a second
reinspection, a fee of $200 for a third reinspection and a fee of $400 for
each subsequent reinspection for the same condition. A reinspection
fee may also be charged when the Building Inspector, or his or her
designee, finds a condition which is similar to a condition which was
subject to a correction order within one year prior to the inspection.
Reinspection fees shall be charged against the real estate upon which
the reinspections were made, shall be a lien upon the real estate and
shall be assessed and collected as a special charge. If there has been a
change of ownership or occupancy after the City issues a correction
order, the reinspection fee may be waived if it is determined that the
new owner or occupant was not aware of the prior order to correct a
violation or condition.
E. Any property owner or occupant that has received a correction order
under this section may, within 30 days of receipt of the order, appeal the
decision to issue the order under procedures set forth in Chapter 16,
Administrative Review, of the Lake Mills Municipal Code. The collection
of any reinspection fees incurred by the appellant shall be stayed while
the appeal is pending.

fees enabling legislation, the purpose of this chapter is to establish the
mechanism for the imposition of impact fees upon new development to
finance the capital costs of acquiring, establishing, upgrading, expanding,
and constructing public facilities which are necessary to accommodate land
development. This chapter is intended to assure that new development
bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditures necessary to
provide public facilities within the City of Lake Mills and its service areas as
they are required to serve the needs arising out of land development.
§ 411-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings

§ 411-8. Sanitary sewer impact fees. [Amended 2-2-2010 by Ord.
No. 1057C; 5-3-2016 by Ord. No. 1163]
The basis for the imposition of sanitary sewer impact fees, and the
establishment of sanitary sewer impact fee zones, is the "Sanitary Sewer
Public Facilities Needs Assessment and Impact Fee Study Update" prepared
for the City of Lake Mills in December 2015, and which is on file in the office
of the City Clerk. The sanitary sewer impact fees, are shown below for each
impact fee zone, which are generally depicted in the Impact Fee Zones Map
2, which is incorporated herein by reference. The sanitary sewer impact
fees are subject to annual adjustments based on the consumer price index,
and are to be paid in accordance with § 411-6. The original, unadjusted

prior to the issuance of a building permit. In the event a building
permit is not required, the impact fees shall be paid prior to the
initiation of service.
A. The developer or property owner upon whom an impact fee is imposed
may contest the amount, collection, or use of an impact fee as specified

days prior to the award of any public contract for expenditure of the
collected fee revenues. [Amended 2-2-2010 by Ord. No. 1057C]

§ 411-9. Water impact fees. [Amended 2-2-2010 by Ord. No. 1057C]
The basis for the imposition of water impact fees is the facilities needs
assessment report and its attachments, "Water Facilities Needs
Assessment," which is on file in the office of the City Clerk. The water
impact fees, where were originally imposed on June 15, 1995, and which are
subject to annual adjustments based on the consumer price index, are to be
paid in accordance with § 411-6.
F. These fees do not apply in cases where an existing building is being
hooked up to an existing sewer lateral or to a sewer lateral that has
been replaced or repaired, unless the size of the meter is increased. In
cases where an increase in the meter occurs, the differential between
the existing sewer service and the expanded sewer service shall be the
basis for determining the applicable impact fee, and such determination
shall be made by the Public Works Board. If such fee becomes
applicable, it shall be payable prior to the issuance of a building permit.
If no building permit is issued, then such fee shall be payable prior to
the issuance of any other required permits from the City of Lake Mills.
G. These fees shall be increased by resolution on July 1 of each year by a
percentage amount equal to the consumer price index from the
previous calendar year.
H. These impact fees shall be applicable to those properties which are
located in the unincorporated areas identified in the City of Lake Mills
sewer service area and which are required under § 623-20Ato connect
to sanitary sewer.

§ 411-10. Park facilities impact fees.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the City to impose land
dedication requirements contained elsewhere in the Code on developers
as part of plat and certified survey map approvals under Ch. 236, Wis.
Stats. Notwithstanding the intent to impose land dedication requirements
on developers, separate park impact fees shall be imposed on property
owners in accordance with § 66.0617, Wis. Stats. Any dedication of land
required by the developer shall be credited to landowners who shall be
required under this chapter to pay park facilities impact fees if any such
impact fee would be used to pay for the same capital costs for which the
land dedication is required of the developer under Ch. 236.
basis for determining the applicable impact fee, and such determination
shall be made by the Public Works Board. If such fee is found to be
applicable, it shall be payable prior to the issuance of a building permit,
or if no building permit is issued or required, then prior to any other
necessary permit.
C. These fees shall be increased by resolution on July 1 of each year by a
percentage amount equal to the consumer price index from the
previous calendar year.
D. These impact fees shall be collected until all capital costs associated
with specified projects in the "Water Facilities Needs Assessment"
report have been incurred and satisfied, unless such time period for
collection or expenditure has been varied through § 411-4 and Wis.
Statutes § 66.0617. [Amended 2-2-2010 by Ord. No. 1057C]
E. In determining the time periods for expending water impact fees
collected for capital costs for which the impact fees have been imposed,
the City Council has considered and determined the appropriate
planning and financing periods to be as follows: [Amended 2-2-2010
by Ord. No. 1057C]
(1) For the construction of the water tower (elevated tank) and well
#6, and the water mains associated therewith, the appropriate
period of time for continued collection of water impact fees shall be
until the financing of these projects has been fully paid. The
construction of all water impact fee-related projects have been fully
completed prior to 2008.
(2) It is estimated that the bond and loans to fund these projects should
be fully satisfied by no later than April 10, 2026.
A. The basis for the imposition of a parks facilities impact fee is the
facilities needs assessment report and its attachments, "Park Facility
Needs Assessment," which is on file in the office of the City Clerk. The
parks facility impact fee was originally imposed and computed on July
15, 1995, to be $543. The park facilities impact fee is to be paid prior to

community center impact fee originally imposed in 1996 was $167 per
residential dwelling unit and is to be paid prior to the issuance of applicable
building permits. Each unit in a multifamily structure shall be treated as an
individual dwelling unit for the purposes of determining this impact fee.

determining the impact fee. [Amended 2-2-2010 by Ord. No. 1057C]
B. These fees shall be increased by resolution by July 1 of each year by a
percentage amount equal to the Consumer Price Index from the
previous calendar year.
C. These impact fees shall be collected until all capital costs associated
with specified projects in the "Parks Facilities Needs Assessment"
report have been incurred and satisfied, unless such time period for
collection or expenditure of individual fees has been varied by § 411-4
and Wis. Statutes § 66.0617. [Amended 2-2-2010 by Ord. No.

district in which the park or mobile home is located, within 20 days
after the end of each month, such proportion of the remainder of the
fees collected in the preceding month as the ratio of the most recent
property tax levy for school purposes bears to the total tax levy for all

§ 479-6. Abatement of public nuisances.
peace, safety or general welfare. [Amended 3-6-2012 by Ord. No.
1097A]
A. Responsibility for enforcement; inspections. It shall be the duty of the
Police Chief, Fire Inspector, Parks and Forestry Director, Director of
Public Works, Building Inspector, or their official designees, to enforce
those provisions of this chapter that come within the jurisdiction of
their respective offices. Each officer shall make or cause to be made
inspections upon complaint to ensure that such provisions are not
violated. No action shall be taken under this section to abate a public
nuisance unless the officer has inspected or caused to be inspected the
premises where the nuisance is alleged to exist, and has satisfied him or
herself that a nuisance does in fact exist. Whenever consent to enter
upon private property is not provided to the officer, unless some other
lawful authority exists to enter without such consent, the officer is
required to gain an inspection warrant before conducting his or her
inspection. The officer taking actions to abate a nuisance under this
chapter shall seek any necessary guidance from the City Attorney with
regard to procedures to follow in obtaining inspection warrants, making
inspections, issuing orders or taking other actions necessary to abate a
public nuisance.
B. Summary abatement.
(1) Order of abatement. If the inspecting officer determines that a
public nuisance exists within the City and that there is imminent
(great and immediate) danger to the public health, safety, peace,
morals, decency or welfare, he or she may, without notice or
hearing, issue an order to the owner, occupant or other person
causing or permitting the nuisance. Such order shall be posted on
the premises and, if such person may be found, personally served
on the owner, occupant or other person causing the nuisance. The
order shall recite the existence of a public nuisance constituting
imminent danger to the public and shall require, as he or she
deems necessary, immediate action to be taken to abate the
nuisance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the
order shall be effective immediately and shall state that unless such
nuisance is so abated, the City will cause the same to be abated and
will charge the cost thereof to the owner, occupant or other person
causing or permitting the nuisance. Any person to whom such
order is directed shall comply with the order immediately.
(2) Abatement by City. Whenever the owner or occupant shall refuse or
neglect to remove or abate the condition described in the order, the
§ 479-4 LAKE MILLS CODE § 479-6
1:376
inspecting officer shall, in his or her discretion, enter upon the
premises and cause the nuisance to be removed or abated, and the
City shall recover the expenses incurred thereby from the owner
or occupant of the premises or from the person who has caused or
permitted the nuisance.
C. Non-summary abatement by City.
(1) Order to abate nuisance. If the inspecting officer shall determine
that a public nuisance exists on private premises, but the nature of
such nuisance is not such as to threaten imminent danger to the
public health, safety, peace, morals, decency or welfare, he or she
shall issue an order reciting the existence of a public nuisance and
requiring the owner or occupant of the premises to remove or
abate the condition described in the order within the time period
specified therein. The order shall make specific reference to the
remedy afforded the property owner in Subsection C(3), and the
order shall be served personally on the owner of the building, as
well as the occupant if different from the owner and if applicable to
the described nuisance, or at the option of the inspecting officer,
the notice may be mailed to the last known address with a return
receipt. If the owner or occupant cannot be served, the order may
be served by posting it on the main entrance of the premises and by
publishing as a Class 3 notice under Chapter 985 of the Wisconsin
Statutes. The time limit specified in the order runs from the date of
completion of service or publication.
(2) Abatement by City. If the owner or occupant fails or refuses to
comply within the time period prescribed, the inspecting officer
shall enter upon the premises and cause the nuisance to be
removed or abated and the City shall recover the expenses incurred
thereby from the owner or occupant of the premises or from the
person who caused or permitted the nuisance.
(3) Remedy from order. Any person affected by such order shall, within
30 days of service or publication of the order, apply to the circuit
court for an order restraining the City and the inspecting officer
from entering on the premises and abating or removing the
nuisance or be forever barred. The court shall determine the
reasonableness of the order for abatement of the nuisance.
D. Authority to assess costs. The cost of the abatement or removal of a
nuisance under this chapter shall be collected from the owner, occupant
or person causing, permitting or maintaining the nuisance and, if notice
to abate the nuisance has been given to the owner, such costs may be
assessed against the real estate as a special charge.
E. Abatement in accordance with state law. Nothing in this chapter shall
be construed as prohibiting the abatement of public nuisances by the
City or its officials in accordance with the laws of the state.
§ 479-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 479-7
1:377
§ 479-7. Collection of costs.
In addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter for the erection,
contrivance, creation, continuance or maintenance of a public nuisance, the
cost of abatement of a public nuisance by the City, and the cost of storage or
disposal of any personal property removed during abatement procedures,
shall be collected as a debt from the owner, occupant or person causing,
permitting or maintaining the nuisance and, if notice to abate the nuisance
has been given to the owner, such cost may be assessed against the real
estate as a special charge.
§ 479-8. Alternative enforcement of public nuisances; reinspection
fees.
A. An alternative enforcement method as described in this section may be
used if the public nuisance is as described in § 479-3 or 479-4, and if it
is determined, after inspection by the Building Inspector under
§ 479-6A, that the nature of such nuisance is not such as to threaten
imminent danger to the public health, safety, peace, peace, morals,
decency or welfare, but that the offense requires that correction orders
be issued as follows:
(1) Correction order. The Building Inspector, or his or her designee,
may issue a correction order reciting the existence of a public
nuisance under § 479-3 or 479-4 and requiring the owner or
occupant of the premises to correct, remove or abate the condition
described in the order within the time period specified therein.
(2) The correction order shall be served personally on the owner of the
property, as well as the occupant, if different from the property
owner, or at the option of the inspecting officer, the notice may be
mailed to the last known address with a return receipt. If the owner
or occupant cannot be served, the order may be served by posting
it on the main entrance of the premises and by publishing as a
Class 3 notice under Chapter 985 of the Wisconsin Statutes. The
time limit specified in the order runs from the date of completion of
service or publication.
(3) If the recipient of the correction order fails or refuses to comply
within the time period prescribed, the inspecting officer may issue
reinspection fees in accordance with this section.
B. The purpose of reinspection fees is as follows:
(1) To assist the City in paying the costs of enforcing its associated
zoning, housing, building, public nuisance, and other codes;
(2) To promote the appropriate regulation and control of buildings and
real estate in the City;
(3) To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the City;
§ 479-7 LAKE MILLS CODE § 479-8
1:378
(4) To help protect the character and the social and economic stability
of the City by eliminating public nuisances or other propertyrelated
violations;
(5) To help protect the value of land and buildings in the City;
(6) To help remedy problems associated with public nuisance and real
estate-related code violations in the City.
C. Findings. In enacting the alternative enforcement of public nuisance
regulations through the issuance of correction orders and by charging
reinspection fees, the City Council finds that the cost of enforcement of
the these codes is greater than the estimated revenues from
reinspection fees expected to be received under this section.
D. Reinspection fee. To compensate for inspection and administrative
costs under this section, a fee of $50 may be charged to the owner or
occupant of property for any reinspection by a City of Lake Mills
Building Inspector, or his or her designee, to determine compliance
with an order to correct conditions in violation of § 479-3 or 479-4,
except no fee shall be charged for the reinspection when compliance is
recorded. A fee of $100 may be charged for a second reinspection, a fee
of $200 for a third reinspection and a fee of $400 for each subsequent
reinspection for the same condition. A reinspection fee may also be
charged when the Building Inspector, or his or her designee, finds a
condition which is similar to a condition which was subject to a
correction order within one year prior to the inspection. Reinspection
fees shall be charged against the real estate upon which the
reinspections were made, shall be a lien upon the real estate and shall
be assessed and collected as a special charge. If there has been a
change of ownership or occupancy after the City issues a correction
order, the reinspection fee may be waived if it is determined that the
new owner or occupant was not aware of the prior order to correct a
violation or condition.
E. Any property owner or occupant that has received a correction order as
required under this section may, within 30 days or receipt of the order,
appeal the decision to issue the order under procedures set forth in
Chapter 16, Administrative Review, of the Lake Mills Municipal Code.
The collection of any reinspection fees incurred by the appellant shall
be stayed while the appeal is pending. [Amended 4-6-2010 by Ord.
No. 1061A]
F. The use of this alternative method for the enforcement of public
nuisance violations does not negate the authority to proceed under any
other lawful remedy available, if deemed necessary by the inspecting
officer.

§ 505-1 LAKE MILLS CODE § 505-6
1:404
A. Preamble.
(1) The City Council of the City of Lake Mills has determined that
herbal preparations powdered or sprayed with a synthetic chemical
cannabinoid are available for sale in the area which are claimed to
produce intoxicating effects similar to THC or marijuana;
(2) While the substances are not yet categorized as illegal controlled
substances under Wisconsin or federal law, several countries,
states, and municipalities have already taken action to prohibit
these substances due to overdoses and other negative health
concerns;
(3) While these synthetic cannabinoid substances are often marketed
as benign and legal alternatives to marijuana, they are potentially
dangerous to users because the substances can create potency
from 3 to 100 times greater than marijuana, can produce severe
adverse health conditions, such as hallucinations, paranoia,
increased agitation, heart palpitations, seizures, and vomiting,
based on emergency room experiences in areas of the country
where use is more prevalent;
(4) The Drug Enforcement Administration has determined that K2/
Spice HU-210, CP 47, 497 and homologues, JWH-018 and JWH-073
do not have an approved medical use in the United States and are
presently listed as "drugs of concern" by the Federal Drug
Enforcement Administration; and
(5) Because the long-term health effects of the use of these substances
is not yet known, the City Council has determined to address the
growing threat of synthetic cannabinoids to the health, safety and
welfare of its citizens by enacting these prohibitions.
B. Synthetic cannabinoid prohibited.

SIDEWALK CAFES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Streets and sidewalks  See Ch. 573.
§ 512-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 548-1
1:409
§ 548-1. Definition.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SIDEWALK CAFE  That portion of a restaurant that is immediately
adjacent to and extends onto a public sidewalk as a licensed encroachment
of that sidewalk for the purpose of providing food and beverages to patrons
of the restaurant.
§ 548-2. Requirements and prohibitions.
A. No portion of any licensed sidewalk cafe may encroach on sidewalk
adjacent to any property other than the property that is licensed under
this chapter.
B. Any public sidewalk on which such licensed encroachment for sidewalk
cafe purposes occurs shall maintain at all times an unobstructed width
of 60 inches adjacent to the street for use by the general public and for
ensuring accessibility by all persons traveling on such sidewalk.
C. No alcohol or fermented malt beverages or food may be served after
10:00 p.m.
D. No alcohol or fermented malt beverages may be served at any time if
the restaurant subject of the sidewalk cafe license does not hold an
appropriate class of liquor license that would entitle such service within
the restaurant.
E. No alcohol or fermented malt beverages may be served at any time if
the restaurant has not received Council approval for the enlargement of
its premises under its liquor license that includes the area of the public
sidewalk where the sidewalk cafe is located. Further, the liquor license
shall be automatically conditioned at the time of such enlargement of
the premises with a limitation that the enlargement of the premises to
allow for the activity of service or consumption of alcoholic beverages
within the sidewalk cafe area outside the restaurant under such liquor
license has no vested rights and may be suspended or revoked or nonrenewed
by the City Council without cause being shown.
F. The entire outdoor area utilized for service and consumption of food
and beverages shall be visible from the restaurant establishment.
G. Any public improvements necessary to accommodate the outdoor
service area shall be approved by the director of public works and the
Building Inspector, and the costs thereof shall be paid by the licensee.
H. Service of food and alcoholic beverages in all sidewalk cafes shall be
limited to persons seated at tables in the licensed sidewalk cafe area.
Food service shall be required to be available at all times when the
sidewalk cafe is open.
§ 548-1 LAKE MILLS CODE § 548-2
1:410
§ 548-3. License issuance, renewal, suspension or revocation.
I. Each license holder shall be responsible for policing the area of the
sidewalk cafe to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not removed from
the sidewalk cafe. All debris and unused food in the sidewalk cafe area
shall be removed by the license holder before the close of business each
day. All spills, food, litter, or any other item on the sidewalk that is
associated with the service or consumption of food and beverages shall
be cleaned or removed as soon as practicably possible to minimize slip
or fall hazards on the public sidewalk that is located inside the sidewalk
cafe, as well as the public sidewalk adjacent to the sidewalk cafe.
A. No food and no fermented malt or other alcoholic beverages may be
served in a sidewalk cafe without obtaining a sidewalk cafe license and
without having any applicable liquor licensed premises enlarged to
include the sidewalk cafe area. Strict compliance with this chapter shall
be required in all aspects of any sidewalk cafe at all times.
B. Application for a sidewalk cafe license shall be made to the City Clerk
on forms furnished by the City, and each application shall include a
scaled drawing of the precise location of the proposed sidewalk cafe
operations that shows the tables and seating to be provided, as well as

from the remainder of the sidewalk that is to remain unencumbered for
pedestrian use. If alcoholic beverages are to be served under any liquor
license, such barriers shall be required. [Amended 12-18-2012 by
Ord. No. 1103]
C. An application fee of $100 shall be submitted to the City Clerk prior to

hearing. [Amended 12-18-2012 by Ord. No. 1103]
D. The applicant for a sidewalk cafe license shall be required to indemnify,
defend and hold the City and its employees and agents harmless against
all claims, liability, loss, damage or expense incurred by the City due to
any injury to or death of any person or any damage to property caused
by or resulting from the activities for which the license is granted. As
evidence of the applicant's ability to perform the conditions of the
license, the applicant shall be required to furnish a certificate of
comprehensive general liability insurance with the City of Lake Mills
named as an additional insured. Such certificate of insurance shall be in
the amount of $1,000,000 per claim or occurrence, and it shall be filed
with the City Clerk prior to the issuance of the annual license.
[Amended 12-18-2012 by Ord. No. 1103]
E. The licensing period for sidewalk cafe licenses shall be from July 1 to
June 30. Prior to expiration of such license, the license holder shall
make application and pay the application fee by no later than June 1 to
be considered for renewal of the license so that the notice and
§ 548-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 548-3
1:411
publishing requirements may be met prior to the hearing on the
renewal of such license.
F. Failure to comply with all of the terms and conditions of a sidewalk cafe
license and all requirements of this chapter may result in the
termination of the privilege of serving food or fermented malt or other
alcoholic beverages in a sidewalk cafe. If a sidewalk cafe license
becomes suspended or revoked or non-renewed by the City Council for
such noncompliance, or if the Council determines that such use of the
public sidewalk shall cease, even without a showing of cause, then no
sidewalk cafe operations of any kind at that location may continue on
the public sidewalk, and no tables or chairs or other encumbrances of
the sidewalk may remain. If such items are on the public sidewalk more
than 72 hours after a license is suspended, revoked, or non-renewed,
the City Manager shall order such encumbrance removed immediately,
and if such encumbrance remains more than 24 hours after issuance of
such removal order, the City Manager shall cause the encumbrance to
be removed and the cost thereof billed to the license holder. Failure to
pay such bill for costs within 30 days of billing shall result in the costs
being placed on the tax roll for the property at which the restaurant
conducting the sidewalk cafe has been located.
G. Any public improvements no longer necessary due to the revocation or
non-renewal of a license under this chapter shall be removed by the
City at the license holder's expense, and failure to pay such costs of
removal shall result in placing the costs on the tax roll for the property
at which the restaurant was conducting its business operations.
H. The Council shall cause notice to be served on the licensee at least
three days before a hearing is held before the Council on whether such
license shall be suspended or revoked or non-renewed, with or without
cause.
I. This chapter does not limit the Council's authority to refuse to license
areas of the public sidewalk for the service or consumption of food or
beverages in individual cases, even if the applicant or license holder
meets all conditions of this chapter.
J. The issuance of any license under this chapter may not be construed to
create a vested right for the benefit of liquor licensees. Whether a
sidewalk cafe license is issued or suspended or non-renewed is within
the Council's discretion, and no cause must be shown for any adverse
action with regard to any sidewalk cafe license.
K. The no-cause standard on nonissuance, non-renewal, suspension or
revocation is deemed reasonable by the Council due to the Council's
recognition that the sidewalk is primarily for the benefit of the public as
a whole for pedestrian travel within its entire width at all times, and
that the encumbrance permitted through the issuance of a sidewalk
cafe license is a special privilege that may be extended or withdrawn at
any time and for any reason. The notice and hearing requirement of this

and burdens associated with the treatment of stormwater by the
Wastewater Utility. The City Council of the City of Lake Mills finds that
the discharge of stormwater from private properties onto public rights-ofway
creates a safety hazard to pedestrians and motorists. The City Council

of the wastewater treatment plant. Further, the City Council declares that
violations of this chapter regulating stormwater shall constitute a public
nuisance.

association or entity.
STORMWATER  Water runoff from downspouts, roofs, sump pumps,
surface water runoff and drainage, provided none of the foregoing is
combined with sewerage or other pollutants requiring treatment by the
Wastewater Utility.
§ 565-3. Stormwater discharges.
A. No person may discharge stormwater from an outfall by combining
such discharge with the sanitary sewer distribution or collection system
of the City.
B. No person may discharge stormwater from an outfall in such a manner
that the discharge disperses directly onto the surface of any public
sidewalk or paved portion of any street.
C. Persons may discharge stormwater directly to a storm sewer, provided
the manner of connection has been approved in writing by the Director
of Public Works.
D. If no storm sewer exists adjacent to the property, storm sewer
discharges from roof downspouts may discharge directly to the paved
portion of the street, provided no obstruction to any public sidewalk is
created, and provided the outfall location and plan therefor are
approved in writing by the Director of Public Works and, if also required
by law, by the Plumbing Inspector.
E. Property owners, whose properties are not adjacent to a storm sewer,

Water and sewer main extensions shall be financed by cost advancements
when deemed advisable by the City Council. In general, the cost
advancement method shall be used only when application is made for
public water and sewer service which would require the extension of mains
through sparsely occupied areas to serve such applicant, or through areas
which in the judgment of the City Council are unlikely to develop extensively
within the next 10 years. Where extensions are authorized on a costadvancement
basis, the procedure shall be as follows:
Ordinance No. 349. The Treasurer of the City shall be custodian of
all financial records and funds belonging to or associated with said
system and such funds shall be deposited in the Bank of Lake Mills
of Lake Mills, Wisconsin, which bank is a member of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. The rates and charges for all services
and facilities rendered by said system shall be reasonable and just,
taking into consideration the costs and value of said system and the

Council. All records, minutes and all written proceedings thereof shall
be kept by the City Clerk.
D. The provisions of this section are subject to the laws of the State of
Wisconsin.
A. The applicant shall deposit with the City Treasurer a sum sufficient to
pay the total estimated cost of the extension, less unapportionable
costs, if any.
B. Such deposit shall be made before construction is started or contracted.
If the actual apportionable cost shall be less than the amount deposited,
the excess of the deposit over the cost shall be refunded to the applicant
within 30 days after payment for the completed project. If the
apportionable cost shall exceed the deposit, the applicant shall pay the
deficiency prior to the granting of water or sewerage service.
C. Any property connected to such main after its installation, other than
the applicant's, shall pay to the City a connection charge determined by
the City Council, which shall be equivalent to the special assessments
which would have been levied by the City at the time such extension
was made.
§ 623-8 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-9
1:504
§ 623-10. Maintenance of sewer laterals.
D. All connection charges collected by the City under Subsection C above
shall be paid to the applicant or his assigns or heirs unless specifically
provided otherwise in writing.
A. Property owners shall be responsible for maintaining sewer laterals
from the service main to the building to be serviced. Where it is
determined by the City, upon inspection, that the sewer laterals
servicing the building are not in a good state of repair, notice of the
deficiency shall be provided the property owner in writing, and the
property owner shall, within 30 days after receipt of such written
notice, cause the sewer lateral to be repaired or replaced, as the case
may require, so as to eliminate the noticed deficiency. In the event the
property owner fails to repair or replace the sewer lateral so as to
eliminate the noticed deficiency, the City shall repair or replace the
sewer lateral as the case may require, and the cost of such repair or
replacement shall be charged to the property owner and be a lien
against the lot or parcel served in accordance with the provisions of
§ 66.0911, Wis. Stats.
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A, in the event the City
determines that a sewer lateral is deficient and in need of replacement
or repair under circumstances which may require the deficiency to be
corrected immediately, the City may, at its election, undertake the
repair or replacement of the sewer lateral, as the case may require, and
charge the cost thereof, or the average current cost of replacing or
repairing such sewer laterals to the property owner, which charge shall
be a lien against the lot or parcel served in accordance with the
provisions of § 66.0911, Wis. Stats. The City shall, where circumstances
require the immediate replacement or repair of a sewer lateral, notify
the property owner that such repair or replacement has, or will be,
undertaken, the reason or circumstance which required the immediate
replacement or repair of the sewer lateral, the actual or estimated cost
of the repair or replacement, and shall advise the property owner that
the charge will constitute a lien upon the lot or parcel served until paid.

§ 623-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-18
1:515
(a) The City shall annually prepare an estimate of the anticipated
cost of service associated with treatment costs, collection
system costs, lift station costs, and administrative costs. Costs
for each of these four functional areas shall be further defined
by revenue requirements in these four areas: operation and
maintenance, replacement fund, debt service, and capital
additions. Finally, the four revenue requirements in each of the
four functional areas of the utility shall be allocated to the
parameters of demand, volume, BOD, total suspended solids
(TSS), phosphorus, and customer costs. These estimates shall
be in the form of a rate ordinance and shall be proposed to the
City Council for enactment prior to the enactment of the
budget of the ensuing year. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(b) Fixed or minimum charges are determined by summing the
revenue requirements of the four functional areas allocated to
the parameters of demand and customer cost, and dividing by
the number of equivalent meters or the number of actual
customers respectively.
(c) The volume charge is determined by summing the revenue
requirements of the four functional areas allocated to the
parameters of volume (or flow), BOD, TSS, and phosphorus,
and dividing by the total billable flow in 1,000 gallons, billable
pounds of BOD, and billable pounds of TSS, and phosphorus,
respectively. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see
Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(2) Operation and maintenance expenses. Operation and maintenance
expenses are allocated to the parameters of demand, volume, BOD,
suspended solids, phosphorus, and customer costs on the following
basis: [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1,
General Provisions, Art. I)]
(a) Labor, by treatment category, is allocated to parameters based
on the specific wastewater parameters being treated in that
treatment category.
(b) Electricity cost is allocated to wastewater parameters based on
estimates of use to parameter.
(c) The cost for repairs and replacement for that part of the sewer
lateral that extends from the building or facility to the property
line shall be paid in full by the property owner. The cost of
repairs and replacement for that part of the sewer lateral
which extends from the private property line under a public
right-of-way to a connection with the public sewer main, to
include the connection itself, shall be the responsibility of and
be paid by the City of Lake Mills Sewer Utility. The cost of
routine cleaning of the entire lateral from the building or
§ 623-18 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-18
1:516
facility to the junction with the sewer main is the sole
responsibility of the property owner.
(3) Replacement expense.
(a) The replacement expense shall be sufficient to replace any
equipment in the sewers or sewage works owned by the City as
required, in order to assure the continued peak performance of
the equipment and to maintain the capacity for which the
sewers and sewage works were designed and constructed. The
service life for real and personal property shall be established
by the City Engineer in cooperation with the City auditors, in
accordance with experience of the City, state and federal
guidelines and accepted accounting procedures. Each piece of
equipment shall be evaluated biannually to determine if its
useful life has been extended as a result of preventative
maintenance programs or repairs.
(b) Yearly replacement costs for each piece of equipment shall be
allocated in accordance with their applicability to the
parameters. This breakdown shall be reviewed annually by the
City Engineer and approved by the City.
(4) Debt service expense, and capital additions expense. Allocations of
debt service expense and routine plant additions expense are
distributed using percentages derived from the allocation of the
cost of the treatment plant, collection system and lift stations to the
parameters.
(5) Additional charges. Additional charges shall be billed, as required,
for the following:
(a) Actual costs incurred for commercial and industrial as well as
for user-requested sampling and analyses.
(b) Actual costs incurred for water meter inspection requested by
the user or as required because of improper maintenance.
(c) Actual costs incurred for special handling not provided for
elsewhere in this article.
(d) Actual costs incurred for handling a user's check returned
because of insufficient funds.
(e) Costs for revenue bond amortization per Ordinance No. 349.
(f) Each user which discharges toxic pollutants which cause an
increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of
the treatment works shall pay for such increased costs and
toxic monitoring.
(g) Surcharge for other than normal wastewater.
§ 623-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-18
1:517
[1] Such surcharge shall be based on flow, BOD, Suspended
solids, phosphorus, and such other constituents that affect
the cost of collection and treatment. Charges shall be
made in accordance with rates established in a separate
rate ordinance.
[2] All users discharging wastes into the public sewers are
subject to a surcharge, in addition to any other wastewater
service charge, if their wastewater has a concentration
greater than "normal concentrations" (see definition). The
volume of flow used for computing waste surcharges shall
be metered water consumption, subject to adjustments as
otherwise herein provided, or the actual volume of waste
as determined by an industrial waste metering installation.
The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by
the City in removing BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus,
and other pertinent constituents.
(h) An impact fee as set forth by a rate ordinance enacted by the
City Council.
(i) Septage or holding tank waste disposal fee.
C. Wastewater user charges.

consist of the fixed or minimum charge and the volume charge plus
any additional charges as may be appropriate, including those
identified in Subsection B(5) above.
(2) Industrial and commercial users.
(a) In addition to the basic wastewater user bill described in
subsection A of this section for the user charge system,
wastewater user bills for industrial and commercial users shall
consist of industrial waste monitoring charges as described in
§ 623-18B(5)(a) of this article.
(b) Industries with wastes classified by the City Engineer as
having special problems shall, if directed by the City Engineer,
install at the industry's own cost and in a structure located on
the building service line, whatever sampling devices are
required by the City Engineer to obtain exact information
about the waste.
(3) Additional charges. Additional charges as described in
§ 623-18B(5) of this article shall, if required, be listed on the
wastewater user bill.
(4) The rates of surcharge for concentrations greater than "normal
concentration" of BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus and other
pertinent constituents shall be at the prevailing rate at the time of
§ 623-18 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-18
1:518
§ 623-19. User charges.
discharge to the sanitary sewer. Said prevailing rates may be
amended from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
(5) All other rates, to include any applicable impact fees, shall be as
established from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
D. Wastewater user bill.
(1) Bill period. A bill shall be prepared and submitted to each user once
every month.
(2) Delinquent bills.
(a) Any bill not paid 20 days after date of billing shall be declared
delinquent and a past due notice issued to the billed party. The
past due notice shall contain an additional handling charge to
offset all costs incurred for generating and issuing the past due
notice.
(b) On or before October 15 of each year, the sanitary sewer utility
shall give notice to the owner or occupant of any lot or parcel
of real estate to which sanitary sewer service has been
provided, and for which there is owing at the giving of the
notice, sewer user charges established in accordance with this
article. The form and content of the notice, as well as the
procedural requirements established in § 66.0809, Wis. Stats.,
shall apply.
(c) Nonreceipt of any bill described in this section shall not release
the user of liability for any of those charges. In any case where
the user is responsible for the nonreceipt of the bill, the
conditions herein described for late payment and penalties
shall apply. In those instances where the City is responsible for
the nonreceipt of the bill, the City may, at its discretion, grant
the user an extension of the discount period and late payment
conditions described herein.
(3) Forms. Forms for bills and delinquent payment shall be as
determined by the City.
E. Debt service. Revenues to pay for debt service shall be collected as
provided for in the Revenue Bond Ordinance No. 349.
A. Money. All user charge payments and all funds received from the
Sanitary District shall be placed in segregated accounts as detailed in
Ordinance No. 349. Such money shall be used only to cover the costs of
operation and maintenance, replacement, debt service and other costs
as outlined in § 623-18B of this article.

B. Expenditures. Expenditures shall be made from the user charge moneys
by the City in accordance with the detailed annual budget and
ordinances authorized by the City Council.
C. Replacement reserve expenditures. Expenditures from the accrued
replacement reserve on facilities shall be for making renewals to
accommodate wear of physical elements and/or movable property that
would result in an extended useful life or meet the anticipated useful
life of the present plant and not for plant expansion or additions.
Replacement revenues as defined herein shall be segregated in a
separate account under the depreciation fund provided for in
Ordinance No. 349.
D. Renewals. Renewals to accommodate wear of physical elements and/or
movable property shall be capital expenditures that cause the annual
estimate for accrued reserves from replacement to be evaluated in
terms of extended useful life as a result of preventive maintenance
programs or of such renewal. The expenditures to overcome physical
and/or functional obsolescence shall be capitalized against the element
of the facility and charged to the fixed assets groups of accounts as an
improvement to such element. Future estimates of accrued reserve
requirements shall be evaluated and reflected in the replacement
reserve requirements.
E. Audit. An audit shall be performed annually at the same time that the
other books of account of the City are audited and in the same manner.
F. Excess revenues. Excess revenues collected within a segregated
account or user class shall be applied to that account or user class for
the next year and the rate adjusted accordingly.
A. Conditions for discharge into treatment system.
(1) Public wastewater collection facilities are required to be used for
the deposit of human wastes, garbage and other liquid wastes that
cannot be discharged into a receiving stream or disposed of in any
other manner in accordance with federal and state statutes and
state administrative regulations and approved by the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources.
(2) No building or facility shall be connected to any sewer unless the
portion of the property on which the building or facility is situated

industrial waste, or any polluted water into a stream or in the air or
onto the land, except where the person has made and provided for
treatment of such wastes which will render the content of such
wastes' discharge in accordance with applicable City, state and
federal laws, ordinances and regulations.
(6) In case of natural outlet discharges, at the time construction of the
waste treatment works is commenced, each owner or operator
shall furnish the City an Approved Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (WPDES) permit setting forth the effluent
limits to be achieved for compliance with such limits by the
required date. The WPDES permit shall be kept on file with the City
Engineer and updated by such information as periodically required
by the City, state and/or federal agencies.
(7) Any person who owns property within the corporate limits of the
City, which property is improved with one or more residences,
houses, buildings or structures for or intended for human use,
occupancy, employment, or any other similar purpose whatever,
and which property abuts on any street, alley or right-of-way in
which there is located a sewer within 100 feet from the nearest
property line shall, within 10 days after notice that such sewer is in
service, at his expense, install suitable toilet and waste disposal
facilities in the residences, houses, buildings or structures and
connect the facilities with the sewer in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this article; provided, however, that in the event
compliance with this section causes economic hardship to the
person, he may apply to the City for exemption. An application for
exemption shall state in detail the circumstances that are claimed
to cause the economic hardship. Exemptions shall only be granted
to residential users and shall not apply to commercial and
industrial users. Any connection to the sewer under this article
shall be made only if the City determines that there is capacity,
including BOD and TSS capacity, available in all downstream sewer
lift stations and sewer lines and in the treatment plant. The
provisions of this subsection shall apply to any person who owns
property within the unincorporated area to which service is
provided under the terms of this article, except that the obligation
to connect the facilities with the sewer shall apply only to buildings
used for human habitation and located within real estate adjacent
to a sanitary sewer main or lateral and within 200 feet of the
§ 623-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-20
1:521
sanitary sewer main or lateral. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(8) Persons described in Subsection A(5) through (7) of this section
shall not avoid connection to the sewer by reason of the actual
distance between the building or structure and the connecting
point of the sewer line.
(9) Every person desiring to connect to the sewer system shall file an
application in writing to the City Engineer on such form as is
prescribed for that purpose. Blanks for such applications will be
furnished at the Office of the City Clerk. The application must state
fully and truthfully all the wastes that will be discharged. If the
applicant is not the owner of the premises, the written consent of
the owner must accompany the application. Persons connected to
the sewer system of the City are referred to herein as "users." If it
appears that the service applied for will not provide adequate
service for the contemplated use, the City Engineer may reject the
application. If the City approves the application, it shall issue a
permit for services as shown on the application.
B. Limitations on discharge.
(1) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any
stormwater, groundwater, surface drainage, basement drainage or

commercial, institutional, or industrial sewer users or
properties to any sewer connected to the City's waste
treatment plant may be made or continued. No basement sump
pumps or building foundation drains may discharge to any
sewer connected to the City's waste treatment plant. Any
existing connections of downspouts, sump pumps, or building
foundation drains to any sewer connected to the City's waste
treatment plant shall be removed within 30 days of receipt of a
written order from the City.
(b) All private, interceptor sanitary sewers and laterals, or any
other private sanitary sewer connection, shall be constructed
and maintained by the property owner or sewer user in such a
manner that the sewers or laterals are reasonably impervious
to infiltration and inflow. If the City determines that private,
interceptor sewers or laterals or any other private sanitary
sewer connection contributes inflow or infiltration
unreasonably or in an excessive amount to the City's waste
treatment plant, the property owner or sewer user may be
ordered to repair or replace the private, interceptor sewer or
laterals or other private sanitary sewer connection within 30
days of receipt of such written order.
§ 623-20 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-20
1:522
(c) Failure to comply with the written order received under either
Subsection B(1)(a) or (b) may result in the issuance of a
citation under this article for each day of noncompliance with
said order, and such noncompliance and the conditions ordered
to be disconnected, repaired or replaced may also be
considered a public nuisance which may be remedied by
whatever lawful means is available to the City. If the property
subject to such written order is located in the Town of Lake
Mills, the Town shall, through mutual aid agreements, or any
other written agreement, such as the boundary and revenue
sharing agreement with the City, cooperate with the issuance
of any required citations.
(d) In addition to all other remedies, the City may discontinue
sanitary sewer service to the user or property owner until the
user or property owner complies with any written order
required by either Subsection B(1)(a) or (b). Prior to
discontinuation of sewer service, the property owner or sewer
user shall be given a ten-day written notice of the action to
discontinue service sent by certified mail. The property owner
or sewer user shall be informed in said notice of a right to
appeal such determination to discontinue service to the public
works board. If notice of such appeal is made in writing to the
City Clerk within seven days of receipt of such notification, no
discontinuation of service may be exercised under this section
unless the Public Works Board has provided a hearing and
unless the decision to discontinue service has been confirmed
by the Public Works Board.
(e) If the property subject to a notice of discontinuation of service
under Subsection B(1)(d) is located in the Town of Lake Mills,
the Town Clerk shall also be sent a copy of the notice. Failure
to comply with the notice requirement to the Town, if such
failure is inadvertent or unintentional, shall not void any
proceedings under this section to enforce the orders of the City
to discontinue sewer service to a property located in the Town
of Lake Mills.
(2) Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged any of the following materials to any sewer
connected to the City's treatment plant:

(m) No provision of this section shall be construed to provide lesser
discharge standards than are presently or may hereafter be
imposed or required by the United State Environmental
Protection Agency or the State of Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources.
C. Pretreatment.
(1) Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be installed by the industrial
or commercial or institutional user at its own expense when, in the
opinion of the City Engineer, such interceptors are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, oils, or
sand in excessive amounts, or any inflammable wastes, or such
other harmful ingredients. Such opinion may be formed in whole or
in part by taking into account § 623-20B(2), Limitations on
Discharge. The requirement to install interceptors under this
subsection shall not include individual residential users within the
meaning established under Subsection C(1)(g)below. All
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the City
Engineer, and shall be located such that they are easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. All interceptors shall be constructed
and maintained by the user in accordance with the state plumbing
codes and Subsection C(1)(a) through (f) and (2)of this section.
(a) General. All plumbing installations for users, other than
individual dwelling units, where grease, fats, oil or similar
waste products of cooking or food are introduced into the drain
§ 623-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-20
1:525
system shall be provided with grease or oil interceptors in
accordance with this subsection. All drains and drain piping
carrying oil, grease or fats shall be directed through one or
more interceptors as specified in Subsection C(1)(b), (c) or (d)
of this section.
(b) New plumbing systems. Notwithstanding the state plumbing
codes, and unless otherwise exempted in this section, all new
plumbing systems that discharge to the sewers shall be
provided with one or more exterior grease interceptors.
(c) Altered or remodeled plumbing systems. Notwithstanding the
state plumbing codes, all existing plumbing systems serving
users other than individual residential users that are altered or
remodeled as to that part of the plumbing system, and which
discharges from kitchens or food processing areas shall be
provided with one or more exterior grease interceptors.
(d) Existing installations. The City may require the installation of
exterior or interior grease interceptors for existing plumbing
installations where the capacity of the sewer system is reduced
due to congealed grease, or where congealed grease
downstream from the industrial, commercial or institutional
user otherwise impairs the proper functioning of the sewer
system.
(e) Exterior or interior grease interceptors shall receive the entire
waste discharge from kitchens or food processing areas of
commercial, industrial or institutional users required to install
or maintain exterior or interior grease interceptors. All grease
interceptors shall be designed, constructed, installed and
maintained in accordance with the standards contained in the
state plumbing code and any additional requirements from the
City Engineer.
(f) The user required to install or maintain an interior or exterior
grease interceptor shall maintain written records of all
inspections and maintenance of each interceptor and all such
records shall be maintained for a minimum of seven years. All
such records shall be made available for on-site inspection by
representatives of the City during all operating hours of the
commercial, industrial or institutional user.
(g) For purposes of this section, a commercial user is a
nonindustrial user that is also not an individual residential user
or an institutional user. A multiple-family residential structure
may constitute a commercial user if eight or more dwelling
units are in the structure and if individual laterals are not
provided for individual dwelling units, or if all laterals
discharge to a private interceptor sewer. An industrial user is
as defined in this article, but for purposes of this section, an
§ 623-20 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-20
1:526
industrial user may also be a noncommercial, noninstitutional,
nonresidential user, provided the industrial user discharges
wastewater of a character that reasonably allows the City
Engineer to determine that the discharges from the user
contain sufficient concentrations of grease or oil or sand to
require that a grease or sand interceptor be installed. An
institutional user is defined in this section as a user that is a
governmental facility that discharges grease or oil from food
service activities or other activities that reasonably allows the
City Engineer to determine that the discharges are likely to
contain sufficient concentrations of grease or oil or sand to
require that a grease or sand interceptor be installed. In
addition, the institutional user may also be defined as a school
that serves food that is prepared or processed on site, or a
similar facility that has wastewater characteristics which may,
in the opinion of the City Engineer, warrant the installation of
a grease or sand interceptor.
(2) Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the user, at his own expense, and shall be kept in
continuous and efficient operation at all times.
(3) In the event City approves the admission of any materials into its
sewers as set forth in § 623-20B(2) of this article, the City shall
direct the user causing admission of any such materials to, at his
own expense, construct, install and operate such preliminary
treatment plants and facilities as may be required in order to:
(a) Reduce the BOD to 300 parts per million and the suspended
solids to 350 parts per million by weight.
(b) Reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents to within
the maximum limits provided for in § 623-20B(2) of this article.
(c) Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or
wastes.
(4) No preliminary treatment plant and facility shall be constructed or
operated unless all plans, specifications, technical operating data,
and other information pertinent to its proposed operating and
maintenance shall conform to all City, State of Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources and any other local, state or
federal agency regulations, and unless written approval of the
plans, specifications, technical operating data, and sludge disposal
has been obtained from the State of Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources, and any other local state or federal agency
having regulatory authority with respect thereto.
(5) All such preliminary treatment facilities as required by this article
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operating condition by the user or person operating and
maintaining the facility served thereby, and at the user's expense.
§ 623-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-20
1:527
(6) No provision contained in this article shall be construed to prevent
or prohibit a separate or special contract or agreement between
the City and any industrial user whereby industrial waste and
material of unusual strength, character, or composition may be
accepted by the City for treatment, subject to additional payment
therefore by the industrial user; provided, however, that such
contract or agreement shall have the prior approval of the City.
(7) The City reserves the right to reject admission to the system of any
waste harmful to the treatment or collection facilities or to the
receiving stream.
D. Further limitations on wastewater strength.
(1) National categorical pretreatment standards as promulgated by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency shall be met by
all users of the regulated industrial categories.
(2) State requirements and limitations on discharges to the treatment
facility shall be met by all users that are subject to such standards
in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this or any other
applicable ordinance.
(3) The City reserves the right to amend this article to provide for more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
treatment facility where deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives set forth in this article.
(4) No user shall increase the use of potable or process water in any
way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this
article.
(5) The City may impose mass limitations on users that are using
dilution to meet the pretreatment standards or requirements of this
article, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is
deemed appropriate by the City.
(6) Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this
article. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge
of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
user's cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted
to the City for review, and shall be approved by the City before
construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures by the City shall not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this article.
§ 623-20 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-20
1:528
(a) Users shall notify the City immediately upon the occurrence of
a "slugload," or accidental discharge of substances prohibited
by this article. The notification shall include location of
discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration
and volume, and corrective actions. Any user who discharges a

sewer, and a disposal or treatment system shall be constructed in
compliance with the terms and provisions of all applicable City,
county, state and federal laws and regulations.
(2) Within 90 days after a property served by a private sewer or
disposal system as described in this section shall become subject to
the terms and provisions of § 623-20A(7) of this article, a direct
connection shall be made to the public sewer according to the
terms and provisions of this article, and all private sewers, disposal
systems, septic tanks, cesspools, and other appurtenances of such
private sewer and disposal system shall be disconnected and
abandoned and all openings, tanks, or other containers of human
wastes, garbage and other wastes shall be permanently filled with
granular material.
(3) The City shall not be responsible in any way for the operation and
maintenance of a private sewer or disposal system or facility.
(4) No provision of this article shall be construed to provide lesser
requirements for private sewers and disposal systems than are

local governmental body or the state or federal government.
F. Service of outlying territory. In accordance with § 66.0813, Wis. Stats.,
the City shall provide service to unincorporated lands located in the
Town of Lake Mills, which lands were formerly located in the Rock Lake
Sanitary District and are delineated on a map which is being approved
contemporaneously with the adoption of this article, which shall be
maintained at the office of the City Clerk and which is attached hereto
as an exhibit. The extension of sanitary sewer service within the area
described shall be conditioned upon an agreement between the City
§ 623-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-20
1:529
and the property owner requesting such service whereby the property
owner agrees to reimburse the City, either directly or by special
assessment, for the cost of extending sanitary sewer service to the
property. The terms of the agreement shall be determined on the same
considerations as if the property serviced were located in the City.
The City shall have no obligation to provide service beyond the area
delineated on the map that is made a part of this article.
G. Discharge permits.
(1) The City reserves the right to require a discharge permit from
commercial or industrial users of the sewer, and, if the City does
exercise the option, commercial or industrial users shall not
discharge to a sewer without having first applied for and obtained a
permit from the City. Upon official notification from the City, each
commercial or industrial user presently discharging material to the
sewer shall apply for and obtain such a discharge permit within 90
days from the date of such notification.
(2) The application for a discharge permit shall be made on a form
provided for that purpose by the City, and shall be fully completed

(4) No discharge permit shall be issued by the City to any person
whose discharge of material to sewers, whether shown upon the
application or determined after inspection and testing conducted
by the City Engineer, is not in conformance with federal, state or
city statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, unless a waiver or
variance of such standards and requirements is granted by the City
in the manner hereinafter set forth. The City shall state in writing
the reason or reasons for denial or requirement for waiver-variance
and said written communication shall be mailed or personally
delivered to the applicant within five days after denial.
(5) In the event the type of volume of material from property for which
a discharge permit was previously granted shall materially and
substantially change, the person granted such permit previously
shall make a new application to the City, in the same manner and
form as originally made.
§ 623-20 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-20
1:530
(6) If the application for a new permit or for one because of change in
the type or volume of material discharge is denied by the City, or if
the discharge indicated from the permit application or inspection is
not in accordance with the requirements of Subsection G(5) of this
section, and a waiver or variance is required, the user may have the
entire City Council review the denial or may request waivervariance,
provided the user shall give written notice of his request
within 30 days after receiving the denial. The entire City Council
shall review the permit application, the written denial, and such
other evidence and matters as the applicant and City Engineer
shall present at its next regular meeting following receipt of
request for its review, and the decision of the entire City Council
rendered publicly at said meeting shall be final.
(7) Should any discharge of material to a sewer materially and
substantially differ in type and volume than shown in the
application and permit, the person and user shall immediately,
under order of the City Engineer, cease and desist from such
discharge and shall also be subject to disconnection, fine and other
penalties provided by this article.
(8) A grant of waiver or variance by the City Council may set forth such
conditions, exceptions, time limitations, durations, and expirations
as the Council deems necessary and proper.
H. Construction of sewers and connections for buildings.
(1) The construction of sewers and connections for buildings shall be
made as required by the applicable ordinances of the City and by
regulations of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
Building drains-sanitary and buildings sewers-sanitary, together
with all connections thereto, shall be constructed water tight to
exclude all infiltration and inflow.
(2) A construction permit shall first be applied for and obtained from
the City before a person, after the effective date of this article, can
connect to any sewer located on properties within the corporate
limits of the City or on properties outside the City where services
have been contracted for with the City.
(3) Construction permits shall not be issued unless it has been
determined by the City that there is capacity available in all
downstream sewerage facilities.
(4) No plumber, pipe fitter, or other person will be permitted to do any
plumbing or pipe fitting work in connection with the sewer system
without first receiving a license from the State of Wisconsin and
obtaining permission from the City Engineer or Building Inspector.

plumbing code.
§ 623-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-20
1:531
(5) Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided by the
industrial user and shall be located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
interceptors, the user shall be responsible for the proper removal
and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and
shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal that are
subject to review by the City Engineer. Any removal and hauling of
the collected materials not performed by the user(s) personnel
must be performed by currently licensed disposal firms.
I. Reporting criteria for nonresidential users.
(1) The City reserves the right to require any nonresidential user to
submit quarterly to the City on forms provided by the City, a
certified statement of the characteristics of its industrial wastes
discharged in the sewers and treatment works of the City or to any
sewers connected to its treatment works. This statement shall be
filed with the City Engineer no later than the 10th day of the month
following the quarter for which the report is required. The City
Engineer may require additional certified statements at any time if,
in his judgment, the same shall be necessary to determine the
source of materials which have been found in the City sewer.
(2) The waste characteristics to be measured and certified by the user
shall be:
(a) BOD in milligrams per liter.
(b) Suspended solids in milligrams per liter.
(c) Such other constituents of wastewater as directed by the City
Engineer.
(3) Should there be a difference in understanding between the City
and user as to the characteristics in this section, the City reserves
the right to use the City results from analyses for purposes of
billing. Should submission not be made during the ten-day period,
the City shall use its results from analyses for purposes of billing.
(4) Whenever required by the City, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer that carries nonresidential wastewater or
material shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber in the
building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications which
have been submitted to and approved by the City Engineer. Such
device shall be installed and maintained at all times at the user's
expense. Such device shall have ample room in each sampling
chamber to accurately sample the wastewater effluent entering the
sewer, and shall collect composite samples for analyses. The
chamber shall be safely, easily and independently, of other
premises and buildings of the user, accessible to authorized
representatives of the City at all times. The City shall have
exclusive access to such device, and no keys shall be in the
§ 623-20 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-20
1:532
possession of any user or any agent of the user. Where construction
of such a device is not economically or otherwise feasible, the City
Engineer may approve alternate arrangements for sampling.
(5) Each sampling chamber shall contain a Parshall flume, weir, or
similar device with a recording and totalizing register for
measuring liquid quantity; or the metered water supply to the
industrial plant may be used as measure of liquid quantity where it
is substantiated by the City Engineer that the metered water
supply and waste quantities are approximately the same or where a
measurable adjustment agreed to by the City Engineer is made in
the metered water supply to determine the liquid waste quantity.
(6) Samples shall be taken periodically with such degree of frequency
as the City Engineer shall, in his discretion, determine. They shall
be properly refrigerated and composited in proportion to the flow
so as to present a representative twenty-four-hour sample. Such
sampling shall be done as prescribed by the City Engineer to insure
representative quantities for the entire reporting period. Minimum
requirements for determination of representative quantities or
characteristics shall include reevaluation during each twelvemonth
period. The determination of representative quantities and
characteristics shall include not less than seven consecutive
calendar days of twenty-four-hour composite sampling taken
during periods of normal operation, together with acceptable flow
measurements.
(7) The sampling frequency, sampling chamber, metering device,
sampling methods, and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any
time, to inspection and verification by the City Engineer.
(8) All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this section shall
be determined in accordance with the Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater (latest edition) or with any
other method approved by the City.
(9) The City may elect, at its option, to have the metering and sample
collection done by the industrial plant personnel and have
composite samples delivered to the City Engineer for analysis. This
procedure can also be terminated at any time by the City upon
reasonable notice.
J. Septic haulers.
(1) Nonindustrial users hauling liquid wastes to the treatment plant
shall be assessed user charge unit charges for billable flow, billable
BOD, billable TSS; and billable phosphorous; the volume of which is
determined for each by the City Engineer. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 623-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-20
1:533
(2) Liquid wastes hauled to the treatment plant containing
concentrations of constituents in excess of the limits set forth in
Subsections B(2) and D of this section shall not be accepted.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I)]
(3) Application for septage disposal. Between August 1 and September
1 of each year every licensed disposer wishing to discharge septage
to the City sewerage system shall file a nonrefundable filing fee and
an application in writing to the City Engineer on such a form as is
prescribed for that purpose. During the months of July and August,
forms for such application will be furnished at the office of the City
Clerk. The application must state fully and truly the type,
frequency, quantity, quality and location of generated septage to be
disposed in the City sewerage system.
(a) During the month of September, the City Engineer will
evaluate the applications and make a determination as to the
amount and conditions of septage disposal in the City
sewerage system. The City shall approve or reject all
applications by October 1 of each year. If the City cannot
accept all the proposed septage disposal then consideration
shall be given first to those generators of septage that are
within the City's sewer service area [see § NR 205.07(2)(f)].
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I)]
(b) All City approvals for septage disposal shall have the
conditions that any time the sewerage system has operational
problems, maintenance problems, or threat of WPDES permit
violations that are indirectly or directly related to septage
disposal, the City may immediately restrict septage disposal
until such time as corrective action or mitigative measures
have been taken.
(4) Septage acceptance location.
(a) Septage shall only be discharged to the City's sewerage system
by City-approved and State of Wisconsin licensed disposers
and at locations, times, and conditions as specified by this
article.
(b) Septage and holding tank waste shall be discharged to the
septage receiving facility at the wastewater treatment facility
and shall be limited to the posted normal working hours of the
facility. Documentation of the discharge shall be submitted to
the City Engineer within one working day of the discharge to
the septage receiving facility.
§ 623-20 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-20

§ 623-21. Enforcement; inspections.
(c) Forms as prescribed for the purpose of documentation of the
discharge will be furnished at the City Hall and will include the
following information:
[1] Name, address and telephone number of the hauler;
[2] License number;
[3] Type of septage;
[4] Quantity of septage;
[5] Estimated quality of septage;
[6] Location, date, time and feed rate of discharge to the
sewer-age system;
[7] Source of septage;
[8] Name and address of septage generator;
[9] Other information as required by the City Engineer.
A. Inspection rights. The Director of Public Works, or authorized designee
of the Director, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have
the right to enter the premises of any user within the corporate limits of
the City, or outside the City if served by the sanitary sewer of the City of
Lake Mills, to determine whether the user is complying with all
requirements of this article or any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Director or authorized
designee ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, observing, measuring, sampling, and testing, as may be
required, in pursuance of the implementation and enforcement of the
terms and provisions of this article.
B. Liability during inspections. While performing the necessary work on
private properties referred to in Subsection A of this section, the duly
authorized employees of the City shall observe all safety rules
applicable to the premises established by the commercial or industrial
user, and the user shall be held harmless for injury or death to the City
employees, and the City shall indemnify the user against loss or damage
to its property by City employees and against liability claims and
demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the
user and growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as
such may be caused by negligence or failure of the user to maintain safe
conditions.
C. Notwithstanding Subsection A, and as a standard to be used in
evaluating requests for warrants under Subsection E, any inspections of
private residences or those areas of commercial or industrial properties
not open to the public shall be made only upon a showing of reasonable
§ 623-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-21
1:535
suspicion that the premises to be inspected is violating a provision of
the sewer user ordinance.
(1) Such inspections shall be confined to only those areas where
violations of the types that are suspected are likely to be found,
unless a relevant violation of the sewer user ordinance is in plain
sight during any such inspection.
(2) Reasonable suspicion to inspect a particular, individual property
may be found under the totality of the circumstances, provided a
reasonable articulation of the facts and circumstances surrounding
the decision to inspect is articulated by the Director or authorized
designee of the Director to the owner or legal occupant of the
property at the time of the inspection, and at the time of making
application for an inspection warrant if consent is not given for the
inspection by the owner or legal occupant of the property.
D. In the case of inspections solely for the purpose of confirming that no
sump pumps are unlawfully connected to the sanitary sewer, reasonable
suspicion to inspect a particular property may be found if the inspector
can articulate all of the following as the reasons for the inspection:
(1) The home or other building connected to sanitary sewer has not
been inspected for the presence of sump pump connections to the
sanitary sewer for a period of at least three years.
(2) The home or other building is located in a area that has been
specifically designated by the sewer utility supervisor as an area
where it is probable that adverse events, such as sewer backups
into basements or an overflow of sewerage, may occur during
periods of high flows if unlawful discharges from sump pumps to
the sanitary sewer line or lines in the designated area are allowed
to occur.
(3) The City Council of the City of Lake Mills has authorized
inspections for unlawful sump pump connections to the sanitary
sewer in the specifically designated area, and this authorization
has been granted because the Council found that the designated
area has a characteristic, such as lift stations or pumps, or a sewer
main that has flows that are nearing capacity on high flow days, or
some other similar reason that makes it probable that sewer
backups or overflows will occur during periods of heavy rains or
heavy snow melt if unlawful sump pump discharges are present in
sewer lines in such designated area.
E. If the Director or designee has been refused access to a building,
structure or property, or any part thereof that is the subject of the
inspection, the Director or designee may seek issuance of a special
inspection warrant, pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes § 66.0119, from the
Lake Mills Municipal Court if the property is located in the City of Lake
Mills, or from the Jefferson County Circuit Court if the property is
located in the Town of Lake Mills.
§ 623-21 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-21
1:536
§ 623-22. Administrative enforcement remedies.
F. In lieu of inspection by the City of Lake Mills, in the case of inspections
solely for the purpose of confirming that no sump pumps are unlawfully
connected to the sanitary sewer, any property owner may elect to hire a
plumber licensed in the State of Wisconsin to provide written
certification, which must be submitted to the sanitary sewer utility
supervisor within 15 days of election, and if such written certification
states that no sump pumps are connected to the sanitary sewer, then
the inspection shall be considered completed.
A. Notice of noncompliance. When the Director of Public Works, or
authorized designee, finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this article, wastewater discharge permit,
order issued herein, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director or designee may serve upon that user a written notice of
noncompliance. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be
submitted by the user to the Director. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
the receipt of the notice of noncompliance. Nothing in this subsection
shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action without first
issuing a notice of noncompliance.
B. Notification of violation. When the Director of Public Works, or
authorized designee, finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this article, wastewater discharge permit,
order issued herein, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, and
has failed to provide an acceptable plan for corrective action as
required in Subsection A of this section, the Director or designee may
serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by this user to the Director.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Director to take
any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement
action without first issuing a notice of noncompliance.
C. Consent orders. The Director of Public Works, or authorized designee,
may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include a specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
Subsections D and E in this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 623-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 623-22
1:537
§ 623-23. Emergency suspensions.
D. Show cause hearing. The Director of Public Works, or authorized
designee, may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this article, wastewater discharge permit, order issued
herein, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the Board of Public Works and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action and a request that the
user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of
the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
E. Compliance orders. When the Board of Public Works finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article,
wastewater discharge permit, order issued herein, or any pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Board may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user to come into
compliance within a specified time period. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to
the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
F. Cease-and-desist orders. When the Director of Public works finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article,
wastewater discharge permit, order issued herein, or any pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to
recur, the Director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(3) The issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
§ 623-22 LAKE MILLS CODE § 623-23
1:538
§ 623-24. Termination of discharge.
In addition to the provisions of § 623-22 , any industrial or commercial user
subject to pretreatment or a wastewater discharge permit who violates the
following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
A. The Director of Public Works may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
unreasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director of
Public Works may also, after notice and opportunity to respond,
immediately suspend a user's discharge that threatens to interfere with
the operation of the wastewater treatment plant, or which presents, or
may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Director of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate suspension order. The Director may take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the
Wastewater Treatment Plant, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to individuals. The Director may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings under this section are
initiated against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the
Director prior to the date of any show cause hearing under

period.
§ 623-28. Water leakage and sanitary sewer credits.
A. A customer of the Lake Mills municipal water system may request a
credit for water loss to offset a charge imposed in any one billing

occurred because of the customer's act or negligence.
(c) Identification of the plumber to include name, address,

§ 650-2. Purpose and intent.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the subdivision of
land and the quality of such subdivision to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare of the community; to prevent the

for water, sewage, and other public requirements; to provide for proper
ingress and egress; to promote proper monumenting of land subdivided
and conveyed by accurate legal description. These regulations are
made with reasonable consideration, among other things, of the
character of the City and its environs with a view of conserving the
value of land and improvements placed thereon, providing the best
possible environment for human habitation, for encouraging commerce
and industry, and providing for the most appropriate use of land in the
City and its environs.
B. Intent. It is the general intent of this chapter to regulate the division of
land so as to:
(1) Support the goals of sustaining natural resources through

the City's soil, water, wetland, woodland, and wildlife resources
and attain a proper adjustment of land use and development to
realize the goal of supporting and sustaining the natural resource
base.
(2) Lessen congestion in the streets and highways.

to periodic inundation nor does the City guarantee, warrant or represent
that the soils shown to be unsuited for a given land use from tests required
by the chapter are the only unsuited soils within the jurisdiction of the
chapter; and thereby asserts that there is no liability on the part of the
City Council, its agencies or employees for flooding problems, sanitation

Manager, as a guarantee that such improvements will be completed by the
subdivider or his subcontractors not later than two years from the date
of recording of the plat and as a further guarantee that all obligations to
subcontractors for work on the development are satisfied. In addition, the
following requirements apply:

create a conforming lot or a more conforming lot to the maximum
extent possible.
A. Hardship from literal enforcement. Where in the judgment of the City
Plan Commission it would be inappropriate to apply literally the
provisions of § 650-32 and where, in the judgment of the City Council, it

§ 650-20. Land suitability.
No land shall be subdivided as a plat or certified survey map which is
determined to be unsuitable for such use by the Plan Commission, upon
the recommendation of the City's Engineering Consultant or any other
agency as determined by the Plan Commission, for reason of flooding,
inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formations with severe limitations
for development, severe erosion potential, unfavorable topography,
inadequate water supply or sewage disposal capabilities or any other
would be inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of § 650-33 of
this chapter because the proposed subdivision is located outside the
corporate limits of the City or because exceptional or undue hardship
would result, the Plan Commission or City Council may grant a special
exception from any requirement to the extent deemed just and proper.
B. Finding of fact. No special exception to the provisions of this chapter
shall be granted unless the Plan Commission finds all the following facts
and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its proceedings:
(1) Exceptional circumstances. There are exceptional, extraordinary or
unusual circumstances or conditions where a literal enforcement of
the requirements of this chapter would result in severe hardship.
Such hardships should not apply generally to other properties or be
of such a recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be
changed.
(2) Preservation of property rights. Such variance is necessary for
preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights
possessed by other properties in the same vicinity.
(3) Absence of detriment. The variance will not create substantial
detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair or be
contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or the public
interest.
(4) A minimum of five affirmative Plan Commission member votes shall
be required to grant any special exception to this chapter.
(5) The City Council may waive the placing of monuments required
under § 236.15(1)(b), (c), and (d), Wis. Stats., for a reasonable time,
not to exceed one year, on condition that the subdivider execute a
surety bond to insure the placing of such monuments within the
required time limits established by statute. Additional time may be
granted upon show of cause.
C. Public interest. When such relief is granted, it shall be without
detriment to the public good, without impairing the intent and purpose
of this chapter or the desirable general development of the City in
accordance with the adopted City Comprehensive Plan or adopted plan
components. The reasons shall be entered in the Plan Commission
minutes.

feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of future
residents of the proposed subdivision or the City. In addition:
A. Floodlands.
(1) No lot served by public sanitary sewerage facilities shall have less
than its required lot area, as specified in the zoning district
regulations, below the elevation of the one-hundred-year
recurrence interval flood or, where such data is not available, the
elevation shall be determined by a registered professional engineer
and the sealed documents shall be approved by the City's
engineering consultant.
(2) For planned development projects served by public sanitary
sewerage facilities, no lot shall have less than the average lot area,
as specified by the Plan Commission, below the elevation of the
one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood or, where such data is
not available, the elevation shall be determined by a registered
professional engineer and the sealed documents shall be approved
by the City's engineering consultant.
(3) No lot of one acre or less in area served by an on-site sanitary
sewage disposal (septic tank or mound) system shall include
floodlands. All lots more than one acre in area served by a septic
tank system or mound system shall contain not less than 40,000
square feet of land which is at an elevation above the elevation of
the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood or, where such data
is not available, the elevation shall be determined by a registered
professional engineer and the sealed documents shall be approved
by the City's engineering consultant.
B. Shorelands. Shorelands shall not be divided into building sites which
are to be served by soil absorption waste disposal systems.
C. Fill materials.
(1) Lands made, altered or filled with non-earth materials within the
last 10 years shall not be divided into building sites which are to be
served by soil absorption waste disposal systems.
(2) Lands made, altered or filled with non-earth materials within the
preceding 20 years shall not be divided into building sites which
are to be served by soil absorption waste disposal systems except
where soil tests prepared by a professional soil scientist clearly
show the soils are suited to such use. Soil reports shall include, but
need not be limited to, an evaluation of soil permeability, depth to
groundwater, depth to bedrock, soil-bearing capacity, and soil
compaction. To accomplish this purpose, a minimum of one test per
acre shall be made initially. The City does not guarantee, warrant
or represent that the required samples represent conditions on an
entire property and thereby asserts that there is no liability on the
part of the City Council, its agencies or employees for sanitary
§ 650-20 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-20
1:572
§ 650-21. Wooded areas and natural tree settings.
Heavily wooded areas should be preserved insofar as possible and by
application of reservation and dedication provisions of this chapter and
other applicable ordinances. The subdivider shall not remove trees in
anticipation of a land division until final subdivision approval is received.
Each tree exceeding six inches diameter at 4.5 feet above the ground that is
removed in preparation for development shall be replaced on a one to one
ratio. Replacement trees shall be of species approved by the City Forester
and measure between 1.5 inches and 2.5 inches in trunk diameter at one
foot above ground. If complete tree mitigation is not feasible within the
subject subdivision development, the City may require tree plantings within
parks, conservation lands, street rights-of-way, or other publicly owned
lands or require payment to a reforestation fund at a rate commensurate
with planting said mitigation trees.
§ 650-22. Determination of adequacy of public facilities.
problems or structural damages that may occur as a result of
reliance upon such tests.
D. Steep slopes. Each lot proposed to be served by an on-site soil
absorption sewerage disposal system shall have 50% of its minimum
required lot area or 20,000 square feet, whichever is less, in slopes of
less than 12%.
E. Shallow bedrock. Lands having bedrock within six feet of the natural
undisturbed surface shall not be divided into building sites to be served
by soil absorption sewage disposal systems.
F. Shallow groundwater table. Lands having groundwater within six feet
of the natural undisturbed surface shall not be divided into building
sites to be served by soil absorption sewage disposal systems.
G. Percolation rates. Soils having a percolation rate slower than 60
minutes per inch shall not be divided into building sites to be served by
soil absorption sewage disposal systems.
H. Findings. The Plan Commission, in applying the provisions of this
section, shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it bases
its conclusion that the land is unsuitable for residential use and afford
the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence in rebuttal to such
finding of unsuitability, if he so desires. Thereafter, the Commission may
affirm, modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.
A. Determination required. A preliminary plat, final plat, or certified
survey shall not be approved unless the City Manager determines that
adequate public facilities and public services are available to meet the
needs of the proposed land division and that no public funds, other than
those already provided in an adopted capital or operating budget, are
required.
§ 650-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-22
1:573
B. Submit required data. The applicant shall furnish any data requested by
the City Manager, who shall transmit this information to the
appropriate commission(s), committee(s), or staff for review of the
adequacy of water, sanitary and storm sewers, fire service, police,
parks, open space, recreation, and transportation facilities.
C. Required conditions. Public facilities and public services for a proposed
land division may be found by the City Manager to be adequate when
the following conditions exist:
(1) The proposed land division is located in an urban service area
where adequate sewer service is presently available for extension,
is under construction, or is designated by the City Council for
extension of sewer service within the current capital budget year
and funds are specifically provided for such extension either from
public or private financing. The City Manager shall consider the
recommendations of the City's engineering consultant, Public
Works Director, and the Wastewater Treatment Superintendent on
the capacity of trunk lines and of sewerage treatment facilities and
any other information presented.
(2) The proposed land division is located within the corporate limits of
the City and it is contiguous to an arterial transmission water main
of adequate capacity for the proposed development, or the water
distribution system that is needed is under construction or
scheduled for construction within the current budget year, and
public or private funds are available for the program. The City
Manager shall consider the recommendations of the Public Works
Board, the Public Works Director, and the City's consulting
engineer on line capacities, water sources and storage facilities as
well as any other information presented.
(3) The City Manager verifies that adequate funds, either public or
private, are available to insure the installation of all necessary
stormwater management facilities.
(4) The Director of Public Works can demonstrate to the City Manager
that street maintenance and refuse collection services, either
public or private, are so situated that adequate and timely service
can be provided so as not to involve danger or injury to the health,
safety, or general welfare to the future residents of the proposed
land division or existing City residents.
(5) The Parks and Forestry Director verifies to the City Manager that
the future residents of the proposed land division can be assured
park, recreation and open space facilities and services which meet
the standards of the City's Comprehensive Plan for parks and open
spaces.

adequate service can be provided to the residents.
§ 650-22 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-22
1:574
§ 650-23. Basis for approval.
Approval of the proposed subdivision shall be conditional upon compliance
with:
(7) The proposed land division is accessible by existing or officially
mapped, publicly maintained, all-weather roadway system,
adequate to accommodate both existing traffic and that traffic to be
generated by the proposed land division in accordance with the
Official Map and City standards.
(8) Where the City Manager determines that one or more public
facilities or services are not adequate for the proposed
development, but that a portion of the area could be served
adequately, or that careful phasing of the development could result
in all public facilities and public services being adequate, the City
Manager shall recommend that conditional approval may include
only such portions or may specify phasing of the development.
D. Finding in writing. No land shall be divided which has been officially
mapped as public lands or a stormwater management facility or is
determined by the City Manager, in consultation with the City's
engineering consultant, to be unsuitable for use by reason of flooding,
bad drainage, soil or rock formations with severe limitations for
development, severe erosion potential, or unfavorable topography, or
any other feature likely to be harmful to the quality of the subdivision as
it relates to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents or
landowners in the proposed land division. The City Manager, in
applying the provisions of this subsection, shall recite the particular
facts in writing upon which conclusions that the land is not suitable for
the proposed use are based and shall afford the subdivider an
opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability to the
Plan Commission. Thereafter, the Plan Commission may affirm, modify
or withdraw the determination of unsuitability.
E. Conform to zoning regulations. In the case of any land division, lot sizes
shall conform to the area and width requirements prescribed for the
zoning district in which the property is located.
A. The provisions of Chapter 236, Wis. Stats.
B. All applicable ordinances of the City.
C. The Comprehensive Plan, if consistent with any applicable zoning
ordinances. The Comprehensive Plan shall be deemed consistent even if
it has more restrictive requirements than found in the zoning
ordinance, provided the requirements of the Comprehensive Plan are
not inconsistent with the applicable zoning regulations.
D. The Official Map.
§ 650-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-23

relating to lot size and lot elevation necessary for proper sanitary
conditions in a subdivision not served by a public sewer where provision
for such service has not been made.
F. The rules of the State Department of Transportation relating to the
provision for the safety of entrance upon and departure from abutting
state trunk highways or connecting highways and for the preservation
of the public interest and investment in such highways.
G. As a further condition of approval, the City Council may require that the
subdivider make and install any public improvements reasonably
necessary, and that the subdivider execute a developer's agreement
with the City and post a surety bond to ensure that the developer will
make those improvements within a reasonable time and manner.
H. As a condition of approval, the City may require prior to accepting the
dedication of public streets, alleys, or other ways, or prior to permitting
private streets, alleys or other public ways to be placed on the Official
Map, that designated facilities shall be provided without cost to the
City, and that they be constructed according to municipal specifications
and under municipal inspection, or that a specified portion of such costs
shall be paid in advance as provided in § 66.0709(2), Wis. Stats. The
designated facilities include, but are not limited because of
enumeration, storm sewer and appurtenances; sanitary sewer mains
and laterals; water mains and laterals; grading and improvement of
streets, alleys, sidewalks and other public ways; streetlighting; street
trees; parkland; or other facilities designated by the City. No street tree
fees or fees in lieu of parkland or park development fees may be

initially been filed with the City Clerk after June 14, 2006.
I. As a condition of approval, the City may require that the subdivider be
responsible for making or causing to be made any necessary alterations
to any existing utilities serving the subdivision, which, by virtue of the
subdivision, fall within the public right-of-way, provided a rational
relationship between the alterations and the subdivision is found to
exist by the City Council.
J. As a condition of approval, the City may require that the subdivider
comply with stormwater regulations as set forth in Administrative Rule
02-01, which is incorporated herein by reference.18 In complying with
said stormwater regulations, the subdivider may be required to provide
stormwater management facilities within the subdivision or on other
property owned or controlled by the subdivider outside the subdivision,
provided such facilities directly serve the stormwater management
needs of the subdivision, No fees in lieu of stormwater management
facilities may be required as a condition of approval if the preliminary

ARTICLE IV
Land Division Procedures
§ 650-24. Compliance requirement.
Any subdivider and owner of land (or his agent) who wish to divide such
land shall comply with the general principles of design and minimum layout
requirements as set forth in Article Vof this chapter , and shall in every case
submit the information required in this article.
§ 650-25. Preapplication.
Prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat or
certified survey map, the subdivider shall submit a concept plan for review
and consultation with City staff and all affected utilities in order to obtain
advice and assistance. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory
but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives
of these regulations, the adopted regional, county or City Comprehensive
Plans or adopted plan components and plan implementation ordinances of
the City and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning his development.
In so doing, both the subdivider and planning agency may reach mutual
conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the proposed
development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and City and
the subdivider will gain a better understanding of subsequent required
procedures.
§ 650-26. Preliminary plat.
A. Submission and review. Before submitting a plat for approval, the
subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat, which shall be clearly
marked "preliminary plat," and a letter of application. The subdivider
shall submit the information required under §§ 650-22 and 650-25.
After completing the determination of adequate facilities and the
concept plan review under those sections, the subdivider may prepare a
preliminary plat which shall conform to the provisions set forth in
Article V of this chapter and shall file with the City Clerk an application
in writing for the tentative approval of said plat, accompanied by one
digital copy of the plat in a generally acceptable format and folded
copies as shall be required by the City Clerk to comply with this
chapter. The plat shall be submitted at least 40 calendar days prior to
the meeting of the Plan Commission at which action is desired. In
addition:
(1) Upon filing the preliminary plat with the City Clerk, the owner shall
pay a fee as established from time to time by resolution of the City
Council.

trunk highway or connecting highway, two copies to the
Department of Safety and Professional Services, if the subdivision
is not served by a public sewer and provision for such service has
not been made, two copies to the Department of Natural Resources
(WDNR), if navigable waters, shoreland/wetlands or floodlands are
contained within the proposed subdivision, and four copies to the
Jefferson County planning agency, if required by Jefferson County.
(3) The City Clerk shall transmit seven copies to the City Plan
Commission, five copies to the City Council and one copy each to
the Building Inspector, Public Works Board, Parks Board, Police
Department, City Assessor, Engineering Consultant, Planning
Consultant, and Fire Department for their review and
recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. The
recommendations, if any, of City boards, commissions and
departments shall be transmitted to the City Plan Commission
within 30 days from the date the plat is filed. The preliminary plat
shall then be reviewed by the City Plan Commission for
conformance with this chapter and all ordinances, rules,
regulations, Comprehensive Plans and Comprehensive Plan
components.
(4) The City Clerk shall transmit two copies to the Lake Mills Light and
Water Utility and one copy each to WE Energies, American
Transmission Company, local telecommunications companies, the
cable television franchisee, and the Lake Mills School District for
their review and information concerning matters within their
jurisdiction. Their comments, if any, shall be transmitted to the City
Manager within 20 days from the date the plat is filed.
(5) The City Plan Commission is designated as the recommending
agency with respect to design and layout of the preliminary plat
under §§ 650-32 and 650-33 of this chapter.
(6) The Wisconsin Department of Administration (WDOA), Wisconsin
Department of Safety and Professional Services, the Wisconsin
Department of Transportation (WisDOT), and Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) shall hereafter be
referred to as "objecting agencies."
(7) The preliminary plat shall be checked and reviewed as to its
conformity to the Official Map, the Comprehensive Plan, and
Chapter 660, Zoning Regulations, of this Code, and the principal
standards and requirements set forth in this chapter including
§ 650-22, Determination of adequacy of public facilities and
services, and copies of plats shall be referred for review and
recommendations to the Plan Commission, Public Works Board,
and Parks Board.
B. Preliminary plat approval. The objecting agencies shall, within 20 days
of the date of receiving their copies of the preliminary plat, notify the
§ 650-26 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-26
1:580
subdivider and all other approving and objecting agencies of any
objections; except the Department of Administration has 30 days to act.
If there are no objections, they shall so certify on the face of the copy
of the plat and shall return that copy to the City Plan Commission. If an
objecting agency fails to act within 20 days (30 days for the Department
of Administration), it shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat.
In addition: [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1,
General Provisions, Art. I)]
(1) The City Plan Commission shall, within 60 days of the date of filing
of a preliminary plat with the City Clerk, examine the preliminary
plat as to its conformance with this chapter; consider review
comments from objecting agencies, City staff and other agencies
required to review and comment on the preliminary plat; and shall
recommend approval, approval with conditions or rejection of the
preliminary plat to the City Council.
(2) After review of the preliminary plat and conferences with the
owner on any changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of
public improvements which will be required, the Plan Commission
shall reject or recommend approval or conditional approval of the
plat. The Plan Commission shall state by resolution any conditions
of approval or reasons for rejection.
(3) If the Plan Commission rejects the plat, it shall return it to the
owner.
(4) If the Plan Commission recommends approval of the preliminary
plat, the City Council shall, within 90 days of the date the plat and
application were filed with the City Clerk, approve conditionally or
reject such plat and shall state in writing any conditions of approval
or reasons for rejection, unless the time is extended by agreement
with the subdivider. Failure of the City Council to act within 90 days
or extension thereof shall constitute an approval of the preliminary
plat. The Clerk shall communicate to the owner the action of the
Council.
(5) Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not
constitute automatic approval of the final plat, except that if the
final plat is submitted within 36 months of preliminary plat
approval and conforms substantially to the preliminary plat layout
as provided under § 236.11(1)(b), Wis. Stats., the final plat shall be
entitled to approval with respect to such layout. If the final plat is
not submitted within 36 months of the last required approval of the
preliminary plat, any approving authority may refuse to approve
the final plat. An approved preliminary plat shall be deemed an
expression of approval or conditional approval of the layout
submitted and used as a guide in the preparation of the final plat,
which will be subject to further consideration by the City Plan
Commission and City Council at the time of its submission.
§ 650-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-26
1:581
(6) If after the approval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat
by either the Plan Commission or the City Council, the subdivider
creates a substantial change to the subdivision layout, the City
shall require the resubmittal of a preliminary plat in conformance
with Subsection B(1) above. A professional engineer or planner
shall review all plats to determine whether the final plat conforms
substantially to the preliminary plat. If the change is made at the
request of the City, a substantial change shall not be presumed to
have occurred and the subdivider may proceed with submittal of a
final plat.
C. Preliminary plat technical details.
(1) General. A preliminary plat shall be required for all subdivisions
and shall be based upon a survey by a professional land surveyor
(RLS) and the plat prepared on tracing cloth, reproducible drafting

(3) Street plans and profiles. The Plan Commission, upon the
recommendation of the City's Engineering Consultant, may require
that the subdivider provide street plans and profiles showing
existing ground surface, proposed and established street grades,
including extensions for a reasonable distance beyond the limits of
the proposed subdivision when requested. All elevations shall be
based upon mean sea level (1929) datum, and plans and profiles
shall meet the approval of the City's Engineering Consultant.
(4) Testing. The Plan Commission, upon the recommendation of the
City's Engineering Consultant, may require borings and soundings
be made in specified areas to ascertain subsurface soil, rock and
water conditions, including depth to bedrock and depth to
groundwater table. The City does not guarantee, warrant or
represent that those soils tested and shown to be unsuited for
specific uses are the only unsuited soils within the City and thereby
asserts that there is no liability on the part of the City Council, its
agencies or employees for sanitation problems or structural
damage that may occur as a result of reliance upon and
conformance with this chapter. Where the subdivision will not be
served by public sanitary sewer service, Ch. SPS 385, Wis. Adm.
Code, shall be complied with and the appropriate data submitted
with the preliminary plat.
(5) Soil and water conservation. The City Council shall require the
subdivider to provide soil erosion and sedimentation control plans

States Conservation Service Technical Guide and shall be in
accordance with standards in § 650-34Kof this chapter and
§ 660-133 of the Zoning Regulations of the Municipal Code. In
addition:
(a) Tree cutting and shrubbery clearing shall be so conducted as
to prevent erosion and sedimentation and preserve and
improve scenic qualities.
(b) Paths and trails shall not exceed 10 feet in width and shall be
so designed and constructed as to result in the least removal
and disruption of trees and shrubs and the minimum
impairment of natural beauty.
(c) Earth movements such as grading, topsoil removal, mineral
extraction, watercourse changing, road cutting, waterway
construction or enlargement, removal of streams or lake bed
materials, excavation, channel clearing, ditching, drain tile
laying, dredging and lagooning shall be so conducted as to
prevent erosion and sedimentation and to least disturb the

the City's interests.
(7) Easements. Easements shall be shown on the preliminary plat and
shall be limited to utility easements, drainage easements,
conservation easements, access easements, scenic easements,
mineral easements, solar access easements, or air rights
easements. Easements shall not be used for the conveyance of
street rights-of-way, pedestrian rights-of-way, park or school lands
or other public lands requiring dedication.
(8) Affidavit. The surveyor preparing the preliminary plat shall certify
on the face of the plat that it is a correct representation of all
existing land divisions and features and that there has been full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(9) A detailed site analysis per the following:
(a) The detailed site analysis required by this section is designed
to provide the clear identification of permanently protected
green space areas on a site which is proposed for development.
The detailed survey work required to identify these areas
accurately on a map is not required prior to the initiation of
development concept plans for an area.
(b) A detailed site analysis shall be performed in conjunction with
required preliminary plat documents for any and all properties
containing:
[1] Permanently protected natural resource areas defined as
required protected areas under state or federal
regulations.
§ 650-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-26
1:587
[2] All environmental corridor components and areas
identified by the adopted Comprehensive Plan and/or by
Jefferson County if lands outside the City's corporate limits
are included.
[3] Any other quality environmental lands as determined by
the City Manager or City Forester.
(c) The detailed site analysis shall be shown on a map of the
subject property which depicts the location of all protected
natural resource areas and environmental corridor
components, as defined by the provisions of this section, and as
located by an on-site property survey. The detailed site analysis
shall meet the following requirements:
[1] Scale. Map information shall be at a scale sufficient to
show required data for detailed site analysis. A minimum
scale may be prescribed by the City Manager or his
designee;
[2] Topography. Topographic information is not required for
any property that does not contain steep slopes. For such
properties, topographic information with a minimum
contour interval of two feet is required.
[3] Specific natural resources areas. All areas subject to the
provisions of § 650-26C(9)(b)shall be accurately outlined
and clearly labeled. Particular care as to clarity shall be
taken in areas where different resource types overlap with
one another.
[4] Development pads. All site disruption (including selective
cutting) proposed to occur within permanently protected
natural resource areas shall be limited to development
pads except as required to remove nonnative or
undesirable species as identified in an approved
management plan for the site. Development pads shall be
depicted on the detailed site analysis map, and preliminary
plat of subdivision.
[5] Tree survey. Where site disruption occurs in forested
areas, a tree survey may be required so that the City
Forester and Planning Commission may adequately make
recommendations to what forest areas must be
permanently protected by easement or dedication. The
tree survey should show the species and size of all trees
affected that are six-inch caliper or larger.
(d) Site disruption activities shall not compact soil covering tree
roots, or otherwise damage trees beyond area from which
trees are to be removed. The use of snow fences and other
barriers to outline development pads during disruption activity
§ 650-26 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-26
1:588
is strongly recommended to limit the extent of inadvertent
compaction or other disturbance of earth, and collision
damage to vegetation intended for protection. Such barriers
should be placed no closer to protected trees than a point
on the ground directly under their outer canopy edge. The
use of on-site temporary construction signage is also highly
recommended.
(e) Tree replacement surety. A surety in a form approved by the
City Attorney may be required to secure the replacement of all
trees with calipers exceeding six inches, whose canopies are
located adjacent to disturbed areas, which die within a period
of five years following site disruption, and to secure the
restoration of all mitigation areas identified on the detailed site
analysis.
(f) All mitigation areas and the areas they buffer, related to the
provisions of this chapter, shall be depicted on the detailed site
analysis map with notations provided which describe the
mitigation techniques employed.
(g) Required procedure for submission and review of detailed site
analysis.
[1] The detailed site analysis map shall be submitted to the
City Clerk for review concurrent with the submission of
the preliminary plat of subdivision. A concept plan of the
proposed development may be submitted prior to the
submission of the detailed site analysis map, however, in
no way does the acceptance and/or general approval of the
concept plan indicate the approval of natural resource
feature locations.
[2] The City Manager shall review the submitted detailed site
analysis map for general compliance with this chapter.
Such review may include data sources, including but not
limited to the following examples:
[a] The Official Zoning Map;
[b] Applicable USGS 7.5 minute topographic maps for the
City of Lake Mills and its environs or other USGS
quads and sources of topographic information;
[c] Air photos of the subject property;
[d] Applicable FEMA and related floodplain maps;

[h] Site visits.
(h) Information contained on the detailed site analysis map
relating to the boundaries of permanently protected green
space areas (including natural resource protection areas, other
permanently protected green space areas, and required
mitigation areas) shall be recorded as a deed restriction which
permanently runs with the land. Said areas shall be clearly
depicted on any and all site plans required as a precondition
for application for any development permit which occurs
subsequent to any proposed final plat of subdivision.
(10) Conservation subdivisions shall include the following additional
information:
(a) Inventory and mapping of existing resources including the
following mapped to scale:
[1] Topographic contours at two-foot intervals.

karst areas and areas with high potential for groundwater
contamination due to fractured bedrock or the presence of
arsenic and mercury.
[3] Hydrologic characteristics, including surface water
bodies, floodplains, groundwater recharge and discharge
areas, wetlands, natural swales, drainageways, and steep
slopes.
[4] Land cover on the site, according to general cover type
(pasture, woodland, etc.), and standalone trees with a
caliper of more than six inches measured four feet off the
ground. The inventory shall include comments on the
health and condition of the vegetation.
[5] Current and past land use, all buildings and structures on
the land, cultivated areas, brownfields, waste sites, and

historic buildings, archaeological sites, and burial sites.
(b) Development yield analysis. The subdivider shall submit a table
showing the maximum number of dwelling units that would be
permitted under the City Zoning Ordinance, consistent with
the required minimum lot size, lot widths, setbacks, and other
provisions of the zoning ordinance and compare it to the
number of dwelling units proposed. Land that is undevelopable
because of other laws and ordinances that prohibit
development in certain areas (e.g., floodplains, wetlands, steep
slopes, and drainageways) shall be excluded from the
development yield analysis; however, some undevelopable
lands can be allowed as easements on lots within the
development yield analysis as long as buildable area is found
on each parcel depicted. The yield analysis shall include:
[1] Natural resources. Inventory and mapping of existing
resources found on the development site. This shall
include an inventory of preserved and disturbed natural
features and prominent views.

the Plan Commission or City Council, the subdivider may proceed
with installation of subdivision improvements after approval of the
engineering plans by the City's Engineering Consultant, Public
Works and Public Utility Boards, approval of all other applicable
agencies and submittal to the City of copies of all permits and
letters of approval and/or may submit a final plat for review. The
subdivider shall enter into a contract with the City agreeing to
install the required improvements and file with the contract a letter
of credit, cash or certified check, or surety bond meeting the
approval of the City Attorney in an amount 120% of the estimated
cost of the improvements, such estimate to be made by the City
Manager upon recommendation of the City's Engineering
Consultant, as a guarantee such improvements will be completed
by the subdivider or his subcontractors not later than two years
from the date of recording of the plat and as a further guarantee
that all obligations to subcontractors for work on the development
are satisfied.
(9) If after approval or conditional approval of the final plat by either
the Plan Commission or City Council, the subdivider creates a
substantial change to the subdivision layout, the City shall require
the resubmittal of a final plat in conformance with Subsection A. If
the change is made at the request of the City, a substantial change
shall not be presumed to have occurred.
C. Final plat technical requirements.
(1) General. A final plat prepared by a professional land surveyor shall

and water resources; least disturb the existing terrain, flora, fauna
and water regimen; and meet all the use, site, sanitary, floodland
and shoreland regulations contained in the City Zoning Code and
the Jefferson County Code when applicable. In areas for which such
plans have not been completed, the street layout shall recognize
the functional classification of the various types of streets and shall
be developed and located in proper relation to existing and
proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as
streams and tree growth, to public convenience and safety, to the
proposed use of the land to be served by such streets and to the
most advantageous development of adjoining areas. The
subdivision shall be designed so as to provide each lot with
satisfactory solar access and access to a public street.
(a) Arterial streets, as defined in § 650-7, shall be arranged so as
to provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of
governmental activity, community shopping areas, community
recreation and points beyond the boundaries of the community.
Arterial streets shall also be properly integrated with and

arterial streets and highways and shall be, insofar as
practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or
planned streets with which they are to connect.
(b) Collector streets, as defined in § 650-7, shall be arranged so as
to provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and
conveyance of this traffic to the arterial street and highway
system and shall be properly related to the mass transportation
system, to special traffic generators such as schools, churches
and shopping centers and other concentrations of population
and to the arterial streets into which they connect.
(c) Minor streets, as defined in § 650-7, shall be arranged to
conform to the topography, discourage use by through traffic,
permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage
systems and require the minimum street area necessary to
provide safe and convenient access to abutting property.

front on a public street, highway, parkway or other public way.
(g) Reserve strips shall not be provided on any plat to control
access to streets or alleys, except where control of such strips
is placed with the City under conditions approved by the Plan
Commission.
(h) Street names shall not duplicate or be similar to existing street
names, and existing street names shall be projected wherever
possible. Final approval of street names rests with the City
Council, upon recommendation of the Plan Commission, Public
Works Board and Police Department.
(i) Access shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas for
off-street loading and service areas unless otherwise required
by the Plan Commission.
(2) Limited access highway and railroad right-of-way treatment.
Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a
limited access highway, arterial or railroad right-of-way, the design
shall provide the following treatment:
(a) When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the rightof-
way of an existing or proposed limited access highway,
arterial or a railroad, a planting strip at least 30 feet in depth
shall be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in
addition to the normal lot depth. This strip shall be part of the
platted lots but shall have the following restriction lettered on
the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting of
§ 650-32 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-32
1:612
trees and shrubs and the building of all structures excepting
public or private utility structures hereon is prohibited."
(b) Where commercial and industrial districts are involved there
shall be provided, on each side of the limited access highway or
railroad, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable
distance from such highway or railroad for the appropriate use
of the land between such streets and highway or railroad, but
shall not be less than 150 feet from the right-of-way of the
limited access highway or railroad.
(c) If a proposed street is to parallel a limited access highway or
railroad right-of-way (not to include bicycle or recreation
trails), and if the proposed street intersects an arterial or
collector street that crosses a railroad or highway, then the
proposed street shall be located at least 250 feet from the
limited access highway or railroad right-of-way to which it is
parallel. See Figure 5.1.
Figure 5.1: Recommended Right-of-Way Separation
Parallel to a Highway or Railroad
(d) Minor streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad
rights-of-way shall be avoided and location of minor streets
immediately adjacent to arterial streets and highways and
railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided in residential areas.
(3) Street and pedestrianway design standards.
(a) Minimum standards. The minimum right-of-way, construction
standards and roadway width of all proposed streets and alleys
shall be as specified by the City's standard specifications,
Comprehensive Plan, Official Map or neighborhood
development plan or county jurisdictional highway system plan
§ 650-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-32
1:613
or, if no width is specified therein, the minimum width shall be
as shown on Table 5.1 below, unless otherwise specified in the
Long-Range Transportation Plan.
Table 5.1: Right-of-Way Width
Street Type
Right-of-Way Width
(feet)
Arterial 100
Collector 80
Local residential 66
Pedestrianways 10
(b) Cul-de-sac streets. Unless otherwise waived by the City
Council, streets designed to have one end permanently closed
shall not exceed 300 feet in length, shall be paved with a
minimum thirty-four-foot-wide pavement, finished with
standard curb and gutter which shall be smoothly connected to
the main street, and shall have a minimum right-of-way radius
of 60 feet and a minimum outside curb radius of 48 feet.
(c) Street grades. Street grades shall be established wherever
practicable so as to avoid excessive grading, the indiscriminate
removal of ground cover and tree growth, and general leveling
of the topography. All changes in street grades shall be
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent in
feet to 15 times the algebraic difference in the rates of grade
for arterial streets and 1/2 this minimum for all other streets.
Unless necessitated by exceptional topography, subject to the
approval of the City Council, the maximum center line grade of
any street or public shall comply with Table 5.2. In no case
shall the grade of any street exceed 12% or be less than 1/2 of
1%.
Table 5.2: Maximum Permitted Grade
Street Type Maximum Permitted Grade
Arterial streets 6%
Collector streets 8%
Minor streets, alleys and
frontage streets
10%
Pedestrianways 12%, unless steps of
acceptable design are
provided
(d) Half streets. Where an existing dedicated or platted half street
is adjacent to the tract being subdivided, the other half of the
§ 650-32 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-32
1:614
street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of new
half streets shall not be permitted.
(e) Roadway elevations through floodlands. Elevations of
roadways passing through floodland areas shall be designed in
the following manner:
[1] At least two feet above the one-hundred-year recurrence
interval flood elevation for arterial streets.
[2] At least two feet above the ten-year recurrence interval
flood elevation for minor streets.
[3] At no less than the one-hundred-year recurrence interval
flood elevation for collector streets.
(f) New and replacement bridges and culverts. All new and
replacement bridges and culverts over perennial waterways,
including pedestrian and other minor bridges, in addition to
meeting other applicable requirements, shall be designed so as
to accommodate the one-hundred-year recurrence interval
flood event without raising the peak stage, either upstream or
downstream, more than 0.01 foot above the peak stage for the
one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood, as established in
the applicable federal flood insurance study or other technical
study. Larger permissible flood stage increases may be
acceptable for reaches having topographic land use conditions
which could accommodate the increased stage without
creating additional flood damage potential upstream or
downstream of the proposed structure providing that flood
easements or other appropriate legal measures have been
secured from all property owners affected by the excess stage
increases. Such bridges and culverts shall be so designed and
constructed as to facilitate the passage of ice floes and other
debris. All new and replacement bridges shall be constructed
in accordance with all applicable state statutes and codes and
plans shall be submitted to the Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) to assure compliance therewith.
(g) Radii of curvature.
[1] When a continuous street center line deflects at any one
point by more than 10 degrees, a circular curve shall be
introduced having a radius of curvature on the center line
of not less than the following:
§ 650-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-32
1:615
Table 5.3: Radii of Curvature
Street Type
Radii of Curvature
(feet)
Arterial streets and highways 500
Collector streets 300
Minor streets 100
[2] Where the Wisconsin Department of Transportation
Facilities Development Manual (FDM 11-10-5)
recommends a greater radii of curvature, the FDM shall
govern. The length of tangent shall be at least 100 feet
between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
(h) Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
(i) Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets
shall be prohibited except where their control is definitely
placed in the City under conditions approved by the Plan
Commission.
B. Street intersections.
(1) Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles as
topography and other limiting factors of good design permit, and
not more than two streets shall intersect at one point unless
approved by the Plan Commission,
(2) The number of intersections along arterial streets and highways
shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, the distance
between such intersections shall not be less than 1,200 feet.
(3) Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of 25 feet or of a greater radius where the Plan Commission
considers it necessary, or shall be cut off by a straight line through
the points of tangency of any arc having a radius of 45 feet.
(4) Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided. Minor streets shall not necessarily continue across
arterial or collector streets, but if the center line of such minor
streets approach the collector or arterial streets from opposite
sides within 300 feet of each other, measured along the center line
of such arterial or collector streets, then the location of such minor
streets shall be adjusted so that the adjoinment across the arterial
or collector streets is continuous and a jog is avoided.
(5) On all streets where sidewalks are required, ramps or openings to
accommodate handicapped individuals or vehicles shall be
provided in accordance with § 66.0909, Wis. Stats.
§ 650-32 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-32
1:616
C. Alleys.
(1) Alleys shall be provided in all commercial and industrial districts,
except that the Plan Commission may waive this requirement
where other definite and assured provision is made for service
access such as off-street loading and parking consistent with and
adequate for the uses proposed.
(2) Alleys shall not be approved in residential areas unless necessary
because of topography or other exceptional circumstances.
(3) The width of alleys shall be not less than 25 feet.
(4) Dead-end alleys are prohibited except under very unusual
circumstances, and crooked and "T" alleys shall be discouraged.
Where dead-end alleys are unavoidable, alleys shall be provided
with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end.
D. Blocks. The widths, lengths and shapes of blocks shall be suited to the
planned use of the land; zoning requirements; need for convenient
access, control and safety of street traffic; topography and solar access.
(1) The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development
contemplated but block lengths in residential areas shall not
exceed 1,500 feet nor be less than 300 feet between street lines.
(2) Pedestrianways of not more than 10 feet in width may be required
where deemed necessary by the City Plan Commission to provide
safe and convenient pedestrian circulation between the individual
lots, streams, lakeshores, parklands or other public areas or may be
required near the center and entirely across any block where
deemed essential by the City Plan Commission to provide adequate
pedestrian circulation or access to schools, shopping centers,
churches, parks, open spaces, or transportation facilities. The final
plat shall contain a special restriction addressing by whom
midblock pedestrianways will be maintained.
(3) The width of blocks shall be wide enough to provide for two tiers of
lots of appropriate depth except where otherwise required to
separate residential development from through traffic. Width of
lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use
shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking
required by the use contemplated and the area zoning restrictions
for such use.
(4) Utility easements shall, where practical, be placed on midblock
easements along rear lot lines.
E. Lots. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated. The lots should be designed to provide an aesthetically
§ 650-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-32
1:617
pleasing building site and a proper architectural setting and for solar
access for the building contemplated. In addition:
(1) Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles of
radial street lines.
(2) Municipal boundaries. Lots shall follow municipal boundary lines
whenever practicable, rather than cross them.
(3) Shape. The shape of lots shall generally be rectangular, with lots
platted on culs-de-sac generally narrower at the street line than at
the rear lot line.
(4) Lots at right angles. Lots at right angles to each other should be
avoided whenever possible, especially in residential areas.
(5) Large lots. In case a tract is subdivided into parcels containing one
or more acres, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the resubdivision
of any parcels into normal lots in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
(6) Double frontage and reverse frontage. Double frontage and
reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to
provide separation of residential development from through traffic
or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation. Where double frontage and reverse frontage lots are
permitted, an extra lot depth of 30 feet or landscaped buffering
shall be provided, unless a greater depth is specified herein.
Landscape buffering shall be to a minimum depth of 15 feet.
(7) Access to public street. Every lot shall front or abut on a public
street for a distance of at least 30 feet and be at least 45 feet on all
proposed culs-de-sac. Lots with an access only to private drives or
streets shall be permitted only with the Plan Commission approval.
(8) Area. Area of all lots shall conform to the requirements of the City
Zoning Code or zoning ordinance of the jurisdiction where the land
division occurs.
(9) Depth. Depth of lots shall be a minimum of 100 feet. Excessive
depth in relation to width shall be avoided and a proportion of two
to one shall be considered a desirable ratio under normal
conditions. Residential lots, fronting on major streets and
highways, should be platted with extra depth to permit generous
distances between the buildings and such trafficways. Depth and
width of lots or parcels reserved or laid out for commercial or
industrial use shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and
parking and outdoor storage required by the use contemplated and
the zoning restrictions for such use.
(10)Water's edge. Lands lying between the meander line and the
water's edge and any otherwise unplattable lands which lie
§ 650-32 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-32
1:618
between a proposed subdivision and the water's edge shall be
included as part of lots, outlots or public dedications in any plat
abutting a stream or lake.
(11)Width. Width of lots shall conform to the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance or other applicable ordinance.
(12) Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use should have extra width
to permit full building setback of at least 30 feet from both streets
or as required by the zoning regulations of the City.
F. Building setback lines.
(1) Building setback lines, appropriate to the location and type of
development contemplated, which are more or less restrictive than
the regulations of the zoning district in which the plat is located,
may be required by the Plan Commission, if under planned
development. Building setback lines appropriate to the location and
type of development contemplated which are more restrictive than
the regulation of the zoning district in which the plat is located,
may be required by the Plan Commission and shall be shown on the
final plat or certified survey map. Examples of the application of
this provision include requiring greater setbacks on cul-de-sac lots
to achieve the necessary lot width at the setback line, requiring
greater setbacks to conform to setbacks of existing adjacent
development or setting special yard requirements to protect
natural resource elements.
(2) Shoreland/wetland and isolated wetland setbacks, in addition to
those required by the City Zoning Code, may be required by the
Plan Commission. See the Zoning Code for more details regarding
the specific wetland protection buffer areas.
G. Special restrictions. Special restrictions which are appropriate to the
location or design of the land division may be required by the Plan
Commission and shall be shown on the final plat or certified survey
map. Examples of the application of this provision include access
control along public ways, required planting and buffering strips, and
prohibition of structures and vegetative clearing in environmentally
significant lands.
H. Easements.
(1) Utility. The Plan Commission or Public Works Board may require
utility easements of widths deemed adequate for the intended
purpose on each side of all rear lot lines and on each side of all side
lot lines or across lots where necessary or advisable for electric
power and communication facilities, storm and sanitary sewers;
street trees, gas, water, streetlights and other utility lines and solar
access. All easements shall be noted on the final plat followed by
reference to the use or uses for which they are intended.
§ 650-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-32
1:619
(2) Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway channel or stream, an adequate
easement shall be provided. The location, width, alignment, and
improvement of such drainageway or easement shall be subject to
the approval of the City's Engineering Consultant; and parallel
streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.
Where necessary, stormwater drainage shall be maintained by
landscaped open channels of adequate size and grade to
hydraulically accommodate maximum potential volumes of flow,
subject to review and approval by the City's Engineering
Consultant. All easements shall be noted on the final plat followed
by reference to the use or uses for which they are intended.
I. Public sites, parks, and open spaces.
(1) Purpose. The requirements of this section are established to insure
that adequate parks, open spaces and sites for other public uses
are properly located and preserved as the City grows. It has also
been established to insure that the cost of providing the park and
recreation sites and facilities necessary to serve the additional
people brought into the community by land development may be
equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional needs created
by the development. The requirements shall apply to all lands
proposed for all residential development.
(2) Design. In the design of a subdivision, land division, planned unit
development or development project, provision shall be made for
suitable sites or adequate areas for future schools, parks,
playgrounds, open spaces, drainageways and other public
purposes. Such sites, as are shown on the Official Map,
Comprehensive Plan, Comprehensive Plan component,
comprehensive outdoor recreation plan, Official Map or
component, neighborhood development plan, or that are deemed
appropriate and necessary by the Plan Commission, shall be made
a part of the design. Consideration shall be given to the
preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of trees, marshes,
lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds, ravines, and
woodland, prairie and wetland plant and animal communities. The
park shall be improved with the necessary public improvements
required in § 650-33F.
(3) Dedication, reservation, payment-in-lieu-of. Accordingly, each
subdivider of land in the City shall, at the discretion and direction
of the Plan Commission, either dedicate open space lands
designated on the City Comprehensive Plan or plan component or
reserve such open space lands and pay a fee or, where no open
space lands are directly involved, pay a fee. The Plan Commission
shall, at the time of reviewing the preliminary plat, condominium
plat, or certified survey map, select one of the following options and
record its selection in the minutes of the meeting at which the
§ 650-32 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-32
1:620
preliminary plat, condominium plat, or certified survey map is
presented for approval:
(a) Dedication option. Whenever a proposed playground, park,
recreation, or other public open space land designated on the
City's Comprehensive Plan, neighborhood unit development
plan or other Comprehensive Plan component is encompassed,
all or in part, within a tract of land to be subdivided by plat or
certified survey map, the public lands shall be made a part of
the plat and be dedicated to the public by the subdivider. A
minimum of 1,740 square feet of land area shall be dedicated
for each proposed dwelling unit.
(b) Reservation option. Whenever a proposed playground, park or
other public open space land designated on the City's
Comprehensive Plan, neighborhood unit development plan or
other Comprehensive Plan component is encompassed, all or in
part, within a tract of land to be subdivided by plat or certified
survey map, the proposed public open space lands shall be
made a part of the plat or certified survey map and reserved at
the time of final plat or certified survey map approval for a
period not to exceed three years, unless extended by mutual
agreement, for acquisition at undeveloped land prices by the
public agency having jurisdiction and the subdivider shall pay
a fee at the time of the signing and recording of a certified
survey map, or final plat of the subdivision, or part thereof at
the rate and according to the procedures in Subsection I(3)(c)
below. Land not acquired within the three-year time period will
be released to the owner.
(c) Park fee option. If the proposed land division does not
encompass a proposed public park, parkway, open space
conservation site or other open space lands, or if the City Plan
Commission requires the reservation of land under Subsection
I(3)(b) above, park dedication fees shall be required.
(d) A park dedication fee shall apply to both residential and
nonresidential properties and shall be paid to the City
Treasurer at the time of the signing and recording of a certified
survey map, final condominium plat, or final plat of the
subdivision, or part thereof in an amount as from time to time
established by resolution of the City Council to defray the
impact the additional development and residences will have on
City parks, the City trail system, and the preserving of the
City's agricultural, natural and cultural resources within the
City's park system. The amount of the fee shall be set by
resolution from year to year and shall be applied on the basis of
the total number of newly created residential dwelling units,
newly created lots, and per acre of developable land. Such fees
collected by the City Treasurer under the provisions of this
section shall be placed in separate nonlapsing special funds for
§ 650-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-32
1:621
park improvement purposes as allowed by Wis. Stats.
§ 66.0617. The funds shall be separated as established by
resolution of City Council to defray that cost of City park
system expansion and opportunities resulting from additional
development and new residences. The funds shall be separate
from the City general fund and such special funds shall be used
exclusively for funding the acquisition or initial improvement
of land for public parks as per Wisconsin Statutes. The
improvement of land for public parks means grading,
landscaping, installation of utilities, construction of sidewalks,
installation of playground equipment, and construction, or
installation of restroom facilities on land intended for public
park purposes.
J. Private common areas or improvements.
(1) If any commonly owned areas or improvements are to be part of the
subdivision, such privately owned portions of the subdivision shall
have an approved conservation easement or deed restriction that
makes provisions acceptable to the City for maintenance of said
common areas or improvements.
(2) The City shall require assurances that a homeowners' association,
nonprofit land trust, appropriate government agency, or other
responsible party will maintain the common area or improvements
in perpetuity.
(3) If the common area or improvements are to be managed by a
homeowners' association, it shall be a nonprofit membership
corporation whose purpose will be to maintain, improve, and
preserve certain properties within the project.
(a) To that extent, Wis. Stats. § 779.70 provides for the imposition
of a maintenance lien on all properties in the development and
the homeowners' association may impose liens upon each lot
for the cost of maintenance of common areas and
improvements. The liens may be enforced by foreclosure or
direct action against property owners to collect the amounts at
law.
(b) The City of Lake Mills shall be named as a third-party
beneficiary of any such lien. The declaration of covenants shall
set forth the provisions of the maintenance lien outlined above
and also provide for the right of the City to enforce these rights
as a third party beneficiary. The enforcement shall be preceded
by a thirty-day written notice allowing the homeowners'
association to perform the required maintenance.
(c) In the event no performance is made, the City may directly
make the repairs or maintenance and charge the costs as
assessments to individual lot owners.
§ 650-32 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-32
1:622
§ 650-33. Required improvements.
(d) The declarant for itself and its assigns shall waive notice and
protest of tax or assessments that may be levied by the City for
the maintenance or repairs performed by the City. Such
assessment of the pro rata share shall be a lien upon all the lots
subject to the covenants and such assessment shall be included
in the tax bill for each lot.
(e) In addition, the declarant shall post a surety bond in the
amount of $15,000 for a period of five years from the date the
association is incorporated that will ensure performance of the
obligations of the homeowners' association hereunder.
Thereafter, the homeowners' association shall maintain a fund
in a minimum amount of $5,000 for the purpose of reimbursing
expenses related to the operation of the association.
(f) The homeowners' association may not amend its bylaws in any
material respect that would adversely affect the interests of
the City of Lake Mills nor will it dissolve without the advance
written consent of the City of Lake Mills.
(4) If the common area or improvements are to be managed through an
entity other than a homeowners' association, such entity shall post
a surety bond or make other acceptable assurances that the
payment of the costs of the management of the common areas or
improvements will be adequately made in perpetuity.
A. General. All required improvements shall be constructed in accordance
with plans and standard specifications approved by the City Public
Works Board, City's engineering consultant, and WDNR, as may be
appropriate. Such plans and standard specifications shall be submitted,
reviewed and approved in accordance with § 650-34Gof this chapter.
(1) The improving of a dedicated roadway to City specifications must
follow the following guidelines: All land divisions which create new
public ROW shall be required to improve, within said ROW, a public
road to City of Lake Mills' specifications and detail drawings.
Should the road end with a permanent cul-de-sac, land must be
dedicated per City standards and the road constructed to City of
Lake Mills specifications. Should the road end with a future
possible road extension, a temporary cul-de-sac may be
constructed with a temporary easement; however, the size must be
the same as a permanent cul-de-sac. City of Lake Mills stormwater
management requirements must be met should the improvements
add more than 1/2 of an acre of impervious surface. All roadway,
grading, storm sewer, and stormwater plans must be reviewed by
the City of Lake Mills as required by the municipal code. The
following requirements vary by the size of the parcels being
divided:
§ 650-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-33
1:623
(a) Should a land division create parcels with an average size of
less than or equal to 40,000 square feet, the road shall be built
to City specifications that include curb and gutter and storm
sewer.
(b) Should a land division create parcels with an average size of
greater than 40,000 square feet, the developer may choose to
request a Public Works Board decision regarding the type of
improvements required. The only option Public Works Board
will consider other than curb and gutter section is ditch section
construction per City of Lake Mills specifications. Should this
option be permitted, the ditch sections shall be maintained by
the developer initially and ultimately the homeowners'
association. Furthermore, these restrictions outlining the
responsibility of this maintenance shall be recorded in a
developer's agreement approved by the City's City Council
concurrent with the final land division document.
(c) Private driveways within newly created public ROW are not
allowed under any circumstance.
(2) Improvements to be extended to farthest limit of parcel or lot. Any
and all improvements, streets, or utility services required by this
chapter, for the subdivision, certified survey map, or condominium
plat shall be extended to the farthest limit of the parcel or lot as set
forth on the plans and specifications approved by the City. If
determined by the Plan Commission, based on the information of
engineering staff, that a resulting development will cause
increased impacts on existing infrastructure, the cost of all
reasonably necessary improvements on the exterior of a
development, such as expanded roadways, intersections, and/or
utility extensions shall be paid by the developer/owner.
(3) Improvements to be extended to farthest affected area. Any and all
improvements, streets, or utility services required by this chapter,
for the subdivision, certified survey map, or condominium plat shall
be extended to the farthest affected area. If determined by the
Public Works Board, Public Utilities Committee, or Planning
Commission, based on the information of engineering staff, that a
resulting development will cause increased affects on
infrastructure, the cost of all improvements on the exterior of a
development, such as expanded roadways, intersections, and/or
utility extensions shall be paid by the developer/owner.
B. Survey monuments. The subdivider shall install survey monuments
placed in accordance with the requirements of § 236.15, Wis. Stats.,
and as may be required by the City's engineering consultant.
C. Grading.
(1) Cut-and-filled lands shall be graded in accordance with the
approved plans or the soil's angle of repose, whichever is the lesser,
§ 650-33 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-33
1:624
and an approved cover shall be established within 30 days
following completion of grading operations or such additional time
period as may be approved by the City's engineering consultant.
(2) The subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all
streets proposed to be dedicated in accordance with plans and
standard specifications approved by the City Public Works Board,
and any agency having jurisdiction, including the WDNR, upon the
recommendation of the City's engineering consultant. The
subdivider shall grade the roadbeds in the street rights-of-way to
subgrade.
(3) Where electric and communication facilities are to be installed
underground, the utility easements shall be graded to within six
feet of final grade by the subdivider prior to the installation of such
facilities and earth fill, piles or mounds of dirt or construction
materials shall not be stored on such easement areas.
D. Surfacing. After the installation of all utility and stormwater drainage
improvements, the subdivider shall surface all roadways in streets
proposed to be dedicated to the widths prescribed by these regulations
and the adopted Comprehensive Plans or adopted plan components.
Such surfacing shall be done in accordance with plans and standard
specifications approved by the City Public Works Board, Public Utilities
Committee, upon the recommendation of the City's Engineering
Consultant and adopted by the City Council or its authorized agents.
The second lift of asphalt shall be installed in accordance with policies
established from time to time by the Public Works Board.
E. Curb and gutter. The City Council may require the subdivider to
construct concrete curb and gutters in accordance with plans and
standard specifications approved by the City Public Works Board,
Public Utilities Committee, upon the recommendation of the City's
engineering consultant and adopted by the City Council or its
authorized agents. Mountable curbs shall generally be constructed.

for development.
B. Development yield.
(1) The number of residential units for a parcel shall be determined in
accordance with the following:
(a) The development yield analysis in § 650-26C(9) shall establish
the base development yield for the parcel.
(b) The base development density may be increased if the
development complies with one or more of the following
standards. Each standard provides a development yield bonus
of the greater of one parcel or 5% of the base development
yield:
§ 650-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-36
1:639
[1] Providing for access by the general public to trails, parks
or other recreational facilities.
[2] Reusing existing buildings and structures which
incorporate rural or agrarian themes, including but not
limited to those sites inventoried by the State Historical
Society of Wisconsin.
[3] Preservation of Environmental features.
[4] Restores native prairie and provides a management plan
for perpetual maintenance.
[5] Improves water quality through stormwater management
standards and practices, that exceed the minimum
standards of Article IV of Chapter 660, Zoning, of the
Municipal Code, and, as approved by the City's
Engineering Consultant and the Public Works Committee.
[6] Provides a minimum seventy-five-foot setback and natural
buffer from all environmental features.
[7] Restores or enhances the functional classification of
wetlands using techniques approved by the USDA-NRCS
and the WDNR.
[8] Provides 70% or more of the gross acreage as open space
in the development. Rights-of-way, stormwater outlots, and
platted private property shall not count towards open
space requirements.
(2) For parent parcels less than 80 acres in area, the maximum bonus
permitted is the greater of three parcels or 15% of the base
development density. For parent parcels 80 acres or greater in
area, the maximum bonus permitted is the greater of four parcels
or 20% of the base development density. All development yield
bonuses shall be calculated to the nearest tenth. In cases where the
total combined development yield bonus results in a fraction, all
such fractions shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
C. Performance standards.
(1) General consideration. Conservation subdivisions must identify a
conservation theme or themes. This theme shall be identified at the
time of the initial application. Conservation themes may include,
but are not limited to, forest stewardship, water quality
preservation, farmland preservation, natural habitat restoration,
viewshed preservation, or archaeological and historic properties
preservation. The Plan Commission and City Forester shall have
the ability to specify which areas shall be preserved.
(2) Agricultural use. If agricultural uses are proposed to be
maintained, lots shall be configured in a manner that maximizes the
§ 650-36 LAKE MILLS CODE § 650-36
1:640
usable area remaining for such agricultural uses, with appropriate
buffers between agricultural uses and residential structures.
(3) Residential lot requirements. Residential parcels located within
conservation subdivisions shall conform to the PDD Planned
Development District zoning regulations and the following:
(a) Lots shall be in conformance with the design standards
identified in § 650-32E(1), (6), (7) and (12).
(b) All lots and dwellings shall be grouped into clusters of no more
than 20 dwelling units. Said clusters shall:
[1] Be located to minimize negative impacts on the natural,
scenic, and cultural resources of the site, and minimize
conflicts between incompatible uses.
[2] Avoid encroaching on rare plant communities, high-quality
environmental resources, or endangered resources as may
be identified by the WDNR.
(c) Lots shall be configured to minimize the amount of road length
required for the subdivision.
(d) All lots shall abut open space on at least one side. A minor
street may separate lots from said open space.
(e) Lots shall be oriented around one or more of the following:
[1] A central green or open space.
[2] A physical amenity such as a meadow, stand of trees, or
other natural or restored feature.
(4) Open space standards. Open space shall be designated as part of
the development.
(a) The minimum required open space is 60% of the gross acreage
less lands granted for density bonuses as stated in Subsection
B of this section. Rights-of-way, stormwater outlots, and platted
private property shall not count towards open space
requirements.
(b) All open space shall be owned and maintained under one of the
alternatives listed in Subsection C(6) below, and as approved
by the City.
(c) The uses within the open space shall be accessible to the
residents of the development. These uses may also be available
to the general public providing the proper approvals are
received. The required open space shall be undivided and
restricted in perpetuity from future development, as specified
in Subsection C(5) below.
§ 650-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-36
1:641
(d) That portion of open space designed to provide plant and
animal habitat shall be kept as intact as possible. Trails shall
be designed to avoid fragmenting these areas.
(e) Accessible open space in upland areas shall be available for
recreational uses such as trails, play fields, or community
gardens but should be designed in a manner that avoids
adversely impacting archeological sites.
(f) A pathway system connecting open space areas accessible to
neighborhood residents, and connecting these areas to
neighborhood streets and to planned or developed trails on
adjacent parcels shall be identified in the plan.
(g) The following areas or structures may be located within the
open space area and shall be counted toward the overall open
space percentage required:
[1] Parking areas for access to and use of the open space
developed at a scale limited to the potential users of the
open space.
[2] Privately held buildings or structures, provided they are
accessory to the use of the open space.
[3] Shared septic systems and shared water systems.
(5) Ownership and maintenance of common areas. The designated
common open space and common facilities may be owned and
managed by one or a combination of the following:
(a) An incorporated homeowners' association. Membership in the

ACCESSORY RESIDENTIAL UNIT (GRANNY FLAT)  An accessory
dwelling unit established in conjunction with, and clearly subordinate
to, the principal dwelling unit on a single-family zoned lot. Accessory
residential units are typically located at the rear of a lot, and are

primary resident, but may be located within the single-family dwelling.
Such units may contain a separate kitchen, dining area, bathroom,
living area, sleeping area, laundry facilities, and recreation areas,
including exterior porches, patios, decks and parking areas. Separate
outdoor access to the unit is required; however, external stairs serving
as the primary access are prohibited. In addition, separate access to
the garage or an internal physical connection to the principal dwelling
unit may be provided. A residence with an accessory dwelling unit may
not be used in the same manner as a duplex. An accessory dwelling unit
shall only be permitted by conditional use within specified residential
zoning districts.21

NEW CONSTRUCTION  For floodplain management purposes, "new
construction" means structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain zoning
regulations adopted by this community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures. For the purpose of determining flood
insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the "start of

Wisconsin portion of boundary waters, which are navigable under
the laws of this state. Under § 281.31(2m)(a), Wis. Stats.,
notwithstanding any other provision of law or administrative rule
promulgated thereunder, shoreland ordinances required under
§ 62.231, Wis. Stats., and Chapter NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, do not
apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches, if:
Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or
river;
(a)
Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands
were not navigable streams before ditching; and
(b)
(c) Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use.
(1)
Wisconsin's Supreme Court has declared navigable bodies of water
that have a bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or
flow sufficient to support navigation by a recreational craft of the
shallowest draft on an annually recurring basis [Muench v. Public
Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952) and DeGaynor and Co.,
Inc., v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975)].
For example, a stream which is navigable by skiff or canoe during
normal spring high water is navigable, in fact, under the laws of
this state, though it may be dry during other seasons.

field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a
system located on a different parcel than the structure.[Amended at
time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
PUBLIC UTILITIES  Those utilities using underground or overhead
transmission lines such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and

saturation by surface infiltration and encompasses all areas or features
that supply groundwater recharge to a well.
RECREATIONAL PURPOSE  A temporary structure is intended for the
relaxation and enjoyment of the owner and not used for any commercial
purpose.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE (RV)  The term "motor home" is often
used interchangeably with "RV." A motor home, however, is an informal
phrase, used to describe a variety of recreational vehicles (RVs), while
recreational vehicle (or RV) is a technical and legal term. The United
States Department of Transportation categorizes RVs by class. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term "recreational vehicle" or "RV" will
include the following vehicle types and units:
Class A RVs. Class A RVs are motor homes, regardless of the type
of chassis beneath them and whether or not the vehicle contains
"slide-outs" (additional living spaces that slide out when the vehicle
is stopped for camping). Class A also includes commercial
passenger and school buses that are converted into RVs (these
are often the largest mobile homes available). Class A RVs are
generally luxurious mobile homes with a solid body, a panoramic
front window, berths that convert from living room or dinette areas,
and bathroom facilities.
(1)
Class B RVs. Class B RVs are camper vans or conventional vans
with raised roofs (either "pop-up" or "fixed"). They often have small
kitchens with refrigerators and gas grills. Larger models may have
a water heater, heat and air conditioning, a portable toilet, or an
internal shower. Smaller models usually have a portable toilet and
an external shower, which can be used with an awning to ensure
privacy.
(2)
Class C RVs. Unlike a Class A mobile home, which is built on a
single chassis, a Class C vehicle is attached to a truck and hauled
behind. Class C RVs are characterized by a distinctive alcove which
fits over the truck cab, providing either a double berth for sleeping
or, sometimes, an "entertainment" section, with a TV and video
games.
(3)
Other RV Types. Other types of RVs or motor homes include:
Truck campers. Similar to the C-class vehicles described
above, these are smaller RVs, carried in the beds of pickup
truck.

designated as wetlands on final wetland inventory maps prepared by
the WDNR, with the exception of those wetlands described in § NR
117.05(1)(b)2, Wis. Adm. Code.
SHORELANDS  Defined in § 59.692(1)(b), Wis. Stats., to mean the
area within the following distances from the ordinary high-water mark
of navigable waters, as defined in § 281.31(1)(d), Wis. Stats.

1:699
§ 660-34. Shoreline Preservation and Vision and Access Corridor.
Figure 2.2: Boathouse Siting Regulations (Slopes Greater Than
20%)
A. Vision and access corridor. There shall be a vision and access corridor
in which vegetation may be removed and trees and shrubs trimmed.
This vision and access corridor shall be an area that does not exceed 30
feet if the lot as measured at the OHWM is 100 feet or more in width. If
the lot as measured at the OHWM is less than 100 feet in width, then
the vision and access corridor shall be no more than 30% of the lot
width.
B. Shoreland buffer. A strip of vegetative cover shall be maintained that
extends 35 feet inland from the OHWM and the entire width of the lot;
except within the vision and access corridor. In those cases where the
residential property is split by a public right-of-way, the shoreland
buffer shall apply between the edge of the right-of-way closest to the
OHWM and the OHWM, if that distance is less than 35 feet. Boathouses
shall be placed within the vision and access corridor if they are to be
located within the shoreland buffer.
C. Measuring shoreland buffer. If the slope extending landward from the
OHWM within the shoreland buffer area is less than 20%, then the 35
feet may be measured along the land surface. If the slope is equal to or
§ 660-33 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-34
1:700
greater than 20%, then the shoreland buffer area shall be the horizontal
distance of 35 feet from the OHWM. (See Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2,
§ 660-33.)
D. Shoreline vegetation. The shoreline shall be vegetated with ground
cover in all areas within 10 feet of the OHWM within the vision and
access corridor, with the exception of areas covered with boathouses,
stairways, and paths providing access to piers. Use of native plants is
encouraged. If naturally occurring sand is already present at the time of
adoption of this chapter, such sand may also be considered as meeting
this requirement to the extent that it is naturally occurring and already
present on the effective date of this chapter.
E. Vegetation removal.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of vegetation removal regulations applicable
to the shoreland area is to protect scenic beauty, control erosion
and replace effluent and nutrient flow from the shoreland. These
provisions shall not apply to the removal of dead, diseased or dying
trees or shrubbery at the discretion of the landowner, or to the
removal of noxious, nuisance or invasive species as they are
defined in §§ 271-3 and 271-6 of the Code of the City of Lake Mills23
or to silvicultural thinning upon recommendation of a forester.
(2) Shoreline cutting and vegetation removal.
(a) Vegetation may be removed and trees and shrubs may be
trimmed within the vision and access corridor, but removal
shall not occur within the shoreland buffer described in
Subsection B, unless such removal is performed on diseased or
dying vegetation. To the extent practicable, healthy individual
trees of twelve-inch caliper or larger and healthy stands of 10
or more trees of six-inch caliper or larger shall be preserved.
Within the shoreland buffer, routine pruning may be done, but
not to the extent of jeopardizing the health and viability of
trees or shrubbery.
(b) If vegetation has already been removed or tree and shrubbery
cutting has already occurred within the shoreland buffer, and
that vegetation removal or cutting has already occurred
outside the vision and access corridor, then mitigation and
restoration or partial restoration may be required as a
condition of approval of permits within the shoreland buffer.
(c) Natural shrubbery shall be preserved as far as practicable and,
where removed, it shall be replaced with other vegetation that
is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion and
preserving natural beauty.

passage within the thirty-five-foot strip shall be constructed and
surfaced as to effectively control erosion. A conditional use is
required under § 660-129J(3). Lake access stairways, pathways, or
roads shall be located within the vision and access corridor. New
structures allowed within 35 feet of the OHWM shall be located
within the vision and access corridor.
(4) Alternative cutting plan. An alternative cutting plan allowing
greater cutting than permitted under this section may be permitted
by the Plan Commission by issuance of a conditional use permit,
under § 660-195 of this chapter. In applying for such a permit, the
commission shall require the lot owner to submit a scale drawing of
the lot, including the following information: location of parking,
existing structures, paths, and stairs located within the shoreland
buffer and vision and access corridor, gradient of the land, existing
vegetation, proposed cutting, and proposed replanting. The
Commission may grant such a permit only if it finds that such
special cutting plans:
(a) Will not cause undue erosion or destruction of scenic beauty.
(b) Will provide substantial shielding from the water of dwellings,
accessory structures and parking areas. The replacement
plantings shall not include noxious, nuisance or invasive
species as they are defined in §§ 271-3 and 271-6 of this
chapter.
(5) Cutting more than 35 feet inland. From the inland edge of the
thirty-five-foot strip to the outer limits of the shoreland, the cutting
of trees and shrubbery shall be allowed when accomplished using
accepted forest management practices and sound soil conservation
practices which protect water quality.
(6) Any land-disturbing activities will adhere to the erosion control
measures outlined in § 660-143, Erosion control.
A. General standards. Filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, ditching or
excavating which does not require a permit under Subsection B below
is permitted in the shoreland area, provided that:
(1) It is done in a manner designed to minimize erosion, sedimentation
and impairment of fish and wildlife habitat.
(2) Filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, ditching or excavating in a
Shoreland-Wetland District meets the requirements of § 660-35 of
this chapter.
§ 660-34 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-35
1:702
(3) A state or federal permit is obtained in addition to a permit under
this chapter, if state or federal laws require the issuance of a permit
for the filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, ditching or excavating
that is proposed.
(4) Any fill placed in the shoreland area is protected against erosion by
the use of riprapping, vegetative cover or a bulkhead.
B. Permit required. Except as provided in Subsection C herein, a
conditional use permit is required:
(1) For any filling or grading of the bed of a navigable body of water.
(2) For any filling or grading of any area which is within 300 feet of the
ordinary high-water mark of a navigable water and which has
surface drainage toward the water and on which there is either:
(a) Filling or grading where a single area of more than 100 square
feet is exposed or where the cumulative exposed area exceeds
300 square feet.
(b) Any filling or grading on slopes of 20% or more.
(c) Filling or grading of more than 1,000 square feet on slopes of
12% to 20%.

of a navigable body of water or where the purpose is the ultimate
connection with a navigable body of water.
C. Soil conservation practices. Soil conservation practices such as
terraces, runoff diversions and grassed waterways which are used for
sediment retardation shall not require a permit under Subsection B
herein.
D. Permit conditions. In granting a conditional use permit under
§ 660-195, the City Plan Commission shall attach the following
conditions where appropriate, in addition to those provisions specified
in §§ 660-187 and 660-188.

parking or traffic circulation area be used as a storage area.
C. Traffic circulation design standards.
(1) Marking. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall be
paved with a hard, all-weather surface, to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Administrator. Said surfaces intended for four or more
parking stalls shall be marked in a manner that clearly indicates
required parking spaces.
(2) Lighting. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas serving
six or more cars shall be lit to ensure the safe and efficient use of
said areas during the hours of use. Said illumination shall meet the
standards of § 660-142 of this chapter.
(3) Fire lanes. A fire lane shall be required to provide access to any
portion of any structure equal to or less than 40 feet tall that is
§ 660-39 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-40
1:710
§ 660-41. Off-street parking.
more than 150 feet from the nearest street right-of-way, and to
any portion of any structure greater than 40 feet tall that is more
than 50 feet from the nearest street right-of-way. The Zoning
Administrator may also require the provision of a fire lane or lanes
to any part of any structure upon a determination that the distance
of the structure from the nearest hydrant, the configuration of
development on the site, or other special characteristics of the site
otherwise inhibit effective fire extinguishment. All fire lanes shall
provide clear, unobstructed access for vehicles and apparatus at
all times through a combination of pavement marking and signage;
shall be a minimum of 18 feet wide; and shall be surfaced as an allweather
roadway.
(4) Signage. All signage located within, or related to, required offstreet
parking or traffic circulation shall comply with the
requirements of Article VI of this chapter.
A. General provisions. This article regulates the minimum/maximum
number, the use, the design and the maintenance of parking spaces,
parking lots, drives/driveways, aisles, loading and drive-through
facilities within the City of Lake Mills.
(1) When required.
(a) For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date hereof, accessory parking
and loading facilities shall be provided as required in this
section. However, where a building permit has been issued
prior to the effective date hereof, and provided that
construction is begun within six months of such effective date
and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading
facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of said
building permits may be provided in lieu of any different
amounts required by this chapter.
(b) When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or
premises shall be increased through the addition of dwelling
units, gross floor area, seating capacity, employment, or other
units of measurement specified herein for required parking or
loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
(c) Parking is not required for nonresidential uses in the B1
Downtown Business District. However, when off-street parking
facilities are provided, such facilities shall be provided in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, except in
respect to the required number of spaces. Mixed-use/upperfloor
residential uses need only provide evidence of the
§ 660-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-41
1:711
availability of off-street public or private parking within 1,000
feet of the unit.
(d) Existing parking facilities. Accessory off-street parking
facilities in existence on the effective date of this chapter and
located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not
hereafter be reduced below or, if already less than, shall not be
further reduced below the requirements for a similar new
building or use under the provisions of this chapter.
(e) Use changes. Whenever the existing use of a building or
structure shall hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or
loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new
use. However, if the said building or structure was erected
prior to the effective date of this chapter, additional parking or
loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which
the requirements for the new use would exceed those for the
existing use, if the latter were subject to the parking and
loading provisions of this chapter.
(f) Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally
nonconforming building or use which is in existence on the
effective date of this chapter, which subsequently thereto is
damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other
cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished, or repaired,
off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided,
except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any
maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be
restored or continued in operation. However, in no case shall it
be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading
facilities in excess of those required by this chapter for
equivalent new uses or construction.
(2) Location.
(a) All parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the
structure or use that they are intended to serve, unless
otherwise specified in this chapter. In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on
which the building or use served is located, an agreement
allowing shared parking facilities shall be required between
the property owners. Such agreement may be either by deed or
long-term lease. The owner of the land on which the parking
facilities are to be located shall be bound by covenants filed on
record in the office of the Register of Deeds of Jefferson
County, requiring such owner, his or her heirs and assigns, to
maintain the required number of parking facilities for the
duration of the use. The recorded document shall be provided
to the City.
§ 660-41 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-41
1:712
(b) There shall be no parking in required parking setback areas or
outside of designated parking spaces, except in the driveways
of single-family and two-family dwellings. The following
regulations shall also apply:
[1] Transitional or buffer yards as regulated in § 660-113 of
this chapter take precedent over zoning district setback
requirements.
[2] Vehicular access easements across side and rear yard
setbacks of adjoining parking and loading facilities in
commercial and industrial districts, across side and rear
yards of parking and loading facilities of uses allowed by
conditional use permit in residential districts, and across
side and rear yard setbacks of multifamily developments in
multiple-family dwelling districts may be approved,
provided a cross-access easement is approved by the City
Attorney and filed with the Register of Deeds.
[3] Multifamily dwelling uses in multifamily districts may
reduce setbacks to a ten-foot minimum rear and side yard
setback for parking lots, unless a greater setback is
required per transitional buffer yard standards, and
provided the setback areas are devoted to green area and
comply with the landscaping requirements of this chapter.
(c) Locational prohibitions for off-street parking areas. No private
parking shall occur on street terraces, driveways, or any other
areas that are located within a public right-of-way.
(3) Calculation of requirements. Calculating the number of spaces
required shall be in accordance with the following:
(a) Net floor area. Net floor area shall be used for the purpose of
calculating the number of off-street parking spaces required.
(b) Assembly. In places of public assembly in which patrons or
spectators occupy benches, pews or other similar seating
facilities, each 30 inches of such seating shall be counted as
one seat for the purpose of this chapter.
(c) Capacity. In cases where parking requirements are based on
"capacity" of persons, capacity shall be based on the maximum
number of persons that may occupy a place, as determined by
the Building Code.
(d) Fractions. Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces
required shall be construed to be the next largest number.
(e) Shopping centers/joint parking. Except in shopping centers or
where joint parking has been approved, if a structure or site
contains two or more principal uses, each use shall be
§ 660-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-41
1:713
calculated separately in determining the total off-street
parking spaces required.
(f) Unspecified uses. The Zoning Administrator shall interpret
parking space requirements for any use not specifically listed
in this chapter and shall determine the required parking from
comparable uses listed or may consult the following sources:
Institute of Traffic Engineers; Urban Land Institute;
International Conference of Shopping Centers; and the
American Planning Association.
(4) Limitations on parking facility uses. In residential districts and on
residentially used lots, accessory off-street parking facilities shall
be solely for parking of passenger vehicles, which shall be
regulated as follows:
(a) All vehicles shall be in condition for safe and legal performance
on public rights-of-way and shall be registered, displaying
current license plates.
(b) Vehicles and/or equipment not normally associated with a
residential use specifically prohibited from being parked or
stored outdoors on residential property include, but are not
limited to:

Pedestrian Access Design
[1] Number. One pedestrian access is required per street
frontage.
[2] Design requirements.
[a] Walkways shall have an acceptable dust-free surface
not less than five feet in width and shall be grade
separated from the parking lot or otherwise
delineated with pavement markers, planters, or
alternate paving materials.
[b] The entirety of the on-site pedestrian walkway system
shall be marked and defined using pavement
treatments, signs, lighting, median refuge areas, and
landscaping, as appropriate and approved by the

on pedestrian access and safety.
§ 660-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-41
1:719
[d] The material and layout shall be continuous as the
pedestrian access crosses the driveway with a break
in continuity of the driveway paving and not in the
pedestrian accessway.
(l) Parking lot lighting. See § 660-142.
(m) Shared parking. The Plan Commission may approve the use of
up to 70% of the required parking spaces to meet off-street
parking regulations for two separate lots on one lot if the
following conditions are present:
[1] Lots are adjacent or opposite (directly across the street)
from each other, fronting on the same street.
[a] One lot is an evening or Sunday use and the other lot
contains a daytime use, such as:
[i] Sunday uses. Auditoriums incidental to public or
parochial schools; churches/places of worship;
theatres; bowling alleys; bars or nightclubs; or
similar uses as determined by the Zoning
Administrator.
[ii] Daytime uses. For the purpose of this section, the
following uses are considered as primarily
daytime uses: schools, public or parochial; banks
and professional offices; personal service
establishments; service and repair shops;
manufacturing without second or third shift;
wholesale businesses; and similar uses, as

of Deeds.
(n) Phasing. Required off-street parking areas may be constructed
in phases with a phasing plan to be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
[1] Areas required for parking, but not immediately improved,
shall be reserved for future parking.
§ 660-41 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-41
1:720
[2] Undeveloped future parking areas shall be seeded with
grass mix, acceptable to the Zoning Administrator, until
said area is fully developed into a parking surface.
(o) Oversized parking lots/maximum number of spaces. Parking
lots may exceed up to 10% of the maximum allowed per the
parking requirements outlined in the off-street parking
requirements in Table 2.4 through an administrative approval,
for which review consideration shall be given to the following
factors. Parking lots in excess of 10% shall be allowed only
through conditional use permit for which review consideration
shall be given to the following factors in granting the permit:
[1] The proposed development has unique or unusual
characteristics (such as high sales volume or low parking
turnover) which creates a parking demand that exceeds
the maximum ratio and does not typically apply to
comparable uses.
[2] The lot is designed to allow for more intensive future site
development.
[3] Pedestrian connectivity through the lot.
[4] The need for additional parking cannot be reasonably met
through provision of on-street or shared parking with
adjacent or nearby uses.
[5] The proposed development demonstrates that its design
and intended use will support high levels of existing or
planned transit and pedestrian activity.
(p) Temporary use parking. As part of a temporary use permit,
temporary outdoor entertainment permit, or combination
thereof, temporary use parking shall be designated on the
temporary use/event site and may also be designated on other
properties. Temporary use parking adequacy shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator based on planned
temporary use/event capacity.
(q) Snow storage requirements for off-street parking and loading
areas.
[1] Snow storage plan required. In conjunction with the
approval of a BSO plan for off-street parking areas, a snow
storage and/or removal plan shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator for review and approval.
[2] Said snow storage plan shall adequately address, either
graphically and/or in writing, the on-site storage of snow
removed from said off-street parking or loading area or the
removal from the site of such snow.
§ 660-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-41
1:721
[3] If the snow is to be physically removed from the site, the
snow storage plan shall specify the location of the
proposed snow repository site.
[4] If the snow is proposed to be stored off site, a letter of
permission from the owner of the snow repository site
shall be furnished the Zoning Administrator with the snow
storage or removal plan.
[5] Snow storage standards for parking and loading areas.
Adequate snow storage shall be provided using the
following standards:
[a] A maximum of 10% of the total required off-street
parking spaces may be used as the snow storage area.
[b] The required snow storage area may be paved or not
paved. In either case, adequate drainage of the snow
storage area shall be provided to accommodate
snowmelt, and no snowmelt shall drain on abutting
properties.
[c] Required setbacks, yards, and buffer yards may be
used to accommodate the required snow storage area.
However, areas landscaped with shrubs and/or trees
shall not be used as snow storage areas.

§ 660-44. Zoning Maps.
§ 660-45. District boundaries.
When uncertainty exists with respect to boundaries of the various districts
shown on the Zoning Maps, the following rules shall apply:
A. Official City of Lake Mills Zoning Map. The location and boundaries of
the districts and overlay districts established by this chapter are set
forth on the Official Zoning Map, which is incorporated herein and
made a part of this chapter. The Official Zoning Map, and all
amendments thereto, shall be deemed included within this chapter as
though fully set forth and described herein. The Official Zoning Map is
sometimes referred to in this chapter as the "Zoning Map" or the
"Zoning District Map."
B. Extraterritorial Zoning Map. The Extraterritorial Zoning Map is an
integral part of this chapter. The official copy of this map, entitled "Lake
Mills Extraterritorial Zoning Map," together with a copy of this chapter,
shall be kept at the office of the City Clerk and shall be available for
public inspection during office hours. The map shall be certified by the
City Clerk. Any changes in zoning district boundaries shall be recorded
on the map. No such change shall be effective until so recorded.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. I)]
A. Zoning boundary determination. The zoning district boundaries are
corporate limits; United States Public Land Survey lines; lot or property
lines; center lines of streets, highways (not including freeways), alleys,
easements, and railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended; flood
boundaries; and wetland boundaries unless otherwise shown. Distances
not specifically shown on the Zoning Maps shall be determined by the
scale of the Zoning Maps.
B. Zoning boundary determination for approximate boundaries. Where the
designation of the Official Zoning Map shows that various zoning
§ 660-43 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-45
1:736
districts are approximately bounded by a street, alley, railroad, lot
line, flood boundary, or wetland boundary such lot line or the center
line of such street, alley, or railroad right-of-way, the flood boundaries,
or wetland boundaries as delineated on large-scale topographic maps
prepared by the City or as determined by using flood profiles and
accompanying hydrologic and hydraulic engineering data, said
approximate boundaries shall be construed to be the zoning district
boundary line.
C. Split zoning of newly created lots not allowed. The rezoning of any lot or
parcel into more than one standard zoning district shall not be allowed.
Use of overlay zoning districts and the Planned Development District
shall be excepted. Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single
ownership on the effective date of this chapter, the Zoning Board of
Appeals, after due hearing, may extend the regulations for either
portion of such lot.
D. Zoning district boundary lines on unsubdivided property. In
unsubdivided property, the location of the zoning district boundary lines
shown on the Zoning Maps shall be determined by:
(1) For unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines shown on
the maps shall be determined by use of the scale shown on such
maps;
(2) In the case of flood boundaries, shall be determined by using flood
profiles and accompanying hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
data; or
(3) Be in accordance with the dimensions shown on the map measured
at right angles from the center line of the street or highway, and the
length of frontage shall be according to dimensions shown on the
map from section, quarter-section, or division lines, or center lines
of streets, highways, or railroad rights-of-way unless otherwise
shown.
E. Locating shoreland-wetland boundaries. Where an apparent
discrepancy exists between Shoreland-Wetland Districts shown on the
official wetland maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps
were adopted, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall contact the
appropriate field office of the WDNR to determine if the Shoreland-
Wetland District as mapped is in error. If the WDNR staff concur with
the Zoning Enforcement Officer that a particular area was incorrectly
mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall have the
authority to immediately grant or deny a land use permit in accordance
with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to
correct wetland mapping errors shown on the Official Zoning Map, the
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall be responsible for initiating a map
amendment within a reasonable period of time.
§ 660-45 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-46
1:737
§ 660-46. Zoning of streets, alleys, public ways, waterways, and
railroad rights-of-way.
All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways, and railroad rights-of-way, if not
otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zoning
district as the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets,
public ways, waterways, and railroad rights-of-way. Where the center line
of a street, alley, public way, waterway, or railroad right-of-way serves as
a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically
designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property
up to such center line.
§ 660-47. Annexed land.
§ 660-48. through § 660-51. (Reserved)
§ 660-52. Purpose statements.
A. Temporary zoning. Except as provided in § 62.233, Wis. Stats., an
annexation ordinance may temporarily designate the classification of
the annexed area for zoning purposes until the zoning ordinance is
amended as prescribed in § 660-197 and § 62.23(7)(d), Wis. Stats. All
real estate that is annexed to the City shall be automatically classified
in the Rural Development (RD) District upon annexation, unless
otherwise classified by amendment.
B. Recommendation. Before introduction of an ordinance containing such
a temporary classification, the proposed classification shall be referred
to and recommended by the Plan Commission, which shall cause a Class
1 notice to be published, and which shall hold a public hearing on the
proposed interim zoning classification. The authority to make such
temporary classification shall not be effective when the county
ordinance prevails during litigation as provided in § 59.69(7), Wis.
Stats.
A. Standard zoning districts.
(1) Residential districts.
(a) Single-family districts.
[1] Rural Development (RD) District. This district is intended
to permit development which is solely of a rural
community character. The land use standards for this
district permit very low density single-family detached
residential development, as well as a variety of
agricultural and agriculture-supporting land uses. Density
and intensity standards for this district are designed to
ensure that development which requires even a minimum
of urban services does not occur until such services are
available. As such, the Rural Development District shall
§ 660-46 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-52
1:738
either serve as a designation which preserves and protects
agricultural activities, or as a "holding zone" which
provides for an interim land use (agriculture) that will
easily permit further development (with rezoning to
another district) at the appropriate time. In this manner,
even if all property were developed in a given area with
the RD District designation, the rural community
character of that area would still be maintained. This
district has a maximum density of one dwelling unit per 35
acres of land area.
[2] Single-Family Residential-4 (R1-4) District. The purpose of
the Single-Family Residential-4 District is to accommodate
lower-density single-family residential development in the
City. This district primarily consists of post-World War II
residential neighborhoods that have a suburban character,
and has a maximum density of approximately four units
per acre.
[3] Single-Family Residential-6 (R1-6) District. The purpose of
the Single-Family Residential-6 District is to accommodate
medium-density single-family residential development in
the City. This district primarily consists of post-World War
II residential neighborhoods that have a urban character,
and has a maximum density of approximately six units per
acre.
[4] Single-Family Residential-8 (R1-8) District. The purpose of
the Single-Family Residential-8 District is to accommodate
higher-density single-family residential development in the
City. This district primarily consists of older platted
residential neighborhoods that have a urban character,
and has a maximum density of approximately eight units
per acre.
(b) Two-family districts. Two-Family Residential-8 (R2-8) District.
The purpose of the Two-Family Residential-8 District is to
preserve higher-density single- and two-family residential
development in older neighborhoods of the City, and to
accommodate new residential development with a similar
character. The R2-8 District also provides for auxiliary dwelling
units compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods.
The district is intended to provide the principal location for
single-family attached dwelling types, including duplexes, twin
houses, and two-flats. This district has a maximum density of
approximately eight units per acre.
(c) Multiple-family districts. Multifamily Residential-12 (R3-12)
District. The purpose of the R3-12 Multifamily Residential
District is to accommodate a range of housing densities and a
§ 660-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-52
1:739
variety of housing types and styles, with a maximum density of
approximately 12 units per acre.
(2) Nonresidential districts.
(a) Business and office districts.
[1] Downtown Business (B1) District. The purpose of the
Downtown Business District is to provide for the
maintenance and orderly growth of a traditional,
pedestrian friendly, compact district of retail, service,
office, and higher density residential uses in the central
area of the City. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging
land uses are permitted within this district. Development
within the B1 District is intended to promote the
rehabilitation and full utilization of existing older
structures as well as appropriate redevelopment to assist
in maintaining the long-term viability of the center of the
community.
[2] Neighborhood Business (B2) District. The purpose of the
Neighborhood Business District is to provide locations for
small-scale service, retail and office uses that primarily
serve the convenience needs of neighborhoods. The B2
District permits a mix of uses, but care must be taken to
ensure that adequate access, parking and screening is
provided so as not to negatively impact adjoining
residential neighborhoods.
[3] Planned Business (PB) District. The purpose of the
Planned Business District is intended to provide for the
orderly and attractive grouping at appropriate locations of
commercial activities of a more general retail and
wholesale nature, and of the office and service facilities
serving a larger community trade area. Uses in the PB
District have the potential to generate significant
automobile traffic, and therefore care must be taken to
properly design access and parking facilities. Since this
district is located along the roads that serve as gateways,
quality building architecture, landscaping and other site
improvements are necessary to ensure this type of
development enhances Lake Mills' image. The size and
location of such districts shall be based upon relationship
of the community need and economy. Uncoordinated,
piecemeal development of small parcels that do not fit into
a larger context are discouraged in the PB District.
Compatible land uses, access, traffic circulation,
stormwater management and natural features, all should
be integrated into an overall development plan. Because
this district is primarily at high-visibility locations, quality
building architecture, landscaping and other site
§ 660-52 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-52
1:740
improvements are required to ensure superior aesthetic
and functional quality.
(b) Industrial districts.
[1] General Industrial (I1) District. This district is intended to
provide for the same type of manufacturing and industrial
development as in the PI District, but in those areas where
the relationship to surrounding land use would create
fewer problems of compatibility and would not necessitate
as stringent regulatory controls. This district should not
normally abut directly upon residential uses without the
use of increased setbacks or extensive landscape buffers.
[2] Heavy Industrial (I2) District. The purpose of the Heavy
Industrial District is to provide areas suitable for primary
and secondary processing, manufacturing and
remanufacturing or reprocessing of all types, with related
outdoor storage and incidental sales. The I2 District is
appropriate where the location has access to an arterial
street or highway, an active rail corridor, and where uses
will not create significant adverse impacts on residential,
commercial or other nonindustrial uses in the area. It must
be emphasized that this is not a district where virtually any
land use is permitted.
[3] Planned Industrial (PI) District. The Planned Industrial
District is intended to provide for the orderly and
attractive grouping in appropriately landscaped grounds
of any manufacturing or industrial operation which, on the
basis of actual physical and operational characteristics,
would not be detrimental to the surrounding area or to the
community as a whole by reason of noise, dust, smoke,
odor, traffic, physical appearance or other similar factor;
and to establish such regulatory controls as will
reasonably insure compatibility with the surrounding area.
B. Special purpose districts. Planned Development District (PDD). The
purpose of the Planned Development District is intended to provide
more incentives for redevelopment in areas of the community which are
experiencing a lack of reinvestment, or which require flexible zoning
treatment because of factors which are specific to the site. This district
is designed to forward both aesthetic and economic objectives of the
City by controlling the site design and the land use, appearance,
density, or intensity of development within the district in a manner
which is consistent with sound land use, urban design, and economic
revitalization principles. The application of these standards will ensure
long-term progress and broad participation toward these principles.
Refer to § 660-206 for the procedures applicable to proposal review in
this standard zoning district. The City intends to use the Planned
§ 660-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-52
1:741
Development District to provide a mechanism for review of planned
neighborhoods, mixed use, and traditional neighborhood developments.
C. Overlay zoning districts.
(1) Lake Residential Overlay (LRO) District. This district is intended to
apply to lake shore properties with specialized regulations
appropriate to their unique character; with particular recognition
of the disproportionately high land value of lake frontage, the
problems of over intensive exploitation of such frontage resulting
from excessive demand, the extreme vulnerability of lake shore
properties to nuisance and to adverse effect on property value, and
the problems of pollution and public safety resulting from over use.
(2) Public and Institutional Overlay (PIO) District. The purpose of the
Public and Institutional Overlay District is to regulate the
development of larger public and semipublic uses in a manner
harmonious with surrounding uses. The PI District designation is
intended to provide an area for activities relating to necessary
public services, provide for continued operation and facilitate
managed growth of existing institutions, and provide and protect
parks, open space and other natural, physical assets of the
community to improve the aesthetic and functional features of the
community.
(3) Historic Preservation Overlay (HPO) District. This district is
intended to preserve and enhance the historical quality of Lake
Mills' historic neighborhoods, places, and corridors. As emphasized
in the Comprehensive Plan, the HPO District is designed to forward
aesthetic objectives of the City by controlling the appearance of
development within the district in a manner which is consistent
with historic neighborhood design principles. The application of
these standards will ensure long-term progress and broad
participation toward these principles. Section 660-180 outlines the
procedures applicable to proposal review in this overlay district.
(4) Wellhead Protection Overlay (WPO) District. The purpose of the
WPO District is to protect the City's municipal water supply and
areas from which City wells draw water, and to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City. The
residents of the City depend exclusively on groundwater for a safe
drinking water supply and certain land use practices and activities
can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality.
(5) Shoreland-Wetland Overlay (SWO) District. The SWO District is
intended to preserve, protect, and enhance the ponds, streams, and
wetland areas of the City. The preservation, protection, and
enhancement of these areas will serve to maintain safe and
healthful conditions; maintain and improve water quality, both
ground and surface; prevent flood damage; control stormwater
runoff; protect stream banks from erosion; protect groundwater
§ 660-52 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-52
1:742
recharge and discharge areas; protect wildlife habitat; protect
native plant communities; avoid the location of structures on soils
which are generally not suitable for use; and protect the waterbased
recreational resources of the City.
(6) Floodplain Overlay (FPO) District. The purposes of the Floodplain
Overlay District are to: ensure public safety through reducing the
threats to life and personal injury; eliminate new hazards to
emergency response officials; prevent the occurrence of public
emergencies resulting from water quality contamination, and
pollution due to flooding; avoid the loss of utility services which if
damaged by flooding would disrupt or shut down the utility
network and impact regions of the community beyond the site of
flooding; eliminate costs associated with the response and cleanup
of flooding conditions; and reduce damage to public and private
property resulting from flooding waters.
(7) Conservancy Overlay (CO) District. The purpose of the
Conservancy Overlay District is to protect the public health, safety,
comfort and welfare and reducing financial burdens imposed on the
community and its individuals by restricting the use of many of
those areas within the City that are subject to periodic inundation,
high groundwater table, unstable soil conditions, presence of
primary and secondary environmental corridors, etc. It is the
intention of the City to allow the development of such areas
through the process of rezoning, provided the difficulties inherent
in soil conditions can be overcome.
D. Extraterritorial zoning districts.
(1) A1 Exclusive Agriculture District, ETZ. The long-range goal for
agricultural land use within Jefferson County is to preserve the
most valuable of resources that of fertile land for agricultural
pursuits, and to protect the land best suited for farming from
premature urbanization. The agricultural district regulations are
therefore designed to regulate the use of land and structures
within the areas of the county where soil and topographic
conditions are best adapted to agricultural pursuits. The
agricultural lands best suited for farming and for protection against
development are prime agricultural lands as defined in the
Jefferson County Zoning Ordinance. Jefferson County's A1
Exclusive Agriculture District regulations are incorporated herein
by reference and made a part of the extraterritorial zoning
regulations set forth in this chapter.
(2) R1 Single-Family Residential District, ETZ. This district is intended
to permit development which has a low-density community
character. The land use standards for this district allow primarily
single-family detached residential development and a variety of
related institutional, recreational, and social land uses. The City of
Lake Mills Single-Family Residential-4 (R1-4) District regulations
§ 660-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-52
1:743
§ 660-53. through § 660-54. (Reserved)
are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of the
extraterritorial zoning regulations set forth in this chapter.
(3) R3 Multifamily Residential District, ETZ. This district is intended to
permit development which has a higher-density community
character. The land use standards for this district primarily allow
single-family detached, twin house/duplex, two flats, townhouses,
and multifamily residential development and a variety of related
institutional, recreational, and social land uses. The City of Lake
Mills Multifamily Residential-12 (R3-12) District regulations are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part of the
extraterritorial zoning regulations set forth in this chapter. The
performance standards and design review requirements set forth in
Article V of this chapter of the City of Lake Mills Code are also
applicable and incorporated herein by reference.
(4) PB Planned Business District, ETZ. This district is intended to
permit large- and small-scale commercial development which is
compatible with the desired overall community character of the
area in general. Significant areas of landscaping are required in
this district to ensure that this effect is achieved. A wide range of
office, retail, and lodging land uses are permitted within this
district. The performance standards and design review
requirements set forth in Article V of this chapter of the City of
Lake Mills Code are also applicable and incorporated herein by
reference.
(5) PO Planned Office District, ETZ. This district is intended to permit
high-quality office and institutional land uses at an intensity
compatible with the overall character of the City. A relatively low
maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and significant areas of
landscaping are required in this district to ensure that this effect is
achieved. The performance standards and design review
requirements set forth in Article V of this chapter of the City of
Lake Mills Code are also applicable and incorporated herein by
reference.
(6) PDD, Planned Development Overlay District, ETZ. This overlay
district is intended to permit greater flexibility and, consequently,
more creative and imaginative design for the development of a site
than is possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is further
intended to promote more economical and efficient use of land
while providing a harmonious mix of land uses, a higher level of
amenities, adequate buffering between adjacent uses, and
preservation of the natural qualities of open spaces. The City of
Lake Mills Planned Development Overlay District regulations in
§§ 660-63A and 660-206 are incorporated herein by reference and
made a part of the extraterritorial zoning regulations set forth in
this chapter.

1:744
§ 660-55. Extraterritorial Zoning (ETZ).
§ 660-56. Land use regulations and Matrix of Land Uses.
A. Intent. The intent of these extraterritorial zoning (ETZ) regulations is to
promote public health, safety, and general welfare, and to provide
sound controls over land uses within the areas over which the
governing body of the City of Lake Mills has jurisdiction pursuant to
§ 62.23(7a) of the Wisconsin Statutes. These ETZ regulations and
associated map have been approved by the Joint Extraterritorial Zoning
Committee for the City of Lake Mills and Town of Lake Mills, and all
necessary public hearings have been held and all approving and
recommending actions taken by the Town and the City, as called for by
the Wisconsin Statutes.
B. Scope. The restrictions and requirements set forth in this chapter shall
be deemed the minimum necessary to conserve the value of land and
buildings and encourage the most appropriate use of land, to lessen
congestion in the streets, secure safety from fire and other dangers,
promote health and general welfare, provide adequate light and air,
prevent overcrowding of land, avoid undue concentration of population,
and facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewers,
schools, parks, and other public requirements.
C. Authority. Should the requirements of this chapter be found in conflict
with any state statute, local ordinance, or regulation, or any existing
easement, covenant or agreement, or any permits previously issued
pursuant to law applicable to the use of any land or structure in the
area specified herein as the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction limits,
the more restrictive law, ordinance, regulation, restriction, or
requirement shall govern.
D. Description of extraterritorial zoning area. The lands affected by this
chapter are those described in Resolution 02-44,24 and as referred to as
the North Growth Area in an intergovernmental agreement between
the City and the Town of Lake Mills, and as is further shown in an
exhibit to that agreement, all of which are incorporated herein by
reference. In the event of any dispute regarding the location or extent
of the ETZ area, the determination of whether an area is included
within or excluded from the extraterritorial zoning area shall refer to
§ 63.23(7a) of the Wisconsin Statutes, which requires all boundary lines
to follow government lot or survey section or fractional section lines or
public roads.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to indicate which land uses may
locate in each zoning district and under what requirements; and which
land uses may not locate therein. A further distinction is made for land
uses which may locate in a given district only upon obtaining a
24.Editor's Note: Said resolution is titled, "A Resolution Declaring Intent to Exercise
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction in the Town of Lake Mills."
§ 660-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-56
1:745
conditional or temporary use permit to do so. Finally, certain land uses
may locate in a given district as a matter of right upon compliance with
special regulations for such a land use.
B. Regulation of allowed uses. The land uses listed in Subsection C are
specifically designated and refer to the detailed listing of land uses
contained in Article IV, Standards and Regulations for Specific Land
Uses.
(1) Land uses permitted by right. Land uses listed as permitted by
right are permitted per the general land use requirement of this
chapter; per the general requirements of the specific zoning
district in which they are located; per any additional requirements
imposed by applicable overlay zoning districts as designated on the
Official Zoning Map; per the general requirements of this chapter
including § 660-197; and per any and all other applicable City,
county, state, and federal regulations.
(2) Land uses permitted as a conditional use. Land uses permitted as a
conditional use are subject to all the requirements applicable to
uses permitted by right as listed in Subsection B(1) above, plus any
additional requirements applicable to that particular land use as
contained in Article IV, Standards and Regulations for Specific
Land Uses, including any additional requirements imposed as part
of the conditional use process. Each application for, and instance
of, a conditional use shall be considered a unique situation and
shall not be construed as precedence for similar requests. Also
reference § 660-195, Conditional uses.
(3) Land uses permitted as an accessory use. Land uses permitted as
an accessory use are permitted subject to all the requirements
applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in Subsection B(1)
above, plus any additional requirements applicable to that
particular land use as contained in Article IV, Standards and
Regulations for Specific Land Uses.
(4) Land uses permitted as a temporary use. Land uses listed as

(A). Blank spaces in the matrix specify that a listed activity or use is
prohibited.25
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to indicate the requirements for
building location and bulk in both residential and nonresidential
developments.
B. Lot requirements.
(1) Minimum lot size. In any residence district, on a lot of record on the
effective date of this chapter, a single-family dwelling may be
established regardless of the size of the lot, provided all other
requirements of this chapter are complied with. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the shape and dimension
of any nonconforming lot of record as of the effective date of this
chapter may be modified by altering the lot lines; provided,
however, that the alteration for modification of the lot line does not
result in any greater nonconformity than that which existed as of
the effective date of this chapter.
(2) Through lots.
(a) In any residence district where a lot runs through a block from
street to street, a front yard as hereinafter provided shall be
required along each street lot line not a side street lot line.
(b) In any commercial or industrial district where a lot runs
through a block from street to street, the requirements for a
rear yard may be waived by furnishing an equivalent open
space on the same lot in lieu of the required rear yard.
(c) Lots on district boundaries. Any side yard, rear yard or court
abutting a district boundary line shall have a minimum width
and depth in the less restricted district equal to the average of
the required minimum widths and depths for such yards and
courts in the two districts which abut the district.
(d) Lot grades on through or corner lots. Where a lot abuts on two
or more streets or alleys having different average established
grades, the higher of such grades shall control only for a depth
of 120 feet from the line of the higher average established
grade.
(e) Lot area not to be reduced below requirements. No lot area
shall be so reduced that the dimensions and yard requirements
imposed by this chapter cannot be met.
25.Editor's Note: The Matrix of Land Uses is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 660-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-57
1:747
C. Bulk standards. All lots shall comply with the standards prescribed by
this section. These standards are related to the specific zoning district
used. Bulk Regulations are listing in the Table found in Subsection I
below.
D. Number of buildings on a zoning lot. All principal buildings shall be
located on a zoning lot. Only one principal building shall be located,
erected, or moved onto a lot in all districts by right. The Plan
Commission may permit more than one principal building per lot by
conditional use as outlined in § 660-195 for the orderly development of
the parcel. When additional structures are permitted, the Plan
Commission may impose additional yard requirements, floor area ratio
limitations, residential density requirements, land use intensity
requirements, landscaping requirements, or parking requirements, or
may require a minimum separation distance between principal
buildings.
E. Yard requirements where different districts abut. Any side yard, rear
yard or court abutting a district boundary line shall have a minimum
width and depth in the less restricted district equal to the average of
the required minimum widths and depths for such yards and courts in
the two districts which abut the district boundary line.
F. Front yard setback adjustment. Front yard setbacks should be adjusted
as follows when the described conditions or circumstances exist:
(1) Setbacks from ultimate street right-of-way line. On all streets or
highways for which the ultimate width has been established by the
City of Lake Mills Official Map, and/or subsequent amendments
thereto to those documents, the base setback line shall be located
at the established ultimate street and/or highway right-of-way line
as prescribed by this chapter. Required setbacks shall be measured
from the base setback line.
(2) Average front yard setback. Reduced building setbacks: A setback
of less than that required by Table 3.2, where there is at least one
main building on either side of the applicant's lot within 200 feet of
the proposed site that is built to less than the required setback. In
such case, the setback shall be the average of the setbacks of the
nearest main building on each side of the proposed site or, if there
is an existing main building on only one side, the setback shall be
the average of the existing building and the required setback. Any
other setback may be permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals,
according to § 660-176 of this chapter, upon a written finding of
unnecessary hardship.
(3) Corner lot setbacks. Corner lots shall be determined to have two
front yards and two side yards. Corner lot setback requirements on
a side street shall meet the requirements set forth in this chapter.
G. Intrusions into required yards. The minimum setback requirements of
each zoning district establish the minimum required yards for all uses,

each zoning district or the minimum lot area requirements of each
§ 660-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-58
1:751
§ 660-59. Nonconforming structures.
zoning district or which does not meet the lot dimension requirements
of each zoning district.
B. A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this chapter in a
residential district, which does not meet the applicable minimum
zoning district area, lot area, or dimensions, may be used for a detached
single-family dwelling if said lot area and each lot dimension are equal
to or greater than 70% of the requirements of this chapter, and if all
other applicable zoning district standards are met. Said lot shall not be
more intensively developed (with multifamily or nonresidential uses)
unless combined with one or more abutting lots (or portions thereof) so
as to create a lot which meets the requirements of this chapter.
A. Continuation. Any structure lawfully existing upon the effective date of
this chapter may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation
existing upon such date, except as provided in this section.
B. Damaged or destroyed. A nonconforming structure damaged or
destroyed on or after the effective date of this chapter by violent wind,
vandalism, fire, flood, ice, snow, mold, or infestation may be restored to
the size and/or location without any limits on the costs of the repair,
reconstruction, or improvement in accordance with Wis. Stats.
§ 62.23(7)(hc).
C. Expansion or improvement. Any lawful nonconforming structures
existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the chapter may
be continued, although its size or location does not conform with the lot
width, lot area, yard, height, parking and loading, and access provisions
of this chapter. Any lawful nonconforming structures may be allowed to
be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered,
provided that said extension, enlargement, reconstruction, movement
or alteration complies with the bulk requirements of the specific zoning
district, except for the existing nonconformance. However, the
nonconforming feature of a lawful nonconforming structure shall not be
allowed to become more nonconforming by being extended, enlarged,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except as permitted under
Subsection D below or when required to do so by law, or order, or to
comply with the provisions of this chapter, or with the approval of the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
D. Unsafe structures. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the Zoning
Enforcement Officer or any other City official from initiating remedial
or enforcement actions when a lawful nonconforming structure is
declared unsafe or presents a danger to the public health, safety, or
welfare.
E. Ordinary maintenance. Ordinary maintenance repairs, including
repairs reasonably necessary to prevent the deterioration of a
structure, and remodeling of a nonconforming structure are permitted,

1:752
§ 660-60. Nonconforming uses.
as well as necessary nonstructural repairs and alterations which do
not extend, enlarge, or intensify the nonconforming structure. Ordinary
maintenance repairs and remodeling include internal and external
painting, decorating, paneling, the addition of acoustical ceilings, the
installation of heating, electricity, plumbing (including fixtures) or
insulation, and the replacement of doors, windows, and other
nonstructural components.
F. Timing of building permit. Any structure for which a building permit
has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this chapter or
an amendment, which will become nonconforming under the provisions
of this chapter or that amendment thereto, may be completed in
accordance with the approved plans. If all such conditions are met, the
structure shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming structure.
A. Continuance of a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use lawfully
existing upon the effective date of this chapter or any amendment to it
may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon
such date, except as specified in this section. Any prior legal use made
nonconforming by this chapter or by an amendment to it may be
granted legal conforming status by the issuance of a conditional use,
subject to the standards and procedures prescribed by § 660-195. Any
prior legal use made nonconforming by a modification to the Official
Zoning Map after the effective date of this chapter may be granted legal
conforming use status, subject to the standards and procedures
prescribed by § 660-197.
B. Modification of a nonconforming use.
(1) Except as permitted in this section, a nonconforming use shall not
be expanded, enlarged, extended or reconstructed, unless the use
is changed to a use permitted in the district in which the use is
located, or shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
(2) A nonconforming nonresidential use not served by public sanitary
sewer and/or public water may be permitted to expand without
being served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water if either
or both facilities are not available within 1,000 feet of the subject
property, and a conditional use permit is granted for such
expansion.
C. Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. When any nonconforming use
of any structure or land is discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive
months, or is changed into a conforming use, any future use of said
structure or land shall be in complete conformity with the provisions of
this chapter.
D. Maintenance and repair of a nonconforming use. The ordinary
maintenance and repair of a nonconforming use (structure or land) is
§ 660-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-60
1:753
§ 660-61. through § 660-62. (Reserved)
§ 660-63. Special purpose and overlay zoning districts.
permitted, including necessary repairs and incidental alterations which
do not exacerbate the adverse impacts of the nonconforming use in
relation to the purpose of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided
in this section, whenever a nonconforming use is damaged to the
extent of more than 50% of its current equalized assessed value, it
shall not be restored except in conformity with the regulations of the

recommendations by the Plan Commission and the Public
Works Board, and approval by the City Council, where strict
compliance would result in not achieving the design flexibility
necessary to achieve the objectives of the planned

development which is explicitly depicted on the required general
development plan (discussed in greater detail later in this section)
approved by the City Council as part of the approved planned

(b) Upon the filing of any application for a certificate of approval
with the Commission, the Commission shall review the
§ 660-63 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-63
1:757
application using the following guidelines, and shall not
unreasonably deny issuance of the certificate of approval,
provided:
[1] In the case of a designated historic structure or historic
site, the proposed work would not detrimentally change,
destroy, or adversely affect any exterior feature of the
improvement or site upon which said work is to be done in
accordance with the guidelines for alterations as follows:
[a] Height. All additions shall be no higher than the
existing building.
[b] Second exit platforms. Second exit platforms shall not
be applied to the front or sides of a building, unless
they are not visible from the street.
[c] Solar apparatus. Passive and active solar apparatus
shall be allowed only if such devices do not detract
from the architectural integrity of the building and are
as unobtrusive as possible.
[d] Repairs. Repairs in materials that exactly duplicate
the original in composition, texture, and appearance
are encouraged. Repairs in new materials that
duplicate the original in texture and appearance are
also permitted. Repairs in materials that do not
duplicate the original in appearance may be permitted
on an individual basis, providing the repairs are
compatible with the character and materials of the
existing building and repairs that duplicate the
original in appearance are prohibitively expensive.
[e] Restoration. Projects that will return the appearance
of the building to an earlier appearance are
encouraged and shall be permitted if such projects are
documented by photographs, architectural or
archaeological research, or other suitable evidence.
[f] Re-siding with aluminum or vinyl. Re-siding with
aluminum or vinyl which replaces clapboards or
nonoriginal siding on buildings originally sided with
clapboards may be permitted, providing the new
siding imitates the width of the original siding within
one inches, the wood graining, and providing
architectural details (such as window trim, wood
cornices, and ornament) either remain uncovered or
are generally duplicated in appearance.
[g] Storms, screens, and storm doors. The repair and
retention of original storms, screens and storm doors,
or the replacement of same with new units that
§ 660-63 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-63
1:758
duplicate the original in materials and appearance
is encouraged. Replacements with nonoriginal
materials, such as combination metal components,
may also be permitted. If metal components are used,
owners are encouraged to use metal components
which have been factory painted.
[h] Additions and alterations to street facades. The
appearance of all street facades of a building shall not
be altered unless the design is sensitive to the historic
character of the building. Specifically, the design or
alteration shall be compatible with the existing
building in scale, color, texture, and the proportion of
solids to voids.
[i] Alterations to the roof. Roof alterations, resulting in
increased building volume, to provide additional
windows or skylights, headroom, or area are
prohibited. The roof shape of the front of the building
shall remain the same unless the owner wishes to
restore an earlier, documentable appearance.
Changes in roofing materials (excluding color
changes) are prohibited unless the existing materials
are no longer produced or the cost of production and
installation exceeds 10% of the assessed value of the
structure, in which case the new roof materials shall
resemble existing materials as closely as economically
possible or the materials shall closely resemble an
earlier documentable material.
[2] In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon
a historic site, or within a historic district, the exterior of
such improvement would not adversely affect nor
disharmonize with the external appearance of other
improvements on such site or within the district, and the
Historic District Guidelines for New Construction,
incorporated herein by reference, shall be applicable to all
new construction proposals within a historic district.
[3] In the case of any property located in a historic district,
the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior
alteration or demolition conforms to the purpose and
intent of this section and to the objectives and design
criteria of the historic preservation plan for said district;
[4] The building or structure is of such architectural or
historical significance that its demolition would not be
detrimental to the public interest nor contrary to the
general welfare of the people of the City and state;
§ 660-63 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-63
1:759
[5] In the case of a request for the demolition of a deteriorated
building or structure, the economic hardship or difficulty
claimed by the owner is not self-created nor is it the result
of failure by the owner to maintain the property in good
repair.
(c) If the Commission determines the application for a certificate
of approval and the proposed changes are consistent with the
guidelines of § 660-63D(4)(b), it shall issue the certificate of
approval. The Commission shall make this decision within 60
days of the filing of the application.
(d) The issuance of a certificate of approval shall not relieve the
applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required
by the City. A building permit or other municipal permit shall
be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the
certificate of approval required for the proposed work.
(e) Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without
a certificate of approval, provided the work involves repairs to
existing features of a historic structure or site or the
replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in
appearance and provided the work does not change the
exterior appearance of the structure or site and does not
require the issuance of a building permit.
(5) Recognition of historic structures, sites and districts. At such time
as a historic structure, site or district has been properly
designated, the Commission, in cooperation with the property
owner, may cause to be prepared and erected on such property, at
City expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property is a
historic structure, site or district. The City's share of the plaque
shall not exceed $100.

§ 660-91. (Reserved)
§ 660-92. Convenient cash businesses and similar establishments.
A. Purpose; title; intent.
(1) The purpose of this section is to provide for the regulation of
convenient cash and other similar establishments. It is recognized
that convenient cash businesses have the potential to be harmful to
the public welfare, both in regards to the community harmony and
with respect to potential effects on the quality, aesthetics and
functional aspects of the community. The purpose of regulating
convenient cash services is to ensure compatibility with
surrounding uses and properties and to avoid an unchecked
proliferation of convenient cash services that may result in the
displacement of other necessary commercial and financial services.
(2) Such businesses tailor their services to make them attractive to
persons experiencing unfavorable economic circumstances, often
aggravating those circumstances. Additionally, it has been found
that through their business practices, convenient cash businesses
are susceptible to attracting criminals seeking to commit
robberies. Finally, when clustered in an area or strung out along an
arterial street, such concentration creates an unwarranted
negative impression regarding the economic vitality of a
commercial district and the community at large. Based on their
proliferation, their susceptibility to crime, and the negative effects
of their proliferation, the common council finds that the health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Lake Mills should
be protected by legislation limiting the geographic proliferation of
convenient cash businesses.
(3) It is therefore the intent of this chapter to regulate the locations
and hours of operation of convenient cash businesses in the City of
Lake Mills.
B. Location and operation of convenient cash businesses.
(1) Convenient cash businesses shall not be located within 2,500 feet
of any other convenient cash business.
(2) Convenient cash businesses shall not be located within 250 feet
from a residential district as measured by the shortest line between
§ 660-90 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-92
1:779
§ 660-93. First Amendment-protected adult-oriented
establishments.
the parcel to be occupied by the proposed convenient cash facility
and the property line of the nearest residential property.
(3) Hours of operation. Convenient cash businesses shall not operate
between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m.
(4) Business shall keep a glass entrance and exit doors with all
windows clear of any signs or advertisements.
(5) The building or portion thereof that is dedicated to the checkcashing
use shall have a minimum size of 1,500 square feet of
building floor area.
(6) All convenient cash businesses shall operate one outdoor
surveillance camera and wireless subscription module.
C. Security plan. Applicant must provide a security plan to the City of Lake
Mills Police Department that addresses the following:
(1) Limits on amount of cash immediately available for withdrawal;
(2) Lighting plan for the business showing both exterior and interior
lighting;
(3) Plans for maintaining visibility into the interior of the checkcashing
facility;
(4) Plans for security of the check-cashing area of the facility;
(5) A program for graffiti and litter abatement;
(6) Hours of operation; and
(7) Use of security guards and cameras plan.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of the residents of the City of Lake Mills, and to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and
concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City of Lake
Mills. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor the
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the
First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it
the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
B. Findings of fact.
§ 660-92 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-93
1:780
(1) The City Council finds that adult-oriented establishments, as
defined and otherwise regulated by the City in Chapter 240, Adult-
Oriented Establishments, of the Code of the City of Lake Mills,
require special zoning in order to protect and preserve the health,
safety, and general welfare of the City.
(2) Based its review of studies conducted in Phoenix, AZ, Garden
Grove, CA, Los Angeles, CA, Whittier, CA, Indianapolis, IN,
Minneapolis, MN, St. Paul, MN, Cleveland, OH, Oklahoma City, OK,
Amarillo, TX, Austin, TX, Beaumont, TX, Dallas, TX, Houston, TX,
Newport News, VA, Bellevue, WA, Seattle, WA, New York, NY, St.
Croix County, WI, and the Report of the Attorney General's Working
Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June
6,1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the
United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, and the findings incorporated
in City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986);
Coleman A. Young v. American Mini-Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S.
50(1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215(1990);
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560(1991); City of Erie v.
Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); East of the River Enterprises II
v. City of Hudson; 2000 Wisc. App. Lexis 734 (Ct. App. Aug. 1,
2000); Ben's Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316 F.3d 702, 2003 WL
132541 (7th Cir. 2003), the City Council finds that there is
convincing evidence that the secondary effects of adult-oriented
establishments include an increased risk of prostitution, high-risk
sexual behavior, crime, and other deleterious effects upon existing
businesses and surrounding residential areas, and decreased
property values.
(3) The City Council intends to control the impact of these secondary
effects in order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of
the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve
the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of
surrounding neighborhoods and areas.
(4) It is not the intent of the City Council to suppress any speech
activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a
content-neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of
adult-oriented establishments while providing an outlet for First
Amendment-protected activities.
(5) In order to minimize and control the secondary effects of adultoriented
establishments upon the City, it is the intent of the City
Council to prevent the location of adult-oriented establishments
within a certain distance of other specified locations which are
incompatible with and would suffer from the secondary effects of
adult-oriented establishments.
(6) Based upon its review of materials linking alcohol consumption and
high-risk sexual behavior and materials linking alcohol
§ 660-93 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-93
1:781
consumption and crimes such as sexual assault, the City Council
finds that a geographic separation of adult-oriented establishments
from alcohol beverage licensed premises is warranted.
C. Location of First Amendment-protected adult-oriented establishments.
(1) The First Amendment and other provisions of the United States
Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court
and other courts, require that adult-oriented establishments, as
defined and otherwise regulated by the City in Chapter 240, are
entitled to certain protections, including the opportunity to locate
in the City. Therefore, if an adult-oriented establishment license
has been granted by the City, and if all the requirements of this
section have been met, an adult-oriented establishment shall be a
permitted use as a conditional use in the I-2 Zoning District and
shall be a prohibited use in any other zoning district.
(2) Distance requirements.
(a) Adult-oriented establishments shall be located at least 1,000
feet from:
[1] Any playground lot line, or public park lot line;
[2] Any place of religious worship, public or private school, or
youth facility as defined in Chapter 240, Adult-Oriented
Establishments, of the Code of the City of Lake Mills.
[3] Any structure housing an establishment which holds an
alcohol beverage license.
(b) Adult-oriented establishments shall be located at least 500 feet
from:
[1] Any structure used as a residence; or
[2] Any residential zoning district boundary.
(3) Distance measurements:
(a) Distance requirements are to be measured in a straight line in
any direction, regardless of intervening structures, from the
structure housing the adult-oriented establishment to the
residential district boundary lines, to the lot line of any lot used
for a park, playground, or the lot line of any structure listed
under Subsection C(2)above.
(b) The measurements from a structure shall be taken from the
farthest point a structure extends in the direction of the
measurement, including overhanging roofs or similar
projections.
(c) For adult-oriented establishments located in conjunction with
other buildings such as in a shopping center, and clearly
§ 660-93 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-93
1:782
separate from other establishments, measurements shall be
taken from the boundaries of the space occupied by the adultoriented
establishment.
(d) For any adult-oriented establishment located above ground
level in a multistory structure and clearly separate from other
establishments within the structure, the distance
measurements shall be taken from the ground floor public
entrance/exit nearest the adult-oriented establishment
(excluding emergency exits).
(4) A licensed adult-oriented establishment is not disqualified from
holding an adult-oriented establishment license by the location
subsequent to the grant or renewal of its license of any of the
establishments described in Subsection C(2) above, within 1,000
feet of the licensed premises.

ARTICLE V
Design Guidelines and Regulations
§ 660-94. Nonresidential design.
A. General provisions.
(1) Purpose. Improve the overall quality of nonresidential development
in Lake Mills, ensure compatibility of nonresidential development
with surrounding land uses, enhance site design of nonresidential
development in the City, enhance pedestrian safety and walkability,
and improve user-friendliness of the document and review process.
(2) Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to the
following types of developments:
(a) Development of all projects in which the principal use is
commercial, industrial or institutional.
(b) Any accessory use to one of the principal uses listed in
Subsection A(2)(a), including but not limited to lighting,
accessory buildings over 300 square feet in floor area,
telecommunications facilities, and exterior building
alterations.
(c) Any addition to an existing use listed in Subsection A(2)(a)
which existed as of November 4, 2014 that results in a total
cumulative square foot expansion of 25% or more over the life
of the development for any of the following:
[1] Building floor area;
[2] Outdoor storage area; or
[3] Parking lot area.
(d) Where developments under Subsection A(2)(c) are proposed,
the project, building, and site shall comply with the provisions
of this section to the extent practical, given existing site and
building conditions.
(3) Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from the provisions of
this section:
(a) All single-family detached and two-family residences on
individual lots or zero lot line.
(b) All multiple-family residences shall comply with the provisions
of § 660-103.
(c) All development in the B1 Downtown Business District shall
comply with the provisions of § 660-98.
§ 660-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-94
1:785
(4) Process. All projects shall be reviewed and approved as a part of
the site plan review and approval procedures contained in
§ 660-205.
B. Site planning.
(1) Purpose. These guidelines and standards are intended to
encourage an orderly and logical pattern of commercial
development that is easily recognized by local residents, and that
enhances the convenience and livability of Lake Mills. It is also the
intent that these guidelines and standards encourage forethought
and consideration of both a development's external relationships as
well as its internal organization.
(2) Preservation of natural features.
(a) Purpose. Enhance local character; protect natural features'
important functions, such as stormwater management, air
purification, and provision of shade; preserve and integrate
natural features, including mature trees into new
development.
(b) Tree and vegetation preservation.
[1] Tree survey/plan requirement. Developers shall submit an
existing tree survey and preservation plan to show
compliance with these guidelines and standards.
[2] General guideline. Existing quality/specimen trees and
vegetation should be preserved whenever possible to act
as buffers between adjoining developments and as site
amenities within the development.
[3] Significant trees. For purposes of this section, "significant"
trees include the following:
[a] Deciduous trees with twelve-inch minimum caliper.
[b] Evergreen trees 12 feet or more in height.
[c] Groups or stands of 10 or more trees with a minimum
caliper of six inches.
[4] Significant tree preservation and replacement standards.
[a] At least 50% of significant trees shall be preserved or
transplanted on site, to the maximum extent
practicable.
[b] Significant trees in appropriate locations, such as
along drainages and along the perimeter of the site,
should be used to fulfill landscaping or buffering
requirements outlined in § 660-113.
§ 660-94 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-94
1:786
[c] Tree replacement. If a significant tree designated to
be preserved is removed or substantially damaged
during clearing, grading, or construction, the
developer shall replace the removed or damaged tree
with new trees. Replacement trees shall be the same
or similar species to the trees removed or damaged, or
alternately a species native to Jefferson County (as
listed in § 660-113) and a minimum planting size of 2.5
inches DBH. Trees removed or damaged shall be
replaced by the developer on a diameter inches for
diameter inches basis.
[d] Barrier fencing shall be installed during construction
to protect significant trees.
[e] Grading shall be avoided within the root area or drip
line of any existing preserved trees.
(3) Land disturbance.
(a) Intent. The natural rolling and vegetated topography is a key
element in distinguishing Lake Mills and defining its character.
Development should maintain natural site topography and
minimize land disturbance. Extensive grading or unusual site
improvements (e.g., large retaining walls) to force a design
onto a property is strongly discouraged. Modifying the design
of a commercial development to fit the site generally results in
a reduced potential for environmental problems and an
improved level of visual interest and variety.
(b) Design guidelines and standards.
[1] Prior approval of land disturbance. Where significant
topographical issues are identified at a preapplication
conference (for example, substantial differences in grade
on site), the City may require the applicant to submit a
preliminary grading plan. As applicable, no grading,
excavation, or tree/vegetation removal shall occur on a
site, whether to provide for a building site, for on-site
utilities or services, or for any roads or driveways, before
the City's approval of such preliminary grading plan.
[2] Natural topography. To the maximum extent feasible, the
layout of commercial developments shall maintain natural
site topography. Berms, channels, swales, and similar manmade
changes to the landscape shall be designed and
graded to be an integral part of the natural landscape and
to provide a smooth transition in changes of slope.
[3] Maximum slope on graded or filled man-made slopes. The
maximum slope shall be 3:1.
§ 660-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-94
1:787
[4] Site drainage patterns. Site drainage patterns shall be
designed to prevent concentrated surface drainage from
collecting on and flowing across pedestrian paths, walks,
and sidewalks. All site drainage shall comply with Chapter
565, Stormwater Management, of the Code of the City of
Lake Mills.
C. Site layout/development pattern.
(1) Intent. Site layout and building orientation often define the focus of
activity that occurs at the front door or along the street. These
standards are intended to use site planning and building
orientation in order to:
(a) Create a sense of place for users and passersby.
(b) Ensure that buildings relate appropriately to surrounding
developments and streets and create a cohesive visual identity
and attractive street scene.
(c) Ensure that site circulation promotes contiguous pedestrian
and vehicle circulation patterns.
(d) Ensure that parking areas provide safe and efficient access to
buildings.
(e) Create a unique and identifiable image for development in
Lake Mills.
(2) Location of parking. In order to reduce the scale of the paved
surfaces and to shorten the walking distance between the parked
car and the building, off-street parking for all commercial
developments shall be located according to one of the following
options:
(a) A minimum of 30% of the off-street surface parking spaces
provided for all uses contained in the development's primary
building shall be located other than between the front facade
of the primary building and the primary abutting street; e.g., to
the rear or side of the primary building(s); or
(b) More than 70% of the off-street surface parking spaces
provided for all uses contained in the development's primary
building may be located between the front facade of the
primary building(s) and the primary abutting street, provided
the amount of interior and perimeter parking lot landscaping
required by § 660-113B is increased by 50%.
(3) Multiple-building developments.
(a) Applicability. When there is more than one building in a
commercial development, the development shall comply with
the following standards, except that multiple-building
§ 660-94 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-94
1:788
developments located at the intersection of two thoroughfare
streets shall comply instead with the standards stated in
Subsection C(5), Site layout and building orientation at two
intersecting thoroughfare streets.
(b) Site layout and building orientation. All primary and pad site
buildings shall be arranged and grouped so that their primary
orientation complements adjacent, existing development and
either:
[1] Frames the corner of an adjacent street intersection;
[2] Frames and encloses a "main street" pedestrian and/or
vehicle access corridor within the development site;
[3] Frames and encloses parking areas, public spaces, or
other site amenities.
[4] Alternatives. An applicant may submit an alternative
development pattern, provided such pattern achieves the
intent of the above standards and this section. Strictly
linear or "strip commercial" development patterns shall be
avoided.
(4) Single-building developments.
(a) Applicability. Unless part of a larger planned development or
commercial center, when there is only one building in a
proposed commercial development, the development shall
comply with the following standards, except that singlebuilding
developments located at the intersection of two
thoroughfare streets shall comply instead with the standards
stated in § 660-94C(5), Site layout and building orientation at
two intersecting thoroughfare streets.
(b) Single-tenant building. Unless part of a larger planned
development or commercial center, when there is only one
building in a proposed commercial development that will be
occupied by a single tenant, such building shall be oriented
toward the primary abutting street and shall otherwise comply
with § 660-94C(2), Location of parking. Deep setbacks behind
large expanses of parking areas or vacant land shall be
avoided.
(c) Multi-tenant building. Unless part of a larger planned
development or commercial center, when there is only one
building in a proposed commercial development that will be
occupied by multiple tenants, at least 50% of the building's
"active" wall shall be oriented toward the primary abutting
street and shall otherwise comply with § 660-94C(2), Location
of parking. Deep setbacks behind large expanses of parking
areas or vacant land should be avoided. For purposes of this
§ 660-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-94
1:789
standard, the "active" wall shall be the side of the building
containing the majority of storefronts, customer entrances,
and windows.
(5) Site layout and building orientation at two intersecting
thoroughfare streets.
(a) Intent. Major intersections of commercial activity in Lake Mills
need special attention so that all four corners are linked and
function as a whole, and so that a sense of place and "arrival"
unique to Lake Mills is created. Development at key
intersections shall comply with the recommendations outlined
in the Comprehensive Plan.
(b) Applicability. All new office, and commercial developments
located at the intersection of two thoroughfare (arterial)
streets shall comply with this subsection's site layout and
building orientation standards.
(c) Site layout and building orientation. To the maximum extent
practicable, within each intersection quadrant, primary
buildings and/or pad site buildings shall be arranged to orient
to the thoroughfare streets and to frame the corner at the
intersection of the two thoroughfares. Deep building setbacks
behind large expanses of parking areas or vacant land shall be
avoided.
(d) Focal point required. On each of the four corners of a
thoroughfare/thoroughfare street intersection, developments
shall provide a "focal point" within a two-hundred-foot radius
from the intersection of the center lines of the two
thoroughfare streets. A "focal point" shall be visible from the
intersecting thoroughfare streets and may be either:
[1] A distinctively designed building, which may include a pad
site building, preferably with a vertical element; but shall
not include drive-through facilities and automobile service
stations;
[2] An architectural feature that is a minimum of 15 feet tall
and a maximum 25 five feet tall (e.g., a clock tower, spire,
or interesting roof form);
[3] Public art or sculpture;
[4] Fountains or other water feature;
[5] Public plazas or other open space; or
[6] Landscape feature.
(6) Pad/outlot sites.
§ 660-94 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-94
1:790
(a) Intent. The siting and design of smaller retail stores, commonly
referred to as "pads" or "outlots," can create a more inviting
appearance in a larger development by visibly reducing the
project's scale and by expanding the range of activities and
businesses found within a single development. The location,
orientation of the entry, and architecture of pad site buildings
also provide opportunities to frame entries into larger
developments and contribute to the development's visual
interest by placing storefront spaces closer to the street and
creating a street scene. Accordingly, pad site structures shall
be compatible with the main buildings on a commercial site.
The layout of pad site buildings shall relate coherently to the
public street and surroundings (outward) as well as to the main
center (inward), and specific siting decisions shall further the
general intent of creating a "sense of place," focal points, site
amenities, and arrival into the commercial center.
(b) Design guidelines and standards.
[1] General guideline. The number, location, and design of
independent pad sites shall reinforce, rather than obscure,
the identity and function of a commercial development.
[2] Clustering of pad sites. To the maximum extent
practicable, pad sites shall be clustered together to define
street edges and entry points or to enclose and create
interesting places between buildings. Even dispersal of
pad sites in a widely spaced pattern within the
development, even if along the street edge(s), is
discouraged. Placement of pad sites shall be consistent
with the requirements for overall development pattern and
site layout set forth in § 660-94C, Site layout/development
pattern.
[3] Spaces between adjacent pad sites. Wherever practicable,
spaces between adjacent pad site buildings should be
improved to provide small pockets (preferably heavily
landscaped) of customer parking, pedestrian connections,
small-scale project amenities, or focal points. Examples
include, without limitation:
[a] A landscaped pedestrian walkway linking customer
entrances between two or more pad site buildings;
[b] A public seating or outdoor eating area;
[c] An area landscaped with a variety of living materials
emphasizing four-season colors, textures, and
varieties; or
[d] Sculptures or fountains.
§ 660-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-94
1:791
[4] Building orientation on pad sites. The primary facade of a
building located on a pad site, typically the facade
containing the primary customer entrance, may be
oriented in a variety of ways, including, without limitation,
toward the primary access street, toward an internal
"main street," framing a primary entrance to the
development or center, toward the side (especially when
that side faces another pad site building), or toward the
interior of the center.
[5] Pedestrian connections. See § 660-94F, Pedestrian access
and circulation.
[6] Pad site building design.
[a] Pad site buildings shall incorporate the same
materials and colors as those on the primary
commercial building(s) in the development or center.
[b] Pad site entrances are appropriate locations to
express individual building character or identity.
Customer entrances shall be emphasized through
incorporation of a building recess, projection, canopy,
or similar design element.
[c] The design of any pad site shall comply with
§ 660-94G, Building design.
(7) Freestanding kiosks/ATM structures/vending machines/outdoor
sales appurtenances.
(a) Intent. Ensure that freestanding kiosk structures, ATM
structures, vending machines, and other outdoor sales
appurtenances are compatible with the appearance and
function of the overall commercial development.
(b) Classification. All freestanding kiosk structures, ATM
structures, vending machines, and other outdoor sales
appurtenances shall be considered uses accessory to the
principal uses on the property.
(c) Design guidelines and standards.
[1] General guideline. All kiosk-type buildings and structures
shall be integrated with the overall commercial or center
development and shall be subject to the same guidelines as
all other buildings with the development.
[2] Location. Freestanding kiosks and drive-up ATM
structures shall not be located along the primary access
street frontage.
§ 660-94 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-94
1:792
[3] Access. Access to a freestanding kiosk or drive-up ATM
structure shall not be from the adjacent public streets.
Access shall be from drives and streets internal to the
development.
[4] Structure design. Freestanding kiosks and drive-up ATM
structures shall comply with the building design standards
applicable to pad sites set forth in Subsection C(6) above.
(8) Site amenities.
(a) Intent. Site amenities and pedestrian-scale features (e.g.,
outdoor plazas, street furniture, playgrounds, statuary,
sidewalk cafes) in commercial developments offer attractive
spaces for customer and visitor interaction and create an
inviting image for both customers and employees. The use of
site amenities can also provide pedestrian spaces at the entry
to buildings, can break up expanses of parking, enhance the
overall development quality, and contribute to the character of
an area.
(b) Design guidelines and standards.
[1] General guideline. Site amenities and gathering places can
vary widely in size, in type, and in degree of amenity.
Buildings, trees, walls, topography, and other site features
within a commercial development should be oriented and
arranged to enclose such gathering places and lend a
human scale.
[2] Permitted site amenities.
[a] Patio or plaza with seating area;
[b] Mini-parks, squares, or greens;
[c] Customer walkways or pass-throughs containing
window displays;
[d] Water feature;
[e] Clock tower; and/or
[f] Public art;
[g] Any other similar, deliberately shaped area and/or
focal feature that, in the City's judgment, adequately
enhances such development and serves as a gathering
place.
[3] Site amenities as focal points. A site amenity may qualify
as a focal point required under Subsection C(5), Site
layout and building orientation at two intersecting
thoroughfare streets, provided the site amenity meets all
§ 660-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-94
1:793
applicable requirements for focal points stated in
Subsection C(5)(d).
(9) Lighting. All lighting shall comply with the regulations outlined in
§ 660-142.
(10) Signage. All signage shall comply with the regulations outlined in
Article VI.
D. Relationship to surrounding development.
(1) Intent. Ensure convenient pedestrian and vehicle access and
connections to adjacent uses whenever practicable; encourage
architectural, land use, and open space transitions, such as
reduced building mass next to residential uses, reduced intensity
between commercial and residential uses, front-to-front building
orientations, green spaces, and preserved natural features.
(2) Connectivity between land uses. See § 660-94E and F for applicable
guidelines and standards.
(3) Transitions between land uses.
(a) Transitions shall be required in the following situations:
[1] Changes in use between adjoining properties, especially
from commercial to residential.
[2] Changes in intensity of use between adjoining properties,
such as from commercial centers to multifamily
residential.
[3] Views, uses, or activities on the commercial development
site that could be a nuisance for neighbors, such as
commercial loading and service areas.
(b) Preferred techniques. When a transition is required, an
applicant shall incorporate, to the maximum extent
practicable, the architectural and green/open space transition
techniques tools outlined below:
[1] Architectural transitions. To the maximum extent
practicable, commercial development incorporates the
following techniques to ensure compatibility with
surrounding development, including adjacent residential
development:
[a] Use similar building setback.
[b] Use similar building height.
[c] Use similar roof form.
§ 660-94 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-94
1:794
[d] Mitigate the larger mass of commercial buildings with
facade articulation as outlined in § 660-94G(2),
Building massing and façade treatment.
[e] Use front-to-front building orientations, especially
with commercial uses that are pedestrian-intensive
(e.g., restaurants, banks). Other building-to-building
orientations may be utilized except that a back-tofront
building orientation is not an acceptable
transition tool.
[2] Green/open space transitions. Commercial development
may employ the following technique to provide transitions
and ensure compatibility between the commercial
development and surrounding development:
[a] Use small green spaces, courts, squares, parks,
plazas, and similar spaces that can also function as
community gathering places.
[b] Use existing natural features as transitions, including
natural differences in topography (not retaining
walls), streams, existing stands of trees, and similar
features. When existing natural features are used as
transitions, the City may still require that adequate
pedestrian connections to adjacent land uses be
accommodated.
[3] Landscaping and screening transitions. Where other
transitions tools are not possible, or where the City
determines other transition tools by themselves do not
create an adequate transition to, or buffer for, less
intensive land uses, the landscaping and screening
requirements outlined in § 660-113B shall apply.
E. Vehicle connections with adjacent properties.
(1) Adjacent nonresidential uses.
(a) To the maximum extent feasible, connections between adjacent
nonresidential development parcels shall be provided by
constructing a logical array of access points continuous to the
adjacent development.
(b) To the maximum extent feasible, common or shared service
and delivery access shall be provided between adjacent parcels
and/or buildings.
(c) The City may require access easements to ensure that pad
sites or adjacent parcels have adequate access if ownership
patterns change.
§ 660-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-94
1:795
(2) Adjacent residential uses. Commercial drives or on-site streets
shall not align with access to adjacent residential developments.
Exceptions may be made in cases where physical constraints
dictate that no other option is possible.
(3) Emergency access. All commercial developments shall comply with
the currently adopted building code provisions regarding
emergency vehicle access and fire lanes.
F. Pedestrian access and circulation. Applicants shall submit a detailed
pedestrian circulation plan with all development applications that
shows compliance with the following guidelines and standards:
(1) Required pedestrian connections. An on-site system of pedestrian
walkways shall be designed to provide direct access and
connections to and between the following:
(a) The primary entrance or entrances to each commercial
building, including pad site buildings.
(b) Any sidewalks or walkways on adjacent properties that extend
to the boundaries shared with the commercial development.
(c) Any public sidewalk system along the perimeter streets
adjacent to the commercial development [see Subsection F(3),
Pedestrian connections to perimeter public sidewalks].
(d) Where practicable and appropriate, adjacent land uses and
developments, including but not limited to adjacent residential
developments, retail shopping centers, office buildings, or
restaurants.
(e) Where practicable and appropriate, any adjacent public park,
greenway, or other public or civic use including but not limited
to schools, places of worship, public recreational facilities, or
government offices.
(2) Pedestrian connections from buildings to parking areas, pad sites,
and site amenities. In addition to the connections required in
Subsection F(1), Required pedestrian connections, on-site
pedestrian walkways shall connect each primary entrance of a
commercial building to a pedestrian network serving:
(a) All parking areas or parking structures that serve such primary
building; and
(b) Site amenities or gathering places provided pursuant to
§ 660-94C(8).
(3) Pedestrian connections to perimeter public sidewalks. Connections
between the on-site (internal) pedestrian walkway network and any
public sidewalk system located along adjacent perimeter streets
shall be provided at regular intervals along the perimeter street as
§ 660-94 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-94
1:796
appropriate to provide easy access from the public sidewalk to the
interior walkway network.
(4) Walkways along buildings. Continuous pedestrian walkways no less
than five feet wide shall be provided along the full length of a pad
site building along any facade featuring a customer entrance and
along any facade abutting customer parking areas. Such walkways
shall be located at least three feet from the facade of the building to
provide planting beds for foundation landscaping, except where
features such as arcades or entryways are part of the facade.
(5) Walkways through vehicle areas. At each point that the on-site
pedestrian walkway system crosses a parking lot or internal street
or driveway, the walkway or crosswalk shall be clearly marked
through the use of a change in paving materials distinguished by
their color, texture, or height, and have a minimum width of seven
feet.
G. Building design.
(1) Intent. Create commercial developments with a recognizable image
as a distinct place; vary massing to provide visual interest; as
applicable, ensure compatibility with surrounding developments;
and use building height and massing to emphasize important
corners, designate points of entry, and create a visible skyline to
differentiate Lake Mills' new commercial areas from other activity
nodes.
(2) Building massing and facade treatment except where noted. All
new commercial development shall comply with the following
standards:
(a) Variation in massing. A single, large, dominant building mass
shall be avoided.
(b) Building facade treatment standards.
[1] Architectural style. Style is not restricted; evaluation of
the appearance of a project shall be based on professional
quality of its design, architectural interest and variety,
relationship to surroundings and the community,
relationship to human scale.
[2] Four-sided architecture. Continuing an architectural
theme on all exposed exterior surfaces through the use of
the same building materials shall be required.
[3] Minimum wall articulation. There shall be no blank,
unarticulated building walls exceeding 30 feet in length.

following standards:
§ 660-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-94
1:797
[a] All building walls shall consist of a building bay or
structural building system visually established by
architectural features such as columns, ribs or
pilasters, piers, changes in wall planes, changes in
texture or materials, and fenestration pattern.
[b] Long walls shall include at least one change in wall
plane, such as projections or recesses, having a depth
of at least four feet and extending at least 20% of the
entire length of the facade.
[c] All building walls shall include materials and design
characteristics consistent with those on the front.
(c) Building walls facing public areas. In addition to Subsection
G(2)(b)[3] above, building walls that face public streets,
connecting walkways, or adjacent development shall be
subdivided and proportioned using features such as windows,
entrances, arcades, arbors, awnings, trellises with vines, or
alternate architectural detail that defines human scale. All
improvements shall comply with § 573-20, Privileges in streets.
[1] Customer entrances. See Subsection G(4), Customer
entrances, below.
[2] Awnings.
[a] Awnings shall be no longer than a single storefront
[b] Fabric awnings are encouraged; canvas awnings with
a matte finish are preferred. Awnings with high-gloss

§ 660-98 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-98
1:806
buildings. Gates should be of a solid material and painted to
match the architectural screening elements on nearby fences
and walls.
(c) Trash receptacles should be accessible for trash collection but
should not block circulation drives near loading areas or
conflict with parking. For security reasons, trash enclosure
locations should not create blind spots or hiding areas.
E. Building design character.
(1) Purpose: to reflect a traditional "Main Street" character, a
collection of structures designed and built in the early 1900s when
structures were composed of simple forms expressed through
commonly available materials such as brick, masonry, stone and
ornamental trim.
(2) Design standards.
(a) The general form of structures is to be simple, threedimensional
forms characteristic of early 1900s main streets
that orient to and participate in the activities of the street.
(b) Structures with multiple component forms are to be integrated
for visual unity.
(c) Visually expose components that support and/or stabilize
structures when compatible with design.
(d) Avoid excessively themed architecture, corporate or franchise
architecture that is not compatible with traditional main street
character.
(e) Adapt building access to site conditions for level, convenient,
obvious entry.
F. Building scale and mass.
(1) Purpose. To encourage the use of building components that are
human scale; to provide rhythm and facade scaling elements; and
to encourage architectural scale of development that is compatible
with desired existing adjacent development. See Figure 5.1.
Figure 5.1: Appropriate Downtown Building Rhythm and
Massing for Vacant Areas
§ 660-98 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-98
1:807
(2) Design standards.
(a) Buildings should maintain the alignment of key horizontal
elements along the block or street edge. Long, uninterrupted
horizontal elements should be avoided and interrupted with
windowsills, moldings and mid-belt cornices. Building
articulation should be accomplished with design elements and
regular articulation intervals.
[1] Repeating distinctive window patterns at intervals less
than the articulation interval.
[2] Providing a porch, patio, deck or covered entry for each
articulation interval.
[3] Providing a balcony or bay window for each articulation
interval.
[4] Changing the roofline by alternating parapet heights.
[5] Changing materials with a change in building plane.
[6] Providing lighting fixtures, trellis, tree or other landscape
feature within each interval.
(b) Vertical "articulation." To moderate the vertical scale of
buildings, the design shall include techniques to clearly define
the building's cornice, middle and bottom. See Figure 5.1. The
following techniques are suggested methods of achieving
vertical articulation:
[1] Top. Strong eave lines, cornice treatments, horizontal
architectural detailing. This treatment should return into
alleyways and the full length of any facades clearly visible
to the public.
[2] Middle. Windows with thoughtful solid-to-void ratios that
exhibit window patterns of adjacent traditional buildings,
balconies, material changes, railings and similar
treatments that unify the building design.
[3] Bottom. Pedestrian-oriented storefronts, large windows,
pedestrian scale building detail, kick plates below
windows, sign band awnings, and arcades.
[4] Where appropriate, the applicant should coordinate the
horizontal elements (i.e., cornices, window lines, arcades,
etc.) in a pattern and height to reflect similar elements on
neighboring buildings that exhibit the City's desired scale
and character for the area.
§ 660-98 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-98
1:808
Figure 5.2: Appropriate Architectural Elements for
Downtown Buildings
G. Building exteriors.
(1) Purpose. To ensure that buildings have design integrity at all
observable distances; to ensure that exterior finishes are
compatible with traditional main street character; to enhance
buildings with appropriate design details; to encourage pedestrianfriendly
street facades along streets and public parks or open
spaces; to architecturally accentuate building corners at street
intersections; to encourage the use of high-quality, permanent,
compatible materials that will upgrade the visual image of
Downtown Lake Mills; to reduce the visual impact of large,
undifferentiated walls.
(2) Design standards.
(a) Vernacular. Material finishes shall reflect the early 1900s
"Main Street" vernacular for building materials for new
building construction and buildings constructed before 1930. A
new design that draws upon the fundamental similarities
among older buildings in the area without copying them is
preferred. This will allow the new project to be construed as a
product of its own time, yet be compatible with its historic
neighbors.
(b) Facades.
[1] Existing buildings. Retain facades that reflect the heritage
of the City. Facades of vintage buildings may be adapted to
contemporary use with compatible materials. Use of metal
or plywood siding, metal screening, plastic, plywood, sheet
wood products, or fiberglass to cover over existing facades
is prohibited. Wood should not be used to cover over
existing brick or stone masonry.
§ 660-98 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-98
1:809
[2] New buildings. Building facades located adjacent to a
sidewalk along downtown streets shall include transparent
window area or window displays along the majority of the
ground floor facade between two feet and eight feet above
ground level and the following elements:
[a] Storefront with recessed entrance(s).
[b] Sign band (horizontal) or projecting sign.
[c] Prominent building address.
[d] Seasonal planters/landscaping.
(c) Building entrances and fenestration. Building entrances should
appear similar to those used historically. See Figure 5.1.
Clearly define the primary entrance with traditional
architectural detailing, landscape features such as ornamental
paving, tile work, planters and/or planting beds, or canopies. A
contemporary interpretation of a traditional building entry,
which is similar in scale and overall character to those seen
historically, is encouraged in new buildings. The arrangement,
proportion and design of windows and doors shall conform to
the following:
[1] The height-to-width ratio of single openings and group
openings are to be proportionately scaled to the wall and
adjacent buildings.
[2] Door and window details and trim suitably scaled to the
wall and adjacent buildings.
[3] Reduce large expanses of glass used in windows and doors
to smaller component windows reminiscent of traditional
main street vernacular when adjacent to sidewalks or
other pedestrian use areas.
[4] The total square footage of windows along a facade facing
a street shall be a minimum of 15% of the square footage
of the facade.

1:810
(d) Ornamentation. New buildings should incorporate the
following measures compatible with early 1900s "Main Street"
buildings:
[1] Decorative rooflines. An ornamental molding, entablature,
frieze or other roofline device visible from the ground
level.
[2] Decorative treatment of windows and doors. Decorative
molding/framing details around all ground floor windows
and doors, decorative glazing, or door designs located on
facades facing streets or public parks or open spaces.
[3] Decorative light fixtures. Decorative light fixtures with a
diffuse visible light source such as a globe or "acorn" that
is nonglaring or a decorative shade or mounting.
[4] Decorative materials. Natural building materials,
including masonry, brick, tone, wood clapboard, or other
materials with similar decorative or textural qualities.
(e) Building materials. Building exteriors shall be constructed
from high-quality, durable materials.
[1] Preferred exterior building materials that reflect the City's
desired traditional main street character are as follows:
[a] Masonry;
[b] Cast stone;
[c] Wood clapboard siding;
[d] Other materials subject to approval by the City.
[2] The following materials are prohibited in visible locations:
[a] Corrugated or beveled metal siding.
[b] Vinyl or plywood siding.
[c] Tinted or mirrored glass (except stained glass) as a
major building element.
[d] Corrugated fiberglass.
[e] Chain-link fencing.
[f] Crushed rock/crushed tumbled glass.
[g] Exterior Insulation Finish Systems (EIFS) when used
for the dominant facade material.
(f) Colors. Exterior finish colors are to express the integral color
of building materials (i.e., brick, cast stone). Colors should be
§ 660-98 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-98
1:811
neutral shades of natural colors found in nature in the local
region, and include limited compatible accent colors. The color
of neighboring buildings that comply with this section should
be considered when selecting colors for repainting or
remodeling of existing structures and for new structures.
(g) Corner buildings. Buildings located at the intersection of
streets should include design elements or treatments to the
building corner facing the intersection.
[1] Provide a corner entrance to a store, courtyard, building
lobby, atrium, pedestrian pathway, or pedestrian-oriented
space.
[2] Include corner architectural elements.
[3] Special treatment of pedestrian weather protection
canopy at the corner of the building.
[4] Other similar treatment or element approved by the City.
(h) Blank walls. Blank walls shall not be visible from a street,
public park or open space. Treatment of blank walls is to be
proportional to the front facade. The applicant must submit
architectural plans and elevations showing proposed
treatments for approval.
(i) Franchise/corporate architecture. Prototype design for
franchises should use customized components that are
consistent with the desired traditional main street character
and that reinforce visual consistency with other adjacent
buildings. No franchise architecture will be allowed unless it
can be shown that it is harmonious with the elements of typical
early 1900s architectural detail.
(j) Awnings.
[1] Materials. Awnings shall be constructed of high-quality
materials such as matte finish canvas or vinyl-coated
canvas, and shall be of simple, historically compatible
design typical to early 1900s downtown Lake Mills
buildings. Awnings shall not be installed so as to obscure
significant architectural details of a building. Bubble, box,
or shiny plastic awnings shall be prohibited. Mansard
awnings shall be prohibited in the B1 District.
Architectural metal awnings may be permitted with
approval of the Zoning Administrator.
[2] Colors. Solid color or two-color striped awnings are
permitted. Corporate colors on awnings are permitted only
if they are architecturally compatible with the building on
§ 660-98 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-98
1:812
§ 660-99. through § 660-102. (Reserved)
§ 660-103. Multifamily residential design.
which the awning is attached. Overly iridescent or
fluorescent colors shall be prohibited.
[3] Signage. Signage on awnings shall be limited to the
vertical drip or flat face (perpendicular to the street or
sidewalk) of an awning, and shall not be permitted on the
sides or top slope of an awning.
[4] Length. Awnings shall not exceed the width of a single
building or building module. Awnings shall not be installed
so as to extend across more than one storefront.
[5] Illumination. Backlit or internally lit awnings shall be
prohibited.
A. General provisions.
(1) Purpose. Improve overall quality of multifamily development in
Lake Mills, ensure compatibility of multifamily development with
surrounding land uses, and improve user-friendliness of the
document and review process.
(2) Applicability. Multifamily residential design shall apply to:
(a) New multifamily development of three units or more.
(b) Major rehabilitation, renovation, restoration, modification,
addition, or retrofit of a three-unit or more multifamily
structure or site that exceeds 50% of its current appraised
value as established by the City of Lake Mills. Major
rehabilitation shall not include routine maintenance and repair
of a structure or other feature on the surrounding site, such as
roof replacement or general repairs to a parking area or other
site feature.
(3) Process. All projects shall be reviewed and approved as a part of
the building site and operation plan procedures contained in
§ 660-205.
B. Site planning.
(1) Purpose. Enhance the image of the City, reflect unique site
characteristics, and provide strong neighborhood environments;
maintain local character by preserving and incorporating natural
site features, significant natural areas, open space, and historic
structures; preserve and integrate healthy and mature existing
trees for the benefits of natural shading, air quality, stormwater
management, and aesthetic value.
§ 660-98 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-103
1:813
(2) Common open space. Common open space areas are to have easy
access by residents, provide focal points for community recreation
and interaction and add to the overall quality of life for residents.
Common open space should be integrated purposefully into the
overall design of a development, not merely as residual areas left
over after buildings and parking lots are sited.
(a) Common open space required. At least 15% of the total land
area shall be common open space. Clustering of buildings is
encouraged to minimize small, narrow, unassigned strips in
front of and between buildings. Designated common open
space may be natural, landscaped for more formal courtyards
or plazas, or may be developed for active or passive recreation.
(b) Areas not allowed for common open space. The following shall
not count toward common open space set-aside requirements:
[1] Private lots, yards, balconies and patios dedicated for use
by a specific unit.
[2] Public right-of-way or private streets and drives.
[3] Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings.
[4] Land covered by structures except for ancillary structures
associated with the use of the open space such as gazebos
and picnic shelters.
[5] Designated outdoor storage areas.
[6] Land areas between buildings and parking lots or
driveways of less than 40 feet.
[7] Required perimeter setbacks.
[8] Detention/retention facilities, including drainage swales,
except that detention or retention areas and stormwater
management structures or facilities may be used to meet
up to 100% of the required common open space amount,
provided such areas or facilities are accessible and usable,
as determined by the City, as year-round community
amenities by the residents of the development (e.g., picnic
areas, passive recreation areas, playgrounds, ponds for
fishing and/or boating, etc.).
(3) Preservation of natural features. Preserving significant natural
features enhances local character while benefitting stormwater
management, air quality, and natural shade.
(a) General guideline. Integrate existing natural features,
required open space, and existing on-site historic structures or
cultural resources into the overall development.
§ 660-103 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-103
1:814
(b) Preservation of existing trees and vegetation.
[1] An existing tree survey and plan for tree preservation and
replacement shall be submitted with a required
preliminary plan or site plan to show compliance with the
guidelines and standards below.
[2] General guideline. Existing trees and vegetation should be
preserved whenever possible to act as buffers between
adjoining developments and as community amenities
within the multifamily development.
[3] Significant trees. Significant trees shall be preserved or
transplanted on-site to the maximum extent practicable.
For purposes of this section, "significant" trees include the
following:
[a] Deciduous trees with twelve-inch minimum caliper;
[b] Evergreen trees 12 feet or more in height; or
[c] Groups or stands of 10 or more trees with a minimum
caliper of six inches. Significant trees in appropriate
locations, such as along drainages and along the
perimeter of the site, should be used to fulfill
landscaping or buffering requirements as outlined in
§ 660-113.
[4] Tree replacement. If a significant tree is removed or
substantially damaged during clearing, grading or
construction, the applicant or developer shall replace the
removed or damaged tree with new trees. Replacement
trees shall be the same or similar species to the trees
removed or damaged, or alternately a species native to
Jefferson County and approved by the Zoning
Administrator. For every one inch of tree caliper removed
or damaged, the applicant or developer shall install the
equivalent diameter inches of replacement tree caliper.
[5] Tree protection during construction. Significant trees shall
be protected during construction with barrier fencing.
Grading shall be avoided within the root area or drip line
of any existing preserved trees.
C. Site layout and development pattern.
(1) Purpose. Site layout and building orientation often define the focus
of activity that occurs at the front door or along the street. The
layout of the site also establishes the sense of community for a
neighborhood by providing opportunities for people to gather.
These standards are intended to use site planning and building
orientation to:
§ 660-103 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-103
1:815
(a) Ensure that buildings relate appropriately to surrounding
developments and streets and create a cohesive visual identity
for the neighborhood and attractive street scene;
(b) Promote efficient site layout in terms of vehicular and
pedestrian circulation patterns;
(c) Create a unique and identifiable image for new multifamily
development in Lake Mills;
(d) Ensure occupants' privacy through careful siting of buildings
within a multifamily development (e.g., address sight line of
window to window in adjacent buildings, limit buildings'
primary orientation to parking lots).
(2) Site layout guidelines and standards for multifamily developments.
(a) Building organization. Individual buildings within a multifamily
development shall be:
[1] Clustered or grouped to form neighborhoods.
[2] Organized around a common open space, public open
space (e.g., a greenway), natural features located on the
site (e.g., a stream corridor), or community amenities such
as swimming pools or other recreational facilities.
[3] Oriented or arranged in a manner to enclose required
common open spaces to the maximum extent practicable.
[4] Oriented to primary perimeter streets, including
thoroughfares, or boundaries; or through-access drives.
(b) Building orientation to street edges. To the maximum extent
practicable, buildings along a public street should be oriented
to avoid multiple parallel orientations to a public street.
Instead, a variety of building orientations, including
perpendicular and canted, or intervening open spaces should
be provided to lessen the mass of buildings along the street.
Multiple buildings may line up parallel to a public street if:
[1] A building entrance faces the perimeter street;
[2] Common open space is centrally located in the interior of
the site and accessible by all units.
(c) Privacy assurance. If any portion of a multifamily development
is located adjacent to single-family residential uses, then
accessory structures, including garages and recreational
facilities, shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet from the
adjacent single-family residential property line. The developer
shall provide a buffer between the structure and adjacent
property. The buffer may be a fence, wall, heavy landscaping,
§ 660-103 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-103
1:816
or combination thereof. Fences and walls used for buffer
purposes shall comply with the regulations outlined in
§§ 660-14 and 660-15.
D. Vehicular and pedestrian circulation and access.
(1) Purpose. These guidelines and standards are intended to:
(a) Create a hierarchy of streets and drives for new multifamily
development.
(b) Design streets and drives to create identifiable, safe
neighborhood environments.
(c) Provide safe and efficient vehicular circulation patterns within
and between developments. Residential and collector drive
design within a multifamily development should be designed to
encourage building clusters that define identifiable
neighborhoods within the multifamily development. So that a
multifamily development should not become an isolated island
in the surrounding community, the internal drive system
should also offer connectivity between adjacent residential
neighborhoods.
(d) Use internal drives to define and protect important views.
(e) Provide safe, identifiable pedestrian circulation patterns within
and between developments.
(2) Vehicle access and circulation.
(a) Internal drive hierarchy. The organization of the internal drive
system in a multifamily development should provide a
hierarchy of three types of drives:
[1] Low-volume, residential drives that serve individual
building clusters.
[2] Collector drives that distribute traffic within the
development and connect separate building clusters.
[3] Through-access drives that typically connect to the
development's perimeter and to the public street system.
(b) Internal drive design. The internal drive network should
respond to topography, intended traffic speed, pedestrian
usage and safety, and views. Excessively straight and wide
drives encourage high traffic speed and do not have a
residential scale. Accordingly, internal drive design within a
multifamily development's boundaries shall comply with the
following guidelines and standards:
[1] The internal drive system shall connect to the perimeter
public street system to provide multiple direct connections
§ 660-103 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-103
1:817
to and between local destinations such as parks, schools
and shopping.
[2] Interconnectivity. The internal drive system shall connect
to the perimeter public street system to provide for both
intra- and inter-neighborhood connections to knit separate
developments together, rather than forming barriers
between them. Accordingly, the internal drive system shall
provide vehicle connections, other than primary vehicle
access, to each adjoining residential or collector street.
[3] Multifamily developments greater than five acres shall
include a minimum of one "through-access drive," which
typically will be a private drive but may be a dedicated
street, with detached sidewalks and landscaped planting
strips between the sidewalk and curb. The through-access
drive shall be continuous through the site, and connect to
a perimeter public street on either end.
[4] The design of all through-access drives shall be consistent
with, and aligned with, residential drives or throughaccess
drives on adjacent properties.
[5] The internal drive system should be arranged to utilize
both parallel and perpendicular streets in identifiable
blocks or clusters, as well as occasional curvilinear or
diagonal streets, except where sensitive natural areas
would be unduly disturbed by such a pattern. "T"
intersections are also encouraged in locations where views
of important public spaces or natural or open areas can be
highlighted.
[6] To the maximum extent practicable, drives should follow
the natural contours of the site.
(c) Vehicle access and circulation. Primary vehicle access to a
multifamily development shall be from thoroughfare or
collector streets. To the maximum extent practicable, unless
required for emergency access, a multifamily development
shall not have primary vehicle access from a local street that
also serves single-family residences. Large multifamily
developments shall have multiple primary access points from
thoroughfare streets as required to ensure public safety.
(3) Pedestrian access and circulation.
(a) Minimum width. All on-site pedestrian walkways and sidewalks
shall be a minimum of four feet wide, except walkways
adjacent to a parking area, where cars may overhang the
walkway, shall be a minimum of six feet wide.
§ 660-103 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-103
1:818
(b) Pedestrian connections. An on-site system of pedestrian
walkways shall be designed to provide direct access and
connections to and between the following:
[1] The primary entrance or entrances to each principal
multifamily building;
[2] To any sidewalks or walkways on adjacent properties that
extend to the boundaries shared with the multifamily
development.
[3] Any sidewalk system along the perimeter streets adjacent
to the multifamily development as outlined in Subsection
D(3)(d) below.
[4] Any adjacent commercial land uses, including but not
limited to retail shopping centers, office buildings,
restaurants, or personal service establishments; and
[5] Any adjacent public park, greenway, or other public or
civic use including but not limited to schools, places of
worship, public recreational facilities, or government
offices.
(c) Connections to primary entrances. In addition to the
connections required in Subsection D(3)(b) above, on-site
pedestrian walkways shall connect each primary entrance of
each principal multifamily building to the following:
[1] Parking areas or parking structures that serve the
principal multifamily building;
[2] Community amenities, such as swimming pools,
community centers, other recreational facilities, or
common open space; and
[3] Sub-community facilities intended to serve the particular
multifamily building, such as mail centers.
(d) Connections to perimeter street. Connections between the onsite
(internal) pedestrian walkway network and any public
sidewalk system located along adjacent perimeter streets shall
be provided at an average spacing of 1,320 feet along the
perimeter street. In this way, pedestrians along the perimeter
public streets will be able to find a sidewalk connection into the
interior walkway system without walking more than 1/4 mile
along the perimeter street.
(e) Connection markings. Each point at which the on-site
pedestrian walkway system must cross a parking lot or internal
street or driveway to make a required connection shall be
clearly marked through the use of change in paving materials,
height, or distinctive colors.
§ 660-103 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-103
1:819
E. Building design.
(1) Purpose.
(a) Create and add to the visual interest of Lake Mills streets;
(b) Ensure distinctive quality and consistency in building
architectural character and style;
(c) Ensure building design and architectural compatibility within a
multifamily development.
(d) Promote compatibility with adjacent development, as
applicable considering the context of adjacent residential
neighborhoods, including the height, scale, mass, form, and
character of surrounding development.
(e) Provide building design details to avoid featureless building
massing and reduce the visual scale of large multifamily
buildings;
(f) Achieve unity of design through the use of similar materials
and colors;
(g) Ensure use of durable and attractive building materials;
(h) Encourage private open spaces for residents' enjoyment; and
(i) Ensure accessory structures are compatible in design with the
primary buildings they serve.
(2) Building height, mass, and form.
(a) Building height. All structures shall comply with the building
height standards outlined in § 660-57, Bulk regulations.
(b) Building mass and form.
[1] Building length/number of units. No more than six
townhouse dwelling units shall be attached in any single
row.
[2] Building design shall provide complex massing
configurations with a variety of different wall planes and
roof planes. Wall and roof planes shall contain offsets or
setbacks with a horizontal plane differential at least every
50 linear feet. Plain, monolithic structures with long,
monotonous, unbroken wall and roof surfaces of 50 feet or
more are prohibited.
[3] The facades of single-family attached townhouses should
be articulated to differentiate individual units.
[4] Multifamily building design should incorporate visually
heavier and more massive elements at the building base,
§ 660-103 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-103
1:820
and lighter elements above the base. A second story, for
example, should not appear heavier or demonstrate
greater mass than that portion of the building supporting
it.
(c) Small multifamily buildings. To the maximum extent
practicable, the massing and use of exterior materials on small
multifamily buildings of eight units or less should be arranged
so as to give the building the appearance of a large singlefamily
detached home.
(3) Architectural detail. Style, roof form, building facades, and
fenestration.
(a) Purpose. Provide a distinctive quality, architectural character
in new multifamily developments, incorporating architectural
details to reduce the visual scale of large multifamily buildings
and development.
(b) Consistency in architectural style. Each building in a
multifamily development should have a definitive, consistent
style. Mixing of various architectural styles on the same
building is discouraged.
(c) Four-sided design required. All sides of a multifamily building
shall display a similar level of quality and architectural
interest. The majority of a building's architectural features and
treatments shall not be restricted to a single facade.
(d) Pedestrian-scale entrance required. All building entries
adjacent to a collector or residential (local) public street or to a
public street or private drive with on-street parking shall be
pedestrian-scaled. Pedestrian-scaled entries are those that
provide an expression of human activity or use in relation to
building size. Doors, windows, entranceways, and other
features such as corners, setbacks, and offsets can be used to
create pedestrian scale.
(e) Articulated building fronts. Fronts of buildings should be
articulated through the use of bays, insets, balconies, porches,
or stoops related to entrances and windows.
(f) Windows. All multifamily building elevations shall contain
windows, except when necessary to assure privacy for adjacent
property owners. Windows should be located to maximize the
possibility of occupant surveillance of entryways, recreation
areas, and laundry areas.
(g) Garage doors. Garage doors of attached garages shall not
comprise more than 50% of the total length of a multifamily
building's front facade, and every two single-bay garage doors
§ 660-103 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-103
1:821
or every double garage door shall be offset by at least four feet
from the plane of an adjacent garage door(s).
(h) Roofs.
[1] All multifamily buildings with pitched roofs shall have a
pitched roof with a minimum slope ratio of 6:12.
[2] On buildings where sloping roofs are the predominant roof
type, each building shall have a variety of roof forms. For
instance, a gable or hip configuration should be used with
complementary sheds, dormers, and other minor
elements. Other roof forms will be considered on a caseby-
case basis.
[3] On buildings where flat roofs are the predominant roof
type, parapet walls shall vary in height and/or shape at
least one every 50 feet of building wall length.
[4] Roof forms shall be designed to correspond and denote
building elements and functions such as entrances and
arcades.
(4) Mechanical/utility equipment screening.
(a) Intent. Mitigate the detracting visual and acoustic impacts of
mechanical and utility equipment systems located in a
multifamily residential development.
(b) Design standards. Mechanical/utility screening shall be an
integral part of the building structure and architecture rather
than appearing "tacked on" to the exterior surfaces. Screening
shall be provided through the use of fencing, landscape
materials, or other materials compatible with the primary
structure.
(5) Mailboxes.
(a) Mailboxes shall be located in highly visible, heavy-use areas for
convenience, and to allow for casual social interaction, and to
promote safety.
(b) Incorporation of design features, such as a built frame
consistent with the development's architectural style, is
encouraged.
(6) Trash and storage areas.
(a) Trash enclosures shall be located in convenient but not
prominent areas, such as inside parking courts, or at the end of
parking bays. They should be well screened with landscaping
and designed to protect adjacent uses from noise and odors. A
clear and safe pedestrian route shall be established to each
§ 660-103 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-103
1:822
trash area. Residents should not have to wind their way
through a parking lot to the trash area.
(b) Trash enclosures shall be constructed from solid materials and
adequately screened from adjacent units with landscaping. All
trash enclosures should be covered with a trellis or similar
structure. Architectural screening elements should be
constructed of the same materials and finishes as adjacent
buildings, and the color should also be compatible with the
adjacent buildings. Gates should be of a solid material and
painted to match the architectural screening elements on
nearby fences and walls.
(c) Trash receptacles should be accessible for trash collection but
should not block circulation drives near loading areas or
conflict with parking. For security reasons, trash enclosure
locations should not create blind spots or hiding areas.
F. Building materials.
(1) Purpose. Achieve unity of design with similar materials and colors
throughout multifamily developments.
(2) Design guidelines and standards.
(a) Multifamily development over 100 units. Subtle variations in
color and materials shall be used where practicable to define
neighborhoods in multifamily development of more than 100
units.
(b) Exterior materials. High-quality building materials that are
durable, attractive, and have low maintenance requirements
shall be utilized.
[1] For all multifamily buildings and single-family townhouses,
an amount equal to 40% of the total net exterior wall area
of each building elevation, excluding gables, windows,
doors, and related trim, shall be brick, stone, or
architectural block.
[2] Exterior building materials shall not include the following:
rough sawn or board-and-batten wood, smooth-faced or
gray concrete block, painted concrete block, tilt-up
concrete panels, field-painted or pre-finished standard
corrugated metal siding, or standard single- or double-tee
concrete systems.
[3] The rehabilitation of existing multifamily structures shall
comply with the requirements for exterior building
materials to the maximum extent practicable. Use of
alternate materials is subject to approval by the Zoning
Administrator.
§ 660-103 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-103
1:823
§ 660-104. through § 660-107. (Reserved)
§ 660-108. Traditional neighborhood development (TND) design.
(c) Roof materials. Predominant roof materials shall be high
quality, durable material such as, but not limited to: wood
shake shingles, clay or concrete tiles, composition shingles,
and asphalt shingles. Other materials, such as standing-seam
metal, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
A. General provisions.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow the optional
development and redevelopment of land in the City of Lake Mills
consistent with the design principles of traditional neighborhoods.
A traditional neighborhood:
(a) Is compact;
(b) Is designed for the human scale;
(c) Provides a mix of uses, including residential, commercial, civic,
and open space uses in close proximity to one another within
the neighborhood;
(d) Provides a mix of housing styles, types, and sizes to
accommodate households of all ages, sizes, and incomes;
(e) Incorporates a system of relatively narrow, interconnected
streets with sidewalks, bikeways, and transit that offer
multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and
provides for the connections of those streets to existing and
future developments;
(f) Retains existing buildings with historical features or
architectural features that enhance the visual character of the
community;
(g) Incorporates significant environmental features into the
design;
(h) Is consistent with the City's adopted Comprehensive Plan.
(2) Application procedure and approval process. Shall comply with the
procedures as outlined in § 660-208, Traditional neighborhood
development (TND).
(3) Subdivision of land. If the traditional neighborhood development
involves the subdivision of land as defined in Chapter 650,
Subdivision Regulations, the applicant shall submit all required
land division documents in accordance with the requirements of
Chapter 650, Subdivision Regulations, of the Code of the City of
Lake Mills and Chapter 236 of the Wisconsin Statutes. If there is a
§ 660-103 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-108
1:824
conflict between the design standards of Chapter 650, Subdivision
Regulations, and the design guidelines of this section, the
provisions of this section shall apply.
(4) Ownership and maintenance of open space. Provision shall be
made for the ownership and maintenance of streets, squares,
parks, open space, and other public spaces in a traditional
neighborhood development.
B. Traditional neighborhood development design standards.
(1) Neighborhood uses. In order to achieve the proximity necessary to
make neighborhoods walkable, it is important to mix land uses. A
traditional neighborhood development should consist of a mix of
residential uses, a mixed-use area, and open space as provided
below:
(a) A mix of residential uses of the following types can occur
anywhere in the traditional neighborhood development. For
infill development, the mix of residential uses may be satisfied
by existing residential uses adjacent to the traditional
neighborhood development.
[1] Single-family detached dwellings;
[2] Single-family attached dwellings, including duplexes,
townhouses, row houses;
[3] Multifamily dwellings, including senior housing;
[4] Secondary dwelling units, such as mother-in-law units, as
allowed by §§ 660-67 and 660-68;
[5] "Special needs" housing, such as community living
arrangements and assisted-living facilities.
(b) Mixed-use area, of commercial, residential, civic or
institutional, and open space uses, as identified below. All
residents should be within approximately 1/4 mile or a fiveminute
walk from existing or proposed commercial, civic and
open space areas. Individual businesses should not exceed
6,000 square feet in size.
[1] Commercial uses.
[a] Food services (neighborhood grocery stores; butcher
shops; bakeries; restaurants, not including drivethroughs;
cafes; coffee shops; neighborhood bars or
pubs);
[b] Retail uses (florists or nurseries; hardware stores;
stationery stores; bookstores; studios and shops of
artists and artisans);
§ 660-108 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-108
1:825
[c] Services (day-care centers; music, dance or exercise
studios; offices, including professional and medical
offices; barber; hair salon; dry cleaning);
[d] Accommodations (bed-and-breakfast establishments,
small hotels or inns).
[2] Residential uses.
[a] Single-family attached dwellings, including duplexes,
townhouses, row houses;
[b] Multifamily dwellings, including senior housing;
[c] Residential units located on upper floors above
commercial uses or to the rear of storefronts;
[d] "Live/work" units that combine a residence and the
resident's workplace;
[e] Special needs housing, such as community living
arrangements and assisted-living facilities.
[3] Civic or institutional uses.
[a] Municipal offices, fire stations, libraries, museums,
community meeting facilities, and post offices;
[b] Transit shelters;
[c] Places of worship;
[d] Educational facilities.
[4] Open space uses.
[a] Central square;
[b] Neighborhood park;
[c] Playground.
[5] Open space uses identified below should be incorporated
in the traditional neighborhood development as
appropriate. Large outdoor recreation areas should be
located at the periphery of neighborhoods rather than
central locations.
[a] Environmental corridors;
[b] Protected natural areas;
[c] Community parks;
[d] Streams, ponds, and other water bodies;
§ 660-108 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-108
1:826
[e] Stormwater detention/retention facilities;
(2) Development units. The number of residential dwelling units and
the amount of nonresidential development (excluding open spaces)
shall be determined as follows:
(a) In areas devoted to mixed residential uses:
[1] The number of single-family attached and detached units
permitted shall be five to eight dwelling units per net acre;
[2] The number of multifamily units shall be eight to 12
dwelling units per net acre.
[3] Secondary dwelling units shall be permissible in addition
to the number of dwelling units authorized under this
section. However, the total number of secondary dwelling
units shall not be more than 10% of the total number of
single-family attached and detached units.
[4] For each affordable housing unit provided under this
section, one additional dwelling unit shall be permitted, up
to a maximum 15% increase in dwelling units.
(b) In mixed-use areas:
[1] The number of single-family and multifamily dwelling units
permitted shall be calculated the same as above plus an
additional number of units not to exceed 10% of the
amount permitted above.
[2] All dwelling units constructed above commercial uses shall
be permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units
authorized under this section. However, the total number
of dwelling units shall not be increased by more than 10
dwelling units or 10%, whichever is greater.
[3] The total ground floor area of nonresidential development
uses, including off-street parking areas, shall not exceed
25% of the traditional neighborhood development.
(3) Open space. At least 20% of the gross acreage of the traditional
neighborhood development must be open space. Open space may
include undevelopable areas such as steep slopes and wetlands,
and stormwater detention and retention basins. Ninety percent of
the lots within the areas devoted to mixed residential uses shall be
within 1/4 mile or a five-minute walk from common open space.
(4) Stormwater management. The design and development of the
traditional neighborhood development should minimize off-site
stormwater runoff, promote on-site filtration, and minimize the
discharge of pollutants to ground and surface water. Natural
topography and existing land cover should be maintained/protected
§ 660-108 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-108
1:827
to the maximum extent practicable. New development and
redevelopment shall meet the requirements as outlined in the
City's stormwater management regulations.
(5) Lot and block standards.
(a) Block and lot size diversity. Street layouts should provide for
perimeter blocks that are generally in the range of 200 feet to
400 feet deep by 400 feet to 800 feet long. A variety of lot sizes
should be provided to facilitate housing diversity and choice
and meet the projected requirements of people with different
housing needs.
(b) Widths. Lot widths should create a relatively symmetrical
street cross-section that reinforces the public space of the
street as a simple, unified public space.
(c) Building setback, front: mixed-use area. Structures in the
mixed-use area have no minimum setback. Commercial and
civic or institutional buildings should abut the sidewalks in the
mixed-use area.
(d) Building setback, front: areas of mixed residential uses. Singlefamily
detached residences shall have a building setback in the
front between zero feet and 25 feet. Single-family attached
residences and multifamily residences shall have a building
setback in the front between zero feet and 15 feet.
(e) Building setback, rear: areas of mixed residential uses. The
principal building on lots devoted to single-family detached
residences shall be set back no less than 30 feet from the rear
lot line.
(f) Side setbacks. Provision for zero-lot-line, single-family
dwellings may also made, provided that a reciprocal access
easement is recorded for both lots and townhouses or other
attached dwellings, provided that all dwellings have pedestrian
access to the rear yard through means other than the principal
structure.
(6) Circulation standards. The circulation system shall allow for
different modes of transportation. The circulation system shall
provide functional and visual links within the residential areas,
mixed use area, and open space of the traditional neighborhood
development and shall be connected to existing and proposed
external development. The circulation system shall provide
adequate traffic capacity, provide connected pedestrian and bicycle
routes (especially off-street bicycle or multiuse paths or bicycle
lanes on the streets), control through traffic, limit lot access to
streets of lower traffic volumes, and promote safe and efficient
mobility through the traditional neighborhood development.
§ 660-108 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-108
1:828
(a) Pedestrian circulation. Convenient pedestrian circulation
systems that minimize pedestrian-motor vehicle conflicts shall
be provided continuously throughout the traditional
neighborhood development. Where feasible, any existing
pedestrian routes through the site shall be preserved and
enhanced. All streets, except for alleys, shall be bordered by
sidewalks on both sides in accordance with the specifications
listed in Table 5.1 below in this section. The following
provisions also apply:
[1] Walkways in residential areas. Clear and well-lighted
walkways, three to five feet in width, depending on
projected pedestrian traffic, shall connect all dwelling
entrances to the adjacent public recreational trails.
[2] Walkways in mixed-use areas. Clear and well-lighted
walkways shall connect building entrances to the adjacent
public walkways and to associated parking areas. The
Public Works Commission shall determine the width of
such walkways.
[3] Disabled accessibility. Walkways shall comply with the
applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
[4] Crosswalks. Intersections of walkways with streets shall
be designed with clearly defined edges. Crosswalks shall
be well lit and clearly marked with contrasting paving
materials at the edges or with striping.
(b) Bicycle circulation. Bicycle circulation shall be accommodated
on streets and/or on dedicated bicycle paths. Where feasible,
any existing bicycle routes through the site shall be preserved
and enhanced. Facilities for bicycle travel may include offstreet
bicycle paths (generally shared with pedestrians and
other nonmotorized users) and separate, striped, four-foot
bicycle lanes on streets. If a bicycle lane is combined with a
lane for parking, the combined width should be 14 feet.
(c) Public transit access. Where public transit service is available
or planned, convenient access to transit stops shall be
provided. Where transit shelters are provided, they shall be
placed in highly visible locations that promote security through
surveillance, and shall be well lighted.
(d) Motor vehicle circulation. Motor vehicle circulation shall be
designed to minimize conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles.
Traffic-calming features such as "queuing streets," curb
extensions, traffic circles, and medians may be used to
encourage slow traffic speeds. Traffic circulation within a
traditional neighborhood development shall comply with the
regulations outlined in § 660-40 and the following:
§ 660-108 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-108
1:829
[1] Street hierarchy. Each street within a traditional
neighborhood development shall be classified according to
the following (arterial streets should not bisect a
traditional neighborhood development):
[a] Collector. This street provides access to commercial or
mixed-use buildings, but it is also part of the City's
major street network. On-street parking, whether
diagonal or parallel, helps to slow traffic. Additional
parking is provided in lots to the side or rear of
buildings. Figure 5.6 is a schematic sketch of a typical
collector street cross-section. Table 5.1 lists the
recommended dimensions of each component: (A)
building setback from street right-of-way; (B)
sidewalks; (C) landscape median; (D) parking lane; (E)
bicycle lane; (F) travel lane.
Figure 5.4: Collector Street Schematic
[b] Subcollector. This street provides primary access to
individual residential properties and connects streets
of lower and higher function. Design speed is 25 mph.
Figure 5.6 is a schematic sketch of a typical
subcollector street cross-section. Table 5.5 lists the
recommended dimensions of each component: (A)
building setback from street right-of-way; (B)
sidewalks; (C) landscape median; (E) bicycle lane; (F)
travel lane.
Figure 5.5: Subcollector Street Schematic
[c] Local street. This street provides primary access to
individual residential properties. Traffic volumes are
relatively low, with a design speed of 20 mph. Figure

[2] Street layout. The traditional neighborhood development
should maintain the existing street grid, where present,
and restore any disrupted street grid where feasible. In
addition:
[a] Intersections shall be at right angles whenever
possible, but in no case less than 75°. Roundabouts
are encouraged at intersections to significantly reduce
accidents without the use of traffic controls.
[b] Curb cuts for driveways to individual residential lots
shall be prohibited along arterial streets and shall
comply with the regulations outlined in § 660-38,
Roadway visibility.
[c] The orientation of streets should enhance the visual
impact of common open spaces and prominent
buildings, create lots that facilitate passive solar
design, and minimize street gradients. All streets shall
§ 660-108 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-108
1:832
terminate at other streets or at public land, except
local streets may terminate in stub streets when such
streets act as connections to future phases of the
development. Local streets may terminate other than
at other streets or public land when there is a
connection to the pedestrian and bicycle path network
at the terminus.
[3] Parking requirements. Parking areas shall be in
conformance with § 660-41, Off-street parking.
[4] Service access and loading facilities. Access and loading
facilities for service vehicles shall be in conformance with

other similar architectural elements shall define the front
entrance to all residences.
[5] For commercial buildings, a minimum of 50% of the front
facade on the ground floor shall be transparent, consisting
of window or door openings allowing views into and out of
the interior.
[6] New structures on opposite sides of the same street should
follow similar design guidelines. This provision shall not
apply to buildings bordering civic uses.
(3) Guidelines for garages and secondary dwelling units. Garages and
secondary dwelling units may be placed on a single-family
detached residential lot within the principal building or an
accessory building, provided that the secondary dwelling unit shall
not exceed 1,000 square feet. The plan-view diagrams of four
alternative garage locations on a single-family housing lot shall
apply.
Figure 5.7: Plan View Diagrams of Alternative Garage
Locations on a Single-Family Lot
(4) Guidelines for exterior signage. A comprehensive sign program is
required for the entire traditional neighborhood development that
establishes a uniform sign theme. Signs shall share a common style
(e.g., size, shape, material). All signage shall comply with the
provisions outlined in Article VI, Signage.
(5) Guidelines for lighting. Streetlighting shall be provided along all
streets. Generally more, smaller lights, as opposed to fewer, highintensity
lights, should be used. All lighting shall comply with the
regulations outlined in § 660-142, Exterior lighting.
D. Landscaping and screening standards. Overall composition and
location of landscaping shall complement the scale of the development
and its surroundings. In general, larger, well-placed contiguous
planting areas shall be preferred to smaller, disconnected areas. All
landscaping shall comply with the standards outlined in § 660-113,
Landscape and buffers.
§ 660-108 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-113
1:834
§ 660-113. Landscape and buffers.
A. General provisions.
(1) Purpose. Uniform landscape, screening and tree preservation
standards for development of property in the City and the review of
plans to ensure that the City remains attractive, safe and
comfortable.
(2) Applicability. This section shall apply to all developments except
detached single-family and attached two-family residentially used
and zoned structures. Every development shall provide sufficient
landscaping so that neighboring properties are shielded from
detracting visual aspects, and the appearance and desirability of
development contributes to the overall attractiveness and
economic health of the City.
(3) Plan requirements.
(a) Landscape plan required. A landscape plan following the
standards set forth in this section shall be required for all
projects requiring BSO plan review. The landscape plan shall
be prepared by a landscape architect, certified nursery
professional, or master gardener. Landscaping on any existing
or proposed street right-of-way shall comply with the
requirements as set forth by the City of Lake Mills Parks and
Forestry Director. Landscape plans shall be reviewed and
approved as a part of the site plan review and approval
procedures contained in § 660-205.
(b) Content of landscape plan. All landscape plans shall include or
have attached thereto the following information:
[1] North arrow, scale, date of plan and any subsequent
revisions.
[2] The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed
buildings, structures, parking lots and driveways,
roadways and rights-of-way, sidewalks, bicycle paths,
signs, refuse disposal areas, fences, freestanding electrical
equipment, light fixtures, other surface utility structures,
and other freestanding structural features, recreational
facilities, setbacks and easements. The landscape plan
shall be drawn at a scale not smaller than one inch equals
100 feet.
[3] The location, quantity, size at planting, and both scientific
and common names of all proposed plant materials.

ground cover, including both scientific and common names
of all proposed plant materials.
[6] The designation, location, type, and size of all existing
trees four inches and larger in diameter measured one foot
above natural grade. Any trees to be removed should be
clearly identified. Trees which will be used to meet
landscape requirements shall also be indicated. If required
for reasons of clarity, this information may be placed on an
additional illustration. Where existing trees are grouped in
a dense cluster, an overall tree mass may be used without
a specific delineation of individual trees. If this technique
is used, protected trees used to meet site landscape
requirements must be tagged on site and identified on the
plan in tabular form.
[7] Details of all fences and walls proposed to be constructed
on the site.
[8] Elevations, cross-sections and other site or construction
details determined to be necessary by the Zoning
Administrator.

have underground utilities located by Diggers Hotline
prior to installation.
[10] Name and contact information of the property owner.
[11]Name and contact information of the person/company who
prepared the plan.
(4) Timing of landscape improvements. All required landscaping shall
be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The
best times for planting in this area are early spring and early fall.
Plants planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration. If
weather conditions or other circumstances beyond the developer's
control prevent installation of all or portions of the landscape
materials and all other requirements for the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy have been meet, a letter of credit or a
performance guarantee approved by the City Attorney to insure
§ 660-113 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-113
1:836
completion of approved landscaping shall be filed with the City
Treasurer. The amount of the performance guarantee and the
required completion date shall be based on a cost estimate
submitted to the Zoning Administrator. If such a letter of credit
or performance guarantee has already been submitted for the
proposed landscape improvements, the City Council may permit
the developer to extend the performance guarantee for an
additional specified period of time.
(5) Guarantee. All plantings shall be guaranteed to be in a healthy and
flourishing condition for a period of 18 months.
B. Landscape requirements. The following shall establish standards for
the landscape improvements required to be installed as part of the
development of new buildings, structures and uses of land governed by
this section:

Figure 5.15: Screening Between Single- and
Multifamily Residential Uses
(d) Foundation area landscaping.
[1] Purpose. To soften large expanses of building walls, accent
building entrances and architectural features, and screen
mechanical equipment. Where extended roofs or canopies
are used to provide a covered walkway adjacent to a
building, foundation plantings are not required.
Landscaping is required to separate vehicular areas from
buildings.
[2] Location. Foundation landscaping areas shall be located
along or adjacent to each applicable front, side or rear of a
building; provided, however, where a portion of the front,
side or rear of a building is devoted to pedestrian ingress/
egress, vehicular ingress/egress, loading or dropoff zones,
foundation landscaping areas may be aggregated into one
or more locations along or abutting such front, side or rear
of a building.
[3] Relationship to buildings. Foundation landscaping areas
shall be located adjacent to the building; or begin within
12 feet of the building (in the case of a walkway which runs
adjacent to the building).
[4] Area. Foundation landscaping areas shall have a total area
in square feet of not less than two feet times the length of
the wall (two feet x length of wall = area in square feet for
§ 660-113 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-113
1:843
foundation landscaping) to which the foundation
landscaping is oriented.
[5] Plantings. Foundation landscaping areas shall be
landscaped with grass, trees, or shrubs/hedge plants, or in
combination with other suitable ground cover materials
and maintained.
[6] Minimum dimension. Foundation landscaping areas shall
maintain a minimum depth in the smallest dimension of six
feet; provided, however, the Zoning Administrator may
approve up to 25% of a foundation landscaping area to be
included in aboveground planters having a minimum
dimension of three feet.
(e) Parking lot landscaping. For parking lots with more than 10
parking spaces, the following standards shall apply:
[1] There shall be a minimum seven-foot-wide planting island
at the ends of parking rows and driveway entrances. The
seven-foot dimension may be reduced to accommodate the
triangular shape resulting from angled parking. The depth
of the planting island shall be equal to the depth of the
parking stalls.
Figure 5.16: Trees in Parking Lot Landscape Islands
§ 660-113 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-113
1:844
Figure 5.17: Parking Lot Landscape Islands Options
and Dimensions
[2] All trees within a landscape island shall be pruned to have
branching starting no less than six feet above the
pavement.
[3] To break up long expanses of parking rows, landscape
islands are required.
[a] One of the following alternatives shall be used to
divide rows of parking spaces.
[i] Alternative A. A continuous curbed landscape
island between rows may be provided in lieu of
full stall planting islands between parking bays.
Where such a continuous island is provided, it
shall be a minimum of seven feet in width and
shall contain a minimum of one tree per 10 lineal
parking spaces.
[ii] Alternative B. One landscape island shall be
constructed for every 10 parking stalls. A curbed
island at least seven feet wide and as deep as the
parking stalls shall be provided to divide the bay
length. There shall be a minimum of one large
deciduous tree per island.
[b] In addition to required trees, an appropriate planting
of shrubs, ground cover plants, flowers, sod lawn and
mulch shall be provided within all landscape islands.
To insure vehicular visibility, shrubs shall not exceed a
mature height of 30 inches above pavement on
landscape islands at the end of parking rows.
[4] As an alternative to standards in Subsection B(2)(e)[1]
through [3] above, a parking landscaping plan may be
§ 660-113 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-113
1:845
submitted, with or without curbing, consistent with other
provisions contained in § 660-113B(2)(e). Such plan shall
provide landscaping for at least 7% of the interior parking
lot area.
(3) Landscape design requirements. Functional activities within and
adjoining the development site must be considered in the design of
landscape improvements, including consideration of the following:
(a) Service area screening. All service areas shall be screened
from view through the use of evergreen plant materials, a
fence, or masonry screen wall compatible with the proposed
building design.
[1] Trash dumpsters and other waste receptacles or
equipment shall be screened with a fence or three-sided
brick or other approved masonry walls at least six feet in
height, with a solid, attractive single or double access gate
on one side only.
[2] All utility equipment (air conditioners, transformers, etc.)
shall be provided with appropriate planting screens. All
dish antennas greater than 36 inches in diameter shall be
adequately screened from adjoining properties by an
opaque wall, fence, hedge or berm.
[3] All loading areas shall be fully screened so as not to be
visible from adjoining rights-of-way and property zoned for
any residential use.
[4] All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, raw materials and
products within 500 feet of a residential district shall be
effectively screened and enclosed by a solid wall or fence
eight feet in height. If materials to be stored outdoors are
in excess of eight feet in height, then landscape screening
shall be provided in addition to the fence or wall installed
along the outside perimeter of the fence or wall, equal or
exceeding the height of the materials to be stored
outdoors.
(b) Intersection visibility. Landscaping must be designed and
installed to minimize potential obstruction of critical sight
lines. Landscape planting shall be so designed as to avoid
obstruction of a motorist's vision at the intersections of outlot
access drives and ring roads, access roads, alleys or municipal
streets. Unobstructed visibility between 2 1/2 feet and eight
feet above the height of the paved surface of the access road
must be maintained at all intersections. To maintain this
visibility, no shrubs or other landscape material which will
reach a mature height greater than 2 1/2 feet shall be
permitted in the sight triangle (see Fig. 2.1 in § 660-38). Trees
§ 660-113 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-113
1:846
are allowed in these critical visibility areas if the lowest
branching begins not less than six feet above the pavement.
(c) Berming shall not exceed a maximum slope of 3:1 except in
parking islands, where the maximum slope shall not exceed
2:1.
(d) Mulch materials shall be shredded bark or other organic
material best suited for the City of Lake Mills. Gravel and stone
mulches are not permitted, unless specifically approved in
writing by the Zoning Administrator.
(e) All fences proposed to be used to meet landscape requirements
shall comply with § 660-14 of this chapter.
C. Landscape plan and design review.
(1) Standards for plant materials.
(a) The quality and size of plant material selected shall comply
with the latest edition of the "American Standard of Nursery
Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen
unless otherwise indicated.
(b) No artificial plants of any type shall be used to meet the
requirements of this chapter in any landscape area within the
parcel.
(c) Minimum sizes for plant materials at time of installation for all
landscape areas shall be as follows:
[1] Deciduous trees shall be a minimum size of 2 1/2 inches
caliper when installed. Evergreen trees shall be a
minimum six feet in height when installed.
[2] Deciduous shrubs (other than dwarf varieties) shall be a
minimum of 30 inches in height at time of installation if
used as a perimeter screen planting, and 24 inches in
height for all other installations. Dwarf varieties and
plants normally measured by spread shall be a minimum of
18 inches in height/spread.
[3] Ground cover shall be so planted and spaced that complete
coverage can be obtained within two years after date of
installation.
[4] Flower beds and the use of native grasses is encouraged
and shall be mass planted in acceptable areas to create
color, texture, and interest. Annual flower beds should be
replanted annually with flowers adapted to the City of
Lake Mills.
§ 660-113 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-113
1:847
(d) Property owners shall be responsible for maintaining all
landscaping shown on the approved landscape plan throughout
the life of the development. All dead plants shall be replaced
with plants which meet original requirements. No changes
shall be permitted without the approval of the Zoning
Administrator or his/her designee.
(2) Guide for landscape planting. The plant materials recommended in
Subsection C(3) below have minimal maintenance requirements.
However, all landscape material must receive a certain degree of
care, especially during and immediately after planting. To protect
an investment in new landscaping, proper horticultural techniques
should be followed. The following recommendations are provided
as a guide for planting based on current horticultural practice.
(a) The best times for planting are early spring and early fall.
Plants planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration.
(b) Plant trees and shrubs at least three feet from the back of curb
along head-in parking spaces to prevent damage from car
overhangs. Mulch, lawn or planted ground cover shall be used
to further help avoid damage.
(c) Dig tree pits at least one foot wider than the root ball.
(d) Especially in areas where construction activity has compacted
the soil, the bottom of the pit should be scarified or loosened
with a pick ax or shovel.
(e) After a pit is dug, observe subsurface drainage conditions.
Where poor drainage exists, special provisions should be made
to ensure proper drainage around the tree.
(f) Backfill should include a proper mix of soil, peat moss, and
nutrients. All roots must be completely covered. Backfill should
be thoroughly watered as it is placed around the roots.
(g) Plants should remain plumb and level. Newly planted trees
may be supported with stakes and ties to hold them firmly in
place. Remove stakes and ties after one year.
(h) Spread at least two inches of mulch over plant beds in order to
retain moisture and keep down weeds. A three-inch-deep
saucer should be provided to form a basin around the trunk of
the tree. This saucer helps catch and retain moisture.
(i) The lower trunks of new trees may be wrapped with burlap or
paper to prevent evaporation and sun scald. The wrapping
should remain on the tree for at least one year.
(3) Lists of recommended trees, shrubs, evergreen, and ground cover.
The following lists indicate plantings which will meet the landscape
requirements of this chapter. The lists are by no means
§ 660-113 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-113
1:848
comprehensive and are intended merely to suggest the types of
flora which would be appropriate for these purposes. Plants were
selected for inclusion on these lists according to four principal
criteria:
(a) General suitability for the climate and soil conditions of this
area;
(b) Ease of maintenance;
(c) Tolerance of City conditions; and
(d) Availability from area nurseries. All plantings shall be
approved by the Parks and Forestry Director.

ARTICLE VI
Signage
§ 660-114. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to indicate the requirements for signage for
all properties within the jurisdiction of this chapter. This article regulates
the location, type, size, and height of signage within the jurisdiction of
this chapter. This article is designed to ensure the implementation of the
Comprehensive Plan of the City of Lake Mills, particularly in regard to the
implementation of the desired overall character of the community, and its
constituent zoning districts.
§ 660-115. (Reserved)
§ 660-116. General signage and iconic displays.
The regulations contained in this section apply to signs and iconic displays
in all districts.
A. Sign prohibitions and limitations.
(1) No sign shall use any word, phrase, symbol, shape, form or
character in such manner as to interfere with moving traffic,
including signs that incorporate typical street-type and/or trafficcontrol-
type signage designs and colors.
(2) No fluttering, undulating, swinging, rotating, or otherwise moving
signs, pennants or other decorations shall be permitted, except for
time and/or temperature signs, and decorative flag signs according
to limitations in § 660-12, Definitions.
(3) No illuminated flashing signs shall be permitted. Flashing signs are
those that change their appearance more than once every 30
seconds, except for time and/or temperature signs.
(4) No mobile or portable signs, as defined in § 660-12, shall be
permitted.
(5) No advertising signs, as defined in § 660-12, shall be permitted,
except as provided within the right-of-way of Interstate 94, per
applicable State of Wisconsin Statutes.
§ 660-114 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-116
1:853
Rationale: The adoption of Subsection A(5), above, reflects a
formal finding of fact on the part of the City of Lake Mills Plan
Commission and City Council that the prohibition of advertising
signage furthers two compelling government interests: (a) the
general public interest of reducing visual clutter caused by
advertising signage that the City has determined is a significant
cause of unsafe traffic conditions; and (b) the public interest
served by furthering the implementation of the purposes of this
chapter and the City of Lake Mills Comprehensive Plan in terms
of limiting the spread of strip commercial development  of which
advertising signs are a primary contributor. Furthermore, the City
of Lake Mills advocates that this regulation leaves ample and
adequate alternative channels of commercial speech
communication for the messages portrayable on such advertising
signs - namely, distributed print media, broadcast media, and
point-of-purchase display, and are narrowly defined so as to limit
said prohibition to commercial speech on exterior signage.
(6) No inflatable signs shall be permitted.
B. Sign location requirements.
(1) No sign shall be erected or maintained at any location where, by
reason of its position, working, illumination, size, shape or color, it
may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or be
confused with, any authorized traffic control sign, signal or device.
(2) No sign shall be located within a required buffer yard or within a
permanently protected green space area.
(3) No sign shall be mounted on a roof or extend above the roof, if
attached to the building.
(4) No sign, temporary or otherwise, shall be affixed to a tree or utility
pole unless otherwise authorized by the Director of Public Works.
(5) Permanent private signs shall not be allowed within road right-ofway
lines.
(6) Projecting signs located over a vehicle circulation or pedestrian
walkway shall be prohibited, unless a conditional use permit
therefor has been granted.29 Such conditional use permit, in
addition to whatever other conditions are imposed, shall comply
with all other applicable ordinances in this chapter, and shall cause
the sign permit to expire every two years unless the Zoning
Administrator has inspected the sign and its supports for the safety
of vehicles and/or pedestrians. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
failure of the Zoning Administrator to inspect the sign or the
findings of the Administrator upon inspection shall not give rise to a
29.Editor's Note: See § 573-20.
§ 660-116 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-116
1:854
§ 660-117. Sign and iconic display measurement.
cause of action against the City, its employees, or its agents, unless
such failure or such findings are the result of intentional actions by
the Administrator.
(7) Pylon signs are not permitted in any residential district or in the
B2, PB, or B1 Districts.
(8) The location of signs shall be reviewed by the Plan Commission
whenever a design review process under Article V is required.
C. Iconic display requirements.
(1) Iconic displays shall only be permitted in the B1 Downtown
Business District. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see
Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(2) A permit shall be required for an iconic display in accordance with
the regulations outlined in § 660-189, Sign permits.
(3) One iconic display shall be permitted on a building in addition to
other wall signs permitted under this chapter.
(4) Iconic displays shall not exceed 27 cubic feet in area.
(5) No iconic display shall be backlit.
(6) Iconic displays shall be mounted or attached to the facade similar
to a projecting sign. No iconic display shall be mounted on a roof or
extend above the ridgeline of the roof.
(7) No iconic display shall be erected or maintained at any location
where, by reason of its position, size, shape, or color, it may
obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or be confused
with, any authorized traffic control sign, signal or device.
(8) Iconic displays located over a vehicle circulation or pedestrian
walkway shall be prohibited, unless approval for "privileges in
streets" has been approved in accordance with § 573-20 of the
Code of the City of Lake Mills.
A. Ground level. The average elevation of the ground upon which the sign
supports are placed, except when the sign supports rest upon a berm or
other area elevated above the surrounding ground. In such cases, the
average elevation of the base of such berm or other area shall be
considered as the ground level.
B. Sign area shall be measured in square feet in the following manner:
(1) In the case of a sign placed within a frame, marquee sign, or other
structure, sign area consists of the entire surface area of the sign
on which the message could be placed. The supporting structure or
bracing of a sign shall not be counted as a part of the message.
§ 660-116 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-117
1:855
§ 660-118. Signage in residential districts.
In all residential zoning districts, signage shall be permitted per the
requirements of §§ 660-114, 660-189, 660-117 and 660-120, 660-124,
660-125, and per the following:
Where a sign has two or more display faces, the total area of the
largest sign face shall be considered the sign face area.
(2) In the case of a sign whose message is fabricated together with the
background that borders or frames that message, sign face area
shall be the total area of the entire background.
(3) In the case of a sign whose message is applied to a background that
provides no border or frame, sign face area shall be the area of the
smallest rectangle that can encompass all words, letters, figures,
emblems, and other elements of the sign message.
C. An iconic display shall be measured in cubic feet in the following
manner:
(1) The area shall be computed by means of the smallest cube or box
that will encompass the extreme limits of the representation,
emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the display.
(2) The supporting structure or bracing of a sign shall not be counted
as a part of the display.
A. Only wall and monument signs may be permitted in residential zoning
districts. Other forms of signage are prohibited.
B. For each single-family lot, or multifamily lot containing four or fewer
dwelling units, one identification sign, not to exceed two square feet in
area, is permitted for each dwelling unit. Said identification sign may
include one or more of the following: name, address, and/or home
occupation title.
C. For each multifamily or institutional residential lot containing more
than four dwelling units, one identification sign, not to exceed 16
square feet in area, is permitted. The sign shall indicate nothing more
than the name and address of the premises and the name and phone
number of the management company or the on-site name, address and
phone number of the manager of the premises.
D. Permanent subdivision identification signs are authorized, if approved
as part of a subdivision plat. Detailed plans of proposed signs must be
submitted at the time of subdivision review or may be approved
subsequently through the granting of a conditional use permit. Such
sign shall comply with visibility standards of this chapter.
E. For any permitted principal use, other than those specified in
Subsections B through D, above, one sign, not to exceed 16 square feet
§ 660-117 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-118
1:856
§ 660-119. Signage in nonresidential districts.
In all nonresidential zoning districts, signage shall be permitted per the
requirements of §§ 660-114, 660-189, 660-117, 660-120 through 660-124,
and per the following:
in area, is permitted. The sign shall indicate nothing more than the
name and address of the premises and the schedule of services or other
information relevant to the operation of the premises.
F. Temporary signs, including rummage or garage sale signs, are
permitted per the requirements of § 660-120, Temporary signs.
A. The owners of multi-tenant properties will be allowed to allocate sign
size to each business up to a specified maximum for the entire property.
This would allow the owner to allocate much of the allowed sign area to
one business and none to another business if he or she saw fit to do so.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, one sign per tenant shall be permitted
and, if the total sign area for the property would exceed the maximum
area permitted; a conditional use permit may be granted for the
additional sign area.
B. The total surface area of all business signs on a lot shall not exceed the
maximum permitted by Table 6.1 or using a combination of the
following calculation methods:
(1) For on-building signs (wall, canopy, projecting, or marquee) use the
listed ratio of sign area in square feet to linear feet of exposed
exterior building wall length on that wall of the building, except for
walls directly abutting residentially zoned property. Permitted sign
area may not be transferred from one wall to another or combined
in any other manner. The number of permitted on-building signs
(one per wall) may be transferred from one wall to another, but the
total combined sign area of all signs on the receiving wall shall still
be limited by its length ratio of said wall.
(2) Freestanding signs (monument or pylon) are limited to a maximum
of 50 square feet per street frontage. Permitted sign area may not
be transferred from one street to another, or combined in any other
manner. The requirements shown in Table 6.2 of this section shall
also apply to freestanding signs.
C. The number and area of business and group signs for a business use
shall not exceed the number or area shown in Table 6.1.
D. Only one freestanding sign shall be permitted to be erected on each
public street frontage of a lot. Such sign may be either a business sign
or a group sign. All signs shall be located so that no part of the sign
shall project beyond the lot line or impede visibility. Where visibility is
not a problem, the minimum required setbacks for freestanding signs
vary by zoning district. Within the B2 Neighborhood Business District,
the minimum required setback shall be 10 feet from the right-of-way
§ 660-118 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-119
1:857
line. Within the PB Planned Business District, and within the PI, I1, and
I2 Industrial Districts, the minimum required setback shall be 12 feet.
There shall be no permitted pylon signs in the B2, PB, and B1 Business
Districts.
E. Auxiliary signs may be permitted, provided said signage is calculated
independently of the requirements of Subsection A above, and it shall
not exceed 50% of the maximum permitted area.
F. Maximum sign sizes for nonresidential districts shall be permitted per
the requirements of Table 6.1: Maximum Sign Sizes, below.
G. Temporary signs are permitted per the requirements of § 660-120.

twelve-month period. Furthermore, any one lot is limited to a maximum of
two temporary signs in any twelve-month period (political signs are exempt
from this restriction).
§ 660-121. Sidewalk signs and movable sign boards.
A. For each lot. One "For Sale" or "For Rent" sign, not more than 12 square
feet in area is permitted.
B. For construction on or development of a lot, one sign not more than 32
square feet in area, indicating the name of the contractors, engineers or
architect, or products being used in the construction of a building is
permitted, but only during the time that construction or development is
actively underway.
C. For a temporary event of public interest, such as a neighborhood
garage sale or church fair, one sign, not over 32 square feet in area,
located upon the site of the event, will be permitted. Such sign shall not
be erected more than 30 days before the event and shall be removed
immediately after the event.
D. Temporary political signs do not require a permit and they are
permitted in all zoning districts. Such signs are subject to the
restrictions pertaining to safety of persons or property, as required
under this chapter. Political signs may be placed on private property
with the consent of the property owner or the person entitled to
possession of the property. No political sign shall be larger than 16
square feet, and the total area of all political signs per lot shall not
exceed 32 square feet. All such signs may be displayed 60 days before
the election or vote to which they pertain, and they shall be removed
within 10 days thereafter.
E. For each real estate subdivision that has been approved in accordance
with the subdivision regulations of Chapter 650, a minimum of two
temporary development project identification signs are permitted to be
located on some portion of the subject subdivision. Each such sign shall
be not more than 32 square feet in area. One additional similar sign
shall be permitted for each 100 lots in the subdivision in excess of said
original 100 lots. These signs shall comply with the visibility standards
of this chapter. These signs shall be permitted to remain within the
subject subdivision until a time at which building permits have been
issued for 80% or more of the lots in the subdivision.
A. Sidewalk sign. A sidewalk sign may be permitted, through issuance of a
sign permit, on sidewalks within the B1 District, provided such signs in
compliance with the design standards set forth in the downtown design
guidelines, the visibility standards contained in § 660-38 of this chapter,
and in compliance with the following:
(1) Each permitted sidewalk sign shall not exceed 2 1/2 feet in width or
30% of the sidewalk width, whichever is less, and shall not exceed
§ 660-120 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-121
1:862
four feet in height. There shall not be any lighting allowed on the
sign. The sign itself shall be movable, shall not be attached in any
way to the sidewalk, and shall not be chained or attached in any
way to street furniture, other signs, street trees, other landscaping,
or other fixtures or appurtenances on or in the sidewalk. Signs
shall also not be placed on any section of the sidewalk in a way
that narrows the effective width of the sidewalk for pedestrian
movement to less than six feet.
(2) Each sidewalk sign permitted under this section shall be
maintained in good condition, shall be removed each day at the
close of business, and be replaced or removed when the
appearance of the sign deteriorates through damage, weathering,
or other causes.
(3) The property and business owners are jointly and severally liable
for any and all injury to any person or property directly and/or
indirectly caused by their joint or several negligence and/or
activities occurring on the paved sidewalk under this article.
B. Movable signage boards in business districts other than B1 Downtown
District. Placement of movable signage boards to display daily specials
(such as sandwich boards) shall be permitted according to the
following:
(1) Limited to one sign board per tenant/business with the total area of
the sign, not exceeding seven square feet per business.
(2) All signage boards shall be designed, printed and mounted on
durable signage board.

ARTICLE VII
Natural Resource Protection Regulations
§ 660-127. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to set the requirements for the mandatory
protection of natural resources and permanently protected green space
areas with the City of Lake Mills. The districts will limit allowed
development in order to protect resource and open space areas  or
resource-based uses such as farming, forestry, and recreation  from
incompatible development and to avoid potential hazards to the public and
to individual property owners, such as in designated flood hazard or water
supply source protection areas. The provisions of this article are designed
to ensure the implementation of the City of Lake Mills Comprehensive Plan
and Wis. Stats. §§ 62.231 and 87.30.
§ 660-128. Wellhead Protection Overlay (WPO) District.
A. Authority. These regulations are established pursuant to the authority
granted by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1983, Wisconsin Act 410
(effective May 11, 1984), which specifically added groundwater
protection to the statutory authorization for municipal planning and
zoning in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.30 Areas
appropriate for protection in the WPO are established in the Well Head
Protection Plan for City of Lake Mills, Wisconsin, dated October 1998,
and the Well Head Protection Plan for the City of Lake Mills, dated
November 2007, hereinafter the "plans," or if referred to separately,
"1998 Plan" and "2007 Plan." Both plans were prepared by Strand
Associates, Inc. The plans are hereby incorporated herein by this
reference, and a copy of the 1998 Plan and the 2007 Plan are on file in
the office of the City Clerk.
B. Applicability.
(1) Zone 1. The regulations specified in this section shall apply to lands
within those portions of the five-year time of travel (TOT) of Well
No. 6 shown on the 1998 Plan, Protection Area Map (see Appendix
E, Figure 2 of WHP), and to lands within the minimum separation
distances from potential sources of contamination described in
§ NR 811.12(5)(d) of the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources (WDNR) Code, which areas also lie within the City of
Lake Mills corporate limits.
(2) Zone 2. The regulations specified in this section shall apply to lands
within those portions of the five-year TOT of Well No. 4 shown on
the 2007 Plan, Protection Area Map (see Appendix E, Figure 2 of
WHP), and to lands within the minimum separation distances from
potential sources of contamination described in § NR 811.12(5)(d)
30.Editor's Note: See § 62.23(7)(c), Wis. Stats.
§ 660-127 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-128
1:869
of the Department of Natural Resources Code, which areas also lie
within the City of Lake Mills corporate limits.
(3) Zone 3. The regulations specified in this section shall apply to lands
within those portions of the five-year TOT of Well No. 5 shown on
the 2007 Plan, Protection Area Map (see Appendix E, Figure 2 of
WHP), and to lands within the minimum separation distances from
potential sources of contamination described in § NR 811.12(5)(d)
of the Department of Natural Resources Code, which areas also lie
within the City of Lake Mills corporate limits.
(4) The City's Wellhead Protection Map shows the Zones of Influence of
lands where these regulations apply at each of the wells, No. 4, No.
5, and No. 6.
C. Wellhead protection areas (WPAs).
(1) Intent. The area to be protected is the Lake Mills WPA (as
determined by the plans) contained within the City boundary limits.
(a) These areas are designated on the Map that is attached, as
well as the Map within the plans. These lands are subject to
land use and development restrictions because of their close
proximity to the TOT and the corresponding high threat of
contamination.
(b) Minimum separation distances from potential sources of
contamination as defined in the DNR Code § NR 811.12(5)(d),
latest version, shall also be maintained when these separation
distances exceed the dimensions of the wellhead protection
area illustrated on the Map.
(2) Permitted uses. The following are the only permitted uses within
the WPA.
(a) Any existing use, even though listed on prohibited uses, below,
located within such areas to the extent that use currently
exists, subject to the requirements for existing prohibited uses,
Subsection C(3) below.
(b) Those uses permitted under Lake Mills Zoning Code consistent
with the Zoning Map, as amended by action of the Lake Mills
City Council and which are not prohibited under Subsection
C(3) below.
(3) Prohibited uses. The following uses, if created after the adoption of
the WHP Ordinance, as adopted in 1998 or as amended in 2008, are
prohibited uses within the wellhead protection areas designated on
the Map. These uses are prohibited based on the high probability
that activities routinely associated with these uses (storage, use,
and handling of potential pollutants) will cause groundwater
contamination. Uses not listed are not considered permitted uses.
§ 660-128 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-128
1:870

(4) Where any of the uses listed in Subsection C(3) above exist within
the WPA on the effective date of this article when adopted in 1998
or when amended in 2008, owners of these facilities will be allowed
to upgrade such uses to facilitate or enhance groundwater
protection. The Plan Commission and Public Works Board must
§ 660-128 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-128
1:871
§ 660-129. Shoreland-Wetland Overlay (SWO) District.
approve plans for the proposed upgrade and the appropriate
permit issued by the City Building Inspector/Zoning
Administrator's office prior to any work being initiated.
(5) Requirements for existing prohibited uses, Subsection C(3) above.
(a) Such uses shall provide copies of all federal, state and local
facility operation approvals or certificate to the City Zoning
Administrator and ongoing environmental monitoring results
to the City Director of Public Works.
(b) Such uses shall provide additional environmental or safety
structures/monitoring as deemed necessary by the City, which
may include but are not limited to stormwater runoff
management and monitoring.
(c) Such uses shall replace equipment or expand in a manner that
improves the existing environmental and safety technologies
already in existence.
(d) Such uses shall have the responsibility of devising and filing
with the City a contingency plan satisfactory to the City Zoning
Administrator for the immediate notification of City officials in
case of an emergency.
D. Enforcement.
(1) In the event the individual and/or facility engaging in permitted
use(s) under this article causes the release of any contaminants
which endanger the WPA, the activity causing said release shall
immediately cease and a cleanup satisfactory to the City shall
occur.
(2) The individual/facility causing the release of contaminants shall be
responsible for all costs of cleanup. The costs of cleanup shall
include, but not be limited to, City consultant fees, at the invoice
amount plus administrative costs for oversight, review and
documentation.
(3) Following any such discharge, the City may require additional test
monitoring and/or bonds/sureties as it deems necessary and
reasonable.
(4) Penalties for noncompliance shall be provided pursuant to
applicable sections of the code and Wisconsin Statutes.
A. Statutory authorization. This section is adopted pursuant to the
authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23 and 62.231 for cities and §§ 87.30
and 281.31, Wis. Stats.
§ 660-128 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-129
1:872
B. Finding of fact and purpose. Uncontrolled use of the shorelandwetlands
and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipality
would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and
general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin
has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
(1) Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general
welfare;
(2) Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;
(3) Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which
filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic
compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
(4) Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife
by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat;
(5) Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area;
and
(6) Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal
of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland
excavation, filling and other earthmoving activities.
C. Compliance. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within
the shoreland area of the municipality shall be in full compliance with
the terms of this section and other applicable local, state or federal
regulations. (However, see Subsection L of this section for the
standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted
development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless
otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this section.
D. Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this section and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways
and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt
when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
E. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
(1) This section supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under § 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate
to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another
municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this section,
that section shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of
the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(2) This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However,
§ 660-129 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-129
1:873
where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of
this section shall prevail.
F. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed
a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes. Where a provision of this section is required by a standard in
Chapter NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and where the section provision is
unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Chapter NR
117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this section or in
effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this section.
G. Severability. Should any portion of this section be declared invalid or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
this section shall not be affected.
H. Annexed areas. The Jefferson County shoreland zoning provisions in
effect on the date of annexation remain in effect administered by the
municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7,
1982, unless any of the changes allowed under Wis. Stats. § 59.692, as
amended by 1993 Wis. Act 329, occur. These annexed lands are
described on the municipality's Official Zoning Map. The Jefferson
County shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for
the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of
the municipal Zoning Administrator.
I. Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District.

navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the
floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and
streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are
designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways
on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps
or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated
by reference and made a part of this section. Floodplain
Zoning Maps adopted in Subsection I(1) shall be used to
determine the extent of floodplain areas.
(b) Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark
location shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator.
When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact
the appropriate district office of the Department for a final
determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark.
(c) When an apparent discrepancy exists between the Shoreland-
Wetland District boundary shown on the Official Zoning Maps
and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted,
the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district
office of the Department to determine if the Shoreland-Wetland
District boundary, as mapped, is in error. If Department staff
concur with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area
was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning
Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or
deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations
applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct
wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands
designated in Subsection I(2)(d) and (e), the Zoning
Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map
amendment within a reasonable period.
(d) Filled wetlands. Wetlands which are filled prior to May 13,
1994, the date on which the municipality received final
wetland inventory maps, in a manner which affects their
wetland characteristics to the extent that the area can no
longer be defined as wetland, are not subject to this section.
(e) Wetlands landward of a bulkhead line. Wetlands located
between the original ordinary high water mark and a bulkhead
line established prior to May 7, 1982, under § 30.11, Wis.
Stats., are not subject to this section.

§ 660-130. Floodplain Overlay (FPO) District.
A. General provisions.
(1) Statutory authorization. This section is adopted pursuant to the
authorization in § 62.23, Wis Stats.; and the requirements in
§ 87.30, Stats. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch.
1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(2) Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the
floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public
health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.
(3) Areas to be regulated. This section regulates all areas that would
be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR.
Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH
Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and
AO zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from
other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the
most restrictive information shall apply.
(4) Official Maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain
districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps
based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change
to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries
of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and
FEMA through the Letter of Map Change process (see § 660-199,
Floodplain zoning administration and procedures) before it is
effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be
effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are
on file in the office of the City Clerk, 200 Water Street, Lake Mills,
Wisconsin. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
(a) Official Maps:
[1] Based on the FIS: 55055CV001B and 55025CV002B.

restrictive than those based on the FIS at the site of the
proposed development.
[1] One-Hundred-Year Dam Failure Floodplain Map, Dam
Failure Analysis: Lake Mills Dam, dated December 2013,
prepared by Mead & Hunt. Dam nonexistent (no dam)
condition. Approved by: The DNR on January 7, 2014.
[2] Jefferson County Flood Storage District Map, Panel 2 of
13, dated 2-4-2015; Approved by: The DNR.
(5) Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are
divided into four districts, as follows:
(a) The Floodway Overlay District (FWO) is the channel of a river
or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the
channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are
contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM.
(b) The Flood-Fringe Overlay District (FFO) is that portion
between the regional flood limits and the floodway and
displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
(c) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may
be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does
not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A,
AH and AO zones on the FIRM.
(d) The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain
where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the
regional flood discharge.
(6) Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries
on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditions
shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection A(6)(a) or (b)
below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended
according to § 660-199D. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a
boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land
use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The
Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual
predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the
district boundary was determined and for initiating any map
amendments required under this section. Disputes between the
Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary
line shall be settled according to § 660-130A(4) and the criteria in
Subsection A(6)(a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are
based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA
must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to
§ 660-199, Floodplain zoning administration and procedures.
§ 660-130 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-130
1:881
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations
shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base
flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary
shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection,
and any information provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base
flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any
map amendment pursuant to § 660-130A(4).
(7) Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions
of this section shall not be grounds for removing land from the
floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or
base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the
floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to § 660-199,
Floodplain zoning administration and procedures.
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the
mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must
contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
(8) Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by
this section shall be in compliance with the terms of this section,
and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
(9) Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are
required to comply with this section and obtain all necessary
permits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis.
Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and
repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department
of Transportation is exempt when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
(10) Abrogation and greater restrictions.
(a) This section supersedes all the provisions of any municipal
zoning ordinance enacted under § 62.23, Wis. Stats.; or
§ 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another
ordinance is more restrictive than this section, that ordinance
shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions, but not otherwise. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(b) This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this
section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
section shall prevail.
(11) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this section are the minimum requirements liberally
§ 660-130 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-130
1:882
construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on
or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.
If a provision of this section, required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the
standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this section or
in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
section.
(12)Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards
in this section are based on engineering experience and scientific
research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. This section does not
imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted
floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor
does this section create liability on the part of, or a cause of action
against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that may result from reliance on this section.
(13) Severability. Should any portion of this section be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this section shall not be affected.
(14) Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Jefferson County
floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation
shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for
all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an
ordinance which meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
These annexed lands are described on the municipality's Official
Zoning Map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated
by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are
on file in the office of the municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats
or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and
the floodway location.
(15) General development standards. The community shall review all
permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites
will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is
in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with floodresistant
materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and
to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the equipment during conditions of flooding.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above
standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home
parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data
for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this
§ 660-130 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-130
1:883
section and all other requirements in § 660-199B. Adequate
drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and
all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damages.
B. General standards applicable to all floodplain districts.
(1) Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.
(a) No floodplain development shall:
[1] Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the
conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other
development, increasing regional flood height; or
[2] Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to
floodplain storage area lost.
(b) The Zoning Administrator shall deny permits if it is determined
the proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any
increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially
adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of
§ 660-199, Floodplain zoning administration and procedures,
are met.
(2) Watercourse alterations.
(a) No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a
mapped floodplain shall be issued until the Zoning
Administrator has notified in writing all adjacent
municipalities, the Department and FEMA regional offices, and
required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal
permits. The standards of § 660-199B(2) must be met and the
flood-carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse
shall be maintained. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(b) As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after
the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation and
pursuant to § 660-199, Floodplain zoning administration and
procedures, the community shall apply for a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be
reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR through the
LOMC process.
(3) Chapters 30, 31, Wis. Stats., Development. Development which
requires a permit from the Department, under Wis. Stats. Chapter
30 and Chapter 31, such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges,
culverts, dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the

§ 660-134. Flood Storage Overlay (FSO) District.
The Flood Storage District delineates that portion of the floodplain where
storage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to
reduce the regional flood discharge. The district protects the flood storage
areas and assures that any development in the storage areas will not
decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would cause higher
flood elevations.
(c) The depth as shown on the FIRM.
(2) In AO/AH zones, provide plans showing adequate drainage paths to
guide floodwaters around structures.
D. Determining floodway and flood-fringe limits. Upon receiving an
application for development within the General Floodplain District, the
Zoning Administrator shall:
(1) Require the applicant to submit two copies of an aerial photograph
or a plan which shows the proposed development with respect to
the General Floodplain District limits, stream channel, and existing
floodplain developments, along with a legal description of the
property, fill limits and elevations, building floor elevations and
floodproofing measures; and the flood zone as shown on the FIRM.
(2) Require the applicant to furnish any of the following information
deemed necessary by the WDNR to evaluate the effects of the
proposal upon flood height and flood flows, regional flood elevation,
and to determine floodway boundaries.
(a) A hydrologic and hydraulic study as specified in § 660-199B(2).
(b) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the

§ 660-135. Nonconforming uses in flood areas.
A. Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the
Flood Storage District (FSD), as shown on the Official Floodplain
Zoning Maps.
B. Permitted uses. Any use or development which occurs in a Flood
Storage District must meet the applicable requirements in § 660-132C.
C. Standards for development in Flood Storage Districts.
(1) Development in a Flood Storage District shall not cause an increase
equal or greater than 0.00 of a foot in the height of the regional
flood.
(2) No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage
volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the
predevelopment ground surface and the regional flood elevation
shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed
development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost
(compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table
is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage.
(3) If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be
developed unless the entire area zoned as Flood Storage District,
on this waterway, is rezoned to the Flood-Fringe District. This must
include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the
waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge
calculated without floodplain storage, as per § 660-199 of this
chapter.
(4) No area may be removed from the Flood Storage District unless it
can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection
elevation and is contiguous to other lands lying outside of the
floodplain.
A. General.
(1) Applicability. If these standards conform with § 62.23(7)(h), Wis.
Stats., they shall apply to all modifications or additions to any
nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or
premises which was lawful before the passage of this article or any
amendment thereto. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(2) The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is
not in conformity with the provisions of this article may continue,
subject to the following conditions:
(a) No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or
structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this
article. The words "modification" and "addition" include, but

are not limited to, any alteration, addition, modification,
structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such
existing use, structure or accessory structure or use.
Maintenance is not considered a modification; this includes
painting, decorating, paneling and other nonstructural
components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of
existing private sewage or water supply systems or
connections to public utilities. Any costs associated with the
repair of a damaged structure are not considered maintenance.
The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square
feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal
structure is not an extension, modification or addition. The roof
of the structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order
to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure.
(b) If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure
is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer
permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure
or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable
requirements of this article.
(c) The municipality shall keep a record which lists all
nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their
present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications
or additions which have been permitted, and the percentage of

represent.
(d) No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or
any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of
the structure would equal or exceed 50% of its present
equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire
structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure
with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this article. Contiguous dry land access must
be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance
with § 660-132C(1). The costs of elevating the lowest floor of a
nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming
use to the flood protection elevation are excluded from the 50%
provisions of this subsection.
(e) No maintenance to any nonconforming structure or any
structure with a nonconforming use, the cost of which would
equal or exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value,
shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently
changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in
compliance with the applicable requirements of this article.

structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is
destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced,
reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet
the current ordinance requirements. A structure is considered
substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the structure
to its pre-damaged condition equals or exceeds 50% of the
structure's present equalized assessed value.
(h) For nonconforming buildings that are substantially damaged or
destroyed by a non-flood disaster, the repair or reconstruction
of any such nonconforming building shall be permitted in order
to restore it to the size and use in effect prior to the damage
event, provided that the minimum federal code requirements

or other appropriate controls designed and used to remove
particles of 100 microns or greater for the highest dewatering
pumping rate. If the water is demonstrated to have no particles
of greater than 100 microns during dewatering operations,
then no control is needed before discharge, except as
determined by the City Building Inspector. Water may not be
discharged in a manner that caused erosion of the site or
receiving channels.
[Note: There are many ways to meet this particle size
performance objective, depending on the pumping rate. As an
example, if the pumping rate is very low (1 gal/min), then
an inclined or vertical enlargement pipe (about eight-inch
diameter for one gallon per minutes) several feet long would
be an adequate control device to restrict the discharge of 100
micron, and larger, particles. As the pumping rate increases,
then the "device" must be enlarged. At a moderate (100 gallons
per minute) pumping rate, a vertical section of corrugated
steel pipe, or concrete pipe section, or other small "tank"
(about 4 1/2 feet across for a 100 gallons per minute pumping
rate) several feet tall would be adequate. With these pipe
sections or small tanks, inlet baffles would be needed to
minimize turbulence. With very large pumping rates (10,000
gallons per minute), sediment basins (about 35 feet in diameter
for a pumping rate of 10,000 gallons per minute) at least three
feet in depth with a simple (but adequately sized) pipe outlet
would be needed. More sophisticated control devices (such
as swirl concentrators or hydro-cyclones) could be specifically
fabricated that would generally be smaller than the simple
sedimentation devices described above, but they would not be
required.]
(b) Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building
materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes,
§ 660-143 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-143
1:905
wastewater, toxic materials, or hazardous materials) shall be
properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff into
a receiving channel or storm sewer system.
(c) Tracking. Each site shall have gravel roads, access drives and
parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent
sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be
removed by street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of
each workday.
(d) Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected
with a straw bale, filter fabric, or equivalent barrier meeting
accepted design criteria, standards and specifications.
(e) Site erosion control. The following criteria (Subsection
E(2)(e)[1] through [4]) apply only to land development or landdisturbing
activities that result in runoff leaving the site:
[1] Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through
the site shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if
practical. Otherwise, the channel shall be protected as
described below in Subsection E(2)(e)[3]. Sheet flow
runoff from adjacent areas greater than 10,000 square feet
in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas
unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less
than 0.5 feet per second across the disturbed area for the
set of one year design storms. Diverted runoff shall be
conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance
and receiving channels. [Note: Natural Resources
Conservation Service guidelines for allowable velocities in
different types of channels should be followed.]
[2] All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical
sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any
one time.
[3] Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be
controlled by meeting either Subsection E(2)(e)[3][a] and
[b] or Subsection E(2)(e)[3][a] and [c].
[a] All disturbed ground left inactive for seven or more
days shall be stabilized by seeding or sod (only
available prior to September 15) or by mulching or
covering, or other equivalent control measure.
[b] For sites with more than 10 acres disturbed at one
time, or if a channel originates in the disturbed area,
one or more sedimentation basins shall be
constructed. Each sedimentation basin shall have a
surface area of at least 1% of the area draining to the
basin and at least three feet of depth and constructed
§ 660-143 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-143
1:906
§ 660-144. through § 660-145. (Reserved)
§ 660-146. Vibrations.
in accordance with accepted design specifications.
Sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of
three feet. The basin shall be designed to trap
sediment greater than 15 microns in size, based on the
set of one-year design storms having durations from
0.5 to 24 hours. The basin discharge rate shall also
be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the
discharge channel or the receiving water.
[c] For sites with less than 10 acres disturbed at one time,
filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control
measures shall be placed along all sideslope and
downslope sides of the site. If a channel or area of
concentrated runoff passes through the site, filter
fences shall be placed along the channel edges to
reduce sediment reaching the channel.
[4] Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten
cubic yards of material should not be located with a
downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a
roadway or drainage channel. If remaining for more than
seven days, they shall be stabilized by mulching,
vegetative cover, tarps or other means. Erosion from piles
which will be in existence for less than seven days shall be
controlled by placing straw bales or filter fence barriers
around the pile. In-street utility repair or construction soil
or dirt storage piles located closer than 25 feet of roadway
or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable
alternative control if exposed for more than seven days,
and the storm drain inlets must be protected with straw
bale or other appropriate filtering barriers.
A. Measurement. Earthborne vibrations are measured with a seismograph
or accelerometer and are measured in three mutually perpendicular
directions (one vertical and two horizontal). Vibration shall be
measured at the site boundary lines. All uses shall conform to the
standards set forth in this section.
B. Permitted steady state vibration displacement. Except temporary
construction activities and agricultural activities, no activity shall cause
or create a displacement greater than the permitted steady state
vibration displacement for the frequencies set forth in Table 8.1.

C. Impact vibrations. For impact vibrations, the maximum permitted
vibration displacement shall be twice that permitted for steady state
vibrations.
D. Temporary construction activities exempt from requirements.
Vibrations resulting from temporary construction activity that occurs
between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. shall be exempt from the requirements
of this section if steady state vibrations and impact vibrations shall not
exceed twice the permitted displacement for permanent operations.
E. Prohibition on vibrations beyond property boundaries. Except
temporary construction activities, no activity shall be permitted which
creates a vibration beyond the boundaries of the site of the activity
sufficient to cause a displacement of 0.003 inch.
F. Public nuisance prohibited. In no case shall vibrations be allowed to
create a public nuisance or hazard beyond the property boundaries.
A. Measurement of noise. Noise shall be measured using a sound level
meter meeting the standards of the American National Standards
Institute's (ANSI S1.4-1983, as amended) "American Standard
Specification for General Purpose Sound Level Meters." The instrument
shall be set to the A-weighted filter response scale and the meter to the
slow response. Measurements shall be conducted in accord with ANSI
S1.2-1962 "American Standard Method for the Physical Measurement
of Sound." Measurements of sound may be made at any point along a
district boundary or site boundary line of the noise-generating property.
For measuring impact sounds, however, the impact sound shall be
measured using the fast response of the sound level meter. Traffic,
aircraft, and other background noises must not be considered in
measuring noise levels unless the background noise is a part of the
noise being measured.
B. Exemptions from standards of this section. Noises exempt from the
requirements of this section include the following:
§ 660-146 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-147
1:908
(1) Noises of vehicles to the standard noise reduction of
manufacturer's specifications.
(2) Home appliances.
(3) Chain saws, lawn mowers, and snow blowers in private use (not
commercial repair services).
(4) Occasionally used safety signals, warning and emergency signals,
and emergency pressure-relief valves.
(5) Unamplified human voice.
(6) Bells or chimes.
(7) Temporary construction operations.
C. Maximum permitted sound levels in all zoning districts. At no point
either on the boundary of a zoning district or site boundary line shall
the sound level of a use exceed the decibel level shown in Table 8.2 for
the zoning districts indicated.
D. Increases to maximum permitted sound levels. The sound levels set
forth in Table 8.2 may be exceeded by 10 dBA for a single period, not to
exceed 15 dBA in any one day except in the PB, PI, I1, I2, and PDD
(business and industrial uses only) Districts.
E. Impact noises. For impact noises, the sound levels set forth in Table 8.2
may be increased by 10 dBA, in the PB, PI, I1, I2, and Industrial PUD
Districts.

F. Creation of excessive noise in areas adjacent to noise-sensitive areas
prohibited. The creation of, or causing the creation of, any sound
adjacent to any noise-sensitive area, containing a hospital, nursing
home, school, court or other designated area, to exceed the specified
§ 660-147 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-147
1:909
land use noise standards set forth in this section and to interfere with
the functions of such activity or unreasonably annoy the occupants in
the activity, is prohibited, if conspicuous signs are displayed indicating
the presence of the noise-sensitive area.
G. Occasional outdoor activities exempted. The provisions of this section
shall not apply to occasional outdoor gatherings, public dances, shows,
and sporting and entertainment events (excluding regularly scheduled
school athletic events), provided the events are conducted pursuant to
any permits issued by the City of Lake Mills concerning the event.
H. Interstate highway noise. The purpose of these regulations is to guide
the development of noise-sensitive land uses (such as homes, schools
and recreational areas) abutting to highway corridors and to ensure
that any such development that does occur is planned to mitigate the
adverse effects of noise. The standards contained are based on the
requirements for development of the best possible urban environment
outlined by the American Society of Civil Engineers, American Public
Health Association, National Recreational Association, American
Association of State Highway Officials, Institute of Transportation
Engineers, Federal Emergency Management Administration, American
Society of Planning Officials Reports, Wisconsin Administrative Code,
Trans 405, and the Federal Highway Administration's Procedures for
Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction Noise, Title 23,
CFR, Chapter I, Subchapter H, Part 772. In general, residential
subdivisions will be encouraged to provide generous distances between
building sites and existing industries and between building sites and
high capacity streets, highways, expressways, and freeways to act as
buffers against noise and noxious fumes. Residential subdivisions will
also be discouraged from locating too close to existing or proposed
airport approach zones.
(1) General provisions.
(a) These provisions shall apply to unplatted lands abutting to any
existing state or federal expressway or freeway for which a
preliminary plat approval was not previously granted. These
provisions shall not apply to structures existing at the time of
adoption of this section.
(b) Prior to approval of any preliminary plat, final plat or
commencement or construction of any structure, every
application for approval shall be submitted in writing to the
Zoning Administrator by the owner of the land on which the
structure is proposed to be constructed and shall contain the
following information:
[1] Identification of the land on which the construction is
proposed;

enumerations that the Federal Highway Administration's
Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and
Construction Noise, Title 23, CFR Chapter I, Subchapter
H, Part 772 provisions, and Ch. Trans 405, Wis. Adm.
Code, shall be met and any other information which the
City may require.
[4] Certification by an engineering or other qualified testing
firm that hourly traffic sound levels, Leq(h) as hereinafter
indicated, are within permissible levels or that appropriate
sound attenuation measures are incorporated into the
design and construction of any structures to satisfy the
highway noise provisions within this section.
(c) In addition to the requirements contained in Subsection
H(1)(b)[3] above, the application shall also contain the
following information as well as any other information bearing
on the approval:
[1] The existing maximum hourly traffic sound level, Leq(h),
for a representative sample of locations, measured in
accordance with guidelines presented in "Sound
Procedures for Measuring Highway Noise: Final Report,"
August 1981, United States Department of Transportation,
Federal Highway Administration, Arlington, VA, or
modeled according to a methodology in the FHWA
Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (Report No.
FHWA-RD-77-108);
[2] The projected future Leq(h) at the site resulting from
future traffic increases; and
[3] Where applicable, plans for sound attenuation measures
on the site and/or of the structure proposed to be built and
the amount of sound attenuation anticipated as a result of
these measures.
(2) Construction restrictions for habitable and institutional structures.
(a) New residential or institutional structures approved for
construction, where the exterior hourly traffic sound level
Leq(h) within a proposed outdoor living area is projected to be
equal to or in excess of 67 dBA upon completion of the
structure, should evaluate opportunities to mitigate noise
levels.
(b) Prior to issuance of any building permit for any structure
regulated pursuant to this subsection, the City may require
submission of plans and specifications to WisDOT for review.
The City or WisDOT may conduct such inspections and

1:911
§ 660-148. Glare.
measurements as are necessary to ensure the proper
implementation of traffic sound mitigation measures.
(3) Remedies. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section
shall invalidate purported transfers of titles at the option of the
purchaser in accordance with provisions of § 236.31(3), Wis. Stats.
Building permits may also be refused for construction on sites
created in violation of these requirements.
A. Measurement of glare. Glare illumination levels shall be measured with
a photoelectric photometer having a spectral response similar to that of
the human eye, using the standard spectral luminous efficiency curve
adopted by the International Commission on Illumination. Illumination
levels shall be measured in footcandles with a direct-reading, portable
light meter. The meter shall have a color and cosine-corrected sensor
with multiple scales and shall read within an accuracy of plus or minus
5%. It shall have been tested, calibrated, and certified by an
independent commercial photometric laboratory or the manufacturer
within one year of the date of use.
B. Glare standards. All uses shall conform to the following minimum
standards:
(1) Maximum illumination increase. Any operation or activity
producing glare shall be conducted so that direct or indirect
illumination from the source of light shall not cause an illumination
increase greater than 0.2 footcandle as measured at a location
beyond the site boundary line as measured during the day or at
night.
(2) Flickering and intrinsically bright sources of illumination.
Flickering and intrinsically bright sources of illumination, even if
meeting the standard set forth in Subsection B(1) above, shall be
controlled by luminaire shielding or aiming the light source away
from roads and nearby sites. Exposed sources of light shall be
shielded so as not to exceed the outdoor lighting standards set
forth in § 660-142.
(3) Reflective materials that cause glare prohibited. Reflective roofs,
sidings, and building surfaces including reflective glass shall not be
permitted except solar heating devices.
C. Exceptions. Solar energy systems regulated by Wis. Stats. § 66.0235
shall be entitled to the protection of its provisions.
D. Declaration of public nuisance. Any operation producing intense glare
shall be done within a completely enclosed building and effectively
screened as not to create a public nuisance or hazard along property
boundaries.
§ 660-147 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-149

All activities involving the manufacturing, utilization, processing or storage
of inflammable and explosive materials shall be provided with adequate
safety devices against the hazards of fire and explosion and with adequate
firefighting and fire-suppression equipment and devices that are standard in
the industry. All such activities shall be in compliance with Wisconsin State
Statutes, applicable Wisconsin Administrative Codes and Municipal Codes
of the City of Lake Mills. When such activities are not specifically governed
by law, the most current standards of NFPA (National Fire Code Standards)
shall apply.
A. Location. Any activity producing intense heat shall be conducted within
an enclosed building as not to raise the temperature of the air beyond
the site boundary line.
B. Increases in humidity in the form of steam or moist air from cooling
towers or equipment. Increases in humidity in the form of steam or
moist air from cooling towers or equipment shall be controlled so that
they do not create an ice hazard. Cooling towers shall be controlled by
either reheating the plume or using a closed system.
C. Standards. There shall be no transmission of heat or heated air so as to
be discernible (by a healthy observer such as the Zoning Enforcement
Officer or a designee) at the lot line.
D. Declaration of public nuisance. Any operation producing intense heat or
humidity shall be done within a completely enclosed building and
effectively screened as not to create a public nuisance or hazard along
property boundaries.
A. Storage or manufacture of materials or products that decompose by
detonation not permitted. Activities involving the storage or
manufacture of materials or products that decompose by detonation are
not permitted unless licensed by the City of Lake Mills. If such activities
are permitted by City of Lake Mills license, such activities shall take
place exclusively in the PI, I1, I2, or Industrial PUD Districts.
B. Storage, use, or manufacture of materials ranging from free to active
burning may be permitted with conditions. The storage, use, or
manufacture of materials ranging from free to active burning, as
determined by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, is permitted in the I2
District (storage only in the I1 District, and may be permitted by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer in the PI District or an industrial PDD
District) under the following conditions:
§ 660-149 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-150
1:913
§ 660-151. through § 660-155. (Reserved)

§ 660-156. Air pollution, contaminants, and smoke.
A. Smoke and particulate matter. The provisions of Subsection A(1) and (2)
below shall not apply in the case of an equipment breakdown that
makes compliance not reasonably possible, and shall not apply to
residential interior fireplaces, to home barbecues and fire pits,
campfires on legal campgrounds, and to burning incidental to
agricultural operations for clearing land, but not for waste disposal.
(1) Measurement of smoke emissions. Smoke emissions shall be
measured by using the Ringelmann Chart, as adopted and
published by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau
of Mines Information Circular 8333, May 1967, on which are
illustrated graduated shades of gray for use in estimating the lightobscuring
capacity of smoke. All uses shall conform with the
following standard. The density of smoke shall be measured at the
point of emission except, when the point of emission cannot be
readily observed, it may be measured at an observable point on the
plume nearest the point of emission.
(2) Established requirements not to be exceeded. No person or activity
shall emit any fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, mists, or gases in such
quantities to substantially contribute to exceeding the established
requirements of the City of Lake Mills, Jefferson County, State of
Wisconsin, or federal air pollution standards set forth by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency. In case of conflict, the
most restrictive requirements shall govern.
(3) Maximum amount of particulate matter on a single site. Emission of
particulate matter from all sources shall be included in the
maximum amount permitted for a single site as prescribed by the
requirements of the agencies and regulations cited in Subsection
A(2) above.
(4) Wind-borne particulate matter. Emission of particulate matter from
materials or products subject to becoming wind-borne from such
sources as storage areas, yards, roads, and so forth, within lot
boundaries, shall be kept to a minimum by landscaping, paving,
wetting, or other means not violating any other applicable laws or
regulations to render the surface wind-resistant.
(5) Maximum smoke units. No stack shall emit more than 10 smoke
units during any one hour, nor shall smoke of a density greater than
Ringelmann No. 2 be emitted, if during a single one-hour period in
each twenty-four-hour day, each stack may emit up to 20 smoke
units when blowing soot or cleaning fires, and during such cleaning
of fires, smoke of a density of Ringelmann No. 3 may be emitted,
but for not more than four minutes each period except a plume
consisting entirely of condensed steam.
(6) Declaration of public nuisance. In addition to the performance
standards specified herein, the emission of smoke or particulate

§ 660-157. Water quality protection.
matter in such manner or quantity as to be detrimental to or
endanger the public health, safety, comfort, or welfare is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance.
B. Toxic and noxious matter. All uses shall conform with the following
standards:
(1) Ambient air quality standards. The ambient air quality standards of
the State of Wisconsin and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, or any other federal agency having jurisdiction
shall limit the release of airborne toxic and noxious materials. In
case of conflict, the most restrictive requirements shall govern.
(2) Toxic materials not included in ambient air quality standards. When
toxic materials are not included in the ambient air quality
standards of the State of Wisconsin, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, or any other federal agency, the
release of such materials shall not exceed 1/40 of the threshold
limit value across site boundary lines of those toxic materials
currently listed in the "Threshold Limit Values" adopted by the
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.
Unless otherwise stated, the measurement of all toxic and noxious
matter shall be at ground level or habitable elevation, and shall be
the average of a twenty-four-hour sampling period. The City of
Lake Mills may request that an applicant submit a statement from
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources that the proposed
levels of toxic matter to be released will not result in any hazard to
human life or health or to wildlife.
(3) Discharge across property boundaries prohibited. No use on any
property shall discharge across the boundaries of said property
toxic or noxious matter in such concentrations as to be detrimental
to or endanger the public health, safety, comfort, or welfare, or
cause injury or damage to other property or business.
A. General water quality standards. No activity shall locate, store,
discharge, or permit the discharge of any treated, untreated, or
inadequately treated liquid, gaseous, or solid materials of such nature,
quantity, obnoxiousness, toxicity, or temperature that might run off,
seep, percolate, or wash into surface or subsurface waters to
contaminate, pollute, or harm such waters or cause nuisances such as
objectionable shore deposits, floating or submerged debris, oil or scum,
color, odor, taste, or unsightliness or be harmful to human, animal,
plant, or aquatic life.
B. Minimum state requirements to be met. No activity shall withdraw or
discharge any liquid or solid materials to exceed, or contribute toward
the exceeding of, the minimum standards set forth in Subsection A,
above, and those other standards and the application of those standards

§ 660-158. Odor.
This section is applicable to all zoning districts and uses.
§ 660-159. Radioactivity.
All uses shall conform to the following specified standards concerning
radioactivity:
set forth in Chapter NR 102 of the Wisconsin Administrative Code, as
amended.
A. Generation of odor. Any use in any district may generate any odor that
reaches the "odor threshold concentration" or does not exceed the
lowest amount set forth in Table III, "Odor Thresholds," of Chapter 5,
"Physiological Effects," of the Air Pollution Abatement Manual of the
Manufacturing Chemists' Association, according to the latest edition of
such tables for the compounds therein described. For compounds not
described in Table III, odor thresholds may be established by methods
shown in Chapter 5 of the manual. No odor shall be permitted at any lot
line exceeding the amount determined by the application of such
methods as measured at:
(1) Two or more uses occupying a single lot or parcel of land. The
outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the use
generating the odor.
(2) Single use lot or parcel of land. The lot line of the use generating
the odor if said use is the only use on the lot.
B. Public nuisance or hazard prohibited. The emission of odorous matter
from any property in such concentrations at any point along the
boundaries of said property or in such concentrations as to create a
public nuisance or hazard beyond such boundaries is prohibited.
A. Maximum concentrations of radioactivity permitted. The maximum
permissible concentrations of radioactivity that can be released shall be
subject to the regulations of the State of Wisconsin, the United States
Atomic Energy Commission, and any other federal agency having
jurisdiction. In the case of conflict, the most restrictive requirements
shall govern.
B. Storage of radioactive materials. Radioactive materials shall be stored
in fireproof containers made of steel and concrete, but shall not be
stored in containers made of lead or other low-melting metals or alloys
unless completely encased in steel.
C. Medical sources of radiation residues. Medical sources of radiation
residues, such as X-ray machines, gamma and neutron sources, and
pharmaceutical isotopes used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes,
shall be permitted when located within a hospital, clinic, medical or
dental office, or medical research facility. Other uses of radioactive

A. Purpose. The City of Lake Mills recognizes the environmental benefits
associated with the use of geothermal/ground source heat pump
(GSHP) systems for heating and cooling. GSHP systems offer the
benefit of reduced generation of air pollution (including greenhouse
gases) in comparison with conventional heating and cooling systems.
The potential environmental and human health risks associated with an
accidental release of the GSHP fluids that are permitted under this
section are relatively low. The main goal of these guidelines is to have
GSHP wells and systems sited in a manner that will not adversely affect
§ 660-167 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-168
1:924
abutting properties and that are installed in a manner that will not
provide potential contaminant pathways that would allow surface
runoff to enter groundwater aquifers or the transfer of natural or
man-made contamination between two different aquifers or between
aquifers and surface water bodies. An additional goal of these
guidelines is to minimize the potential for subsurface system leaks.
B. Types of systems and typical arrangement.
(1) Closed-loop system: horizontal. Horizontal ground source heat
pump installation is generally most cost-effective for residential
installations, particularly for new construction where sufficient
land is available. It requires trenches at least four feet deep. The
most common layouts either use two pipes, one buried at six feet,
and the other at four feet, or two pipes placed side-by-side at five
feet in the ground in a two-foot wide trench. The method of looping
pipe allows more pipe in a shorter trench, which cuts down on
installation costs and makes horizontal installation possible in
areas it would not be with conventional horizontal applications.
(2) Closed loop system: vertical. Vertical systems are often used for
large commercial buildings and schools because the land area
required for horizontal loops would be prohibitive. Vertical loops
are also used where the soil is too shallow for trenching, and they
minimize the disturbance to existing landscaping. For a vertical
system, holes (approximately four inches in diameter) are drilled
about 20 feet apart and 100 feet to 400 feet deep. Into these holes
go two pipes that are connected at the bottom with a U-bend to
form a loop. The vertical loops are connected with horizontal pipe
(i.e., manifold), placed in trenches, and connected to the heat pump
in the building.
(3) Closed loop system: pond/lake. The coils are placed in an open
water source (pond or lake) that meets minimum volume, depth,
and quality criteria. A supply line pipe is run underground from the
building to the water source and coiled into circles at least eight
feet under the surface to prevent freezing.
(4) Open-loop system. This system uses a well or surface water body,
such as a pond or lake, as the heat exchange fluid that circulates
directly through the ground source heat pump system. Once the
water has circulated through the system, it returns to the ground
through the well, a recharge well, or surface discharge. This option
is only practical where there is an adequate supply of relatively
clean water, and all regulations regarding groundwater discharge
are met.
C. Prohibitions. GSHP wells or systems shall not be located, constructed,
or operated in a manner that will cause further degradation of aquifers,
wetlands, or surface water bodies.
§ 660-168 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-168
1:925
D. Underground injection control requirements. The federal Underground
Injection Control (UIC) Program regulates every injection of fluid into
the subsurface.
(1) USEPA. All wells and systems shall comply with the regulations
outlined in 40 CFR 144.26.
(2) WDNR. All wells and systems shall comply with the regulations
outlined in Wisconsin Administrative Code Ch. NR 815.
E. Construction.
(1) Plan submittal. The owner/operator/installer of the GSHP system
shall submit to the City a BSO plan and comply with the regulations
outlined in § 660-205. All construction plans must be designed and
stamped by a professional engineer licensed in the State of
Wisconsin or an individual that is certified by the International
Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA).
(2) Required permits/approvals.
(a) A City of Lake Mills zoning permit shall be required as outlined
under § 660-187.
(b) A City of Lake Mills building permit shall be required as
outlined under Chapter 279, Building Construction, Article I,
Building Code.
(c) The owner/operator/installer of the GSHP system shall submit
the plan to the Zoning Enforcement Officer for approval for
said system by the WDNR. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
(3) Prior to construction. Prior to the construction of a GSHP system,
the owner/operator/installer must submit to the WDNR UIC
Program a notification of intent to construct. This notification
requirement includes GSHP systems that do not include the use of
wells.
(4) Contractors.
(a) Well drilling. Only Wisconsin Registered Well Drillers shall be
permitted to construct, alter, or decommission wells for
geothermal heating and cooling systems.
(b) Plumbing. All plumbing installation/modification shall be
performed by a licensed Wisconsin plumber.
(c) GSHP equipment. The installation or modification of all GSHP
equipment shall be performed by an individual certified by the
IGSHPA.
(5) Materials.

(except as otherwise provided) shall be granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals unless it finds that if the variance is granted it
would not be contrary to the public interest; a literal
enforcement of the chapter provisions would result in practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardship due to special conditions;
the spirit of the chapter is preserved; public safety and welfare
are secured and substantial justice done. In reviewing the
application and evidence relating to a variance, the Zoning

(4) Boundary disputes. The following procedure shall be used by the
Board in hearing disputes concerning floodplain district

be given a reasonable opportunity to present arguments and
technical evidence to the Board.
(c) If the boundary is incorrectly mapped, the Board should inform
the Plan Commission or the person contesting the boundary
location to petition the governing body for a map amendment
according to § 660-199. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
H. Public hearings for Zoning Board of Appeals.
(1) General. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing
upon each variance within a reasonable time of the date of filing.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall publish notice of a public
hearing in conformance to the requirements of § 62.23(7)(d) of the
Wisconsin Statutes. Said notice shall be published in a paper of
general circulation in the City, on such application for variation,

§ 660-176 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-176
1:937
the public hearing shall be mailed to the petitioner and the owners
of all property within 200 feet of the boundaries of subject property.
Failure to mail said notice, provided it is unintentional, shall not

the appellant or petitioner may appear in person, by agent, or by
attorney.
(2) Notice to the WDNR. The provisions of § 660-198 shall be followed
when a variance is requested for a property located in the

the application. The Chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
rule on exceptions to evidence and permit examination of
witnesses.
I. Findings. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall grant no variance to the
provisions of this chapter unless it finds that the following facts and
conditions exist when applicable and so indicates in the minutes of its
proceedings:
(1) Hardship or practical difficulty. The hardship or difficulty shall be
peculiar to the subject property and different from that of other
properties and not one which affects all properties similarly. Such
hardship or difficulty shall have arisen because of the unusual
shape of the original acreage parcel; unusual topography or
elevation; or because the property was created before the passage
of the current, applicable zoning regulations, and it is not
economically suitable for a permitted use or will not accommodate
a structure of reasonable design for a permitted use if all area,
yard, green space, and setback requirements are observed.
(2) Preservation of intent. No variance shall be granted that is not
consistent with the purpose and intent of the regulations for the
district in which the development is located. No variance shall
permit a use in any district that is not a stated permitted use,
accessory use, or special use in that particular district.
(3) Exceptional circumstances. There must be exceptional,
extraordinary, or unusual circumstances or conditions applying to
the lot or parcel, structure, use, or intended use that do not apply
generally to other properties or uses in the same district and the
granting of the variance would not be of so general or recurrent
nature as to suggest that the Zoning Ordinance should be changed.
§ 660-176 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-176
1:938
(4) Economic hardship and self-imposed hardship not grounds for
variance. No variance shall be granted solely based on economic
gain or loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be considered as
grounds for the granting of the variance.
(5) Preservation of property rights. The variance must be necessary for
the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights
possessed by other properties in the same district and same
vicinity.
(6) Preservation of health, safety, welfare, morality of the community.
The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the
congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire or
endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair
property values within the neighborhood.
(7) Absence of detriment. No variance shall be granted that will create
substantial detriment to adjacent property and will materially
impair or be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this chapter or
the public interest.
(8) Additional requirements in Shoreland-Wetland Districts. See the
provisions of § 660-198 of this chapter.
(9) Additional requirements in floodplain districts. In addition to the
criteria above, to qualify for a variance under FEMA regulations,
the following criteria must be met:
(a) The variance shall not cause any increase in the regional flood
elevation;
(b) Variances can only be granted for lots that are less than 1/2
acre and are contiguous to existing structures constructed
below the RFE; and
(c) Variances shall only be granted upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause, shall be the minimum relief necessary, shall
not cause increased risks to public safety or nuisances, shall
not increase costs for rescue and relief efforts and shall not be
contrary to the purpose of the ordinance.
(d) A variance shall not:
[1] Grant, extend or increase any use prohibited in the zoning
district.
[2] Be granted for a hardship based solely on an economic
gain or loss.
[3] Be granted for a hardship which is self-created.
§ 660-176 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-176
1:939
[4] Damage the rights or property values of other persons in
the area.
[5] Allow actions without the amendments to this chapter or
map(s) required in § 660-199D.
[6] Allow any alteration of an historic structure, including its
use, which would preclude its continued designation as a
historic structure.
(e) When a floodplain variance is granted, the Board shall notify
the applicant in writing that it may increase risks to life and
property and flood insurance premiums could increase up to
$25 per $100 of coverage. A copy shall be maintained with the
variance record.
J. Decision.
(1) Required vote. If a quorum is present, the concurring vote of a
majority of the members present shall be necessary to grant a
variation. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1,
General Provisions, Art. I)]

Vice Chair and attested to by the Board Secretary as evidence of

ordered or authorized by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(4) Decision. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall, within 60 days after
the public hearing, render its decision in writing.
K. Limited effect of a variance. Where the Board has granted a variance,
such approval shall neither change the use classification of the building
or premises, nor give it any status as a nonconforming use other than
that which it has as a result of the variance. Granting a variance shall
be considered as being unique to the variance granted, and shall not be
construed as precedent for any other proposed variance.
L. Effect of denial and resubmittal. No application for a variance which
has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted for a
period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on
grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer.
M. Re-hearing. No request to grant a re-hearing shall be entertained
unless substantial new evidence is submitted which could not
reasonably have been presented at the previous hearing. In all cases,
the request for a re-hearing shall be in writing listing the reasons for

hearing.

ETZC.
(6) The Council may adopt by ordinance the proposed district plan and
regulations, or parts thereof, recommended by the ETZC after

A. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this section is to provide regulations that govern the

of proposed temporary uses.
(2) Temporary uses are those uses that have the potential to create
undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop
simply under the general requirements of this chapter. In addition
to such potential, temporary uses also have the potential to create
undesirable impacts on nearby properties that potentially cannot
be determined except on a case-by-case basis. In order to prevent
this from occurring, all temporary uses are required to meet
certain procedural requirements applicable only to temporary uses,
in addition to the general requirements of this chapter and the
requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is
located.
(3) Land uses which fail to meet one of the requirements for temporary
uses in § 660-29 may be reviewed as a conditional use.
B. Regulations applicable to all temporary uses. No public hearing is
required to develop a temporary use; however, a demonstration that the
developer proposes to meet all temporary use requirements of this
article must be made at time of site plan application. Furthermore, no
building permit shall be issued for any development that does not
comply with all requirements of § 660-188, Certificate of occupancy.
Any temporary use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this
chapter shall be considered in violation of this chapter and shall be
subject to all applicable procedures and penalties.

§ 660-195. Conditional uses.
certification of the proposed temporary use. Said complete application
shall be comprised of all of the following:
(1) A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the
temporary use is proposed, and all other lands within 200 feet of
the boundaries of the subject property. Said map shall clearly
indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs,
and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and
all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is
clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a
reasonable scale. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a
graphic scale, and a North arrow shall be provided;
(2) A map, such as the Land Use Plan or Zoning Map, of the
generalized location of the subject property in relation to the City
as a whole; and
(3) A written description of the proposed temporary use describing the
type of activities, buildings, and structures proposed for the subject
property and their general locations.
(4) The Zoning Enforcement Officer may require a building site and
operation (BSO) plan of the subject property. Said BSO plan shall
conform to any and all the requirements of § 660-205, Building site

D. Approval by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Approval of a temporary
use shall be by the Zoning Enforcement Officer following review of said
complete application per Subsection C above.
E. Fee. A fee is required for this procedure.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which
govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or
denial, of proposed conditional uses. Conditional uses are those uses
which have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby
properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements
of this chapter. In addition to such potential, conditional uses also have
the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which
potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan and on
a case-by-case basis. In order to prevent this from occurring, all
conditional uses are required to meet certain procedural requirements
applicable only to conditional uses, in addition to the general
requirements of this chapter and the requirements of the zoning district
§ 660-192 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-195
1:957
in which the subject property is located. A public hearing process is
required to review a request for a conditional use.
B. Approval required. Uses listed as permitted by conditional use grant
may be permitted in the district in which listed upon petition for such
grant to the Plan Commission and subject to the approval of the City
Council and to such other conditions as hereinafter designated.
C. Basis for approval. The Plan Commission and City Council shall base
their determination on general considerations as to the effect of such
grant on the health, general welfare, safety and economic prosperity of
the City and specifically of the immediate neighborhood in which such
use would be located, including such considerations as the effect on the
established character and quality of the area, its physical
attractiveness, the movement of traffic, the demand for related
services, the possible hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive or
nuisance effect as a result of noise, dust, smoke or odor and such other
factors as would be appropriate to carrying out the intent of conditional
use grants. No conditional use permit shall be recommended or granted
pursuant to this chapter unless the petitioner shall establish the
following:
(1) Zoning Code and Comprehensive Plan purposes and intent. The
proposed use and development will be in harmony with the general
and specific purposes for which this chapter was enacted and for
which the regulations of the zoning district in question were
established and with the general purpose and intent of the City of
Lake Mills Comprehensive Plan or elements thereof.
(2) Adverse impact. The proposed use and development will not have a
substantial or undue adverse or detrimental effect upon or
endanger adjacent property, the character of the area, or the public
health, safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare and not
substantially diminish and impair property values within the
community or neighborhood and:
(a) Interference with surrounding development. The proposed use
and development will be constructed, arranged, and operated
so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use and
development of neighboring property according to the
applicable zoning district regulations.
(b) Adequate public facilities. The proposed use and development
will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as streets, public utilities including public water
supply system and sanitary sewer, police and fire protection,
refuse disposal, public parks, libraries, schools, and other
public facilities and utilities or the petitioner will provide
adequately for such facilities.
(3) Traffic congestion. The proposed use and development will not
cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of
§ 660-195 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-195
1:958
traffic through residential streets. Adequate measures will be taken
to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic
congestion in the public streets.
(4) Destruction of significant features. The proposed use and
development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of
any natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
D. Procedure.
(1) Initiation of request for approval of a conditional use. Proceedings
for approval of a conditional use shall be initiated by:
(a) A petition of the owner(s) of the subject property;
(b) A recommendation of the Plan Commission; or
(c) By action of the City Council.
(2) Petition. A request for conditional use grant shall be submitted in
writing to the City Clerk who shall promptly refer such petition to
the Plan Commission and City Council for determination. Such
petition shall be accompanied by appropriate data and information
necessary for proper evaluation of the request, including
specifically the following:
(a) An accurate map of the property including indication of
general terrain and topographical characteristics, the location
of all significant terra in features such as streams, ponds, tree
growths, etc., and the location of all existing structures.
(b) An accurate and complete written description of the use for
which a conditional use is being requested including pertinent
statistics and operational characteristics.
(c) Plans and other drawings showing proposed development of
the site and buildings including landscape plans, location of
parking and service areas, driveways, exterior lighting, type of
building material, etc.
(3) Review by City staff. The proposed conditional use shall be
reviewed by City staff in the following steps:
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall review the submittal in order to
ensure that all required portions of the submittal are provided.
(b) Upon the receipt and acknowledgement of a complete
submittal, City staff shall undertake a review of the submittal
which shall evaluate and comment on the written justification
for the proposed conditional use provided in the submittal per
Subsection C, Basis for approval, above. Furthermore, said
review shall evaluate the submittal based on the following
questions:
§ 660-195 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-195
1:959
[1] How is the proposed conditional use (the use in general) in
harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and
standards of the City of Lake Mills Comprehensive Plan, or
any other plan or program, adopted by the City?
[2] How is the proposed conditional use (in its specific
location) in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives,
policies and standards of the City of Lake Mills
Comprehensive Plan, or any other plan or program,
adopted by the City?
[3] Does the proposed conditional use, in its proposed location
and as depicted on the site plan, result in a substantial or
undue adverse impact on adjacent property, the character
of the neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors,
parking, public improvements, public property or rightsof-
way, or other matters affecting the public health, safety,
or general welfare, either as they now exist or as they may
in the future be developed as a result of the
implementation of the provisions and policies of this
article, the Comprehensive Plan, or other plan, program,
map, or ordinance adopted?
[4] Does the proposed conditional use maintain the desired
consistency of land uses, land use intensities, and land use
impacts as related to the environs of the property?
[5] Is the proposed conditional use located in an area that will
be adequately served by, and will not impose an undue
burden on, any of the improvements, facilities, utilities or
services provided by public agencies serving the property?
[6] Do the potential public benefits of the proposed
conditional use outweigh any and all potential adverse
impacts of the proposed conditional use (as identified in
Subsection D(3)(b)[1] through [5], above), after taking into
consideration any proposal by the petitioner and any
requirements recommended by the petitioner to alleviate
such impacts?
(c) A staff report shall be forwarded to the Plan Commission for
review and use in the development of a recommendation to
City Council.
(4) Review by Plan Commission. City Council shall not approve a
conditional use without allowing for a recommendation from the
Plan Commission per the provisions of this subsection.
(a) Within 45 days after the receipt of the complete petition as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, the Plan Commission
shall hold a public hearing pursuant to § 660-209, Public
hearings, of this chapter.
§ 660-195 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-195
1:960
(b) Within 60 days after the receipt of the complete petition as
determined by the Zoning Administrator (or within an
extension of said period requested in writing by the petitioner
and granted by the Plan Commission), the Plan Commission
shall provide a written report, minutes, or motion to the City
Council stating its findings regarding Subsection D(3), above,
and its recommendation regarding the petition as a whole. The
report, minutes, or motion shall include a formal finding of
facts developed and approved by the Plan Commission
concerning the requirements of Subsection D(3)(c) above.
(c) If the Plan Commission fails to make a report within 60 days
after the receipt of said complete petition (and in the absence
of a petitioner-approved extension per Subsection D(4)(b)
above), then the City Council may hold a public hearing within
30 days after the expiration of said sixty-day period. Failure to
receive said written report from the Plan Commission shall not
invalidate the proceedings or actions of City Council. If such a
public hearing is necessary, the City Council shall provide
notice per the requirements of § 660-209, Public hearings.
[State Law Reference: § 62.23(7)(d)2.]
(5) Review and action by City Council. City Council shall consider the
recommendation of the Plan Commission regarding the proposed
conditional use. The Council may request further information and/
or additional reports from the Plan Commission, City staff, and/or
the petitioner. The Council may take final action on said conditional
use at time of its initial meeting, or said proceedings may be
continued from time to time for further consideration. City Council
may approve the conditional use as originally proposed, may
approve the proposed conditional use with modifications (per the
recommendations of City staff, the Plan Commission, or City
Council itself), or may deny the proposed conditional use. If the
City Council wishes to make significant changes in the proposed
conditional use, as recommended by the Plan Commission, then the
procedure set forth in § 66.23(7)(d) of the Wisconsin Statutes shall
be followed prior to Council action. Any action to amend the
provisions of this section requires a majority vote of the Council.
Approval of the proposed conditional use shall be considered the
approval of a unique request and shall not be construed as
precedent for any other proposed conditional use.
(6) Mapping and recording. When a conditional use is approved, the
building site and operation plan and occupancy and zoning use
permits shall be applicable solely to the structures, use, and
property so described. The City Clerk shall be responsible for
recording the approved conditional use permit. Indication of such
approval shall also be made on the Zoning Map by appropriate code
number or symbol.
§ 660-195 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-195
1:961
E. Effect of denial. No application which has been denied (either wholly or
in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of
said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of
change in factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
F. Compliance with standards. The conditional use shall, in all other
respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which
it is located, except as such regulations may, in each instance, be
modified by the City Council pursuant to the recommendations of the
Plan Commission. The proposed use and development shall comply with
all additional standards imposed on it by the particular provision of this
section and the Code authorizing such use.
G. Special standards for specific conditional uses. When the zoning district
regulations authorize a conditional use in a particular zoning district
and that conditional use is indicated as having special standards as set
forth in Article IV of this chapter, a conditional use permit for such use
in such zoning district shall not be recommended or granted unless the
petitioner shall establish compliance with all such specific standards.
H. Considerations. In determining whether the petitioner's evidence
establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the Plan
Commission and the City Council shall consider the following:
(1) Alternative locations. Whether and to what extent such public goals
can be met by the location of the proposed use and development at
another site or in another area that may be more appropriate than
the proposed site.
(2) Mitigation of adverse impacts. Whether and to what extent all steps
possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects of the
proposed use and development on the immediate vicinity through
building design, site design, landscaping, and screening.
I. Conditions on conditional use permits. The Plan Commission may
recommend and the City Council may impose such conditions and
limitations concerning use, construction, character, location,
landscaping, maintenance, screening, operation, hours of operation
(except as may be allowed by other federal, state, or county
requirements), need for a developer's agreement, and other matters
relating to the purposes and objectives of this chapter upon the
premises benefited by the issuance of a conditional use permit as may
be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects
upon other property and improvements near the subject property, upon
such public facilities and services, protection of the public interest, and
to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in
this chapter. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the
resolution granting the conditional use permit, and the City Council
may require the unconditional consent of the petitioner to such
conditions. Violation of any such condition of limitation shall be a
§ 660-195 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-195
1:962
violation of this chapter and shall constitute grounds for revocation of
the conditional use permit.
J. Costs. The costs of all professional, expert, technical consultant
services retained by the City and rendered in review of a conditional
use permit, administration of a conditional use permit, checking and/or
inspections relating to a conditional use permit, including, but not
limited to, consulting professional engineers, consulting planners, City
Attorney, or other professional, expert, or technical services, shall be
borne by the petitioner for a conditional use permit and shall be
considered as a part of the application fees for a conditional use permit.
K. Affidavit of compliance with conditions. In all cases in which conditional
uses are granted, the City Council shall require such evidence and
guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith are being, and will be, complied
with. Whenever any conditional use permit granted pursuant to this
chapter is made subject to conditions or limitations to be met by the
petitioner, the petitioner shall, upon meeting such conditions, file an
affidavit with the Zoning Administrator so stating.
L. Effect of issuance of a conditional use permit. The grant of a conditional
use permit shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any
such use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any other permits
or approvals that may be required by the ordinances and codes of the
City of Lake Mills, including but not limited to building permit, zoning
permit, occupancy permit, land division approval, site plan approval, or
other type of permit or approval.
M. Limitations on conditional use permits.
(1) Time limitations. Subject to an extension of time granted by the
City Council, upon recommendation of the Plan Commission, no
conditional use permit shall be valid for a period longer than 12
months unless a building permit and/or occupancy permit is issued
and construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a zoning
permit is issued and a use commenced within that period.
(2) Use discontinuance. A conditional use permit shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use for which it was issued. Such
permits shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or
effect if such use shall be discontinued for 12 consecutive months
or more; provided, however, that if such use is discontinued due to
labor strikes, war, natural disasters, or other similar cause(s)
beyond the reasonable control of the holder of the conditional use
permit, such twelve-month period shall be extended for a period of
time equal to the period that the holder of the conditional use
§ 660-195 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-195
1:963
permit is, for such reason, prevented from engaging in the
particular use for which the conditional use permit was issued.
(3) Conditional use permit runs with land and not the petitioner.
Unless otherwise provided in the resolution granting a conditional
use permit, a conditional use permit shall be deemed to relate to,
and to be for the benefit of, the use and lot in question rather than
the petitioner, owner, or operator of such use or lot.
(4) Additions and enlargements to conditional uses.
(a) Any additions or enlargements of an existing legal conditional
use for which a conditional use permit has been issued may be
amended, varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures
and subject to the standards and limitations provided in this
chapter for its original approval.
(b) Any additions or enlargements of an existing conditional use
for which a conditional use permit has not been issued shall be
subject to the provisions of Subsection N of this section.
(5) Amendments to conditional use permits. A conditional use permit
may be amended, varied, or altered only pursuant to the
procedures and subject to the standards and limitations provided in
this chapter for its original approval.
N. Existing conditional uses.
(1) Application to existing uses.
(a) A use which existed lawfully on a lot at the time said lot was
placed in a district where such use would be permitted only as
a conditional use grant shall automatically be granted
conditional use status.
(b) The grant of a conditional use in such case shall be based upon
the existing conditions at that time, and any expansion or
change in use shall require changing of the conditional use
grant.
(c) Petition may be made at any time for expansion or other
change of the conditional use grant, and such petition shall not
prejudice the existing grant as herein authorized.
(d) Conditional use status granted under previous zoning
regulations shall be considered in effect under this chapter
subject to the conditions established by the original grant. Any
expansion or other change, however, shall be subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
(2) Review of existing conditional use permits. An existing conditional
use permit may be reviewed by the City as follows.
§ 660-195 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-195
1:964
(a) The Plan Commission may review a conditional use permit if
any of the following determinations are made by the Plan
Commission:
[1] The conditional use has not continued in conformity with
the City's conditions of approval of the conditional use
permit or with any subsequent amendments to the
conditional use permit.
[2] Violations of other statutes, ordinances, or laws.
[3] A change in the character of the surrounding area or in the
conditional use itself which has caused the conditional use
to become incompatible with the surrounding uses.
[4] A change in ownership or tenant; a change in the use or
occupancy of property. This can involve the review of
existing site/building conditions with a determination by
the Plan Commission of where nonconforming elements
are to be brought into compliance.
(b) The determination for the review of a conditional use permit
shall be made by the Plan Commission after due notice to the
property owner, occupant, or agent as indicated on the
conditional use permit, as to the reasons for the review.
(c) Upon review of the conditional use permit, the Plan
Commission may recommend to the City Council that no action
be taken, recommend revisions to the conditional use permit or
additional conditions be added to the conditional use permit or
may recommend that the City Council proceed with a public
hearing for possible termination of the conditional use permit.
(d) Termination. Where a permitted conditional use does not
continue in conformity with the conditions of the original
approval, or where a change in the character of the
surrounding area or of the use itself causes it to be no longer
compatible with surrounding areas, or for similar cause based
upon consideration for the public welfare, the conditional use
grant may be terminated by action of the City Council following
referral to the Plan Commission for recommendation and
public hearing thereon. Such use shall thereafter be classified
as a legal nonconforming use, except that where the action is
due to failure to comply with the conditions of the conditional
use grant, the City Council may require complete termination
of such use.
(3) Subsequent change or addition to the approved plans or use shall
first be submitted for approval to the Zoning Administrator. If in the
opinion of the Zoning Administrator such change or addition
constitutes a substantial alteration based on the standards set
forth, a public hearing before the Plan Commission shall be
§ 660-195 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-195
1:965
§ 660-196. Zoning Code amendments.
required and notice thereof be given pursuant to § 660-209, Public
hearings, of this chapter.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which
govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or
denial, of proposed amendments to provisions of this chapter while
promoting the public health, safety, morals, comfort, and general
welfare, conserving the value of property throughout the City, and
lessening or avoiding congestion in the public streets and highways.
The City Council may, from time to time, in the manner hereinafter set
forth, amend the regulations imposed by this chapter, provided that in
all amendatory ordinances adopted under the authority of this section
due allowance shall be made for existing conditions, the conservation of
property values, the direction of building development to the best
advantages of the entire City, and the uses to which property is devoted
at the time of the adoption of such amendatory ordinance.
B. Initiation of request for amendment of Chapter 660, Zoning
Regulations. Proceedings for amendment of this chapter may be
initiated by any one of the following methods:
(1) An application by any member of the general public;
(2) A recommendation of the City staff;

above, shall be approved as complete by the Zoning Administrator prior
to the formal initiation of this procedure. The submittal of an
application to the City Clerk to initiate this procedure shall not occur
until the Zoning Administrator has certified acceptance of the complete
application to the City Clerk. No placement of the application on any
agenda for action shall occur without certification. The item may be
placed on any agenda as a discussion-only item, with the permission of
the Zoning Administrator or the Plan Commission Chair, without an
application. Prior to the submittal of the Official Notice regarding the
application to the newspaper by the City Clerk, the petitioner shall
provide the City Clerk with the requisite number of copies of the
complete application as certified by the Zoning Administrator. Said
complete application shall be comprised of all of the following:

in a manner which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier;
§ 660-195 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-196
1:966
(2) A copy of the text which is proposed to replace the current text;
and
(3) As an optional requirement, the petitioner may wish to provide
written justification for the proposed text amendment, consisting of
the reasons why the petitioner believes the proposed text
amendment is in harmony with the recommendations of the
Comprehensive Plan, particularly as evidenced by compliance with
the standards set out in Subsection D(3).
D. Review by the Zoning Administrator and City departments. The
proposed text amendment shall be reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator, the City Planner, the City Engineer, pertinent City
departments, including Police, Fire, and Public Works, as follows:
(1) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application
is complete and fulfills the requirements of this chapter. If the
Zoning Administrator determines that the application is not
complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this chapter, he
shall return the application to the petitioner. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that the application is complete, he shall
so notify petitioner.
(2) Upon notifying the petitioner that his application is complete the
Zoning Administrator shall review the application and evaluate and
comment on the written justification for the proposed text
amendment provided in the application per Subsection C.
(3) The Zoning Administrator may also evaluate the application to
determine whether the proposed text amendment is in harmony
with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan, particularly
as evidenced by compliance with the standards below:
(a) The proposed text amendment furthers the purposes of this
chapter as outlined in Subsection A.
(b) The proposed text amendment furthers the purposes of the
chapter in which the amendment is proposed to be located.
(c) The proposed text amendment furthers the purposes of the
specific section in which the amendment is proposed to be
located.
(d) The following factors have arisen that are not properly
addressed in the current zoning text:
[1] The provisions of this chapter should be brought into
conformity with the Comprehensive Plan. (If a factor
related to the proposed amendment, note pertinent
portions of the Comprehensive Plan.);
[2] A change has occurred in the land market, or other factors
have arisen which require a new form of development, a
§ 660-196 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-196
1:967
new type of land use, or a new procedure to meet said
change(s);
[3] New methods of development or providing infrastructure
make it necessary to alter this chapter to meet these new
factors; or
[4] Changing governmental finances require amending this
chapter in order to meet the needs of the government in
terms of providing and affording public services.
(e) If the proposed text amendment is concerned with the
provisions of § 660-56, Land use regulations and matrix of land
uses, then the proposed amendment maintains the desired
overall consistency of land uses, land use intensities, and land
use impacts within the pertinent zoning districts.
(4) The Zoning Administrator shall forward the report per Subsection
D(2), and if it has been prepared, the report per Subsection D(3) to
the Plan Commission for the Commission's review and use in
making its recommendation to the City Council. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with
the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning
Administrator shall note this determination in the report.
E. Review and recommendation by the Plan Commission. The City Council
shall not make an amendment to this chapter without allowing for a
recommendation from the Plan Commission per the provisions of this
subsection.
(1) The Plan Commission shall schedule a reasonable time and place
for a public hearing to consider the application after the
acceptance and determination of the complete application as

appear in person, by agent, and/or by attorney. Notice of the
proposed amendment and the public hearing shall conform to the
requirements of § 660-209 of this chapter. Said notice shall contain
a description of the proposed text change. A record of such
proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the Plan
Commission shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time.
(2) After the public hearing (or within an extension of said period
requested in writing by the petitioner and granted by the Plan
Commission), the Plan Commission may make a written report to
the City Council and/or shall state in its motion or the minutes its
findings regarding Subsection E(1) above and its recommendations
regarding the application as a whole. The report, motion, and/or
minutes shall include a formal finding of facts developed and
approved by the Plan Commission concerning the requirements of

§ 660-196 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-196
1:968
(3) If the Plan Commission fails to make a report within 60 days after
the filing of said complete application [and in the absence of a
petitioner-approved extension per Subsection E(2) above] then the
City Council may hold a public hearing within 30 days after the
expiration of said sixty-day period. Failure to receive the written
report from the Plan Commission per Subsection E(1) above shall
not invalidate the proceedings or actions of the City Council. If
such a public hearing is necessary, the City Council shall provide
notice per the requirements of Subsection E(1).
(4) If the Plan Commission recommends approval of an application, it
shall state in its motion, minutes, or final written decision, its
conclusion and any finding of facts supporting its conclusion as to
the following: that the potential public benefits of the proposed
amendment outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the
proposed amendment, as identified in Subsection D(3), after taking
into consideration the proposal by the petitioner.
F. Review and action by the City Council.
(1) The City Council shall not act upon a proposed amendment to this
chapter until it shall have received a written report and
recommendation from the Plan Commission of the proposed
amendment, except that if the City Council has not received such
written report within 60 days of the submission of the proposed
amendments, it may nevertheless act upon such proposed
amendments. The Council may request further information and/or
additional reports from the Plan Commission, Zoning
Administrator, and/or the petitioner. The Council may take final
action on the application at the time of its initial meeting, or may
continue the proceedings, at the Council's or the petitioner's
request. The City Council may approve the amendment as
originally proposed, may approve the proposed amendment with
modifications (per the recommendations of the Zoning
Administrator, the Plan Commission, authorized outside experts, or
its own members), or may deny approval of the proposed
amendment. If an application for a proposed amendment is not
acted upon finally by the City Council within 90 days of the date
upon which such application is received by the City Council, it shall
be deemed to have been denied.
(2) In case of protest against such change duly signed and
acknowledged by the owners of 20% or more either of the areas of
land included in such proposed amendment, supplement or change,
or by the owners of 20% or more of the area of the land within 100
feet therefrom or by the owners of 20% or more of the land directly
opposite thereto extending 100 feet from the street frontage of
such opposite land, such amendment, supplement or change shall
not become effective except by the favorable vote of 3/4 of the
members of the City Council.
§ 660-196 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-196
1:969
§ 660-197. Zoning Map amendments.
G. Effect of denial. No application which has been denied (either wholly or

said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of
change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
H. Fee. A fee is required for this procedure.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which
govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or
denial, of proposed amendments to provisions of the Official Zoning

item, by the Zoning Administrator or Plan Commission Chair,
without an application. Prior to the submittal of the official notice
regarding the application to the newspaper by the City Clerk, the
petitioner shall provide the City Clerk with the requisite number of
copies of the complete application. Said application shall be comprised
of the following:

feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the
names and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as they
appear on the current tax records of the City of Lake Mills. Said
map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject
property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains
that control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be
§ 660-196 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-197
1:970
submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a
photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one
inch equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a
graphic scale, and a North arrow shall be provided;
(2) A map, such as the Land Use Plan or Zoning Map, of the
generalized location of the subject property in relation to the City
as a whole; and
(3) As an optional requirement, the petitioner shall provide
justification for the proposed map amendment, consisting of the
reasons why the petitioner believes the proposed map amendment
is in harmony with recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan,
particularly as evidenced by compliance with the standards set out
in Subsection D(3).
D. Review by the Zoning Administrator. The proposed amendment to the
Official Zoning Map shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator as
follows:
(1) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application
is complete and fulfills the requirements of this chapter. If the
Zoning Administrator determines that the application is not
complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this section, he
shall return the application to the petitioner. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that the application is complete, he shall
so notify the petitioner.
(2) Upon notifying the petitioner that his application is complete, the
Zoning Administrator shall review the application and evaluate and
comment on the written justification for the proposed map
amendment provided in the application per Subsection C(3).
(3) The Zoning Administrator may also evaluate the application to
determine whether the proposed Zoning Map amendment is in
harmony with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan,
particularly as evidenced by compliance with the standards below:
(a) The proposed Official Zoning Map amendment furthers the
purposes of this chapter as outlined in § 660-3 and the
applicable rules and regulations of the WDNR and FEMA.
(b) The following factors have arisen that are not properly
addressed on the current Official Zoning Map:
[1] The destinations of the Official Zoning Map should be
brought into conformity with the Comprehensive Plan;
[2] A mistake was made in mapping on the Official Zoning
Map;
[3] Factors have changed (such as the availability of new data,
the presence of new roads or other infrastructure,
§ 660-197 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-197
1:971
additional development, annexation, or other zoning
changes) making the subject property more appropriate
for a different zoning district; or
[4] Growth patterns or rates have changed, thereby creating

floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on
the regional flood elevation.
[b] If any part of the proposed development is in the
floodway, it must be added to the base model to show
the difference between existing and proposed
conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients
remain the same as in the existing model, unless
adequate justification based on standard accepted
engineering practices is provided.

(post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the
existing model and any proposed changes to the
topography caused by the proposed development. This
model shall reflect proposed conditions.
[e] All changes to the duplicate effective model and
subsequent models must be supported by certified
topographic information, bridge plans, construction
plans and survey notes.
[f] Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to
the stream reach for which the revision is being
requested. Cross-sections upstream and downstream
of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations
and top widths computed by the revised models
matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The
effective model shall not be truncated.
[3] Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be
submitted to the Department for review which meet the
following conditions:

(2) Who may appeal. Any petitioner, permittee, landowner, or land user
may appeal any order, decision or determination made by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer in administering § 660-143 and this
section. [Amended 12-19-1989 by Ord. No. 570]
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to specify the requirements and
procedures for the review and approval of site plan applications. The
provisions of this section are designed to ensure that all proposed land
use and development activity complies with the requirements of this
chapter. Specifically, this section requires that the initiation of all
development activity (including building permits, zoning certificates,
occupancy permits for a change of use of an existing lot or structure
where there is contemplated a site plan revision, clear cutting, grading
or filling) require the approval of building, site, and operational plans
by the City before the building, occupancy, and building permits can be
issued  except, however, that development activity associated with an
approved final plat of subdivision for single-family and/or duplex/twin
home dwelling units, and development activity associated with the full
and complete implementation of a project approved within the PIP
phase of the planned development (PDD) is exempt from this
requirement.
B. Applicability of this section.
(1) The procedures to be followed in this section shall be applicable to
design, building and operational plans for all construction or
external remodeling or enlargement of any primary or accessory
structure, if such construction or external remodeling requires a
building permit, and if such development activity is located within
the B1, B2, PB, R3-12, I1, I2, or PI Zoning Districts, unless said
district specifically provides for an exemption from either site plan
approval or administrative design review.
(2) If the regulations contained elsewhere within this chapter require a
site plan approval or design review procedure of any kind prior to
initiating any construction or remodeling or enlargement activity of
any structure whatsoever, this sectionshall supersede such
procedural requirements contained within those other provisions,
and this sectionshall be the exclusive procedural requirement for
applying for and receiving any site plan or design review approval.
(3) If the regulations contained elsewhere within this chapter require a
site plan approval or design review procedure of any kind, the
substantive standards for landscaping, open space, parking,
screening, lighting, building materials or any other similar
requirement that is of a substantive, rather than purely procedural
§ 660-201 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-205
1:991
nature, then those substantive requirements shall continue to be
applicable, but the process for review shall be exclusively those
procedural requirements contained in this section.
C. Review process/procedure.
(1) Initiation of request for BSO plan approval. Procedures for
approval of a BSO plan shall be initiated by the owner(s) of the
subject property, or their legally authorized representative(s).
(2) Preapplication meeting. The petitioner is encouraged, but not
required, to first meet with the City Manager, planning consultant,
engineering consultant, and other applicable City staff to discuss
preliminary concepts and plans for the development. Guidance will
be provided to the petitioner on technical requirements and
procedures, and a timetable for project review may be discussed.
(3) Application requirements. Petitioner shall submit a complete BSO
plan application as outlined in Subsection F below for BSO
submittal requirements for City staff review, accompanied by all
fees and deposits which from time to time may be adopted by the
City Council and in effect at the time of submittal.
(4) City staff review. The City Manager, or designee, shall review the
application and submitted plans to determine whether the
development complies with the provisions of this chapter. As part of
its review, the City Manager may consult with other City staff,
consultants, the Plan Commission and officials of the City, county,
state, fire and emergency medical services departments, or other
agencies. The City staff review may be combined with related Plan
Commission reviews for rezoning, conditional use permit, land
division, or other land use approvals. The City Manager or his
designee shall reserve the right to defer decision regarding a BSO
plan to the Plan Commission for review and approval.
(5) Time frame. The administrative review shall not be conducted until
the planning consultant has received a complete application. After
the application is certified as complete, the review of the submitted
application shall be completed within 20 working days of
application certification.
D. Appeal.
(1) To Plan Commission. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the
decision of the City Manager, the petitioner may apply within 30
days after the decision is issued to the Plan Commission for a
review of that decision. The Plan Commission of the City of Lake
Mills shall hear such appeals and issue a written decision with
respect to the appeal within 30 days after receipt of the appeal.
(2) To the City Council. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the decision
of the Plan Commission, the petitioner may apply within 30 days

after the decision is issued to the City Council for a review of that
decision. The City Council of the City of Lake Mills shall hear such
appeals and issue a written decision with respect to the appeal
within 30 days after receipt of the appeal.
E. Project commencement. No building permit shall be issued and no
development project under the jurisdiction of this section shall
commence construction until the Zoning Enforcement Officer has
received, in writing, approval of the application and submitted plans (or
Plan Commission or City Council approval if the decision was appealed)
from the City Manager, and all conditions of approval that reasonably
could have been satisfied have in fact been satisfied. The property
owner shall be responsible for installing and maintaining all site
improvements in conformance with the approved plans and all
conditions.

all applications filed after the date of adoption and publication.
H. Fee. A fee, as established by the City Council from time to time, shall be
required for this procedure.
A. Purpose and intent.
(1) Purpose. Planned developments are designed to forward both the
aesthetic and economic development objectives of the City by
adhering to standards consistent with sound land use and urban
design and by controlling the site design and the appearance,
density or intensity of development in terms of more flexible
requirements for land uses, density, intensity, bulk, landscaping,
and parking requirements. In exchange for such flexibility, the
planned development shall provide a much higher level of site
design, architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and
§ 660-205 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-206
1:995
functional excellence than is normally required for other
developments.
(2) Intent. Planned Development Overlay District regulations are
intended to permit greater flexibility and, consequently, more
creative and imaginative design for the development of a site than
is possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is further
intended to promote more economical and efficient use of land
while providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a higher
level of amenities, adequate buffering between adjacent uses, and
preservation of the natural qualities of open spaces. The planned
development procedure requires a high degree of cooperation
between the developer and the City. The procedure described
herein is designed to give the developer general plan approval
before completing all detailed design work while providing the City
with assurances that the project will retain the character
envisioned at the time of approval.
(3) PDDs are required to meet certain procedural requirements
applicable only to PDDs, in addition to the general requirements of
this chapter. A public hearing process is required to review a
request for a PDD. This process shall essentially combine the
process for a Zoning Map amendment with that required for a
special use, with several additional requirements.
B. Initiation of request for amendment of Chapter 660, Zoning.
Proceedings for amendment of this chapter may be initiated by any one
of the following methods:
(1) An application by any member of the general public;
(2) A recommendation of the City staff;
(3) A recommendation of the Plan Commission; or
(4) By action of the City Council.
C. Application requirements. All applications for proposed planned
development districts, regardless of the party of their initiation per
Subsection B above, shall be approved as complete by the City
Manager. The City Manager shall forward copies of said complete
application to the office of the City Clerk. Said application shall apply to
each of the process steps in Subsection D below.
D. Procedure.
(1) Preapplication conference. The petitioner shall contact the Zoning
Administrator to place an informal discussion item for a planned
development on the Plan Commission agenda. No details beyond
the name of the petitioner and the identification of the discussion
item as a PD is required to be given in the agenda. At the Plan
Commission meeting, the petitioner shall engage in an informal
§ 660-206 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-206
1:996
discussion with the Plan Commission regarding the potential
planned development. Appropriate topics for discussion may
include the location of the PD, general project themes and images,
the general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses being
considered, approximate residential densities and nonresidential
intensities, the general treatment of natural features, the general
relationship to nearby properties and public streets, and
relationship to the Comprehensive Plan. Points of discussion and
conclusions reached in this stage of the process shall be in no way
binding upon the petitioner or the City, but should be considered as
the informal, nonbinding basis for proceeding to the next step.
(2) Concept plan. The petitioner shall provide the Zoning
Administrator with a draft planned development concept plan for a
determination of completeness prior to placing the proposed
planned development on the Plan Commission agenda for concept
plan review. This submittal shall contain all of the following items,
prior to its acceptance by the Zoning Administrator and placement
of the item on a Plan Commission agenda for concept plan review:
(a) Legal description of the subject property.
(b) A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at 11
inches by 17 inches, as depicted on a copy of the City of Lake
Mills Land Use Plan;
(c) A general written description of the proposed Planned
Development District, including:
[1] General project themes and images;
[2] The general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses;
[3] Approximate residential densities and nonresidential
intensities as described by dwelling units per acre, floor
area ratio and impervious surface area ratio;
[4] The general treatment of natural features;
[5] The general relationship to nearby properties and public
streets;
[6] The general relationship of the project to the
Comprehensive Plan;
[7] An initial draft list of zoning standards which will not be
met by the proposed PDD and the location(s) in which they
apply and, a complete list of zoning standards which will
be more than met by the proposed PDD and the location(s)
in which they apply. The purpose of this listing shall be to
provide the City staff with information necessary to
determine the relative merits of the project in regard to
private benefit versus public benefit and in regard to the
§ 660-206 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-206
1:997
mitigation of potential adverse impacts created by design
flexibility.
(d) A written description of potentially requested exemptions from
the requirements of the underlying zoning district, in the
following order:
[1] Land use exemptions;
[2] Density and intensity exemptions;
[3] Bulk exemptions;
[4] Landscaping exceptions;
[5] Parking and loading requirement exceptions.
(e) A conceptual plan drawing (at 11 inches by 17 inches) of
general land use layout and general location of major public
streets and/or private drives. Petitioner may submit copies of a
larger version of the plan in addition to the eleven-inch-byseventeen-
inch reduction.
(f) At the Plan Commission meeting, the petitioner shall engage in
an informal discussion regarding the PDD concept plan
submittal. Appropriate topics for discussion may include any of
the information provided in the PDD concept plan submittal or
other items as determined by the Plan Commission.
(g) Points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of
the process shall in no way be binding upon petitioner or the
City, but should be considered as informal, nonbinding basis
for proceeding to the next step. The preferred procedure is for
one or more iterations of City staff review of the concept plan
to occur prior to introduction of the formal rezoning petition
which accompanies general development plan (GDP)
application.
(3) General development plan (GDP). The petitioner shall provide the
Zoning Administrator with a draft GDP plan submittal for a
determination of completeness prior to placing the proposal on the
Plan Commission agenda for review.
(a) The submittal shall contain all of the following items, with the
number of copies to be determined by the Zoning
Administrator, prior to its acceptance by the Zoning
Administrator and placement of the item on a Plan Commission
agenda for review:
[1] Legal description of the subject property.
§ 660-206 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-206

current records of the Register of Deeds of Jefferson
County (as provided by the City of Lake Mills). Said map
shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject
property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which
maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and
attachments shall be at a reasonable scale. All lot
dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a
North arrow shall be provided.
[4] A general written description of proposed Planned
Development District, including:
[a] General project themes and images;

recommendations and the City Council in making its
determination shall give consideration and satisfy themselves
as to the following:
[1] That the proposed development is consistent with the
spirit and intent of these regulations and produces
significant benefits in terms of improved environmental
design sufficient to justify the application of the "Planned
Development District" concept.
[2] That the site development plan reflects proper
consideration of the natural features of the site, with
particular concern for preservation of open space and
careful grading to ensure proper drainage and
conservation of natural features.
[3] That the general character of the development produces
an attractive environment appropriate to the intensity of
uses proposed and which is compatible with existing
developments in the surrounding area, and with general
community development plans and policies.
[4] That the development can be provided with appropriate
municipal services or their equivalent in private services.
§ 660-206 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-206
1:1003
[5] That proposed design standards provide adequately for
practical operation and maintenance of circulation,
parking, emergency services, delivery services, and
snowplowing.
[6] That the proponents of the proposed development have
demonstrated that they intend to start construction within
a reasonable period following the approval of the project
and requested overlay of the PDD District, that the project
appears economically sound, that a surety/proof of
financing is provided to the City, and that the development
will be carried out according to a reasonable construction
schedule satisfactory to the City.
[7] That the proposed development is consistent in all
respects to the spirit and intent of this chapter, is in
conformity with the general plans for community
development, would not be contrary to the general welfare
and economic prosperity of the City or of the immediate
neighborhood, that the specific development plans have
been prepared with competent professional advice and
guidance, and that the benefits and improved design of the
resultant development justifies the variation from the
normal requirements of this chapter through the
application of the PDD District.
(b) In the case of proposed residential developments:
[1] That such development will create an attractive residential
environment of sustained desirability and economic
stability, compatible with the character established for the
area by the community's Comprehensive Plan, and where
the economic impact of the development in terms of
income levels, property values, and service demands is at
least as beneficial to the community as that which could be
anticipated under the base zoning.
[2] The population composition of the development will not
alter adversely the impact upon school or other municipal
service requirements as anticipated under the existing
basic zoning and Comprehensive Plan.
[3] That the total average residential density of the project
will be compatible with the Comprehensive Plan.
[4] That the aggregate open space of the development will be
no less, than would have resulted from the application of
open space requirements of the previous district.
[5] That adequate guarantee is provided for permanent
retention as "open space area" of the residual open land
area resulting from the application of these regulations,
§ 660-206 LAKE MILLS CODE § 660-206
1:1004
either by private reservation for the use of the residents
within the development or by dedication to the public.
[6] Ownership, maintenance, and tax liability of private open
space reservation shall be established in a manner
acceptable to the municipality and made a part of the
conditions of the plan approval.
(c) In the case of proposed PDD Planned Development District
Overlays for commercial developments:
[1] That the economic practicality of the proposed
development can be justified on the basis of purchasing
potential, competitive relationship and demonstrated
tenant interest.
[2] That the proposed development will be adequately served
by off-street parking and truck service facilities.
[3] That the locations for entrances and exits have been
designed to prevent unnecessary interference with the
safe and efficient movement of traffic on surrounding
streets, and that the development will not create an effect
upon the general traffic pattern of the area incompatible
with that anticipated under the Comprehensive Plan.
[4] That the architectural design, landscaping, control of
lighting, and general site development will result in an
attractive and harmonious service area compatible with
and not creating an effect upon the property values of the
surrounding neighborhood incompatible with that
anticipated under the Comprehensive Plan.
(d) In the case of mixed-use developments:
[1] That the proposed mixture of uses produces a unified
composite which is compatible to itself and which as a
total developmental entity is compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood and consistent with the general
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
[2] That the various types of uses conform to the general
requirements as herein set forth applicable to projects of
such use and character.
E. Determination of the City Council.
(1) The City Council, after due consideration and recommendation by
the Plan Commission, may deny the petition, approve the petition
as submitted or approve the petition subject to additional
conditions. A PDD may only be approved by an ordinance adopted
by the City Council. Any ordinance approving a Planned
Development District shall specify the special conditions and
§ 660-206 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 660-206
1:1005
restrictions imposed on the PDD and shall include the development
plan and plat of subdivision, provided that a plat or re-division or
consolidation may be approved by the City Council as part of the
PDD and must be recorded before permits may be issued. Said
ordinance shall further contain a legal description of the property
subject to such PDD and said ordinance shall be recorded in the
office of the Register of Deeds of Jefferson County before any
permits may be obtained.
(2) The approval of a petition and resulting amendment of the Zoning
Map to include the PDD District shall be based on and include
conditions to comply with the building, site and operational (BSO)
plans for the development. The development as approved by the
City Council shall be mapped and recorded as specified by
§ 660-206. Such plans, however, need not necessarily be
completely detailed at the time of zoning provided they are of
sufficient detail to satisfy the Plan Commission and City Council as
to the general character, scope, and appearance of the proposed
development as outlined in the GDP.
(3) No permits, as outlined in § 660-187, Zoning permit, shall be
approved or issued for any use or construction activity in a Planned
Development District without final approval of a PIP by ordinance
of the City Council.
F. Conditions and restrictions.
(1) The Plan Commission may recommend, and the City Council may
adopt by resolution, conditions, and restrictions for planned
developments that specify permitted uses, set bulk regulations and
density standards for lot coverage and dwelling unit size and
distribution, and yard setbacks. The Plan Commission, and the
Public Works Board, when applicable, may recommend, and the
City Council may adopt by ordinance, such permissible
modifications to Chapter 660, Zoning, that are applicable to the
PDD/GDP and the PDD/PIP.
(2) The developer shall enter into a developer's agreement with the
City to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including
any conditions and restrictions adopted to regulate a specific
planned development, and to assure the construction of all facilities
and infrastructure associated with the project.
(3) No building permit shall be issued until all applicable fees and
assessments have been paid and either all public construction has
been completed and approved, or a developer's agreement has
been approved and executed and a bond has been posted. For
staged development, such developer's agreements may provide for
the construction of improvements and the use of common areas
outside of the subject stage.

perform maintenance functions, such as snow and ice removal,
weed cutting, or trash disposal, the City shall have the right to
perform such functions or to contract for their accomplishment at
the property owner's expense.
G. Changes or revisions.
(1) All proposed changes, revisions and additions to any aspect of an
approved planned development project shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator for his review. The Zoning Administrator
shall determine whether the change, revision or addition is minor
or if it materially affects the intended design of the project and the
impact of the project on neighboring uses.
(2) If the requested change is determined by the Zoning Administrator
to be substantial, because of its effect on the intended design of the
project or on neighboring uses, a public hearing, subject to the
notice requirements of a conditional use request, shall be held by
the Plan Commission to review and pass its findings to the City
Council for final approval.
(3) If the change is determined to be minor, the Zoning Administrator
shall review the request and may approve the change without a
public hearing.
(4) If the City Council approves any substantial or material change, an
ordinance shall be passed and any necessary amendments to any
developer's agreement(s) shall be executed prior to the developer
proceeding with implementation of any approved change or
modification.
