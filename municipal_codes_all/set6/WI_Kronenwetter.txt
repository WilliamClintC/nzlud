Editor's Note: This article also repealed former Art. II, Post-Construction Stormwater Management,adopted 12-22-2008 (Ch. 59, Art.
I
, of the 2004 Code), as amended.
§ 270-16. Authority.
This article is adopted by the Kronenwetter Village Board under the authority granted by § 61.354,Wis. Stats. This article supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under§ 62.23, Wis. Stats., that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwisespecified in § 62.234, Wis. Stats., § 62.23, Wis. Stats., applies to this article and to anyamendments to this article.
The provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of thesame governing body.
The Village of Kronenwetter hereby designates the Director of Public Works or his/her designee toadminister and enforce the provisions of this article.
The requirements of this article do not preempt more stringent stormwater managementrequirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals,including those authorized under §§ 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resources under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
§ 270-17. Findings of fact.
The Village of Kronenwetter finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impactupon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes thepublic enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can:
Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing streambank erosion, increasing streambed scour,diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing streamtemperature.
Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and watersupply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavymetals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads.
Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities.
Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks andvolumes.
Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.

Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish long-term, post-construction runoffmanagement requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and theaquatic environment. Specific purposes are to:
Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion;prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; controlbuilding sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenicbeauty; and promote sound economic growth.
Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving waterbodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportationof particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property.
Intent. It is the intent of the Village of Kronenwetter that this article regulates post-constructionstormwater discharges to waters of the state. This article may be applied on a site-by-site basis.The Village of Kronenwetter recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving thestormwater performance standards set forth in this article is through the preparation andimplementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that coverhydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans mayprescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed totreat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans arein conformance with the performance standards developed under § 281.16, Wis. Stats., forregional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the Village ofKronenwetter, it is the intent of this article that the approved plan be used to identifypostconstruction management measures acceptable for the community.
§ 270-19. Applicability and jurisdiction.

are considered to be minimum guidelines. Consideration may be given to access locations where site-specific restrictions, both environmental and built, may limit compliance with these standards. Exceptfor cases of special approved variance with the Village, corner lots and lots that adjoin multipleroadways shall only be granted access to the roadway with the lower functional classification. Theseparation of access points is measured from the center line of the approach.
Residential access.
The standards set forth serve only as minimum separation distance required between accesspoints. The Village staff shall recommend separate standards where limitations exist on a site.These spacing standards should apply to all driveways, under their functional classification,within the Village. Spacing distances shall be determined from center line to center line of theaccess point, as measured from the end of the paved or impervious surface.
These requirements intend that with posted speeds, access points will align or offset at thesuggested distance or greater from all existing or proposed access points.
Principal arterial access. The Village identifies arterial roadways as interstate, freeways, orexpressways. Private access is prohibited on these roadways by the Wisconsin Department ofTransportation and the Federal Highway Commission.
Minor arterial access.
No more than one access shall be permitted or provided to an individual parcel with publicroad frontage. Except for cases of special approved variance with the Village.
All private accesses, intersecting public roadways and other direct access to minor arterialVillage roadways shall be separated by a minimum of 1,000 feet.
All accesses must be surfaced with pavement.
Collector access.
No more than one access shall be permitted or provided to an individual parcel with publicroad frontage. Except for cases of special approved variance with the Village.
All private accesses, intersecting public roadways and other direct access to minor collectorroadways shall be separated by a minimum of 500 feet.
All accesses must be surfaced with pavement.
Local urban access.
No more than one access shall be permitted or provided to an individual parcel with publicroad frontage. Except for cases of special approved variance with the Village.
All private accesses, intersecting public roadways and other direct access to any local urbanaccess roadway shall be separated by a minimum of 70 feet.
All private accesses off of a paved road must be surfaced with pavement. Private accessesoff a gravel road may be constructed of gravel.
Local rural access.
No more than one access shall be permitted or provided to an individual parcel with publicroad frontage except for cases of special approved variance with the Village.

All private accesses off of a paved road must be surfaced with pavement. Private accessesoff a gravel road may be constructed of gravel.
Commercial/industrial success.
The appropriate separation distance is dependent upon several criteria, including:
The posted speed limit and design speed of the roadway;
The design vehicle anticipated to use the approach;
Daily use levels; and
The width and turning radius of the access.
Commercial and industrial access points shall be limited to access points necessary to servethe property and shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator and Plan Commission throughthe site plan review process.
Commercial and industrial access points shall be constructed to support Standard AASHTOWB-67 design vehicle. Interconnected driveways and parking lots are encouraged incommercial and industrial developments.
One direct access point to a roadway will be permitted for each commercial or industrialproperty.
Contingent upon the site plan approval, a multiaccess, looping route may be permittedwhere seen fit in supporting the needs of the establishment.
Increased separation distances may be allowed or required by the exercise of reasonablejudgment of the Zoning Administrator and/or Director of Public Works.
Agricultural and recreational driveway access.
Access to agricultural land or any other nonresidential land use where oversize vehicles mayenter the roadway right-of-way shall be considered in this classification. The owner shallprovide an access design consistent with adopted roadway design standards. The accessshall be designed for the largest vehicle anticipated to use the access. All agricultural andrecreational driveway access off of a paved roadway must provide a minimum of a gravelapproach extending from the existing roadway surface to the right-of-way line.
The driveway access must comply with Village of Kronenwetter General Code Ordinance§

in regards to depositing debris onto the public roadway. The owner retains the optionof installing a tracking pad to ensure debris is removed prior to accessing the public right-of-way.
§ 419-15. Roadway access control.
By enforcing standards on access points to public and private property, the following guidelinesestablish levels of access control based on the functional classification of the Village roadways. Thefunctional classification accounts for use levels, potential conflicts, urban and rural landscapes,amongst other elements. In general, it is intended to separate access points from each other as muchas possible. These are considered to be minimum guidelines. Consideration may be given to locationswhere site-specific restrictions, both environmental and built, may limit compliance with thesestandards. The access should serve as many parcels as possible to reduce the demand for additionalpublic roadways and for additional direct access to Village roadways. The separation of access pointsis measured from the center line of the approach.

When the State of Wisconsin returns the approved Assessor's plat map, the Village Clerkshall publish a notice in the local newspaper advising the public the plat will be displayed atthe Village Hall for 30 days for public inspection. During this thirty-day inspection period, theowner of any parcel within the Assessor's plat may file an objection or request for correctionwith the Village Clerk. The Village Board cannot approve the Assessor's plat for record untilany such objections are satisfied by stipulation of the owners, or judgment of a court ofrecord, should a suit for correction be filed by any owner.
Upon completion of the foregoing procedures and final approval of the Assessor's plat by theVillage Board, the plat shall be delivered to the surveyor in order that he or she may record itwith the Register of Deeds. A copy of the approved final plat shall be provided by the Villagethrough the Village Engineer's office to all affected property owners without charge.
Costs of Assessor's plat. The Village contracts with a registered land surveyor to performAssessor's plat surveys for a specified amount per lot or parcel. The Village shall share the costwith each property owner on a fifty-fifty basis. The Village may levy a special assessment againstthe property for Assessor's plat surveys. The special assessment is computed at a specific chargeper $1,000 of land valuation excluding buildings and improvements as required by WisconsinStatutes.
Any land parcel or lot in the Village, which has been surveyed, and recorded on a subdivisionplat or certified survey map and for which monuments or stakes exist, will be included in anAssessor's plat survey without charge to the property owner;
If any land parcel or lot is a part of an old recorded subdivision plat or a certified survey mapwhich has evident errors, lacks sufficient monuments or stakes do not exist, the lot or lotsinvolved will be included in the Assessor's plat survey and the property owner will be chargeda special assessment;
The Village will invoice each property owner involved for his share of the surveying cost as aspecial assessment upon the recording of the final Assessor's plat.
Responsibilities of the certified land surveyor.
It is the primary responsibility of the surveyor performing the Assessor's plat survey to locateproperty corners in conformity with record deeds wherever possible. If any property corners orlines located by deed description do not fit existing property improvements, the surveyor mustcooperate with the adjoining owners to locate a property line which is acceptable by mutualagreement between them. After completion of the staking of each land parcel, the surveyorprepares an Assessor's plat or map of his or her survey. This plat or map is then recorded inthe Marathon County Register of Deeds office as an official record document after it has beenapproved by the State of Wisconsin and the Village. After recording, each land parcelcontained within the plat or map is referred thereafter by a lot number of such plat,notwithstanding some other description on the deed for the parcel. The record deeds arecross-referenced on the recorded plat for each parcel surveyed.
Chapter 59, Wis. Stats., provides any land surveyor, retained by an individual or corporationto perform a survey, must file a true and correct map or plat of such survey in the office of thecounty surveyor within 60 days of its completion. Such law also provides that while engagedin surveying, the land surveyor and his assistants shall not be liable for trespass upon anyprivate property, but shall be liable for any actual damage done to the land or property, suchas cutting of trees, without the permission of the owner.

The Village Board hereby acknowledges that certain issues arise in condominium developmentsthat require limited applicability of this chapter to condominium developments. The StateLegislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums, but thatsubdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from thoseimposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium.
A condominium development is the creation of multiple, distinct property entities at or near theground surface, subject to property taxation as separate parcels, with each property entity havingdifferent ownership and management in accordance with Ch. 703, Wis. Stats. The Villagedetermines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar, both physically and inownership, from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership,management and control.
The Village Board finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on communityresources in the same manner as other new developments which are characterized by division ofland into lots. These impacts include:
Additional population density.
Possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the land's characteristics.
Additional demands upon Village parks, recreation areas, utility facilities and schools.
Additional traffic and street use.
Condominium developments shall comply with Ch. 703, Wis. Stats., the provisions of this chapter,including plat approval, and, where appropriate, Chapter
520
, Zoning, of the Code of the Village ofKronenwetter.
§ 460-22. Cemetery plats.
Cemetery plats shall comply with Wis. Stats. § 157.07, the provisions of this chapter and, whereappropriate, Chapter
520
, Zoning.
§ 460-23. Standardized address system.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to assist the ambulance, Fire and Police Departments toquickly locate correct addresses at which to provide emergency services by requiring numbers tobe placed in prominently visible locations on buildings.
Specifications.
Display requirement. The standard assigned number shall be placed on every house andbuilding in the Village.
Number assignment. Street numbers for dwelling units and places of business on all publicand private streets shall be assigned by the Village Zoning Administrator in accordance withthe Village address guide.
Address baselines. The baseline for north-south streets is the Kronenwetter-Knowlton-Guenther Townline. Address numbers increase to the north. The baseline for east-weststreets is the Wisconsin River. Address numbers increase to the east.
Address range. Each address one-hundred block shall be the quarter mile or a change inaddress for every 26 feet.

Communications tower.
Communications tower uses include all freestanding broadcasting, receiving, or relaystructures, and similar principal land uses; and any office, studio, or other land uses directlyrelated to the function of the tower. See land use descriptions and regulations associated withexterior communication devices regulated as accessory uses later in this section, where,unlike communications towers, the communications use is clearly incidental to the principaluse on the site. It is the policy of the Village to encourage the placement of communicationsdevices on preexisting towers and other support structures (e.g., water towers) over theerection of new communications towers.
Performance standards:
Each application for a conditional use permit, site plan approval, and/or building permitunder this subsection shall include the following information:
The name and business address of, and the contact individual for, the applicant.
The location of the proposed or affected communications tower or other supportstructure.
The location of the proposed equipment and network components, includingantennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling, andassociated equipment.
If the application is for a substantial modification to an existing communicationstower or other support structure, a construction plan which describes the proposedmodifications to the support structure and the equipment and network components,including antennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling,and related equipment associated with the proposed modifications. For purposes ofthis Subsection
C
, "substantial modification" means the modification of acommunications tower, including the mounting of an antenna on such a structure,that does any of the following:
For structures with an overall height of 200 feet or less, increases the overallheight of the structure by more than 20 feet.
For structures with an overall height of more than 200 feet, increases the overallheight of the structure by 10% or more.
Measured at the level of the appurtenance added to the structure as a result ofthe modification, increases the width of the support structure by 20 feet or more,unless a larger area is necessary for co-location.
Increases the square footage of an existing equipment compound to a total areaof more than 2,500 square feet.
If the application is to construct a new communications tower, a construction planwhich describes the proposed mobile service support structure and the equipmentand network components, including antennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations,power supplies, cabling, and related equipment to be placed on or around the newmobile service support structure.

over the placement of the mobile service support structure attesting that co-locationwithin the applicant's search ring would not result in the same mobile servicefunctionality, coverage, and capacity; is technically infeasible; or is economicallyburdensome to the mobile service provider.
Evidence and information to indicate compliance or intent to obtain compliance withother applicable provisions of this subsection and chapter.
Each communications tower and modification thereto shall be erected and installed inaccordance with the State Electrical Code adopted by reference in the National ElectricalCode, Federal Communications Commission and the instructions of the manufacturer. Incases of conflict, the stricter requirements shall govern.
If an application is to construct a new communications tower, the Village may consult witha third party to verify that co-location on an existing communication tower or othersupport structure within the applicant's search ring would not result in the same mobileservice functionality, coverage, and capacity; is technically infeasible; or is economicallyburdensome to the mobile service provider. All costs and expenses associated with suchconsultation shall be borne by the applicant, except for travel expenses. Failure to paysuch costs and expenses or provide related information to the third-party consultant shallbe grounds for denial of the conditional use permit.
Each communications tower shall be placed or constructed so it can be utilized for theco-location of additional antenna arrays to the extent technologically and economicallyfeasible. The Village shall, unless it is shown to be unreasonable, condition the grantingof each conditional use permit upon the applicant placing or constructing thecommunications tower to accommodate, at a minimum height of 150 feet, the co-locationof two additional antenna arrays similar in size and function to that placed on the towerby the applicant. Co-location sites need not be available on the tower as initially placed orconstructed, provided that the tower will support the later addition of the required numberof co-location sites at the specified minimum height. The holder of each conditional usepermit under this Subsection
C
and the predecessor chapter shall make the co-locationsites required hereunder available for the placement of technologically compatibleantenna arrays and equipment upon contractual provisions that are standard in theindustry and at prevailing market rates allowing the permit holder to recoup the cost ofproviding the co-location sites and a fair return on investment.
Each communications tower and associated equipment shall, to the extent determinedpossible by the Zoning Administrator, be installed in a fashion to lessen the visualimpacts of such installation.
For communications towers erected after the effective date of this chapter, and inconjunction with the installation of new ground-mounted buildings or equipment totaling300 square feet or greater, the applicant shall provide a buffer yard meeting therequirements of §
520-79C(4)
along all property borders abutting residentially zonedproperty. Other landscaping requirements of Article
XI
shall also apply.
A new or amended conditional use permit and site plan shall be required for a substantialmodification to an existing communications tower. Neither a conditional use permit norsite plan approval shall be required for any modification, including co-location, that is notdefined as a "substantial modification," but a building permit shall be required.
Prior to the issuance of a building permit for a communications tower erected after theeffective date of this chapter, the applicant shall provide a written agreement stating thatif the communications tower, antennas, or transmitters are unused for a period exceeding12 months, the applicant shall remove the tower, antennas, or transmitters upon writtenrequest from the Zoning Administrator at no cost to the Village within 60 days of suchrequest. If such listed items are not removed within 60 days of such notification, the

A performance bond or deposit of$20,000 shall be required to ensure compliance with all applicable requirements forremoval of the communications tower and equipment.
The owner of any communications tower shall maintain insurance against liability forpersonal injury, death, or property damage caused by the maintenance and/or operationof the communications tower and accessory structures with a single combined limit of notless than $1,000,000 per occurrence. The policy shall contain a provision that it may notbe canceled or materially modified without the approval of the Village. The owner shallprovide the Village with a certificate of such insurance before issuance of a buildingpermit and upon each policy renewal thereafter.
Upon written inquiry from the Village, the recipient of a conditional use permit under thisSubsection
C
shall have the burden of presenting credible evidence establishing thecontinued compliance with the approved plans and all conditions placed upon theconditional use permit. Failure to establish compliance with the approved plans and allconditions placed upon the conditional use permit shall be grounds for revocation of thepermit. If the Village determines that it is necessary to consult with a third party toascertain compliance with conditions on a conditional use permit, all costs and expensesassociated with such consultation shall be borne by the holder of subject conditional usepermit, except for travel expenses. Failure to pay such costs and expenses or provideinformation requested by the Village shall be grounds for revocation of the conditionaluse permit.
Upon written inquiry from the Village, any owner or operator of a communications towershall provide information on the tower, including but not limited to available sites on thetower for potential co-locators; evidence that such co-location sites are in fact availablefor the placement of technologically compatible antenna arrays and equipment uponcontractual provisions that are standard in the industry and at prevailing market ratesallowing the tower owner to recoup the cost of providing the co-location sites and a fairreturn on investment; contact information for future co-location inquiries that the Villagemay receive; and number and placement of antenna arrays and ground-mountedequipment, type of service provided (e.g., 4G LTE, etc.), contact information, andexpiration dates of user agreements or leases associated with all current users of thetower.
In its evaluation of any permit or plan approval for a communications tower, theapplicable limitations under §§ 66.0404(4) and 66.0406(2), Wis. Stats., shall apply.
Minimum required off-street parking: one space per each employee vehicle needed forongoing maintenance.

Geothermal energy system (GES).
A geothermal energy system (GES) is a central heating and/or cooling system that uses themoderate temperatures of subsurface ground or a body of water to assist with the heating orcooling of a building or a building's water. A GES requires an underground heat exchanger, inthe form of a network of underground or underwater pipes or tubes filled with a liquid medium(refrigerant, water mixed with antifreeze, or water). The liquid medium within the heatexchanger is transferred between a structure and the heat exchanger via pumps. In an openloop GES, groundwater or surface water is continuously drawn from an outside sourcethrough the heat exchanger pipes and discharged after use. In a closed loop GES, the systemis designed so that heat exchanger fluid does not come in direct contact with soils,groundwater, or surface water.
Performance standards:
Mechanical pumps used to move water between heat exchanger structures shall belocated entirely within principal or accessory structures.
Underground GES pipes or tubes shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from any lotline, public right-of-way, buried utility line, utility easement, and permanently protectednatural resource area.
Underground GESs shall comply with state requirements regarding setbacks from privateor public water wells.
Earthmoving or drilling activities associated with installation or maintenance of theunderground element of GES heat exchangers shall comply with applicable erosioncontrol requirements.
Installation of a GES within the WHP Wellhead Protection Area Overlay District shall beallowed subject to review and approval by the Director of Public Works and inaccordance with all applicable licensing and permit requirements.

§ 520-39. AH Airport Height Limitation Overlay District.
Description and purpose. The AH Airport Height Limitation Overlay District is intended to regulatethe height of structures relative to air travel associated with the Central Wisconsin Airport, in orderto protect the public health, safety, and welfare of airport users and residents and employeeswithin the surrounding area. In addition to the standards in this section, lands within the AH Districtmay also be subject to the regulations set forth in Marathon County Airport Height Ordinance.
AH Airport Height Limitation Overlay District boundaries. The AH District extends to many areasunder the geographic jurisdiction of this chapter, limiting the height and use of structures withinsuch jurisdiction. As such, the AH District is not shown on the Village's Official Zoning Map and/orOfficial Overlay Zoning Map. Instead, the map listed in Subsection
C(1)
serves as the heightlimitation zoning map.
AH Airport Height Limitation Overlay District requirements.
The maximum height above mean sea level of all new or expanded structures shall be asindicated on the Central Wisconsin Airport Height Map prepared by Marathon County, basedon elevation data ordinated from the Wisconsin Bureau of Aeronautics Map dated September7, 1999, as from time to time amended. The Zoning Administrator may permit a greater heightthan specified by such map, if such greater height is favorably recommended by the Bureauof Aeronautics. This requirement shall not be applied retroactively to any structure lawfullyerected before December 29, 1971, except if a subsequent vertical expansion of such astructure is sought.
Prior to issuing or authorizing a zoning permit or building permit, the Zoning Administratormay require any information deemed necessary to make a determination regardingcompliance with the requirements of AH District (such as exact height, location, and currentand finished ground elevation of the structure) and/or refer the application to the airport owneror operator or the Wisconsin Bureau of Aeronautics for recommendation. If the ZoningAdministrator elects to refer the application, the normally required time frame for issuing azoning permit or building permit under this chapter and the Building Code shall be extendedby 10 days.
No use may be made in the AH District that causes interference with radio or electronicfacilities associated with the airport and any lighting that makes it difficult to distinguish airportlights, results in glare in pilots' eyes, or otherwise impairs visibility.
Other than any use that meets the criteria in Subsection
C(3)
, all allowable uses andstructures within the AH District shall comply with all other applicable standards of theunderlying standard zoning district and any other applicable overlay district requirements withregard to use and all other requirements.

Statutory authorization. This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 61.35 and 62.23,Wis. Stats., for villages and cities and the requirements in § 87-30, Wis. Stats.
Finding of facts. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of thismunicipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.
Statement of purpose. This article is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
Protect life, health and property.
Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects.
Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers.
Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions.
Minimize damage to private and public facilities in the floodplain.
Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain.
Discourage the victimization of unwary land buyers and home buyers.
Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflictsbetween property owners.
Discourage development in a floodway if there is any practicable alternative to locate theactivity, use or structure outside of the floodway.
Title. This article shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the Village ofKronenwetter, Wisconsin."
General provisions.
Areas to be regulated. This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regionalflood or base flood. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the FloodInsurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas coveredby the base flood are identified as A Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated asfloodplains or A Zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the Village ofKronenwetter Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in theFlood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewedand approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional floodelevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. Thesemaps and revisions are on file in the office of the Village Clerk, Village of Kronenwetter. Ifmore than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.

Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts asfollows:
The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of thefloodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.
The Flood Fringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional floodlimits and the floodway.
The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be coveredby floodwater during the regional flood and have not had a base flood elevation orfloodway boundaries determined. This district includes those flood zones designated asA, AH, and AO on the FIRM.
Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official FloodplainZoning Map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in §
520-40E(4)(a)
and
(b)
below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to §
520-47
. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grantor deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The ZoningAdministrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditionsand the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any mapamendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and anapplicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to §
520-46C(3)
and thecriteria in §
520-40E(4)(a)
and
(b)
below.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the districtboundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are anydiscrepancies.
Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by themap scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department.[Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from aFIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to §
520-47A(6)
.]
Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this article shall not begrounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above theregional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and themap is amended pursuant to §
520-47
. This procedure does not remove the requirements forthe mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA torequest a letter of map change (LOMC).
Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this article shall be incompliance with the terms of this article, and other applicable local, state, and federalregulations.
Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities,villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessarypermits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. Theconstruction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by theWisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This article supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enactedunder § 61.35, Wis. Stats., for villages, or § 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate tofloodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this article, that ordinance shallcontinue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.

Code, is unclear, the provision shall beinterpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this article or ineffect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this article.
Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this article are based onengineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood heightmay be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply or guaranteethat nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flooddamages; nor does this article create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, themunicipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result fromreliance on this article.
Severability. Should any portion of this article be declared unconstitutional or invalid by acourt of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected.
Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Marathon County floodplain zoning provisions ineffect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by themunicipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinancewhich meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, and the National FloodInsurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's OfficialZoning Map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for thepurpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the Municipal ZoningAdministrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and thelocation of the floodway.
General development standards. The community shall review all permit applications todetermine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If aproposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantialimprovements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostaticloads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methodsand practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating,ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities designedand/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the componentsduring conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the abovestandards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall includeregional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivisiondefinition of this article.
§ 520-41. General standards applicable to all floodplain districts.
Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.
Except as allowed in §
520-41A(3)
below, no floodplain development shall:
Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters byitself or with other development, increasing regional flood height; or
Increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which equals orexceeds 0.01 foot.

Article X. Building and Site Design Standards
§ 520-74. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish regulations that address the exterior design and appearanceof new buildings and their relationship to other structures, hard-surfaced areas, landscaping areas, andother required site design elements on the same building site or adjoining building sites. Sites andbuildings within a D Design Overlay Zoning District, as specified in §
520-37
, shall also be subject tothe unique building and site design standards of that district.
§ 520-75. Single-family and two-family housing standards.
All new and expanded single-family detached dwellings shall meet the applicable design requirementsin §
520-20A
. All new and expanded two-family dwellings shall meet the applicable designrequirements in §
520-20B
. All detached accessory buildings serving one of these principal uses shallmeet the applicable design requirements in §
520-27B
.
§ 520-76. Design standards for multifamily and nonresidentialbuildings.
Applicability. All new multifamily (three-plus units) residential principal buildings and nonresidentialprincipal buildings shall meet the design requirements in this section, with the exception of farmstructures such as barns, silos, and grain elevators. Expansion and remodeling of existingmultiple-family (three-plus units) residential principal buildings and nonresidential principalbuildings shall meet the design requirements in this section to the extent determined practical bythe applicable site plan approval authority. All detached accessory structures serving multifamilyresidential principal buildings shall meet applicable design requirements in §
520-27B
. Alldetached accessory structures serving nonresidential principal buildings shall meet applicabledesign requirements in §

Article XI. Landscaping and Preservation Standards
§ 520-78. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish landscaping requirements to provide and maintain vegetationin a manner that promotes the Village's natural resource protection, aesthetic, and public health goals.
§ 520-79. Landscaping requirements.
Applicability. Any use for which site plan approval is required under §
520-16J
shall providelandscaping in accordance with the requirements of this section, including expansion, renovation,and redevelopment of existing buildings and sites. Where the predecessor Zoning Ordinance, or aVillage zoning decision under that ordinance, required landscaping, and it has not beensatisfactorily installed or maintained, the property owner shall be required to install or restore suchlandscaping. Where the appropriate site plan approval authority under §
520-124
determines thatfull compliance with the requirements of this section is impractical, the approval authority mayrequire compliance to the extent it determines practical. Such a determination of impracticalitymay be based on one or more of the following conditions:
Preexisting buildings or impervious surfaces, and/or insufficient lot area, do not providesufficient green space for full compliance.
Village stormwater management or easement requirements do not provide sufficient area forfull compliance.
A redevelopment project would otherwise be infeasible, based on financial informationprovided by the applicant.
Full compliance would result in a plan in which landscaping would, by maturity, interfere withor compete with one another for survival and may therefore require removal at a later date.
Where a proposed addition does not exceed 50% of the original building or hard-surfacedarea size. In such cases, the quantitative landscaping standards shall be met in proportion tothe size of the addition as compared to the original building or hard-surfaced area.
Required landscape plan and preparer qualifications. All proposed landscape plantings to belocated on the subject property shall be depicted on a landscape plan as to their location, type,and size at time of planting and maturity. All landscape plans required under this article shall be

prepared by a licensed landscape architect, certified landscape designer, or another professionalor individual skilled in landscape design, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
Landscape planting requirements. Landscaping shall be provided based on the followingrequirements for hard- or gravel-surfaced areas, building foundations, buffer yards (whereapplicable), and general yard areas. These requirements are additive to each other and any otherlandscaping or screening requirements in this article. By approval of the applicable site planapproval authority, required landscaping points may be shifted between areas (e.g., hard-surfacedareas to building foundations). The landscaping point system is described in greater detail inSubsection
D
below.
[Amended

Factors have changed, such as the availability of new data, the presence of new roads orother infrastructure, additional development, annexation, or other zoning changes,making the subject property more appropriate for a different zoning district.
Growth patterns or rates have changed, thereby creating the need for a rezoning.
Does the proposed zoning district maintain the desired consistency of land uses, land useintensities, and land use impacts as related to the environs of the subject property?
Does the rezoning meet the minimum requirements for frontage or parcel size? A lot, lots, orparcel of land shall not qualify for a Zoning Map amendment unless it possesses 200 feet offrontage or contains 25,000 square feet of area, or adjoins a lot, lots, or parcel of land whichbears the same zoning district classification as the proposed Zoning Map amendment.

It is not sufficient that avariance applicant show that the zoning regulation(s) prevents or burdens his or herplanned activity. Such applicant must show by competent evidence that the regulationunreasonably prevents or unnecessarily burdens the proposed activity.
That compliance with the strict letter of the Zoning Ordinance would create unnecessaryhardship due to a unique property condition, meaning a special physical feature orlimitation of the property that is not generally shared by nearby land or property within thesame zoning district. If a variance applicant fails to prove the existence of a uniqueproperty condition and a connection between the condition and the hardship, even if thehardship is great, a variance may not be granted.
That the requested variance will not be contrary to the public interest, the intent andpurpose of this chapter, or the Village's Comprehensive Plan.
That the requested variance is for a provision of this chapter authorized for potentialvariances under §

The Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premisesbenefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in thissection. The concurring vote of four of the members of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall benecessary to grant a variance.

Recording of variance. The Zoning Administrator shall record the variance against the property,assigning all costs thereof to the applicant, and shall make record of the variance in the MarathonCounty Register of Deeds' office.
Effect of denial. No application for a variance that has been denied shall be resubmitted for aperiod of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence orproof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
Limited effect of variance. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals has granted a variance, suchapproval shall neither change the use classification of the building or premises nor give it anystatus as a nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the variance. Granting ofa variance shall be considered unique to the variance granted, and shall not be construed asprecedent for any other proposed variance.
Stay of proceedings. An application for a variance shall stay all legal proceedings furtheringenforcement of any provisions of this chapter from which the applicant is requesting a variance,unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals, after the request for thevariance has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in hisopinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.

Review by Zoning Administrator.

This review shall also take into consideration thestandards for review presented in Subsection
B
.
Standards for review of requested interpretations. This chapter shall be interpreted in a mannerthat is consistent with the purposes intended by the Village Board as noted in this chapter. To thisend, the Zoning Administrator shall proceed as follows:
Articulate certain public purposes underlying the standard(s) for which an interpretation isrequired.
Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility in designand prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public.

No interpretation shall permit a land use not specifically allowed in the particular zoningdistrict unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that samedistrict and is more similar to such other permitted uses than to uses either not permittedin said district or uses requiring a conditional use permit. If the proposed land use is moresimilar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject property's districtthan to a use permitted by right, then an interpretation permitting such use shall beconditioned upon the approval of a conditional use permit.
Effect of favorable land use interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use to beallowed or conditionally allowed in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishmentof such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any buildingor structure. A favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing ofapplications for any permits and approvals that may be required by this chapter. These permitsand approvals include, but are not limited to, required site plans, conditional use permits, andcertificates of occupancy.
Limitations on favorable land use interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use tobe permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period ofmore than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation, unless a building permit isissued and development is actually begun within that period, and is thereafter diligently pursued tocompletion, or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period. Aninterpretation finding a particular land use to be allowed or conditionally allowed in a specifiedzoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location forwhich the interpretation was issued. The interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize anyallegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued. A favorableinterpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular usefor which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive daysor more.
Fee. The Village may require a fee for this procedure, as established by the Village Board andstated in the Village of Kronenwetter's fee schedule.
