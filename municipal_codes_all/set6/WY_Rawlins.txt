shall be considered to have been waived.

available. Whenever the city manager determines that an emergency exists as a result of natural or
manmade condition, or threatened natural or manmade condition, causing imminent danger to the health
or safety or danger of injury to or damages to persons or property, he or she shall, have authority to
declare an emergency and take any precautionary measure or abatement which is reasonable under the

This chapter may be called "the historic preservation ordinance." (Ord. 5B-88 § 1(a))
Section 2.48.020 Findings and purpose.
The state of Wyoming and the city have a wide range of cultural resources that include prehistoric
and historic sites which are invaluable relics that remain to illustrate our state's past. The city council
finds that the state and city are noteworthy for their historic sites and natural beauty. The city has large
numbers of historic buildings and institutions with significant cultural importance. In recent years many
significant structures, and historic and archaeological sites have been destroyed without adequate
consideration of either the values represented therein or the possibility of preserving the properties for use
in economically productive ways. Citizens of the city share that belief that Wyoming's cultural resources
enhance the quality of life for all and promote the city's general welfare. It is declared a matter of public
policy that the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of significant historical, archaeological and
architectural relics of value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of health, prosperity, safety
and welfare of the people. The purpose of this chapter is to:
A. Effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of such improvements and
of districts which represent or reflect elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political,
engineering and architectural history;
B. Safeguard the city's historic, archaeological and cultural heritage, as embodied and reflected in
such historic structures, sites and districts;
RAWLINS MUNICIPAL CODE
Page 25 of 35
C. Stabilize and improve property values;
D. Foster civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past;
E. Protect and enhance the city's attractions to residents, tourists and visitors, and serve as a support
and stimulus to business and industry to strengthen the economy of the city;
F. Promote the use of historic structures, sites and districts for the education, pleasure and welfare of
the people of the city. (Ord. 5B-88 § 1(b))

and the trial and all other matters to come before the court shall have a priority upon the court calendar. If,
upon trial, it appears that the license or permit of the licensee should be revoked, the court shall enter its
order accordingly. The court may revoke the license or permit upon proof that the intent and purpose of
this title has been violated. The fact that no criminal proceeding has been instituted or that no law with
sanctions has been violated is not a defense to the action. Upon the application of the state and upon a
showing to the satisfaction of the court that there are probable grounds for believing the license holder’s
license should be revoked, the court may issue an order suspending a license during the pendency of an
action for its revocation and no bond shall be required as a condition to the issuance of the suspension order.
Appear from the final district court decision may be taken according to the Wyoming Rules of Appellate
Procedure, but the order of revocation shall remain in effect pending a decision by the appellate court.
F. The provisions of this section are cumulative and shall not be construed as preventing the division
from revoking a liquor license in any case authorized by law.
G. The division may revoke any license or permit issued under this title for violation of any of the
rules and regulation promulgated by the department pursuant to this title or for violation of any of the
provisions of this title. Prior to suspension or final revocation of a license or permit under this chapter the
division shall issue at least two (2) written notices of the intent to revoke or suspend the license or permit
to the licensee. The notices shall be provided at least one (1) week apart and the final notice shall be
provided at least thirty (30) days prior to any suspension or revocation. The notice shall identify the
violation warranting revocation or suspension of the license or permit, the date when it will be suspended
or revoked and the ability to appeal and to continue to operate as provided in this subsection. Unless the
division orders otherwise, a licensee may continue to operate under the license or permit pending an appeal
of a license suspension or revocation to the state board of equalization made under this subsection. Any
appeal shall be filed with the state board of equalization not more than thirty (30) days following the
suspension or revocation of the license or permit. Appeals before the state board shall be conducted as a
contested case under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and the state board shall either affirm or
deny the action taken by the division. The state board may affirm an order of immediate suspension of a
license or permit if the division demonstrates that the licensee should not be permitted to operate pending
the outcome of an appeal made under this subsection. The decision of the state board shall be subject to
judicial review under W.S. §16-3-114 except that the review shall not operate to stay a revocation or
suspension order of the division during the pendency of the district court proceeding or during a later appeal
to the supreme court. Should the license or permit of a licensee expire during the pendency of an appeal
before the state board or in any of the courts of this state, no new or renewal license shall be granted by the
licensing authority to the licensee or any other person pending the outcome of the appeal.
H. Upon the final revocation of a liquor license or permit, all alcoholic liquors in the possession of the
license holder and which are in merchantable conditions hall be delivered to the division which shall
reimburse the license holder for the value thereof at its then regular wholesale prices. All malt beverages
and non-merchantable alcoholic liquors shall be disposed of at the direction of the division. (Emergency
Ord. 06A-2017, Amended 6/27/17)
Section 5.08.570 Minors Prohibited on Premises where Alcoholic Beverages are Sold; Exceptions.
1) Any licensee, or his agent or employee, of a place licensed to sell, serve or dispense alcoholic

portion of the premises primarily intended for liquor sales and consumption in the performance
of employment duties, and such entry by a minor employee is prohibited.
5) The employee of a company delivering goods or other services to a licensee may be on the
premises for the purpose of doing bona fide work or delivering goods or other services,
provided that no one under the age of eighteen (18) years of age shall be in the dispensing
room. The employee must be present only for the purpose of performing his work during
normal business hours and he or she must be able to provide verification of the business purpose
through his boss or supervisor.

8) With the approval of the Rawlins City Council, in a dining or waiting area with an adult and
not later than 10:00 o’clock p.m. If the dining or waiting area is part of the licensed room.

person in the dispensing room during the event;
3. During the event, the dispensing room shall be closed and no alcoholic liquor or malt

take the animal into custody and notify the owner, if known, and notify the appropriate health officials.
The animal may be immediately euthanatized or with proof of current rabies vaccination, will be
impounded or isolated for a period of ten (10) days, provided that the owner may request in writing that
the animal be released to the custody of a licensed veterinarian or boarding kennel at the owner’ s
expense. If, after the end of the ten-day period the animal exhibits no symptoms of rabies, the animal may
be returned to the owner by the veterinarian. If impounded in the animal shelter, it will be returned to the
owner by the Animal Control Officer upon payment of all accrued charges. If the owner has not been
found, the animal shall be disposed of after the ten (10) days. In either case, the appropriate health
officials will be notified of the animal’s condition at the end of the ten (10) days.

shall kill any animal suspected of being rabid, until after the animal has been quarantined as provided and

the head of such animal sent to a laboratory for pathological examination and confirmation of the
diagnosis. When the suspected animal is so vicious and/or wild that it cannot be captured and the police

with gunshot not aimed at the head of the animal. When dead, the animal’s head is to be severed from its
body and the head sent to the state laboratory for examination. (Ord. No. 4-97, Enacted, 04/15/97)

junk; provided, however, that if a proper request for hearing is filed, abatement shall only
proceed upon order of the municipal judge or hearing examiner.
C. In the event a request for hearing is filed as provided, a hearing shall be held before the
municipal judge or such other individual or group as designated by the city council to act as
hearing examiner. The purpose of the hearing shall be to confirm or deny the existence of a
public nuisance and for taking such further action as is authorized under this chapter. Notice

that a public nuisance does not exist, abatement authority shall be denied and costs shall not be
assessed.

as provided in subsection C of this section, is an agency within the meaning of the Wyoming

Section 13.16.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to generate sufficient revenue to pay all costs for the operation and
maintenance of the complete wastewater system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the
wastewater system in proportion to each user's contribution to the total loading of the treatment works.
Factors such as strength (BOD and SS), volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered
and included as the basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and
maintenance costs to each user (or user class). (Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 28-41(a))
Section 13.16.020 Determination of operation and maintenance costs.
The city engineer shall determine the total annual costs of operation and maintenance of the
wastewater system which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance during the service life
of the treatment works for which the works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost of
operation and maintenance shall include but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment replacement,
maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency
fund. (Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 28-41(b))
Section 13.16.030 Determination of wastewater contribution percentage.
A. The director of planning shall determine each user's average daily volume of wastewater, which
has been discharged to the wastewater system, which shall then be divided by the average daily volume of
all wastewater discharged to the wastewater system, to determine each user's volume contribution
percentage. The amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude infiltration
and inflow. The director of planning shall determine each user's average daily poundage of five-day
twenty-degree Centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) discharged to the wastewater system to
determine each user's BOD contribution percentage.
B. The director of planning shall determine each user's average suspended solids (SS) poundage
which has been discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily
poundage of all suspended solids discharged to the wastewater system to determine the user's suspended
solids contribution percentage. Each user's volume contribution percentage, BOD contribution percentage
and suspended solids contribution percentage shall be multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance
costs for wastewater treatment of the total volume flow, of the total five-day twenty-degree Centigrade
Page 27 of 31
BOD and of the suspended solids, respectively. (Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 28-41(c))
(Ord. 11-2007, Amended, 11/06/2007)
Section 13.16.040 Determination of surcharges.
The director of planning will determine the average suspended solids (SS) and biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average residential user. The city will assess a surcharge rate for all
nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and SS strengths greater than the average residential
user. The users will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the costs of treating the user's abovenormal
strength wastes. (Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 28-41(d))
(Ord. 11-2007, Amended, 11/06/2007)
Section 13.16.050 Determination of service charge.
Each nonresidential user's wastewater treatment cost contributions as determined in Sections
13.16.030 and 13.16.040 shall be added together to determine the users' annual wastewater service
charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class of user and an equitable service charge may
be determined for each user based upon an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of
user. The city council may classify industrial, commercial and other nonresidential establishments as a
residential user; provided that the wastes from these establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the
average residential user with respect to volume, suspended solids and BOD. (Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part): prior
code § 28-41(e))
Section 13.16.060 Service charge statement.
The city shall submit an annual statement to the user for the user's annual wastewater service charge
or one-twelfth of the user's annual wastewater service charge may be included with the monthly water
utility billing. The city shall add a penalty of one and one-half percent per month if the payment is not
received by the city within fifteen days. Should any user fail to pay the user wastewater service charge
and penalty within three months of the due date, the city may stop the wastewater service to the property.
(Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 28-41(f))
Section 13.16.070 Review of service charge.
The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as well as each user's
wastewater contribution percentage not less often than every two years and will revise the system as
necessary to assure equity of the service charge system established in this chapter and to assure that
sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. If a
significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant modifications which would change that user's
wastewater contribution percentage, the user can present at a regularly scheduled meeting of the city
council, such factual information and the city shall then determine if the user's wastewater contribution
percentage is to be changed. (Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 28-41(g))
Section 13.16.080 Rates and charges establishment.
The city council shall by ordinance establish all sewer service charge rates, surcharge rates and any
changes thereto. (Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 28-41(h))
Page 28 of 31
Section 13.16.090 Rate notice.
Each user will be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that
portion of the user charges which are attributable to wastewater treatment services. (Ord. 7-79 § 1 (part):

Section 16.04.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this title is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the community.
Manufactured homes, because of the manner of their construction and assembly (including heating,
plumbing and electrical systems), like other finished products having concealed vital parts, may present
hazards to the health, life and safety of persons and to the safety of property unless properly
manufactured. Inspection of the construction of manufactured homes frequently cannot satisfactorily be
performed after the unit has been manufactured. Further, manufactured home parks may present hazards
to the health and safety of persons and to the safety of property unless they are properly planned,
constructed and maintained. It is the policy of the city to:
A. Provide protection to the public against possible hazards arising from manufactured home
construction and for that purpose forbid the manufacture, and sale, or placement of manufactured homes
which are not constructed so as to provide reasonable safety and protection to their occupants;
B. Provide protection to the public against unsafe and unhealthful conditions in manufactured home
parks and camping parks, and to assure to those who live in such parks a reasonably safe, sanitary and
decent environment;
C. Protect and conserve the value of land and buildings nearby;
D. Provide for adequate water, sewage, recreation and other requirements, facilities and open space
needs as will accommodate the tenants of manufactured home parks and camping parks;
E. Establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for manufactured home and camping
park developments, in order to further the orderly layout and use of land; and
F. Avoid excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of public services. (Ord. 6B-79 § 1
(part): prior code § 15-1(b))
(Ord. 11a-2005, Amended, 11/15/2005)

Section 16.04.040 Compliance required.
A manufactured home park or camping developer shall comply with reasonable conditions laid down
by the director of planning for design, dedication, improvement and restrictive use of the land so as to
conform to the physical and economic development of the city and to the safety and general welfare of the
future tenants in the manufactured home park or the camping park and of the community at large. (Ord.
6B-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 15-2(c))

Section 16.04.050 Penalty for violation.
Any owner or proprietor of a manufactured home park or camping park within the jurisdiction area of
the city who fails to provide and maintain any of the improvements or facilities required by this title,
unless a specific variance or variances have been granted by the city council, shall be subject to a fine not
to exceed two hundred dollars for each day such failure continues; provided, however, no fines shall be
imposed unless the owner or proprietor has personal knowledge of the deficiencies and has failed after the
passage of a reasonable period of time to take measures reasonably calculated to remedy the situation.

value of the property is unstable, when the property may be difficult to sell, or when other factors exist
which will inhibit the city from exchanging the property for an amount of money sufficient to complete
the required improvements. When property is offered as an improvement guarantee, the developer shall:

in escrow as an improvement guarantee will not be used for any other purpose, or pledged as a security in
any other matter, until it is released by the director of planning. (Ord. 6B-79 § 1 (part): prior code § 15-

(12) months. Any plat not receiving final approval within the period of time set forth in this section shall
be null and void, and the developer shall be required to resubmit a new plat for preliminary approval, subject
to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations. In the event the final plat covers only a portion
of the territory covered by the preliminary plat, the approval of the preliminary plat shall be automatically
renewed for additional one-year periods following the approval of each final plat, unless the Planning &
Zoning Commission notifies the subdivider to the contrary. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-27(e)) (Ord

RESIDENTIAL INFILL
Sections:
18.18.010 Purpose.
18.18.020 Applicability.
18.18.040 Residential Infill Subdivision Standards.
18.18.050 Other Requirements.
Section 18.18.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish appropriate subdivision development standards for the infill
and redevelopment of underutilized residential properties, to allow for additional housing opportunities
on individual lots in existing neighborhoods that are currently zoned. To help minimize development
cost and thereby encourage affordable housing, this chapter is intended to be utilized as a template for
qualifying developments without the need for complete engineered plans- relying instead on the
standards herein and qualified contractors to complete the subdivision improvements to acceptable
standards. Therefore, the scope of this chapter is limited to projects that are relatively straightforward
and do not require construction of any new public streets, public water lines, or public sewer lines.
The maximum size limit for applicability of this chapter is meant to separate small infill situations
from larger properties that are more appropriately developed with traditional development
improvements. (Ord. 04-2019, Amended 4/16/2019)
Section 18.18.020 Applicability.
This chapter shall only be applicable to properties that have all the following characteristics.
A. The property is 2.5 acres or less in size;
B. The property is located in a residential zone and does not contain any non-conforming
commercial or industrial uses.
C. The property has frontage on and access directly to/from a paved public street;
D. The property shall contain the same lot density as properties adjacent to but in no case
contain more than eight lots;
E. The access route to any lot in the proposed subdivision is not more than one hundred
(100) feet in length, measured from the public street right-of-way to the middle of the
turnaround;
F. All lots will be served with public sewer, water and power;
G. No sewer or water lines will be shared between lots- individual sewer and water service
lines must be run to each lot pursuant to 13.04.060.
(Ord. 04-2019, Amended 4/16/2019)
Section 18.18.040 Residential Infill Subdivision Design Standards.
The following design standards shall apply to residential infill subdivisions. All applicable required
improvements are the responsibility of the subdivider and shall be installed prior to issuance of a
building permit for a dwelling within the subdivision. The layout of the subdivision improvements
shall be shown on the preliminary plat application drawings pursuant to Rawlins Municipal Code
Page 27 of 49
Chapter 18.12.
A. Access and Frontage Requirements:
1. Lot Frontage: All lots shall be provided with frontage on a public street or
private access easement.

drive to the public street shall consist of a paved entrance/exit extending from the curb
cut to a point at least twenty-five (25) feet from the public street, measured along the
direction of travel. Asphalt thickness shall be at least three (3) inches, compacted
depth.
3. Approach to Public Street: In areas that have curb and gutter along the property
frontage, the approach to the public street shall be constructed to the City’s standards
with curb, gutter and ADA compliant sidewalk.
4. Access Drive Connection: If the access drive connects to a major collector or
arterial, the City Engineer may require any existing approach be removed and all access
to occur from the common access drive.
5. Property Frontage: If the property frontage has curb and gutter, but no
sidewalk, the subdivider shall install sidewalk to City standards across the property
frontage. If no curb and gutter exist along the property frontage, subdivider shall install
curb and gutter to City standards.

A. The applicant may post a performance bond, at the time of application for final subdivision approval
by the council, in the amount estimated by the subdivider’s licensed engineer as sufficient to secure to the

removed. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-41(b))
Section 18.20.030 Responsibility for Costs.
All required improvements shall be made by the applicant, at his expense, without reimbursement by
the city, or any improvement district therein, except that the city may share in the cost of required
improvements when they are of an unusual nature and not consistent with the character and/or size of
normally required improvements. The cost sharing shall be in accordance with policies and rules properly
adopted by the city council. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-41(c))
Section 18.20.040 Guarantee--Governmental Unit.

qualified real estate appraiser shall establish the value of any real property so used and in so doing, shall
take into account the possibility of a decline or rise in the value of the property during the guarantee period.
The city council reserves the right to reject the use as collateral of any property when the value of the
property is unstable, when the property may be difficult to sell, or when other factors exist which will inhibit
the city council from exchanging the property for an amount of money sufficient to complete the required
improvements. When property is offered as an improvement guarantee, the subdivider shall:
A. Execute an agreement with the escrow agent when it is not the city instructing the agent to release
the property to the city in case of default. The agreement shall be placed on file with the county clerk;

and approved by the city council, of completing all required improvements;
B. That, if the subdivider fails to complete the specified improvements within the required period, the
creditor will pay to the city immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance
the completion of those improvements, up to the limit of credit stated in the letter;
C. That this irrevocable letter of credit may not be withdrawn or reduced in amount until released by
the city council. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-41(g)(3))
Section 18.20.110 Guarantee--Alternate Methods--Third Party Trust Agreement.
The subdivider may place title to the subdivided property in trust with a third party escrow agency or
trust company authorized and licensed to do business in the state. The trust shall include an agreement
between the trustee and the city that title to any lot or parcel within the subdivision shall not be transferred
until all improvements required by these regulations have been installed and accepted by the city, on any
particular lot or parcel, with written approval for release to the escrow agency or trust company holding the
property in trust. The agreement shall contain special conditions providing for authorization of the city to
abandon and resubdivide the property should the required improvements fail to be installed in compliance
with city standard specifications. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-41(g)(4))
Section 18.20.120 Guarantee--Alternate Methods--Combined Methods.

The improvement guarantee shall be submitted to the city attorney for approval by the city council prior
Page 33 of 49
to the signing of the plat by the mayor, regardless of which method of guarantee is selected. (Ord. 4A-78
(part): prior code § 30-41(h))
Section 18.20.140 Inspections and Fees.
The city council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during construction and insure
their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay the city inspection fees as may henceforth be
established by resolution of the city council as per Title 1 of this code. These fees shall be due and payable
upon application for permit to construct the various types of improvements. If the city engineer finds upon
inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the city's
construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for correcting the
improvements. Whenever the cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and
the bonding company shall be severely and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to
specifications. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-43(a))
(Ord. 08a-2008, Amended, 08/19/2008; Ord. 11-2007, Amended, 11/06/2007)

2. That the improvements are free and clear of any encumbrance or lien.
B. Upon request by the subdivider, the office of the Planning & Zoning Commission shall, after
making final inspection, file with the city council a statement either certifying that the improvements have
been completed and are in compliance with appropriate specifications and requirements or listing the
defects and deficiencies in the improvements.
C. If the city engineer has certified that the contracted improvements are complete and free from
defect, then upon receipt of the other statements and agreements detailed in this section, the city council
shall accept the dedication of those improvements. The city council may accept the dedication of any
portion of the required improvements; provided, that all statements and agreements specified in this section
have been received for the portion of the improvements.
D. Reduction of Improvement Guarantee. An improvement guarantee shall be reduced upon actual
dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvements dedicated bear
to the total public improvements for the plat. In no event shall a performance bond be reduced below twentyfive
percent of the principal amount. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-43(b))
(Ord. 11-2007, Amended, 11/06/2007)
Section 18.20.160 Maintenance.
The applicant shall be required to maintain all public improvements within the subdivision and provide
for snow removal on streets and sidewalks if required, until initial acceptance of the improvements by the

Page 34 of 49
inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
B. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Planning & Zoning Commission to defer the construction
of any improvement required in this chapter because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate
or lack of connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his share of the costs of the
future improvements to the city prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat, or the applicant may post

Page 36 of 49
and purposes of these regulations. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-58(a))
(Ord. 11-2007, Amended, 11/06/2007)
Section 18.24.020 Self-imposed Restrictions.
If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the subdivision, greater than those
required by the zoning ordinance or these regulations, such restrictions, or reference thereto, may be
required to be indicated on the subdivision plat; or, the Planning & Zoning Commission may require that
restrictive covenants be recorded with the county clerk in a form to be approved by the city attorney. (Ord.
4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-58(b))
Section 18.24.030 Plats Crossing Municipal Boundaries.
Whenever access to the subdivision is required across land in another government entity, the Planning
& Zoning Commission may request assurance from the city engineer that the access road is adequately
improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the
construction of the access road. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross city boundary lines.
(Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-58(c))
(Ord. 11-2007, Amended, 11/06/2007)

Section 18.24.050 Character of Land.
Land which the Planning & Zoning Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development
due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography,
utility easements or other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare
of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or
developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning &
Zoning Commission, upon recommendation of the city engineer, to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions. The land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger. (Ord. 4A-
78 (part): prior code § 30-58(e))
Section 18.24.060 Name of Subdivision.

code § 30-58(f))
Section 18.24.070 Lot Arrangement.
The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of

zoning ordinance and health regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings on the lots from an
Page 37 of 49
approved street. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-59(a))
Section 18.24.080 Lot Dimensions.
Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance. Where lots are more
than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the Planning & Zoning Commission may
require that the lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where
they should be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the zoning ordinance and these
regulations. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curve street lines)
unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan. Depth and width of properties shall be
adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and
development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-
59(b))
Section 18.24.090 Through Lots and Lot Access.
A. Through Lots. Through lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation to
residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation.
B. Access from Major Secondary Arterials. Single-family residential lots shall not, in general, derive
access exclusively from a major street. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-59(c))
Section 18.24.100 Relation to Adjoining Streets.
A. The arrangement of streets, in new subdivisions, shall make provision for the continuation of the
existing streets in adjoining areas (or their proper protection where adjoining land is not subdivided) insofar
as such may be deemed necessary by the Planning & Zoning Commission for public requirements. The
street arrangement must be such as to cause no unnecessary hardship to owners of adjoining property when
they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it.
B. Minor streets shall approach the major or collector streets at an angle of not less than eighty degrees.
(Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-60)
Section 18.24.110 Street Dedication.
Streets, in general, shall be dedicated to the city as public streets. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-
61(a))
Section 18.24.120 Major Street Design.

Section 18.32.010 Grounds Required.
Where the Planning & Zoning Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties
may result from strict compliance with these regulations or the purposes of these regulations may be served
to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these subdivision regulations so
that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, if the variance does not have the effect
of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations. The Planning & Zoning Commission shall not
approve variances unless it finds, based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case, that:
A. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or
injurious to other property; or
B. The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property for which
the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property; or
C. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific
property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out; or
D. The variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of the zoning ordinance, master plan or
official map. (Ord. 4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-13(a))
Section 18.32.020 Conditions.
In approving variances, the Planning & Zoning Commission may require such conditions as will, in its
judgment, secure substantially the objective of the standards or requirements of these regulations. (Ord.
4A-78 (part): prior code § 30-13(b))
Section 18.32.030 Petition.
A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the

state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner. (Ord. 4A-78

Section 19.44.040 Facilities Required--Existing Structures and Uses.
A. Any use of a building or other use which is conforming or construed to be conforming
under the ordinance codified in this section may be changed or enlarged and be in compliance with
this section provided that one or more of the following conditions are met, provided, however, that
none of the provisions of this section shall apply in the area bounded by Spruce Street on the North,
Second Street on the East, Sixth Street on the West and Front Street on the South. It shall be the
duty of the zoning officer to determine which option or combination of options best meets the
intent of the ordinance codified in this section. The options are as follows:
1. When a change in use is made between uses listed in Section 19.44.030 or an enlargement
of such a use is made, an increment of parking may be added equal to the net increase required.
This increment shall be determined to be the difference if the new use or enlargement where new
construction and the parking requirements of the existing use if it were newly constructed. In no
case will this increment be less than zero.
2. When the use is located in a commercial zone, in lieu of creating an additional increment
of parking, a contribution equal to the fair market value of each parking space required by this
subsection may be made to the city municipal parking improvement fund for purposes of creating
and maintaining public parking. This amount shall be calculated by the following formula:
400 x fair market price per square foot of commercial parking area = parking extraction
Whenever cash in lieu of actual parking is made for required increments of parking, the market
value shall be based on an official market value determined by recommendation of Community
Development and adopted by the City Council and adjusted from time to time. In the event of
inability of the above parties to agree on the full market value of the spaces, an independent party
being a qualified local appraiser shall be selected by mutual agreement of the disagreeing parties.
The independent party's findings on full market value of the site shall be final and binding on all
parties. The applicant shall pay the cost of the appraiser. Payments made under the requirement of
this section shall be made payable to the city. The zoning officer shall receive such fund to change
in use of a property or issuance of a building permit. This fee shall be deposited with the city
treasurer who shall in turn deposit such funds in any city approved and designated financial
institution within the city. Such funds shall be deposited to special interest bearing escrow
accounts. The status of these accounts shall be reported annually to the city council and shall be
made available to the general public. Funds may be withdrawn from the special escrow accounts
by the city council, for the specific purposes of acquiring lands for public parking sites and of
making improvements to and maintaining such sites.
3. Upon written approval of the city engineer and the chief of police, the zoning officer may
approve a written waiver of incremental parking up to twenty-five percent of total required parking
Rawlins Municipal Code
Page 96 of 146
for the new use or enlargement if it were new construction. In granting such a waiver, the zoning
officer must certify that such a waiver does not violate the intent of the ordinance codified in this
section nor harm the public interest. This waiver may only be used in cases where it is unlikely
that municipal parking will ever be provided in the vicinity.
4. The applicant may be asked to apply for blanket approval of parking arrangements under
the variance procedure outlined in Section 19.44.050. (Ord. 9-90 (part); Ord. 9-89 (part)) (Ord. 04-
2020, Amended 4/7/2020)
Section 19.44.050 Variance to Off-Street Parking Requirements.
A. An applicant may appeal any decision of the zoning officer in regard to general
requirements of the ordinance codified herein to the Board of Adjustments by filing a written
request for appeal. This written appeal shall include the following items:
1. A site plan of proposed parking requirements;
2. A statement of reasons for requesting a variance and extenuating conditions;
3. Any other rationales which would tend to support the conclusion that the intent of the
ordinance codified herein would be met by the applicant's plan.
B. No variance to design standards may be granted through this procedure. All such requests
shall be considered by the Board of Adjustments. Application for such variance shall be made in
accordance with Section 19.76.040. Each application for such a variance shall include payment
of the appropriate fee to the city as set by resolution of the City Council, and provided for in Title
1 of this code. (Ord. 9-89 (part)) (Ord. No. 10D-94, Amended, 10/04/94) (Ord. 08a-2008,
Amended, 08/19/2008) (Ord. 04-2020, Amended 4/7/2020)
Section 19.44.060 Location of Parking.
A. Parking spaces for apartment buildings, commercial or industrial uses shall be readily
accessible to, and be within a reasonable distance from the buildings served thereby. Such spaces
shall be on the same lot and in the same zoning district as the principal building, or open area,
except when otherwise authorized, as a special exemption, conforming to the following
regulations:
1. The required parking spaces shall be suitable within six hundred feet of the principal
building or open space in question.
2. Such spaces shall be in the same ownership or control as the principal building to which
they are accessory and shall be subject to deed restrictions acceptable to the Planning & Zoning
Commission, binding the owner, and his heirs or assigns to maintain the required number of
parking spaces throughout the life of the principal use.
3. A leasehold or easement may constitute control; however, continued occupancy may be
conditioned on continuation of such control or equivalent.
B. Except when specifically approved otherwise by the city council, no part of a public street
or alley right-of-way may be used for required off-street parking spaces. In no case shall any onstreet
parking spaces be considered as satisfying any portion of off-street parking requirements.
(Ord. 9-89 (part))
Section 19.44.070 Design Standards.
A. The minimum standards of parking facilities to be provided shall be as follows:

Section 19.46.030 Definitions.
“A-Weighted Sound Level (dba)” – A measurement of sound pressure level, which has been
filtered or weighted to progressively de-emphasize the importance of frequency components below
1000 Hz and above 5000 Hz. This reflects the fact that human hearing is less sensitive at low

perpendicular to the nearest I-80 right-of-way boundary.
D. Common Signage Plan.
a. Businesses located in a multi-tenant complex may submit a common signage plan
that would contribute to uniformity in the complex's collective signage. Signage
permitted under a common signage plan may exceed the sign restrictions dictated by

standards for consistency among all signs on the lots affected by the plan. Criteria for
a common signage designation include but are not limited to: (A) color scheme; (B)
lettering or graphic style; (C) lighting; (D) location of each sign on the building(s) or
lot(s); (E) sign material; (F) sign proportions; and (G) cumulative sign display areas

The purpose of planned unit development procedures is to permit creativity and flexibility in
design by permitting deviations from the requirements of this title if the design satisfactorily
proves that no problems will be created. Through individual design and location of units, greater
privacy, land efficiencies and improved living environments should result. Planned unit
developments in any districts where permitted shall be subject to the additional provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 9-89 (part))
Section 19.60.020 Application and Fees.

R 7,500 6 units per acre
R 3,000 14 units per acre
R 1,500 30 units per acre
Open space for recreation shall be provided based on the following:
The percent of the total land to be dedicated shall be based on the formula below which
recognizes the national standard of ten acres per one thousand population for park usage. This
standard is then related to density and varying family size with density changes. Therefore, the
Rawlins Municipal Code
Page 137 of 146
amount to be dedicated is calculated as follows:
Gross density x 2 plus 5 equals % dedication required
(Example: 10 units per acre x 2 plus 5 equals 25 or
25% dedication)
B. That area designated as open space or park shall be dedicated in perpetuity by appropriate
covenants, and protected by a homeowner's association or similar legally constituted arrangement
to control, construct and maintain the mutually owned property. Lands proposed to be dedicated
to public ownership cannot be considered as meeting these requirements unless accepted by legal
action of the government.
C. The minimum distance between principal structures, on the same lot, and perimeter
development boundaries shall be no less than the height of the tallest structure as applicable. In no
case shall the setback from the boundary be less than twenty-five feet.
