DOUGLAS, WYOMING - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of
Douglas, Wyoming 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 24,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Douglas, Wyoming Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1987, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 24, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 24, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 998 , adopted November 13, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 24, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 24, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 24, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 24, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 24, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

Cultural resources found in the city include significant architectural structures, settlement period historic sites and numerous architectural sites which have played a part in the history of the state and community. In recent years, many significant structures, and historic and archaeological sites have been destroyed without adequate consideration of either the values represented therein or the possibility of preserving the properties for use in economically productive ways. Citizens of Douglas share the belief that Wyoming's cultural resources enhance the quality of life for all and promote Douglas' general welfare. It is declared a matter of public policy that the protection, enhancement, and perpetuation of significant historical, archaeological and architectural relics of value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of health, prosperity, safety and welfare of the people.

3.  Stabilize and improve property values. 
4.  Foster civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past.

C.  The city council enacts this chapter as stated above to help preserve Wyoming's heritage. The city council also endorses the state's certified local government program and agrees to participate in this historic preservation program.

The certified notice from the state and all evidence presented to the state in support of the certified notice and order of conviction from municipal court will be admitted and considered prima facie evidence of the liquor licensee's sales tax delinquency or conviction of municipal ordinance on liquor. The purpose of the hearing is to allow the liquor licensee to offer corrections to the information; and action taken by liquor licensee to mitigate the violation and for governing body to determine whether liquor licensee should face restrictions or suspension of the liquor license. Notice of such violation shall be served by regular mail to the address of the licensee listed on the licensee's most recent liquor license application to the city, and shall include a statement:

Penalties provided in this section are based on the violations of ordinances outlined in subsection E herein against a liquor licensee within a three-year period beginning the first day of April through the last day of March of each year. Any convictions of ordinances outlined in subsection E during this period of time involving the same licensed liquor building and/or premises may be used by governing body to determine a gross violation and suspension or recommend revocation of licensee's license. The maximum fine is seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per occurrence. 
I.  Revocation. If it appears to the governing body that a liquor license should be revoked, the governing body may authorize the city attorney to prepare and file with the district court a petition to revoke the licensee's license. If a license is revoked, except as provided in W.S. 12-7-201(d) concerning the expiration of a license while a revocation order is under appeal, the liquor licensee of such revoked license shall not be eligible to apply for a new liquor license for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of revocation. In the event a suspension occurs, the clerk shall send by certified mail one (1) copy of each of the suspension notices to the last known address of the liquor licensee and to the director of the state department of revenue. Additionally, the clerk shall post one (1) copy of the suspension notice on the liquor license or permitted building or premises.

Further, the licensee shall either remove all of the alcoholic liquor and malt beverages from the licensed building and/or premises or secure the alcoholic liquor and malt beverages in a manner approved in writing by the chief of police or his designee. 
J.  Appeal. Action by governing body suspending a liquor license of a licensee shall be subject to review in the district court upon exhaustion of administrative appeals in accordance with the procedural rules heretofore or hereinafter adopted by the Wyoming Supreme Court concerning the review of administrative actions. Filing an appeal as provided in such rules, stays enforcement of the suspension decision pending final order on the appeal.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 855, adopted June 22, 2009, repealed Section 5.36.110, which pertained to exceptions and derived from Ord. 780, 2006; Ord. 763 (part), 2005. 
Chapter 5.40 - CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE-REGULATION OF RATES 

5.40.010 - Purpose. 
    This chapter governs the regulation of rates for basic service and equipment within the city and does not replace Ordinance No. 172-A as amended. The provisions set forth below are intended to be consistent with all Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulations governing the regulation of basic service rates and equipment, and the city will regulate and interpret its rules so that they are consistent with FCC regulations, as if those regulations were set forth in full herein; the franchisee is prohibited from engaging in any activity it is prohibited in engaging in under FCC rules, as if those rules were set forth in full herein. If enforcement of any provision would be prohibited under FCC rules, the provision shall not be enforced, but all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. For purposes of these provisions, the term "basic service" or "basic cable service" has the same meaning as the term "basic service" at 47 C.F.R. 76.901 and the term "equipment" refers to all equipment and services subject to regulation under 47 C.F.R. 76.923. 
(Ord. 523 § 0.1, 1993) 
5.40.020 - Initial filings-When made. 
    A franchisee that is notified that its basic service and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission ("the rate filing") within thirty (30) days of the notification (but is not required to make a filing any earlier than November 15, 1993), justifying its then-existing basic service and equipment rates. All rates for all customer classifications must be justified. Once a franchisee has been so notified by the city that its rates are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase its rates for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the city. This requirement applies in all cases, including with respect to increases in rates announced prior to the date the operator was notified its rates were subject to regulation where the increases were not implemented prior to the date of notice. A franchisee must submit a rate filing to justify any increase in basic service or equipment rates or any new basic service or equipment rate (collectively referred to herein as rate increases). An "increase" occurs when there is an increase in rates or a decrease in program or customer services. Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for review at least thirty (30) days in advance of the proposed effective date of the increase. This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice requirement. 
(Ord. 523 § 1.1.1, 1993) 
5.40.030 - Initial filing-Where made. 
    Every rate filing must be submitted to the City Clerk of Douglas, 101 North Fourth Street, P.O. Box 1030, Douglas, Wyoming 82633. A rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the date the rate filing and all required copies are received by the city clerk. Three (3) copies of each rate filing (including all supporting materials) must be submitted. If any part of the rate filing contains information that is claimed to be proprietary under applicable FCC rules, the franchisee also must file three (3) copies with the proprietary information removed. 
(Ord. 523 § 1.1.2, 1993) 
5.40.040 - Initial filing-Contents. 
A.  Subject to any FCC regulations governing the burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the rates the franchisee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable. Except as inconsistent with FCC rules: 
1.  Every rate filing must clearly state in a cover letter whether it justifies existing rates; or proposes an increase in rates. The cover letter must also identify any rate that is derived in whole or in part, based upon cost of service, and identify any pages of the rate filing that contain information that the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state whether any part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment or an alleged increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain a brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service. 
2.  The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially. 
3.  The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these forms must be correctly completed. 
4.  If different rates are being charged, or are to be charged, for different customers or classes of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the differences in the rate charged are reasonable and consistent with federal law. 
B.  If the franchisee seeks to support a rate based upon a cost of service, the city will establish a rate that provides the franchisee an opportunity to recover its reasonable costs, including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not presumed reasonable merely because the franchisee has incurred or made it. A franchisee is not entitled to recover monopoly rents in any form. 
C.  In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee who seeks to justify all, or any part of its rates based upon its cost of service, must submit a complete cost of service analysis that shows all expenses it incurs and all revenues derived from the system directly, or indirectly, by the franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the system within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. Section 522(4). The cost of service must identify the accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC's regulations) at which each expense, or revenue identified, was aggregated and show clearly how the expense or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not include costs at an accounting level unless it also includes all revenues from that same level attributable to the system or to a group of systems of which the system serving the city is a part. The replacement cost of a comparable system must be identified and supported. The franchisee must identify the name and address of any entity with which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives revenues from the system, and must state whether and how the revenues of that entity were included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service shall clearly show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the application of that charge to yield a basic service rate. It must also show and support the derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the derivation of the rate for: 
1.  Operation and maintenance expenses; 
2.  Administrative and general expenses; 
3.  Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs and copyright fees separately); 
4.  Costs for PEG access and any institutional network; 
5.  Franchise fee expenses; 
6.  Investment in the system and associated depreciation; 
7.  Other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes, itemized; and 
8.  The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid by the franchisee. 
D.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is not required to submit the cost of service specified in subsection C of this section for equipment rates, and instead, initially shall complete, submit and support the costs of equipment using applicable FCC forms. Any costs of service submitted to justify basic service rates must show that the cost of service does not include equipment costs. 
(Ord. 523 § 1.1.3, 1993) 
5.40.050 - Initial city review. 
A.  After receiving a rate filing, the city promptly shall publish a notice that a filing has been received, and that, except for those parts which may be withheld as proprietary, it is available for public review. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties at least seven (7) days to submit written comments on the filing to the city. The city shall submit the comments received and its recommendations for action to the city council and shall make those comments and recommendations available for public inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than five (5) business days after the staff recommendations are submitted to the city council and the franchisee. The response shall be filed with the city, and if submitted in a timely fashion, the city shall forward a copy to the city council. 
B.  Within thirty (30) days of the date of the filing, the city council shall issue a written order including an explanation, which may be in the form of a resolution, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or tolling the proposed rate in whole or part. If the city council tolls the rate in whole or in part, its written order, at least, shall explain that it requires additional time to review the rate filing, and state that the franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a supplementary filing as provided in Section 5.40.060. With respect to existing rates, tolling means the rates may remain in effect, subject to refund; with respect to rate changes, tolling means the portion of the rate change that is tolled may not go into effect. 
(Ord. 523 § 1.2, 1993) 
5.40.060 - Supplementary filings. 
A.  If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the franchisee shall submit a supplementary filing twenty (20) days from the date the tolling order issues, containing corrections, if any, to its filing (including any required supplement to its cost of service filing) and any response to information filed by interested parties or to the recommendations of the city and any additional information supporting the proposed rate. Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with Section 5.40.030. 
B.  A supplementary filing also must contain such information as the city directs the franchisee to provide. 
C.  In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee who claims that it is entitled to a rate in whole or in part based upon the adjustments for inflation and external costs contemplated by 47 C.F.R. 76.922(d)(l)-(2) must submit the following: 
1.  A calculation showing how each part of the adjustment was derived; 
2.  A statement itemizing each external cost (as defined by FCC regulations), the amount of the external costs for the two (2) calendar years prior to the date of the filing and the year-to-date in which the filing is made; and the projected amount of the external cost for the remainder of the year in which the filing is made and for the following calendar year. The statement must specifically show any increases in revenues from programming services. "Revenues" includes all revenues, in whatever form received; 
3.  If the increase is attributable to any increase in programming service costs, the contract for each programming service whose cost has increased; a sworn statement identifying each programming service whose costs increased where the programmer is an affiliate of the franchisee (as defined by FCC regulations) ; and, for any contract that has been in effect less than twelve (12) months, the prior contract for the service; 
4.  A sworn statement by the franchisees' chief financial officer or an independent, certified accountant stating that he or she has examined all external costs (including all programming costs) and has offset against any increase claimed, the amount of any decreases in external costs, and the amount by which any increase in external costs was below the GNP-PI, as required by 47 C.F.R. 76.922(d)(2); affirming that the franchisee has only sought to recover any external cost to the extent that costs exceeded the GNP-PI; and affirming that the franchisee has not attempted to recover any increase in the cost of programming purchased by an affiliate except as provided in 47 C.F.R 76.922(d)(2)(vi). 
D.  Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the city promptly shall publish a notice that a filing has been received and that it is available for public review (except those parts which may be withheld as proprietary). The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties twenty (20) days to submit written comments on the filing to the city. The city clerk shall submit the comments received and the recommendations of the staff for action to the city council. The recommendations shall be made available for public inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than ten (10) days after the staff recommendations are submitted to the city council. The response shall be filed with the city clerk, and if submitted in a timely fashion, shall be forwarded to the city council. 
E.  The city council shall issue a written order including an explanation, which may be in the form of a resolution, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect in whole or in part, subject to refund. If the city council issues an order allowing the rates to go into effect, subject to refund, it shall also direct the franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with 47 C.F.R. 76.933. 
F.  The order specified in subsection E of this section shall be issued ninety (90) days after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies based on the FCC benchmark. The order shall be issued within one hundred fifty (150) days of the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies with a cost of service showing. 
(Ord. 523 § 1.3, 1993) 
5.40.070 - Rate orders-Effective date-Public notice. 
    Any rate order of the city council shall be effective upon the passage of the resolution related thereto. Each rate order shall be released to the public and franchisee. In any case where the city council approves, denies or tolls a rate; orders that a rate may go into effect subject to refund; or orders refunds or establishes rates, a public notice shall be published stating that the order has issued and is available for review. Any such order shall be in writing. 
(Ord. 523 § 2.1, 1993) 
5.40.080 - Rate orders-Protection of public interest. 
    The city council may take any steps that it is not prohibited from taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of any rate order or by any other means. By way of illustration and not limitation, it may require refunds, set rates, and impose forfeitures and penalties directly or through its delegated representatives, and enforce refund orders. Any order prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisee's proposed rate was unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the city council shall ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the city propose a refund or a rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the franchisee at the time it is submitted to the city council shall be deemed to provide the franchisee this notice and the franchisee must comment on the refund or rate in its response to the recommendations. 
(Ord. 523 § 2.2, 1993) 
5.40.090 - Rate orders-Reduction and refund. 
    No order approving, or setting a rate using the FCC benchmarks shall be interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not limitation, should the FCC reduce the benchmarks, the city shall have the right to reduce a franchisee's rates and to require the franchisee to refund any amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by federal law. 
(Ord. 523 § 2.3, 1993) 
5.40.100 - Franchisees' duties. 
A.  A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including prospective rate reductions and refunds, within sixty (60) days of the date the city council issues an order mandating a remedy. 
B.  Within ninety (90) days of the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a franchisee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of the cable company stating: 
1.  Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of the city council's order; and 
2.  Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the city council's order; and 
3.  Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and distributed. 
C.  It is each franchisees' responsibility to keep books and records of account so that it can refund any amounts owed to subscribers. 
D.  If is each franchisees' duty to submit as complete a filing as possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing that is incomplete under applicable law shall be treated as an evasion of this chapter. 
E.  Information Requests. 
1.  A franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues or expenses that are allocated to the franchisees' system must respond to requests for information from the city by deadlines established by the city. A franchisee is responsible for ensuring that such other entity responds to the city's requests. 
2.  Because federal law limits the time available for an initial response to a filing by a franchisee before the order contemplated by Section 5.40.050 issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to requests for information regarding its filing within five days of the date an information request is delivered to franchisee. The information may include the information the franchisee would be required to provide as part of any supplementary filing. 
(Ord. 523 § 3, 1993) 
5.40.110 - Duties of the city administrator. 
A.  The city administrator, or his designee, shall be responsible for administering the provisions herein. Without limitation and by way of illustration: 
1.  The city administrator, or his designee, shall ensure notices are given to the public and each franchisee as required herein and by FCC regulations. 
2.  The city administrator, or his designee, may submit requests for information to the franchisee and establish deadlines for response to them as provided in Section 5.40.100. 
3.  For good cause, the city administrator or his designee, may waive any provision herein or extend any deadline for filing or response except as to such matters that are mandatory under FCC regulations. 
4.  The city council shall rule on any request for confidentiality. 
5.  The city administrator or his designee, shall prepare the recommendations to the city council contemplated by Sections 5.40.050 and 5.40.060. If the city administrator or his designee, recommends that any increase be denied in whole or in part, it shall: 
a.  Propose a rate and explain the basis for its recommendation (it may propose that rates remain at existing levels); and 
b.  Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue; and 
c.  Notify the franchisee of its recommendation at the time it is submitted to the council. 
(Ord. 523 § 4, 1993) 
5.40.120 - Penalties and forfeitures. 
A.  Except as prohibited by federal law, a franchisee shall be subject to penalties and forfeitures under subsection B of this section below and its request for approval of a rate may be denied if it: 
1.  Knowingly submits false or fraudulent information to the city in connection with any rate proceeding; 
2.  Fails to comply with any lawful order or request of the city, including, but not limited to a request for information or an order setting rates; or 
3.  Evades or attempts to evade federal or local rate regulation; provided that, filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable is not in and of itself an evasion of federal or local rate regulation. 
B.  Penalties and may include any one, any combination or all of the following in an appropriate case: 
1.  Criminal Penalty. Fine of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each violation may be imposed. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense for which a separate fine may be imposed. 
2.  Civil Penalty. A civil penalty equal to one-thirtieth ( 1/30 ) of the gross monthly receipts for basic services, from all subscribers of the city, may be imposed for each day a violation continues. 
3.  Forfeiture. In cases where no other remedy is effective to stop the violation or provide a proper remedy, a forfeiture of the franchise may be ordered by the city council. 
4.  In any case where the city takes legal action, including the filing of suit in an appropriate form, judicial or administrative, to enforce any lawful order or request of the city or any provisions of these regulations, the franchisee shall pay the reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city. 
5.  No criminal fine, civil penalty or attorney's fee award set forth in this section shall be recoverable by the franchisee in a cost of service rate determination or otherwise. 
(Ord. 523 § 5, 1993) 
5.40.130 - Proprietary information. 
A.  If these provisions or any request for information requires the production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the city council determines that the preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. The city shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in information being withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied, (1) where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned to it; or (2) the franchisee may seek review within five (5) working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
B.  Any interested party may, file a request to inspect material withheld as proprietary with the city council. The city council shall weigh the policy considerations favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable franchisee that submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the franchisee may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal. 
(Ord. 523 § 6, 1993) 
5.40.140 - Petition for change in status. 
    Any franchisee may petition for a change in status in accordance with 49 C.F.R. 76.915, and the city shall consider that petition in accordance with 49 C.F.R. 76.915. The petition and three (3) copies must be filed with the city.

5.44.060 - Disconnection-Downgrades. 
A.  A subscriber may terminate or downgrade service at any time. Franchisee shall promptly disconnect, or downgrade, the services of any subscriber who so requests. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of service by a subscriber may be required. No charge may be imposed by franchisee for a cable service delivered after the date of a request for disconnection or downgrade of that service. However, franchisee may continue to levy a pro rata equipment charge on any equipment the subscriber is required to return to franchisee, if the equipment is not returned within five (5) business days after the date of disconnect request. 
B.  No charge may be imposed for any disconnection. Any charge for a downgrade will not exceed the average amount, over the last full calendar year, actually received for upgrades, except that an additional reasonable downgrade charge may be imposed where a promotion requires a subscriber to take a service for a set and limited period of time in order to qualify for the promotion. In such cases, in addition to satisfying any requirements of Section 5.44.050, the subscriber shall be notified, in writing, before the service is installed (1) that a downgrade charge will result if the subscriber downgrades before the end of a designated period, and (2) the amount of the downgrade charge.

A.  On streets running generally north and south: 
1.  Address assignments on the east side of the street shall be odd numbers. Address assignments on the west side of the street shall be even numbers. 
2.  As a street extends north and south from Center Street, the "hundreds" digit of any address on such street shall correspond to the block count the subject address is from Center Street. For example, an address located in the third block north or south of Center Street will be in the three hundred block. Where Center Street does not extend east or west far enough to intersect a north-south running street, the hundred block of that street will be determined from an imaginary extension of Center Street. For these purposes, a "block" means the section of a street between two consecutive intersecting streets. 
B.  On streets running generally east and west: 
1.  Address assignments on the south side of the street shall be odd numbers. Address assignments on the north side of the street shall be even numbers.

For example, an address located in the third block east or west of First Street will be in the three hundred block. Where First Street does not extend north or south far enough to intersect an east-west running street, the hundred block of that street will be determined from an imaginary extension of First Street. For these purposes, a "block" means the section of a street between two consecutive intersecting streets. 
C.  Where the layout of a street is irregular or unusual, a strict interpretation of subsections A and B of this section may not be applicable. In such cases, address assignments shall be made, with the Douglas planning director's concurrence, which best meet the intent of this code and preserve the established address pattern of the area. 
D.  Beginning with "XOO" and "XOl" on the even and odd numbered sides of a block, respectively, where "X" is the hundreds digit, each potential address provided for by this section shall cover twenty (20) feet, fronting on the street to which it applies, except in the Fairview Addition to the city, each number shall cover twenty-five (25) feet of frontage. Addresses actually assigned shall be those corresponding to near the center of the subject lot or building.

(Ord. 375 § 7-2, 1983) 
13.44.030 - Basis of user fee-Fee structure. 
    All users within the city's service area shall be assessed a monthly sewer user rate consisting of a customer service charge and a volume charge. 
A.  The customer service charge shall be assessed to recover costs that apply equally to each user of the system regardless of volume contribution. It shall be billed on a customer account basis. 
B.  The volume charge shall be the amount charged a customer for the quantity of wastewater contributed to the city's system during a billing period. 
1.  For the single-family residential and multifamily residential users, this fee shall be based on the average water used by that user during the winter quarter (December, January and February) as measured at the dwelling by the city water meter. A single-family residential and multifamily residential user may submit a written request to the city administrator or designated representative to use alternate months for the averaging period. The city administrator or designated representative is authorized to substitute different month of a calendar year to obtain a three (3) month averaging period to calculate the annual sewer average for the user and adjust the sewer user fee accordingly. The following situations may be considered by the city administrator or designated representative to select an alternate month to be used for the recalculation of the sewer user fee: weather conditions, shut-off of service, new ownership, irrigation, or leaks within the user's dwelling. The city administrator or designated representative may utilize the prior year's average when a three (3) month averaging period cannot be determined due to the situations noted herein. 
2.  For single-family residential users not having a winter water consumption history, their sewer bill for the first month of service and every month thereafter shall be based on the number of reported occupants times two thousand (2,000) gallons per occupant per month with a minimum implied water usage of two thousand (2,000) gallons per month. After a period of three (3) full months as measured at the dwelling by the city water meter, a single-family residential user may submit a written request to the city administrator or designated representative for a review of the average sewer consumption used by the user. The city administrator or designated representative will calculate the annual sewer average based on this period of three (3) full months and adjust the sewer user fee accordingly. For multifamily residential users not having a winter water consumption history, the sewer average shall be based on the previous owner's average. When a previous owner's average is not available due to new construction or shut off of services the sewer average shall be based on the number of reported occupants for all units times two thousand (2,000) gallons per occupant with a minimum implied water usage of two thousand (2,000) gallons per unit per month. Otherwise, the assigned average monthly water consumption will be used until such time as a winter quarter water consumption history is obtained for the individual user. 
3.  For residential users who purchase and move to another property within the city, the established volume charge will be transferred to the new property. 
C.  Charges shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the following schedule: 
1. Residential - Single family - Multifamily customer service charge, $ per account $3.48 Volume charge, $ per 1,000 gallons or any portion thereof (based on winter quarter average) $6.13 2. Commercial customer service charge, $ per account, per month $3.48 Volume charge, $ per 1,000 gallons or any portion thereof (based on monthly water usage) $6.13  
(Rates are current as of July 1, 2017, and are subject to modification by resolution pursuant to subsection D.) 
D.  The rates and charges established in this section may be modified by a resolution adopted and ratified by the governing body.

1.4 - Instructions for Using this Code 
As identified above, this Code includes ten (10) chapters. Any person or entity proposing to initiate a land use or construct upon or otherwise develop land within the City of Douglas is encouraged to review the chapter-by-chapter summary below, which includes general instructions for using each chapter as a component of the overall Code. 
Chapter 1 - General Provisions 
This chapter memorializes adoption of the Unified Land Development Code and includes provisions establishing the authority of the City to administer and interpret the Code. The provisions of this Chapter are frequently relied upon to provide clarity and consistency in the application of the regulations of the Code. 
Chapter 2 - Definitions and Acronyms 
The terms, acronyms, and definitions in Chapter 2 are intended to provide a single comprehensive source of definitions pertaining to the use and development of land. The lists of terms and acronyms are not intended to be limitless, but rather are intended to provide direction as to the meaning of terms that are commonly used in relation to the use and development of land. 
Chapter 3 - Application and Review Procedures 
Chapter 3 includes a set of step-by-step procedures for submitting, reviewing, and approving applications under this Code. The provisions in this Chapter address the processing requirements for each application type afforded under this Code, which can range in technical complexity from simple Residential Site Plan applications to more challenging Sketch Plan, Mixed-Use Planned Unit Development, Type B-LSR Development Plan, and Annexation applications. This Chapter should be considered the usual starting point for anyone seeking to initiate a specific development application within the incorporated boundaries of the City of Douglas. 
Chapter 4 - Zoning 
This Chapter includes provisions pertaining to the City's standard and special purpose zoning districts, the City Zoning Map, zone district-specific dimensional standards, use-specific development standards, and nonconforming uses and structures. A casual user of this Code is likely to rely upon this Chapter to provide a list of uses allowed in a certain zoning district or to provide the required front, rear, and side building setback requirements in a certain zoning district. An experienced user of this Code is likely to rely upon this Chapter to obtain more detailed development regulations, such as the specific requirements for processing a Mixed-Use Planned Unit Development application. 
Chapter 5 - General Development Standards 
The General Development Standards in this Chapter include requirements pertaining to the following: streets and sidewalks; parking and loading; lighting; fences and walls; drainage; hazards; landscaping and buffering; snow removal and storage; refuse storage; signs; architectural design; and water, wastewater, and utilities. The requirements and limitations for each of the above issues have been organized as to the applicability of each issue to certain land use types (e.g., single-family residential, commercial, industrial, etc.). All development within the City of Douglas shall be subject, to one degree or another, to the requirements of this Chapter. Users of this Code should review the requirements of this Chapter prior to creating plans depicting the layout and design of a proposed development. 
Chapter 6 - Use-Specific Development Standards 
Many of the allowed and conditional uses of each of the zoning districts outlined in Chapter 4 above are uses that inherently cause, or have the potential to cause, additional adverse impacts to adjoining property owners, the neighborhood, or to existing public infrastructure. This Chapter provides specific regulations pertaining to each of these uses. Many of the regulations function to provide mitigation of the potential adverse impacts of the uses by requiring the developer to comply with additional compatibility measures, such as increased building setbacks, screening and buffering, and landscaping or by limiting certain aspects of the operation, such as hours of operation, maximum use area, or seasonal restrictions. 
Chapter 7 - Subdivision Regulations 
This Chapter includes regulations for legally dividing land within the City of Douglas. The regulations address certain aspects of the division of land pertaining to the layout and design of a subdivision as well as the dedication of public land and development-related agreements. All users of this Code may, at some point in time, need to utilize the provisions of this Chapter since this Chapter applies to all divisions of land ranging from simple lot splits to multi-phase, large scale subdivisions. 
Chapter 8 - Construction of Public Improvements and Utilities 
The provisions of this Chapter pertain to the construction and installation of development-related public improvements and utilities. More specifically, this Chapter includes the following: design, submittal, and review requirements for public improvements; subdivision and development improvement agreements; estimates and financial assurance requirements; construction, inspection, and acceptance of public improvements; and requirements for the installation of utilities. Generally, only developers of medium to large scale projects are likely to rely upon the provisions of this Chapter. However, smaller scale development projects could trigger the requirement for minimal public improvements. 
Chapter 9 - Enforcement 
This Chapter includes language pertaining to the enforcement of the City's zoning and subdivision regulations. This Chapter also identifies the Community Development Director, and his or her designees, as the City Code Enforcement Officer and having the authority to enforce this Code. This Chapter also provides established protocol for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this Code. Only landowners within the City that are subject to enforcement of the zoning or subdivision regulations of this Code are likely to utilize or be subject to the provisions of this Chapter. 
Chapter 10 - Annexations, Additions, and De-Annexation 
This Chapter provides regulations pertaining to the processes for adding or removing land into or out of the incorporated boundaries of the City of Douglas. The regulations in this Chapter should be reviewed by any landowner seeking to develop his or her property in the City of Douglas.

3.3 - Mixed-Use Planned Unit Development (MU-PUD) Rezonings 
3.3.1  Intent and Applicability 
A.  Intent 
The intent of the MU-PUD zoning district is to provide an alternative zoning scheme that can be tailored to fit a proposed development that may not otherwise fit within a standard zoning district in terms of owner's desired development pattern, allowed uses, massing, densities, or type and mix of land uses. An applicant may propose an MU-PUD zoning district that accommodates development concepts that otherwise vary from strict compliance with the requirements of the City's standard zoning districts. The MU-PUD zoning district is a versatile zoning mechanism which should be used to encourage innovative and creative development design and to facilitate an appropriate mixture of land uses, including residential, commercial, open space, and other compatible land uses. The MU-PUD zoning district is not typically used to zone property to allow for the development of industrial land uses. A similar zoning mechanism, the Planned Light Industrial (PLI) zoning district, is available for developments proposing to use innovative design to develop a mixture of light industrial and commercial uses. This procedure is designed to allow for the processing, review, and approval of an MU-PUD zoning district in order to accomplish the following objectives: 
 To preserve the health, safety, and general welfare of the existing and future residents of the City of Douglas; 
 To permit adjustments to established development standards in order to encourage innovative development patterns that are more compatible with existing and planned land uses in the area; 
 To improve the siting, design, character, and quality of new development by allowing flexibility in terms of lot sizes, building heights, setbacks, and other site development requirements; 
 To encourage development that is responsive to the current market demand while still maintaining the character of the area; 
 To provide housing of all types and designs to be located in proximity to employment and activity centers such as shopping, recreational amenities, public gathering places, and community centers; 
 To minimize impacts on existing infrastructure and to encourage the most efficient use of public infrastructure while limiting the costs of providing services and to reduce the burden on existing streets and utilities by encouraging more efficient development; 
 To ensure that the layout, design, and construction of new development is compatible with the natural land forms and environmental conditions in the immediate and surrounding area, including scenic vistas, natural features and hazards, and environmentally sensitive areas; 
 To ensure the provision of active, usable open space; 
 To ensure that new development plans for and installs measures that are designed to minimize and, where necessary, mitigate adverse impacts to public services and infrastructure resulting from such development; and 
 To ensure that all mixed-use development is planned and developed in a manner that is in general conformance with the City of Douglas Master Plan. 
B.  Applicability 
The MU-PUD zoning district is a voluntary zoning that is custom-tailored to a specific development proposal. The MU-PUD zoning is not required in order to develop within the City of Douglas. A property owner may, however, seek approval of a MU-PUD rezoning request if the owner's proposed development scenario for the property will not conform to the use and dimensional requirements of the City's standard zoning districts and if the property proposed to be zoned MU-PUD consists of at least ten (10) acres. The MU-PUD zoning district is typically used for medium to large-scale developments that include a mixture of open space and residential and commercial uses. Development within a MU-PUD zoning district may or may not be phased over an extended period of time. 
3.3.2  Pre-Application Conference 
A pre-application conference with the City Community Development Director or his/her designee is required prior to making a formal application for approval of a MU-PUD rezoning request. The purpose of the pre-application conference is to work with the Community Development Department to identify any major issues or potential problems that may arise during the process of reviewing a proposed MU-PUD rezoning. The conference should also serve as an initial collaboration with City staff to begin developing appropriate strategies for mitigating and/or offsetting the impacts of the development and any identified major issues or problems. 
3.3.3  Application Submittal Requirements 
A formal application for approval of a MU-PUD rezoning shall include a MU-PUD development plan map, a completed MU-PUD rezoning application form, payment of the appropriate application fee, and documentation sufficient to address the standards and review criteria in this Section. If the applicant does not include the project-specific development standards on the face of the MU-PUD development plan, then a MU-PUD development guide shall also be required in support of the MU-PUD rezoning application. The submittal requirements and appropriate quantity of each submittal requirement, including electronic copies, shall be established by the Community Development Department at or following the pre-application conference, but prior to submitting a formal application for approval of a MU-PUD rezoning request. 
3.3.4  MU-PUD Zoning District Development Plan Requirements 
All MU-PUD rezoning applications shall include an MU-PUD development plan depicting the MU-PUD zoning area. The purpose of the development plan is to provide information necessary to rezone a property to the MU-PUD zoning district and to provide a graphical representation that will serve as the zoning of the subject property following approval of the MU-PUD rezoning request. The MU-PUD development plan is a comprehensive and binding zoning document which details land use parameters and the general location and massing of buildings, landscaping, open space, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, architectural standards, and standards to ensure vertical and horizontal use-to-use compatibility. The standards for development in a MU-PUD development plan serve as customized zoning for the subject property rather than relying on the general development requirements of a Standard Zoning District in Section 4.4 of this Code. Applicants proposing a MU-PUD rezoning may elect to provide the project-specific development standards for the MU-PUD zoning district within a MU-PUD development guide rather than incorporating such development standards onto the face of the MU-PUD development plan. Under no circumstances shall the MU-PUD development guide be allowed as the only source of information in support of the MU-PUD rezoning request. All MU-PUD rezoning requests shall be supported by an associated visual depiction of the MU-PUD zoning district in the form of a MU-PUD development plan. The layout and design of the plan shall comply with the MU-PUD zoning requirements of Chapter 4 and the subdivision requirements of Chapter 7 of this Code. 
A.  General Requirements

3.4 - Planned Light Industrial (PLI) Rezonings 
3.4.1  Intent and Applicability 
A.  Intent 
The intent of the PLI zoning district is to provide an alternative zoning scheme for the development of a mixture of light industrial and commercial uses that can be tailored to fit a proposed development that may not otherwise fit within a standard zoning district in terms of the allowed uses, building siting and massing, and use intensities. The PLI zoning is designed to accommodate innovative light industrial and commercial development concepts and allow for variations from strict compliance with the City's standard zoning districts. The PLI zoning district is a versatile zoning mechanism which should be used to encourage innovative and creative development design and to facilitate an appropriate mixture of light industrial and commercial land uses. The PLI zoning district shall not be used to zone property to allow for the development of residential uses. A similar zoning mechanism, the Mixed-Use Planned Unit Development (PLI) zoning district, is available for developments proposing to use innovative design to develop a mixture of residential and commercial uses. This procedure is designed to allow for the processing, review, and approval of a PLI rezoning request in order to accomplish the following objectives: 
 To preserve the health, safety, and general welfare of the existing and future residents of the City of Douglas; 
 To permit adjustments to established development standards in order to encourage innovative industrial and commercial development patterns that are more compatible with existing and planned land uses in the area; 
 To improve the siting, design, character, and quality of new development by allowing flexibility in terms of lot sizes, building heights, setbacks, and other site development requirements; 
 To encourage development that is responsive to the current market demand while still maintaining the character of the area; 
 To minimize impacts on existing infrastructure and to encourage the most efficient use of public infrastructure while limiting the costs of providing services and to reduce the burden on existing streets and utilities by encouraging more efficient development; 
 To ensure that the layout, design, and construction of new development is compatible with the natural land forms and environmental conditions in the immediate and surrounding area, including scenic vistas, natural features and hazards, and environmentally sensitive areas; 
 To ensure the provision of use-to-use transition areas, including use intensity transitions, incorporating appropriate screening and buffering, and constructing aesthetically compatible buildings and structures. 
 To ensure that all adverse impacts commonly associated with light industrial and commercial uses are appropriately mitigated and that all nuisances resulting from such uses are adequately abated. 
 To ensure that new development plans for and installs measures that are designed to minimize and, where necessary, mitigate adverse impacts to public services and infrastructure resulting from such development; and 
 To ensure that all mixed-use light industrial and commercial developments are planned and developed in a manner that is in general conformance with the City of Douglas Master Plan. 
B.  Applicability 
The PLI zoning district is a voluntary zoning that is custom-tailored to a specific development proposal. The PLI zoning is not required in order to develop within the City of Douglas. A property owner may, however, seek approval of a PLI rezoning request if the owner's proposed development scenario for the property will not conform to the use and dimensional requirements of the I (Industrial) standard zoning district and if the property proposed to be zoned PLI consists of at least ten (10) acres. The PLI zoning district is typically used for light industrial and commercial mixed-use developments. Development within a PLI zoning district may or may not be phased over an extended period of time. 
3.4.2  Pre-Application Conference 
A pre-application conference with the City Community Development Director or his/her designee is required prior to making a formal application for approval of a PLI rezoning request. The purpose of the pre-application conference is to work with the Community Development Department to identify any major issues or potential problems that may arise during the process of reviewing a proposed PLI rezoning. The conference should also serve as an initial collaboration with City staff to begin developing appropriate strategies for mitigating and/or offsetting the impacts of the development and any identified major issues or problems. 
3.4.3  Application Submittal Requirements 
A formal application for approval of a PLI rezoning shall include a PLI development plan map, a completed PLI rezoning application form, payment of the appropriate application fee, and documentation sufficient to address the standards and review criteria in this Section. If the applicant does not include the project-specific development standards on the face of the PLI development plan, then a PLI development guide shall also be required in support of the PLI rezoning application. The submittal requirements and appropriate quantity of each submittal requirement, including electronic copies, shall be established by the Community Development Department at or following the pre-application conference, but prior to submitting a formal application for approval of a PLI rezoning request. 
3.4.4  PLI Zoning District Development Plan Requirements 
All PLI rezoning applications shall include a PLI development plan depicting the PLI zoning area. The purpose of the development plan is to provide information necessary to rezone a property to the PLI zoning district and to provide a graphical representation that will serve as the zoning of the subject property following approval of the PLI rezoning request. The PLI development plan is a comprehensive and binding zoning document which details land use parameters and the general location and massing of buildings, landscaping, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, architectural standards, and standards to ensure internal and perimeter use-to-use compatibility. The standards for development in a PLI development plan serve as customized zoning for the subject property rather than relying on the general development requirements of a Standard Zoning District in Section 4.4 of this Code. Applicants proposing a PLI rezoning may elect to provide the project-specific development standards for the PLI zoning district within a PLI development guide rather than incorporating such development standards onto the face of the PLI development plan. Under no circumstances shall the PLI development guide be allowed as the only source of information in support of the PLI rezoning request. All PLI rezoning requests shall be supported by an associated visual depiction of the PLI zoning district in the form of a PLI development plan. The layout and design of the plan shall comply with the PLI zoning requirements of Chapter 4 and the subdivision requirements of Chapter 7 of this Code.

 Conflict 
In the event of a conflict between two or more provisions within this plan (or between the provisions of this plan and the provisions of the associated development guide) that cover the same subject matter, the most restrictive provision shall apply. 
 Maximum Level of Development 
The intensity level for industrial and commercial development shown on this plan is the maximum development requested for platting or construction. The actual level of industrial and commercial development may be less due to implementation of subdivision or development plan requirements, land development capacity, or other conditions or modification imposed by the City Council.

 A change in the character of the area in which the subject property is located that causes the current designation(s) of the subject property to be inaccurate or inappropriate (e.g., a series of rezoning approvals or conditional use approvals in the area that deviate or contradict the approved designations in the Master Plan); 
 Evidence that the designation(s) of the subject property was erroneous at the time of adopting the Master Plan (e.g., identifying a property or area as future commercial land based upon the current zoning of the land as commercial, which was later discovered to be inaccurate due to mapping error); or 
 Current factual details of the subject property that contradict the factual details that were previously utilized in determining the designation(s) of the subject property cause the designation to be inaccurate or inappropriate (e.g., a property is designated for public use due to the fact that a governmental entity owned the property when the Master Plan was adopted but that has since been sold to a private entity). 
In addition to including or addressing one of the above requirements, the surveys and studies supporting the Master Plan amendment request shall also identify how the proposed amendment to the Master Plan will better "promote the general welfare as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development," as required under W.S. § 15-1-504.

( Ord. No. 967, § 42, 8-10-2015 ) 
4.3 - Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots 
4.3.1  Intent 
This section is intended to regulate legally existing uses, structures, and lots that do not comply with one or more of the requirements of this Code. Uses, structures, and lots that are legally existing but that do not comply with one or more of the requirements of this Code shall be referred to as nonconforming uses, structures, and lots. The City seeks to allow nonconforming uses, structures, and lots to continue to exist while encouraging such nonconformities to be brought into conformance with this Code to the greatest extent practical. The following regulations shall be interpreted to recognize the interests of a property owner in continuing a legally existing nonconformity while also ensuring that any extension, expansion, or change in the nonconformity is in compliance with the requirements of this Code. 
4.3.2  General Provisions 
A.  Continuation of Use 
A nonconforming use may be continued and a nonconforming building may continue to be occupied, except as otherwise restricted in this Section. A pre-existing, nonconforming use which would otherwise require approval of a conditional use permit shall be presumed to have the required conditional use permit. 
B.  Change of Building or Use 
A nonconforming building or use may be changed to a conforming building or use. Upon establishing a conforming building or use, the owner of land or operator of a use may not be allowed to later change the use back to a nonconforming building or use. A legal nonconforming use shall not be changed to a different nonconforming use. Any change of a nonconforming use to another use shall immediately terminate the right to continue the nonconforming use. 
C.  Interruption and Abandonment 
If a nonconforming use is interrupted for a period of one (1) year or more, the nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned and the structure and land where the nonconforming use existed shall then only be used for conforming uses. Any nonconforming use may be deemed abandoned after a period of less than one (1) year if the property owner submits a request for a determination of abandonment to the Planning Department or if the owner engages in action which unambiguously expresses an intent to abandon. 
D.  Burden of Proof 
The owner of land or operator of the use shall have the burden of proving the legal status of a nonconforming structure or use. This requirement shall also apply to the owner of land or operator of a use in proving that a nonconforming use has been continuously maintained. 
E.  Construction Approved Prior to Enactment of Regulations 
Nothing contained in this chapter shall require any change in plans, construction, or designated use of a building or structure for which a building permit has been issued and the construction of which shall have been diligently pursued within three (3) months of the date of such permit. 
4.3.3  Restoration 
A.  Damage to Structure or Use 
A nonconforming structure damaged or partially destroyed by fire, explosion, or as a result of natural events may be restored to the exact same size, location, and layout as it existed immediately prior to the damaging event so long as the restoration complies with the following: 
i.  The value of the damage is less than fifty percent (50%) of the Converse County Assessor's assessed value of the damaged structure; 
ii.  The restoration or reconstruction does not extend beyond the original limits of the structure in setback, lot area coverage, height, and floor area; and 
iii.  All restoration is started within one (1) year from the date of the damaging event and is completed within two years. 
B.  Damage to Structure by an Intentional Act of the Property Owner or Agent 
The right to continue a nonconforming use or restore a nonconforming structure shall immediately terminate if the structure is destroyed by an intentional act of the property owner or their agent. 
C.  Requirement for Development Plan or Site Plan Application 
Restoration activities meeting the requirements of this Section shall not proceed until and unless a Development Plan or Site Plan application is reviewed and approved by the Planning Department. The type of application and associated review fee shall be determined by the Planning Director based upon the nature and extent of the restoration. 
4.3.4  Enlargement or Expansion of a Nonconforming Use 
A.  Within an Existing Building 
A nonconforming use, when located within a structure, may be extended throughout the existing structure so long as any structural alterations of the structure to allow for the extension of the use throughout the structure are in compliance with the requirements of this Section. 
B.  Expansion of Use by Conditional Use Permit 
A nonconforming use shall not be extended or enlarged unless the use is a conditional use in the respective zoning district and the owner of the land or the operator of the use has obtained approval of a conditional use permit application to extend or enlarge the nonconforming use on the same property. 
4.3.5  Alteration of a Nonconforming Structure 
A.  Limitations of Structure Alterations 
A nonconforming building or structure may be altered, improved, or reconstructed provided that the aggregate cost of such work does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the actual value of the building or structure, unless the building or structure is changed to a conforming use. Under no circumstances shall the alteration, improvement, or reconstruction of a nonconforming structure result in an increase in the degree of nonconformity of the structure. Additions and extensions to the nonconforming structure shall be allowed provided that such additions and extensions conform to the dimensional standards of the respective zoning district. 
B.  Maintenance 
Normal repairs and maintenance of a nonconforming structure are encouraged and shall not result in termination of nonconforming status of the structure. Under no circumstances shall a repair to or maintenance of a nonconforming structure result in an increase in the nonconformity of the structure. 
C.  Unsafe Buildings 
Any structure wherein a nonconforming use is operated or any nonconforming structure declared as unsafe by the City Building Official may be strengthened or restored to a safe condition without resulting in termination of the legal nonconforming status of the use or structure. 
D.  Movement or Relocation of a Nonconforming Structure 
Any nonconforming structure that is moved or otherwise relocated shall be required to conform to the zoning requirements of the receiving property. 
E.  Mobile Homes 
A mobile home may be replaced within a nonconforming mobile home park, on a unit by unit basis, or on a legally existing nonconforming lot if the replacement mobile home complies with the maximum height and setback requirements of the respective zoning district. Mobile homes may be replaced by right if such replacement can be accomplished in compliance with the applicable setback standards. Replacement of a mobile home with a stick-built home shall be allowed. The Community Development Director shall have the authority to administratively approve dimensional relief of the applicable setback requirements for the replacement of the mobile home with a stick-built home up to twenty percent (20%) of a side or rear setback requirement. Under no circumstances shall the Director approve relief of a setback requirement if such relief would result in a minimum setback less than five (5) feet from a side lot line and ten (10) feet from a rear lot line. The Director shall not have the authority to approve relief from the applicable front lot setback requirements for replacement of a mobile home with a stick-built home. 
4.3.6  Nonconforming Signs 
Nonconforming signs shall be regulated pursuant to the restrictions and provisions in Chapter 5, General Development Standards, of this Code.

 The owner of land within the proposed PLI zoning district is also the owner of record of the property that is proposed to receive the transferred open space; 
 The preservation and/or development of open space on the receiving property will provide a greater benefit to the current and future residents of the City of Douglas than would be provided as a result of full compliance with the open space requirements within the PLI planning area; 
 The quality of usable open space on the receiving property will be more regional in nature and will represent and provide a logical connection or extension of existing usable open space and/or pedestrian pathways; 
 The owner of both properties has provided a plan for construction of the transferred open space and financial assurance sufficient to secure performance of such construction; and 
 The owner of both properties has provided a plan for maintenance of the transferred open space and financial plan for ensuring the performance of such plan. 
J.  Streets, Alleys, and Sidewalks 
i.  The requirements of Section 5.10, Streets, Alleys, and Sidewalks, of this Code shall be the minimum standards for development within a PLI zoning district. 
ii.  The standard cross-sections and dimensional details may be modified by recommendation of the City Engineer and may be approved by the City Council as a trade-off in exchange for the provision of public improvements in excess of those improvements necessary to facilitate and mitigate the impacts of the proposed development. Modifications to the standard street or roadway cross-sections shall not be approved unless such modifications are found by the City Council to be in the best interest of the current and future residents and occupants of the City of Douglas. 
iii.  The streets and internal transportation network within a PLI zoning district shall be laid out and designed to ensure connectivity to the existing and planned transportation network. The use of cul-de-sacs is discouraged within a PLI zoning district. The use of the cul-de-sac shall be limited to instances where connectivity with an adjacent street is not logical or is physically impossible due to existing development on the adjacent property or due to the presence of a physiographic, geographic, or environmental constraint. 
K.  Parking, Loading, Maneuvering 
i.  Section 5.8, Parking, Loading, Maneuvering, and Snow Removal, of this Code shall be the minimum standards for development within a PLI zoning district. 
ii.  On-street parking within a PLI zoning district shall be strictly prohibited. 
iii.  Loading areas for buildings and uses within a PLI zoning district are encouraged to be located at the rear or side of buildings and shall be screened from view from existing, approved, or planned residential uses and from view from public or private streets. 
L.  Equipment and Materials Storage 
i.  The requirements of Section 6.16, Construction Equipment Storage, and Section 6.25, Outdoor Storage, of this Code, as applicable, shall be the minimum standards for equipment and materials storage within a PLI zoning district. 
ii.  Increased allowances in outdoor storage may be approved as a trade-off in exchange for increased use-to-use buffering and screening. Under no circumstances shall outdoor equipment and/or materials storage be sited between the principal light industrial or commercial building on the subject site and an adjacent residential zoning district or existing or approved residential use. All areas of outdoor storage shall be sited a minimum of 100 feet from the property line shared with a residential zoning district or an existing or approved residential use. All areas of outdoor storage shall be screened from view from any residential zoning district or existing or approved residential use and from any public street. Screening of outdoor storage areas shall, at a minimum, include a six (6) foot 100% opaque fence or decorative screening wall. All decorative walls exceeding six (6) feet in height and/or twenty (20) feet in length shall be designed and certified by a licensed engineer in the State of Wyoming. 
M.  Signage 
i.  A master sign program shall be required for each phase of a PLI planning area, if phasing is proposed, or for the entire PLI planning area, if phasing is not proposed. The master sign program shall provide a comprehensive set of development-specific standards for signage pertaining to the following: allowed sign types and sizes, construction materials, color and design scheme, acceptable siting locations, and maximum total sign area of the respective phase or PLI planning area, as applicable. 
ii.  The requirements of Section 5.9, Signs, of this Code, shall be the minimum standards for design, siting, and construction of signs within a PLI zoning district. 
iii.  Increased allowances in sign area may be approved as a trade-off in exchange for increased architectural design and construction standards for proposed buildings and signage or for the provision of increased use-to-use buffering and screening. 
N.  Drainage

4.5 - Density and Dimensional Standards 
4.5.1  General 
Tables 4-2 and 4-3 below identify the density and dimensional requirements for each of the standard zoning districts. The methods for calculating and interpreting dimensional measurements and the definition of terms used in this section shall be pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1, General Provisions, and Chapter 2, Definitions and Acronyms, of this Code, respectively. 
4.5.2  Exceptions to Dimensional Standards 
A.  Setback Exceptions 
Steps, uncovered porches, and covered but unenclosed porches, on the first story which do not extend more than ten (10) feet beyond the front wall of the building are not considered in the front or side yard requirements. The methods for calculating and interpreting dimensional measurements and the definition of terms used in this section shall be pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1, General Provisions, and Chapter 2, Definitions and Acronyms, of this Code, respectively. 
B.  Exceptions for Lots of Record 
The phrase "lot of record" is defined in Chapter 2, Definitions and Acronyms, of this Code. The following exceptions to the density and dimensional standards apply to all lots of record: 
i.  Any lot of record may be used as a building site if such building complies with the minimum setback and maximum height requirements of this Code. No permit shall be issued for more than one (1) dwelling unit on any lot having less than the minimum area per dwelling unit of the zone in which the lot is located; 
ii.  Each minimum setback requirement (front, rear, and side) may be reduced by two (2) inches for each one (1) foot by which such lot is narrower than fifty-five (55) feet, provided that no side yard setback shall be reduced to less than five (5) feet from the lot line and/or utility easement; and 
iii.  In any residential zone where a lot of record adjoins lots having existing front yards less than the minimum required by this title, the minimum front yard setback for the lot of record shall be the average of the existing front yard setbacks for the two (2) adjoining lots, or if only one (1) of the adjoining lots is built upon, the front yard setback for the lot of record shall be the average of the following: 1) the existing front yard setback for the lot that is built upon and 2) the minimum front yard setback required in the respective zoning district.

4.6.3  GRN, Green Space Zoning District 
The GRN (Green Space) zoning district is intended to promote open vegetated areas capable of maintaining natural wildlife habitat and to protect the scenic and ecological qualities of environmentally sensitive areas. The district is commonly applied to publicly owned property or property for which scenic or greenspace easements have been dedicated or purchased for the use and/or enjoyment of the public. 
4.6.4  MU-PUD, Mixed-Use Planned Unit Development Zoning District 
A.  Intent 
The Mixed Use Planned Unit Development (MU-PUD) zoning district is intended to accommodate high-quality commercial, office, residential, commercial mixed-use, and residential mixed-use development. The purpose of the following regulations is to allow for increased flexibility in the siting and design of land uses and zoning standards within a comprehensively planned area. The MU-PUD zoning district allows for the vertical and horizontal mixture and siting of commercial and residential uses and the establishment of development-specific standards, including: 
 Residential density ranges; 
 Maximum commercial and office square footages; 
 Vertical and horizontal dimensional standards; 
 Maximum lot area coverages; 
 Open space siting and design; 
 Building setbacks; 
 Acceptable building types; 
 On and off-street parking; 
 Street layout and design; and 
 Signage. 
In exchange for the flexibility and design benefits gained through the use of the MU-PUD zoning district, proposed MU-PUD developments shall demonstrate and provide a combination of the following: 
 Innovative and exceptional building design, including the use of higher quality building materials and architectural features; 
 A mixture of permitted and conditional land uses that are appropriately sited to ensure use-to-use compatibility within the proposed development and in relation to existing and approved adjacent land uses; 
 A mixture of housing types and styles; 
 A comprehensive plan for integrating landscaping, screening, and buffering in a manner that creates safe and attractive pedestrian spaces while preserving and enhancing the character of the area; 
 Preserving areas as usable open space; 
 Providing pedestrian amenities; 
 Developing community amenities and public gathering spaces; and 
 Designing and constructing public improvements that meet or exceed the standards of this Code. 
B.  Enforcement 
The City Council shall have exclusive enforcement authority over all use, density, dimensional, and development standards, and engineering criteria, including modifications of the same, within a MU-PUD zoning district. 
C.  Phasing 
Large scale MU-PUD zoning district development should include a comprehensive phasing plan for the construction of buildings, roads, necessary drainage facilities, and the extension of utilities. The phasing plan shall present a logical progression for cost effective extensions of project-dependent infrastructure. 
D.  Restrictions 
A MU-PUD rezoning shall not be approved if the purpose of the proposed MU-PUD zoning district is to circumvent the zoning variance process in Section 3.15 of this Code or to otherwise circumvent or undermine the intent of this Code. Use of the MU-PUD zoning district shall not be used for the development or redevelopment of a single use on a single property or to rezone a parcel to allow for mixed-use development where there is no intent to subdivide the subject parcel. 
E.  General Standards 
i.  Uses 
The allowed, conditional, temporary, and accessory uses within a specific MU-PUD zoning district shall be established by the City Council in approving a MU-PUD rezoning. In establishing the use allowances in the MU-PUD, reference shall not be made to existing zone districts otherwise established by this Code. 
ii.  Restrictions 
 Industrial and light industrial land uses shall be prohibited in the MU-PUD zone district. Such uses shall only occur in the I (Industrial) and PLI (Planned Light Industrial) zone districts. 
 The mixture of residential uses shall only occur on the second floor or higher of any residential and commercial or office mixed-use building within the MU-PUD zone district. 
iii.  Additional Standards 
 All buildings, structures, and land uses in the MU-PUD district shall be located, designed, and operated in accordance with the standards established by the specific MU-PUD development plan and development guide, if a development guide is included in support of the MU-PUD rezoning request. 
 Specific use and development standards shall be established within the specific MU-PUD zoning district for certain unique land use relationships such as vertical and horizontal mixed-use scenarios, use-to-use transitional areas, and the siting and use of open space, community amenities, and public gathering spaces. 
 All MU-PUD zoning district regulations should be designed so as to encourage neighborhood and pedestrian-scale commercial and office uses and appropriate live-work scenarios. Large-scale retail and regional commercial uses should be designed and sited in a logical manner based upon the existing and proposed roadway network and upon the existing land use pattern adjacent to the perimeter of the MU-PUD zoning district. 
 The provisions of this Code, as amended from time to time, shall apply where a specific MU-PUD zoning district is silent, contradictory, or unclear on a particular issue. 
F.  Architectural Standards 
i.  At a minimum, the architectural design standards of Section 5.2, Architectural Design Standards, of this Code shall apply to the development of structures and uses within a MU-PUD zoning district. 
ii.  A clearly identifiable and uniform architectural theme shall be required within a MU-PUD zoning district. 
iii.  The same exterior building height and/or elevation shall not be repeated within a 200-foot block length or upon four (4) consecutive lots within the MU-PUD zoning district. 
iv.  Residential structures with attached garages shall be designed in a manner that front-loaded garages are not the dominant visual features of the street-side elevation and shall be recessed toward the back of the lot at a minimum of five (5) feet from the front of the residential structure. The Community Development Department Director shall have the authority to determine the front elevation of a proposed residential structure for the purposes of administering these regulations. 
v.  Exterior building façades and frontages shall incorporate alternating recesses for individual tenant units within the same building. 
vi.  The siting and construction of buildings shall be street and pedestrian orientated. The Community Development Department Director shall have the authority to approve an alternative siting plan where site-specific circumstances or restrictions inhibit an applicant's ability to comply with this requirement. 
G.  Density, Bulk, and Dimensional Standards 
i.  The MU-PUD development plan and development guide, if included within a specific MU-PUD zoning district, shall establish the minimum and maximum density and dimensional standards for land uses authorized within the district, including, but not limited to, minimum lot sizes, maximum densities, minimum lot widths, setbacks, maximum building coverage, maximum building height, and minimum separation distances between specific uses. 
ii.  In establishing the density and dimensional standards in a MU-PUD zoning district, reference shall not be made to existing zoning districts established by this Code. 
iii.  Density and dimensional standards that do not meet the minimum or maximum limits, as applicable, for similar zoning districts and land uses established by this Code shall be supported by trade-offs in the form of increased design and development standards that support vertical and horizontal mixed-use scenarios and include increased architectural design standards, compatible building siting, bulk, and orientation, and additional landscaping, buffering, and screening. 
iv.  Any MU-PUD zoning district that allows for a maximum building height that exceeds the maximum building height of a comparable standard zoning district, as outlined in this Chapter, shall be required to incorporate a combination of building step-backs, decreased building widths, balconies, or other architectural design elements for any portion of a building extending above the second floor. 
v.  Additional landscaping, buffering, and screening shall not be considered acceptable tradeoffs as a means of mitigating increases to the maximum building height. 
H.  Landscape, Buffering and Screening 
i.  The requirements in Section 5.5, Landscaping, Buffering, and Screening, shall be considered the minimum standards for landscaping, buffering, and screening within a MU-PUD zoning district. 
ii.  The MU-PUD zoning district shall establish uniform landscape, buffering, and screening requirements for land uses and transitions between different land uses and areas, including but not limited to, street trees and roadway landscaping buffers, internal landscaping, parking lot landscaping and screening, and buffering and screening for differing or sensitive uses within and adjacent to the MU-PUD zoning district. 
iii.  Uniform standards shall be established for landscaping, buffering, and screening along the MU-PUD zoning district boundary to improve and ensure use-to-use and zoning-district-to-zoning-district compatibility. 
iv.  Standards for use, density, and intensity transitions between distinct use areas shall be established by the MU-PUD development plan and/or development guide. 
v.  Reduced screening and buffering between uses may be approved as a trade-off in exchange for increased design features, such as building massing and orientation, areas dedicated to outdoor seating, public plazas, parks, and other open space and pedestrian amenities. 
I.  Open Space 
i.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the gross land area within a MU-PUD zone district planning area shall be set aside as open space. Individual phases within the MU-PUD are not required to provide fifteen percent (15%) open space if a master open space plan, depicting compliance with the required fifteen (15%) open space standard, is provided with the overall MU-PUD development plan. Each phase, if phasing is proposed, of a MU-PUD development plan shall include some portion of the required open space and shall have immediate access to an area of usable open space. 
ii.  No less than 25% of required open space of a MU-PUD zoning district shall be contiguous and usable for active or passive recreational use. Open space for active or passive use shall not include drainage facilities or areas that include natural hazards. Examples of active or passive open space uses include trails, parks, interpretative parks, outdoor recreational facilities, athletic fields, wildlife viewing areas, and other similar uses. 
iii.  Usable open space in the form of community, neighborhood, or pocket parks shall be located within a one-quarter (1/4) mile distance from all single-family, two-family, and multi-family residential dwellings.

vi.  The City Council shall consider the following when evaluating the quality of the proposed open space within a MU-PUD rezoning request: 
 Whether the proposed open space area(s) is consistent with the goals and policies of the City of Douglas Master Plan; 
 The environmental characteristics and significance of the proposed open space area(s); 
 Whether the location, use, and relationship of the proposed open space areas is compatible with the distinct planning areas within the MU-PUD zoning district. 
 Whether public or private common use open space area(s) will be available to and accessible by residents of any distinct residential area(s); 
 Whether the plan for usable open space includes the provision of adequate bicycle and pedestrian trails; 
 Whether the plan for open space will improve buffering and screening between the MU-PUD development and adjacent existing and planned land uses; 
 Whether the open space will provide neighborhood, community, and regional recreational opportunities for future residents in the proposed MU-PUD zoning district and for the existing and future residents of the City of Douglas; 
 Whether the applicable school district standards for the number, type and location of public school recreational facilities can be met if the proposed open space area(s) are anticipated to allow joint school-public use; and 
 Whether the proposed open space area(s) will help preserve view corridors both within and through the property and protect and/or enhance other scenic assets. 
 The design and construction, as appropriate, of open space within a MU-PUD zoning district shall be considered a public improvement similar to the design and construction of other public improvements such as roads, drainage facilities, sidewalks, etc. All open space areas within a specific phase of a MU-PUD planning area, if phasing is proposed, or for the entire MU-PUD planning area, if phasing is not proposed, shall be installed concurrent with the other public improvements with the initial Final Plat or Development Plan in the MU-PUD zoning district. The design and installation of all open space, pursuant to the procedures outlined immediately above, shall be completed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building within the applicable phase or within the MU-PUD planning area, as applicable. 
 Financial assurance in the form of cash, letter of credit, or bond in an amount necessary to ensure that the City will have the ability to develop the subject open space and common areas in the event that the developer defaults on the requirement to do the same. The requirement of the developer to develop the subject open space shall be included in the associated subdivision improvement agreement for the initial final plat application or as part of the development improvement agreement for the initial development plan application. The determination for inclusion of the construction of open space areas into either a subdivision improvement agreement or a development improvement agreement shall be made by the City Council in response to a request from the developer at the time of taking final action on the respective application. 
 Open space and common areas, unless otherwise dedicated to the City, shall be protected from commercial or residential redevelopment by covenants, deed restrictions, plat restrictions, conditions of approval, or any other mechanisms approved by the City Council. 
 Provisions for continuous maintenance of open space within a MU-PUD zoning district shall be established as part of the MU-PUD rezoning request and shall be memorialized by notation on the face of the MU-PUD development plan cover sheet, unless such open space is otherwise dedicated to the City for ownership and maintenance. 
vii.  The City Council may allow transfer of up to 33% of the required open space acreage and 33% of the usable open space acreage from a proposed MU-PUD zoning district area to another location within the City in exchange for increased residential density or commercial intensity within the MU-PUD planning area. Any request to transfer open space acreage shall comply with the following: 
 The owner of land within the proposed MU-PUD zoning district is also the owner of record of the property that is proposed to receive the transferred open space; 
 The preservation and/or development of open space on the receiving property will provide a greater benefit to the current and future residents of the City of Douglas than would be provided as a result of full compliance with the open space requirements within the MU-PUD planning area; 
 The quality of usable open space on the receiving property will be more regional in nature and will represent and provide a logical connection or extension of existing usable open space and/or pedestrian pathways; 
 The owner of both properties has provided a plan for construction of the transferred open space and financial assurance sufficient to secure performance of such construction; and 
 The owner of both properties has provided a plan for maintenance of the transferred open space and financial plan for ensuring the performance of such plan.

The PLI development plan and development guide, if included within a specific PLI zoning district, shall establish the use and dimensional standards for land uses authorized within the district, including, but not limited to, minimum lot sizes, minimum and maximum square footages or acreages, minimum lot widths, setbacks, maximum building coverage, maximum building height, and minimum separation distances between specific uses. 
ii.  In establishing the intensity and dimensional standards in a PLI zoning district, reference shall not be made to existing zoning districts established by this Code. 
iii.  Intensity and dimensional standards that do not meet the minimum or maximum limits, as applicable, for similar zoning districts and land uses established by this Code shall be supported by trade-offs in the form of increased design and development standards that support horizontal mixed-use scenarios and include increased architectural design standards, compatible building siting, bulk, and orientation, and additional landscaping, buffering, and screening. 
iv.  Any PLI zoning district that allows for a maximum building height that exceeds the maximum building height of a comparable standard zoning district, as outlined in this Chapter, shall be required to incorporate a combination of building step-backs, decreased building widths, or other architectural design elements for any portion of a building extending above twenty-five (25) feet from finished grade. 
v.  Additional landscaping, buffering, and screening shall not be considered acceptable tradeoffs as a means of mitigating increases to the maximum building height. 
H.  Landscape, Buffering and Screening 
i.  The requirements in Section 5.5, Landscaping, Buffering, and Screening, shall be considered the minimum standards for landscaping, buffering, and screening within a PLI zoning district. 
ii.  The PLI zoning district shall establish uniform landscaping, buffering, and screening requirements for land uses and transitions between different land uses and areas, including but not limited to, street trees and roadway landscaping buffers, internal landscaping, parking lot landscaping and screening, and buffering and screening for differing or sensitive uses adjacent to the PLI zoning district. 
iii.  Uniform standards shall be established for landscaping, buffering, and screening along the PLI zoning district boundary to improve and ensure use-to-use and zoning-district-to-zoning-district compatibility. Increased buffering and screening shall be incorporated along any PLI zoning district boundary adjacent to a residential zoning district or an approved or existing residential use. 
iv.  Standards for use and intensity transitions between distinct use areas shall be established by the PLI development plan and/or development guide. 
I.  Open Space 
i.  A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the gross land area within a PLI zone district planning area shall be set aside as open space. Individual phases within the PLI are not required to provide ten percent (10%) open space if a master open space plan, depicting compliance with the required ten (10%) open space standard, is provided with the overall PLI development plan. Each phase, if phasing is proposed, of a PLI development plan that includes a commercial component shall include some portion of the required open space and shall have immediate access to an area of usable open space. 
ii.  No less than 25% of required open space of a PLI zoning district shall be contiguous and usable for active or passive recreational use. Open space for active or passive use shall not include drainage facilities or areas that include natural hazards. Examples of active or passive open space uses include trails, parks, interpretative parks, outdoor recreational facilities, athletic fields, wildlife viewing areas, and other similar uses. 
iii.  Required landscaping, buffering, and screening for uses within a PLI zoning district shall not be counted toward the provision of the required open space. 
iv.  Uses allowed in open space areas within a PLI zoning district shall include, but may not be limited to, the following: 
 Pedestrian and bicycle trails for non-motorized use; 
 Decorative fences and walls; 
 Signs necessary for identification of and navigation through open space areas; 
 Restrooms; 
 Picnic shelters, pavilions, gazebos, and other similar open-air structures; 
 Maintenance storage facilities; 
 Playgrounds; 
 Recreation-related parking facilities; and 
 Athletic courts and fields. 
v.  The City Council shall consider the following when evaluating the quality of the proposed open space within a PLI rezoning request: 
 Whether the proposed open space area(s) is consistent with the goals and policies of the City of Douglas Master Plan; 
 The environmental characteristics and significance of the proposed open space area(s); 
 Whether the location, use, and relationship of the proposed open space areas is appropriate within the distinct planning areas within the PLI zoning district; 
 Whether the plan for open space will improve buffering and screening between the PLI development and adjacent existing and planned land uses; and 
 Whether the proposed open space area(s) will help preserve view corridors both within and through the property and protect and/or enhance other scenic assets. 
 The design and construction, as appropriate, of open space within a PLI zoning district shall be considered a public improvement similar to the design and construction of other public improvements such as roads, drainage facilities, sidewalks, etc. All open space areas within a specific phase of a PLI planning area, if phasing is proposed, or for the entire PLI planning area, if phasing is not proposed, shall be installed concurrent with the other public improvements with the initial Final Plat or Development Plan in the PLI zoning district. The design and installation of all open space, pursuant to the procedures outlined immediately above, shall be completed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building within the applicable phase or within the PLI planning area, as applicable. 
 Financial assurance in the form of cash, letter of credit, or bond in an amount necessary to ensure that the City will have the ability to develop the subject open space and common areas in the event that the developer defaults on the requirement to do the same. The requirement of the developer to develop the subject open space shall be included in the associated subdivision improvement agreement for the initial final plat application or as part of the development improvement agreement for the initial development plan application. The determination for inclusion of the construction of open space areas into either a subdivision improvement agreement or a development improvement agreement shall be made by the City Council in response to a request from the developer at the time of taking final action on the respective application. 
 Open space and common areas, unless otherwise dedicated to the City, shall be protected from industrial or commercial redevelopment by covenants, deed restrictions, plat restrictions, conditions of approval, or any other mechanisms approved by the City Council. 
 Provisions for continuous maintenance of open space within a PLI zoning district shall be established as part of the PLI rezoning request and shall be memorialized by notation on the face of the PLI development plan cover sheet, unless such open space is otherwise dedicated to the City for ownership and maintenance. 
vi.  The City Council may allow transfer of up to 25% of the required open space acreage and 25% of the usable open space acreage from a proposed PLI zoning district area to another location within the City in exchange for increased light industrial or commercial intensity within the PLI planning area. Any request to transfer open space acreage shall comply with the following: 
 The owner of land within the proposed PLI zoning district is also the owner of record of the property that is proposed to receive the transferred open space; 
 The preservation and/or development of open space on the receiving property will provide a greater benefit to the current and future residents of the City of Douglas than would be provided as a result of full compliance with the open space requirements within the PLI planning area; 
 The quality of usable open space on the receiving property will be more regional in nature and will represent and provide a logical connection or extension of existing usable open space and/or pedestrian pathways; 
 The owner of both properties has provided a plan for construction of the transferred open space and financial assurance sufficient to secure performance of such construction; and 
 The owner of both properties has provided a plan for maintenance of the transferred open space and financial plan for ensuring the performance of such plan. 
J.  Streets, Alleys, and Sidewalks 
i.  The requirements of Section 5.10, Streets, Alleys, and Sidewalks, of this Code shall be the minimum standards for development within a PLI zoning district. 
ii.  The standard cross-sections and dimensional details may be modified by recommendation of the City Engineer and may be approved by the City Council as a trade-off in exchange for the provision of public improvements in excess of those improvements necessary to facilitate and mitigate the impacts of the proposed development. Modifications to the standard street or roadway cross-sections shall not be approved unless such modifications are found by the City Council to be in the best interest of the current and future residents and occupants of the City of Douglas. 
iii.  The streets and internal transportation network within a PLI zoning district shall be laid out and designed to ensure connectivity to the existing and planned transportation network. The use of cul-de-sacs is discouraged within a PLI zoning district. The use of the cul-de-sac shall be limited to instances where connectivity with an adjacent street is not logical or is physically impossible due to existing development on the adjacent property or due to the presence of a physiographic, geographic, or environmental constraint. 
K.  Parking, Loading, Maneuvering 
i.  Section 5.8, Parking, Loading, Maneuvering, and Snow Removal, of this Code shall be the minimum standards for development within a PLI zoning district. 
ii.  On-street parking within a PLI zoning district shall be strictly prohibited. 
iii.  Loading areas for buildings and uses within a PLI zoning district are encouraged to be located at the rear or side of buildings and shall be screened from view from existing, approved, or planned residential uses and from view from public or private streets. 
L.  Equipment and Materials Storage 
i.  The requirements of Section 6.16, Construction Equipment Storage, and Section 6.25, Outdoor Storage, of this Code, as applicable, shall be the minimum standards for equipment and materials storage within a PLI zoning district. 
ii.  Increased allowances in outdoor storage may be approved as a trade-off in exchange for increased use-to-use buffering and screening. Under no circumstances shall outdoor equipment and/or materials storage be sited between the principal light industrial or commercial building on the subject site and an adjacent residential zoning district or existing or approved residential use. All areas of outdoor storage shall be sited a minimum of 100 feet from the property line shared with a residential zoning district or an existing or approved residential use. All areas of outdoor storage shall be screened from view from any residential zoning district or existing or approved residential use and from any public street. Screening of outdoor storage areas shall, at a minimum, include a six (6) foot 100% opaque fence or decorative screening wall. All decorative walls exceeding six (6) feet in height and/or twenty (20) feet in length shall be designed and certified by a licensed engineer in the State of Wyoming. 
M.  Signage 
i.  A master sign program shall be required for each phase of a PLI planning area, if phasing is proposed, or for the entire PLI planning area, if phasing is not proposed. The master sign program shall provide a comprehensive set of development-specific standards for signage pertaining to the following: allowed sign types and sizes, construction materials, color and design scheme, acceptable siting locations, and maximum total sign area of the respective phase or PLI planning area, as applicable. 
ii.  The requirements of Section 5.9, Signs, of this Code, shall be the minimum standards for design, siting, and construction of signs within a PLI zoning district. 
iii.  Increased allowances in sign area may be approved as a trade-off in exchange for increased architectural design and construction standards for proposed buildings and signage or for the provision of increased use-to-use buffering and screening. 
N.  Drainage 
Development within a PLI zone district shall comply with the requirements of Section 5.3, Drainage, Grading, and Erosion Control, of this Code.

5.4.2  Placement and Location 
A.  Front Yard 
Fences located within the front yard of a residential lot or parcel shall be limited to four (4) feet in maximum height from the front façade of the residential dwelling on either side of the house to the front property line. The Community Development Director may approve minor deviations to this requirement where the front of the residential dwelling is located behind the midpoint of the lot or parcel as measured from the midpoint of the front property line to the midpoint of the rear property line. Under no circumstances shall a fence exceeding four (4) feet extend in front of the front façade of the residential dwelling or the midpoint of the lot or parcel, whichever is closer to the front lot or parcel line. 
B.  Setbacks 
a.  Setback from Property Lines 
Fences and walls higher than 6 feet shall meet the principal structure setback requirements of the applicable zoning district. 
b.  Setback from Fire Hydrants 
Fences and walls shall not encroach within a three (3) foot radius of any existing or approved fire hydrant location. 
C.  Located Outside of Rights-of-way 
All fences and walls shall be placed outside public rights-of-way unless otherwise approved by the City Administrator or his/her designee. 
D.  Located outside of sight line triangle 
Fences and walls shall not obstruct the view of pedestrian or vehicular traffic within a fifteen (15) foot sight line triangle at any existing driveway and at right-of-way intersections adjacent to corner lots (see Figure 5.4-1 below). 
Figure 5.4-1: Example of the fifteen (15) foot sight line triangle. 

E.  Finished Surface to Face Rights-of-Way 
The side of any fence considered to be its "face" (finished side having no structural supports) shall face the public right-of-way (see Figure 5.4-2 below). 
Figure 5.4-2: Example of the "face" of a fence facing the public right-of-way. 

5.4.3  Maintenance 
Fences and walls shall be maintained in a condition of good repair and appearance and shall not create a nuisance or safety or health risk. The City may require removal, maintenance, or repair of any fence deemed to be a nuisance or safety or health hazard. Failure to comply with the maintenance requirements of this Section shall be subject to the enforcement provisions in Chapter 9 of this Code. 
5.4.4  Non-Conforming Fences and Walls 
A.  Intent 
This Section is intended to regulate legally existing fences and walls that do not comply with one or more of the requirements of this Code. Fences and walls that are legally existing but that do not comply with one or more of the requirements of this Code shall be referred to as nonconforming fences or walls. The goal of the City is to allow nonconforming fences and walls to continue to exist while encouraging such nonconformities to be brought into conformance with the requirements of this Code to the greatest extent practical. The following regulations shall be interpreted to recognize the interests of a property owner in continuing a legally existing nonconforming fence or wall while also ensuring that any change to the nonconforming fence or wall is in compliance with the requirements of this Code. 
B.  Alteration of Non-conforming Fences and Walls 
An existing fence or wall not previously permitted pursuant to this Section shall not be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered unless such fence or wall is in compliance with the requirements of this Section. This provision shall not apply to fences or walls, or alterations thereto, that are required by law or ordinance. 
C.  Maintenance and Repair 
Maintenance of a nonconforming fence or wall shall be allowed where such maintenance is necessary and incidental to the normal upkeep of a fence or wall and where such maintenance will not result in an expansion of the fence or an increase in the nonconformity of the fence or wall.

5.7 - Natural Hazards 
5.7.1  Floodplains 
A.  Intent 
This Section is intended to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the existing and future residents of the City, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
 Protect human life and health; 
 Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
 Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
 Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
 Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
 Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood-blight areas; 
 Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
 Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
B.  Applicability 
This Section shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the City of Douglas. 
C.  Interpretation 
In interpreting and applying the requirements of this Section, all provisions shall be: 
i.  Considered as the minimum requirements; 
ii.  Liberally construed in favor of the City of Douglas; and 
iii.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. 
D.  Establishment of Flood Hazard Areas and Adoption of Flood Hazard Map 
To establish flood hazard areas, the City of Douglas has adopted a flood hazard map and supporting data. The flood hazard map includes, at a minimum, areas of special flood hazard as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in an engineering report titled "The Flood Insurance Study for City of Douglas, Wyoming," dated 2009, as amended or revised with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) and related supporting data along with any revisions thereto. The adopted flood hazard map and supporting data are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this Section. 
E.  Statutory Authority 
Wyo. Stat. § 15-1-103(xxxi) and (xli) delegates to local governments the responsibility of adopting regulations designed to regulate the channels of streams and water courses, and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Douglas hereby adopts the following floodplain management regulations. 
F.  Findings of Fact and Basis for Establishing Areas of Special Flood Hazard 
i.  Flood hazard areas within the City of Douglas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in the following impacts: loss of life; damage to property, health, and safety; disruption of commerce and governmental services; extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief; and impairment of the tax base. Each of these impacts has the potential for adversely affecting the public health, safety and general welfare. 
ii.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
iii.  Relief is available in the form of flood insurance as authorized by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. Therefore, the City of Douglas, Wyoming has chosen to become a participating community in the National Flood Insurance Program, and agrees to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended) as detailed in this Floodplain Management Ordinance. 
iv.  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report titled "The Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Douglas, Wyoming," dated April 1978/Revised: 3/15/83, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), and the flood insurance study and flood insurance rate map effective on November 04, 2009, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter. The flood insurance study and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this Section and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this ordinance and which are recommended to the governing body by the floodplain administrator. A copy of the flood insurance study and the flood insurance rate map shall be on file in the Community Development Department. 
v.  Regulations within this Section shall apply to zones A, AE, AO, AH, and zone A1-A30 as indicated on the flood insurance rate map. 
G.  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses 
In order to accomplish its purpose, this Section includes methods and provisions for: 
i.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights and velocities; 
ii.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to flood, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
iii.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, alluvial fans, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
iv.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
v.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
H.  Designation and Duties of the Floodplain Administrator 
i.  Designation 
The Community Development Director or his/her designated representative is appointed to administer and implement this Section by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions.

J.  Unlawful Acts, Enforcement, and Penalties for Noncompliance 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this Section and other applicable regulations. The following restrictions shall also apply: 
i.  Unlawful Violations 
 It shall be unlawful for any person to divert, retard or obstruct the flow of waters in any watercourse without first securing the written authorization from the floodplain administrator. 
 Where the watercourse is a delineated floodplain, it shall be unlawful to excavate or build any structure affecting the flow of waters without securing written authorization from the floodplain administrator. 
 It shall also be unlawful to dispose of grass clippings, ashes, brush, fill, trash, debris, obstructions, unwanted materials, or any materials other than storm water into storm sewers, or within or along banks of man-made or natural watercourses, streams, ditches or drainages, or in adjacent floodplain areas which may wash into streams and sewers. 
ii.  Notice of Violation 
Any person found to be in violation of this Section shall be served with written notice stating the nature of the violation, and providing ten (10) days for the satisfactory correction thereof. The violator shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations. 
iii.  Unresolved Violation as Separate Offenses 
After notification has been received, each day that the structure or land remains in noncompliance, beyond the ten (10) days provided, shall constitute a separate offense. Nothing contained in this Section shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
iv.  Misdemeanor Offense 
Violation of the provisions of this Section, by failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
v.  Penalty 
Any person who violates this Section or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each violation. 
K.  Abatement of Violations 
Every new structure, building, fill, excavation, development, or condition(s) located or maintained within any special flood hazard area in violation of this chapter is a public nuisance and may be abated, prevented or restrained by action of the City of Douglas. The floodplain administrator or his designee is authorized to: 
i.  Enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation and measurement; 
ii.  Take necessary action to effect the abatement of violations; 
iii.  Order the owner of the property upon which the violation exists to provide whatever additional information may be required;

c.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
d.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this Section are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
viii.  Standards for Manufactured Homes 
Any request to locate, place, or otherwise establish a manufactured home on a lot or parcel shall meet the following criteria: 
a.  All manufactured homes to be placed or those to be substantially improved shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home (including basement or crawlspace) is a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the base flood elevation (freeboard) and is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Manufactured homes located in areas designated in this Code as mobile home park zones (MH-2), or that have been grandfathered to allow manufactured (mobile) home use, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the structural frame or the lowest point of the manufactured home will be a minimum of twelve (12) inches above base flood elevation (freeboard), or at least three (3) feet above highest adjacent grade when no base flood elevation is available, and be securely anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength, over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. (See FEMA publication "Manufactured Home Installation In Flood Hazard Areas.") This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
ix.  Recreational Vehicles Prohibited 
The siting or stationary occupation of a recreational vehicle within any special flood hazard area, as indicated on the flood insurance rate map, shall be prohibited. 
x.  Standards for Areas Below the Lowest Floor 
All new construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement shall follow the guidelines in FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93 (Openings in Foundation Walls for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas) and TB 7-93 (Wet Floodproofing Requirements for Structures Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas), and must either be certified by a licensed professional engineer or architect to meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  Must have a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and

5.7.2  Floodways 
Located within areas of special flood hazards are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
i.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, storage of equipment or supplies, and other development unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has issued a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR); 
ii.  If Subsection i. of this Section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood-hazard reduction provisions of Subsection 5.7.1 above. 
5.7.3  Geological Hazards 
Geologic hazards shall include but not be limited to avalanches, landslides, rockfalls, mudflows, debris fans, unstable or potentially unstable slopes, ground subsidence, faulting, expansive soil or rock and mining-related modifications or other human-made modifications of the natural geology which may pose some geologic hazard. No development shall occur in any area of, or affected by, a geologic hazard unless the application for such development is supported by an engineered design for the development. The engineered design shall be prepared and certified by a licensed engineer in the State of Wyoming. Any area identified in a geology and soils report in support of an application for approval of a final plat shall be depicted on the subject final plat as a "No Build Area." Any request to construct within an identified "No Build Area" shall require prior submittal of an updated geology and soils report for the property, which shall specifically address the hazard area and the mitigation of the subject hazard, and approval by the City Council of a Major Final Plat Amendment pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 3 of this Code in order to remove the "No Build Area" restriction on the final plat. 
5.7.4  Additional Provisions 
A.  Danger to Life or Property 
No development shall increase danger to life or property from flood hazard within the city. This shall include but not be limited to prohibition of actions which might decrease the size of the floodway, reduce flood channel capacity, constrict the size or flow of the flood channel, create a significant backflow condition, increase the potential for debris in the floodway or increase the volume or velocity of floodwaters. 
B.  Floodplains 
No land shall be platted for occupancy unless suitable hazard protection and mitigation can be shown according to the provisions of the Douglas Floodplain Ordinance. 
C.  Floodway and Floodplain Improvements 
Improvements to the floodway, floodplain, or any part thereof which will result in an overall reduction of flood hazard areas are encouraged. 
( Ord. No. 967, § 42, 8-10-2015 ) 
5.8 - Parking, Loading, Maneuvering, Snow Removal and Storage 
5.8.1  General 
A.  Intent 
The purpose of this Section is to establish uniform parking, loading, maneuvering, and snow removal storage standards for uses allowed or otherwise authorized in accordance with the provisions of this Code. These standards are intended to accomplish the following: 
 Improve vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, and service access and maneuvering in parking areas for on-site and adjacent land uses; 
 Reduce the visual impact of parking lots on the community; 
 Ensure that the storage of snow does not inhibit or otherwise restrict vehicular parking or maneuvering or pedestrian access to a site; and 
 Reduce the potential for negative impacts to surrounding land uses and roads due to insufficient parking or deficient parking lot design. 
B.  Applicability 
The parking and loading requirements of this Section shall apply to the construction or substantial expansion of any single or multi-family residential use, manufactured and/or mobile home park, travel trailer and RV park, commercial, or industrial use in any zoning district within the City. For the purpose of applying the requirements of this Section, "substantial expansion" shall include any development or construction activity that requires approval of a Residential Site Plan or Type A, B, or B-LSR Development Plan as outlined in Chapter 3 of this Code. Additional use-specific standards may be applicable pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 6 of this Code. 
C.  Exceptions/Exemptions 
New and existing uses within the CB-1 (Downtown Business) zoning district are exempt from the off-street parking requirements of this Section. The City Council may exempt or modify requirements of this Section for existing or proposed uses upon written request by the applicant and recommendation by City staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
D.  Alternate Parking Plan 
An applicant proposing to develop within the City of Douglas may choose to develop an alternate parking plan in lieu of providing a parking plan that directly complies with the requirements of this Chapter. The Community Development Director, in reviewing an alternate parking plan for a Type A Development Plan, and the City Council, in reviewing an alternate parking plan for a Type B or B-LSR Development Plan, shall find that the plan is in compliance with the intent of this Section and is consistent with policies and recommendations of the City of Douglas Master Plan. The Community Development Director and City Council shall consider the following in reviewing an alternate parking plan: 
 The extent to which the proposed plan accomplishes the intent of this Section equally well or better than a parking plan that meets the strict application of this Section; 
 The specific nature and type of the proposed use, the proposed number of employees, the projected number of expected customers or clients, the availability of joint or mixed-use parking, and other relevant factors that may be unique to the applicant's specific request; 
 A traffic impact study, prepared by the applicant, containing a trip generation analysis, parking analysis study, or other relevant data describing the projected traffic impacts and clearly discussing the modifications and alternatives proposed; 
 Whether the plan detracts from the continuity, connectivity, and convenient proximity of vehicular and pedestrian access to the site or adjacent land uses in the vicinity; 
 Whether the plan minimizes visual impacts along public roads by placing parking and loading areas in the rear or along the side of existing or proposed buildings; 
 Whether the plan accomplishes the intent of any Character District guidelines in the Douglas Master Plan; 
 Whether the plan minimizes the visual and aesthetic impacts to surrounding residential neighborhoods and uses; and 
 Whether the plan is in compliance with all applicable ADA requirements. 
The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to provide adequate information supporting the request for approval of an alternate parking plan. 
5.8.2  On-Street Parking and Loading 
A.  On-Street Parking and Loading Limitations 
The ability to utilize on-street parking and loading shall be limited to uses within the CB-1 (Central Business) District (except as outlined above in Section 5.81.C), Downtown Douglas Historic District, and each of the single-family residential zoning districts. On-street parking shall be allowed along roads that are not restricted from on-street parking and may also be allowed within areas and districts specifically authorized by the City Council. 
B.  On-Street Parking and Loading Not Included in Required Off-Street Parking and Loading Calculations 
The availability of on-street parking shall not be counted toward the number of required off-street parking and loading spaces unless otherwise authorized by the Community Development Director in approving a Type A Development Plan or by the City Council in approving a Type B or B-LSR Development Plan. 
5.8.3  Off-Street Parking Requirements 
A.  General Standards/Requirements 
The following standards shall apply to all land uses and may be expanded for specific uses pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 6 of this Code. 
i.  Location of Off-Street Parking 
Parking spaces for new developments or for the substantial expansion of an existing use requiring approval of a Development Plan and for proposed uses shall be located on the same property as the existing or proposed use. For the purpose of applying the requirements of this Section, "substantial expansion" shall include any development or construction activity that requires approval of a Residential Site Plan or Type A, B, or B-LSR Development Plan as outlined in Chapter 3 of this Code. The Community Development Director, in approving a Type A Development Plan, and the City Council, in approving a Type B or B-LSR Development Plan, may approve an off-street parking plan that includes off-site parking if the applicant can provide evidence that he or she has a legal right to use the property or properties and that such property or properties are immediately adjacent to the property upon which the expanded or proposed use is to be conducted. 
ii.  Parking Lot Landscape Buffer 
Developments proposing to locate a parking lot adjacent to public right-of-way, open space, or another parking lot on an abutting property shall provide a landscaping area between the proposed parking lot and the adjacent use unless otherwise approved with an alternate landscaping plan. The landscaping area shall be depicted on the landscaping plan for the site and shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width and shall include tree planting at a quantity of one medium-sized tree for every 40 linear feet of parking lot landscape buffer area (see Figures 5.8-1 and 5.8-2 below). The landscaping area shall be required to extend for the length of the subject property line in the area in which it is adjoining the public right-of-way, open space, or abutting parking lot. Gaps in the landscaping area shall be allowed to accommodate vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress to and from the site. 
Figure 5.8-1: Example of a landscaping area between two parking lots. 

Figure 5.8-2: Example of parking lot landscape buffering with tree plantings adjacent to public right-of-way. 

iii.  Joint and Mixed-Use Scenarios 
Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent the joint use of off-street parking spaces for two (2) or more buildings or two (2) or more uses in the same building so long as the total number of spaces provided for both uses meets or exceeds the requirements for each individual use. The cumulative requirements for off-street parking for mixed-use occupancies may be reduced if the applicant can demonstrate that the peak requirements of the occupancies occur at different times. If the peak parking usage for the various uses is not simultaneous, the Community Development Director, in approving a Type A Development Plan, and the City Council, in approving a Type B or B-LSR Development Plan, may permit any portion of the off-street parking area to satisfy all or part of the parking requirements for more than a single building or use. 
iv.  Pedestrian Access 
Pedestrian access shall be provided to all land uses except where pedestrian access is not practical due to the location of the use along a public or private road in which pedestrian travel is prohibited.

Chapter 7 - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 

7.1 - General 
7.1.1  Purpose 
This Chapter is intended to create comprehensive standards for the subdivision of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Douglas. These standards are adopted for the following purposes: 
 To ensure compliance with the applicable legal requirements for the division of land under Wyoming State Statutes; 
 To ensure that all divisions of land evaluate and provide for safe and convenient siting and construction of buildings, structures, and uses; 
 To ensure that development of the City will occur in an orderly, efficient, and integrated manner; 
 To ensure that land is divided into blocks, lots, and tracts at a size and configuration that will allow for efficient construction and operation of the intended use(s); 
 To ensure that buildings and structures will be in harmony with the physical characteristics of the land; 
 To provide adequate spaces for transportation improvements, drainage and drainage facilities, open spaces and parks, public lands, light, and air; 
 To ensure that divisions of land incur the burden of siting, designing, and constructing all public improvements necessary to minimize the impacts of such development to existing infrastructure; 
 To implement the City of Douglas Master Plan; and 
 To create a regulatory system for maintaining an accurate record of land divisions, which should also serve to protect the financial investment and property interests of existing and future residents within the City of Douglas. 
7.1.2  Authority 
The provisions of this Chapter are hereby adopted by the City of Douglas pursuant to requirements of the Wyoming State Statutes, including, but not necessarily limited to, Wyo. Stat. §15-1-512, §15-1-601 to -611, and §34-12-101 to -115. 
7.1.3  Applicability 
This Chapter shall apply to all divisions of land, including subdivisions, replats, plat amendments, and other actions resulting in the creation of new lots, parcels, and/or tracts or the reconfiguration of existing platted lots, parcels, and/or tracts. 
7.1.4  Procedural Requirements 
All applications requesting approval of a division of land shall comply with the applicable requirements of Chapter 3, Application and Review Procedures, of this Code. Chapter 3 includes provisions pertaining to pre-application procedures, application submittal requirements, review and referral procedures, notice requirements, approval criteria, public hearings, and post hearing requirements. Chapter 3 also includes procedures for amending previously approved subdivision applications. 
7.1.5  Requirement to File a Plat for Recording 
Approved final plats, including replats, plat amendments, and condominium and townhome plats, shall be filed in the records of the Converse County Clerk and Recorder's Office. All plats shall be filed with the County Clerk and Recorder's Office within one (1) year from the date in which the plat, replat, plat amendment, condominium plat, or townhome plat was approved by the City Council or authorized City official. If an approved plat, replat, plat amendment, condominium plat, or townhome plat is not filed within one (1) year of receiving final approval from the approving authority, the approval shall be void and the plat shall not be filed for recording until a new approval is granted by the applicable approving authority in accordance with the requirements of this Code. 
7.1.6  Compliance with Regulations 
All subdivisions of land shall conform to all applicable statutory provisions, the City of Douglas Municipal Code, and requirements of this Code use. Under no circumstances shall lots, tracts, or parcels be created in a manner that will result in non-compliance with the use, density, and dimensional standards of the respective zoning district(s), as regulated in Chapter 4, Zoning, and Chapter 6, Use-Specific Development Standards, of this Code. In addition to the requirements of this Chapter, the design and layout of subdivisions shall also comply with the requirements of Chapter 5, General Development Standards, of this Code. 
7.1.7  Vested Rights 
The recording of an approved final plat shall be considered a specific plan for development for the subject property for the purposes of securing vested rights. 
( Ord. No. 967, § 42, 8-10-2015 ; Ord. No. 990 , § 41, 5-22-2017) 
7.2 - Types of Subdivision Actions 
7.2.1  General 
The process of subdividing land can often require multiple applications ranging all the way from the more conceptual sketch plan stage to the more detail-specific final plat stage. Additional subdivision can also occur even after the final platting stage in the form of replats, final plat amendments, condominium plats, and townhome plats. Each of the subdivision processes are described below and are further defined and regulated under the procedural requirements of Chapter 3 of this Code. 
7.2.2  Sketch Plans 
The sketch plan is the first step in the subdivision process for larger, more complex, and/or multi-phased subdivisions and typically precedes final development zoning (if land is being annexed) or rezoning (if the land is already within the City's boundaries, but requires rezoning to allow for the proposed development). The sketch plan process is a conceptual-level analysis of the feasibility and design qualities of a proposed development based upon the development standards of this Code. Sketch plan applications are required to examine the feasibility of the proposed division of land, including review of the following: 
 The schematic design and layout of the proposed development; 
 The ability to provide adequate services and utilities; 
 The ability to minimize the existing and potential impacts of geological hazards; 
 The ability to preserve and minimize impacts to environmentally sensitive areas; 
 Vehicular and pedestrian circulation; and 
 General conformance with the City Master Plan. 
The requirement to obtain approval of a sketch plan shall be at the discretion of the Community Development Department Director, except as otherwise required in Section 3.20.1.4.B of this Code pertaining to annexations containing ten (10) or more acres. The application and review procedures for a sketch plan are pursuant to the requirements of Section 3.2 of this Code. 
7.2.3  Preliminary Plats 
The preliminary plat process is typically the second subdivision-related step, following approval of a sketch plan, in the division of land process for larger or more complex projects and can also serve as the first subdivision-related step in the approval process for more moderately-sized and less complex divisions of land. The provisions of Chapter 3 of this Code allow a subdivider to move directly to the final platting process if the application for final plat approval addresses all of the requirements for both a preliminary plat application and a final plat application. This option should generally be reserved for only very small or simple subdivision applications that would not be benefitted by additional review and public hearings and where the subdivider is prepared to commit to the final design and detail of a final plat application. 
The purpose of the preliminary plat is to provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed subdivision, including a refinement of the design and layout due to geologic hazards, environmentally sensitive areas, public and utility services, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and with respect to existing and approved adjacent land uses. The preliminary plat process will evaluate the preliminary block, lot, and tract design and configuration as well as provide the City Engineer with an opportunity to review preliminary engineering designs for the subdivision. 
Any person proposing to subdivide real property within the incorporated boundaries of the City of Douglas may elect to make an application for approval of a preliminary plat. Any subdivision that creates property boundaries or interests in real property shall comply with the procedures for preliminary plat if such approval is sought by the subdivider prior to making a formal final plat application. 
If preliminary plat approval is not sought, a subdivider shall prepare a final plat application that combines and complies with the procedural requirements of both a preliminary plat and a final plat pursuant to Section 3.5 of this Code. 
7.2.4  Final Plats 
The final plat process is the last step in the process of subdividing land. The final plat process is designed to allow the Community Development Department, City Engineer, and City Council an opportunity to review the final block, lot, and tract design and layout and final engineering plans, subdivision improvement agreement, financial assurances, covenants, and any other documents, reports, or studies that support an application for approval of a proposed subdivision. 
Any subdivision that creates property boundaries or interests in real property shall receive prior approval of a final plat, replat, or plat amendment, as applicable. If a subdivider has not obtained preliminary plat approval prior to making an application for approval of a final plat, then the subdivider shall prepare a final plat application that combines and complies with the submittal and procedural requirements of both a preliminary plat application, pursuant to Section 3.5, and a final plat application, pursuant to Section 3.6, of this Code. 
7.2.5  Replats 
The replatting process generally involves two actions: 1) vacation of a portion of the final plat where the change is proposed to occur or vacation of an entire recorded final plat where all or a majority of lot lines will be changed, and 2) approval of a new final plat. These actions can be reviewed and approved concurrently under the replatting process. Replat applications shall comply with the final plat and replat procedures in Section 3.6 of this Code if such replat would result in the creation of an additional lot, tract, or parcel or would add or remove a plat note or restriction. All replats that do not result in the creation of an additional lot, tract, or parcel or would not add or remove a plat note or restriction shall be considered a final plat amendment, as discussed below in Section 7.2.6, and shall be subject to the procedural requirements of either Section 3.7 or 3.8 of this Code. 
7.2.6  Final Plat Amendments 
Final plat amendments shall be defined as either major or minor. A major final plat amendment is any amendment to an approved final plat that would result in any of the following: 
 A change to legal description of the land included within the final plat; 
 An increase in the number of approved lots; 
 A decrease in the amount of approved open space; 
 A request to add or remove a plat note or restriction; or 
 A change in the provision of public improvements or a material change to the design of such improvements, as determined by the Community Development Department Director. 
Examples of a major plat amendment include, but are not limited to, a vacation and re-plat of an approved final plat that would not result in the creation of an additional lot, tract, or parcel and would not add or remove a plat note or restriction. Major final plat amendment applications shall comply with the procedures in Section 3.7 of this Code. 
A proposed amendment to an approved final plat that would not result in a major amendment to a final plat shall be considered a minor final plat amendment. Examples of a minor plat amendment include, but are not limited to, vacation of an interior lot line (a.k.a., combination of lots) and lot line adjustments. Under no circumstances shall the creation of additional lots, tracts, or parcels (e.g., re-platting 2 existing lots into 3 lots, re-platting 3 existing lots into 3 lots and a tract, etc.) or the additional or removal of plat notes or conditions be applied for, reviewed, and approved as a minor final plat amendment. Minor final plat amendment applications shall comply with the procedures in Section 3.8 of this Code. 
7.2.7  Townhome and Condominium Plats 
Townhome and Condominium plats are utilized as a way of further dividing the legal interests of a lot, tract, or parcel into townhome or condominium units. The townhome and condominium plat processes are designed to allow the Community Development Department, City Engineering, and City Council an opportunity to review the final design and layout of the townhome or condominium units and associated common area(s) as well as any new or modified final engineering plans, subdivision improvement agreements, financial assurances, covenants, or any other documents, reports, or studies that support a condominium or townhome plat. 
An application for approval of either a townhome or a condominium plat shall be submitted, reviewed, and approved pursuant to the requirements of Section 3.9 of the this Code 
( Ord. No. 967, § 42, 8-10-2015 ) 
7.3 - Plat Naming and Numbering Standards 
All plats or other documents filed for the purposes of compliance with this Chapter shall meet the following naming and numbering standards: 
7.3.1  Plat Naming 
Plats, including preliminary plats, final plats, replats, and amended plats, shall be named pursuant to the following naming standards. Waivers to the following naming standards shall be reviewed and approved by the entity having final approval authority over the respective plat (e.g., City Council or Community Development Department Director). 
A.  Initial Plat has Right to Use 
The first plat submitted to the Community Development Department for review shall have exclusive right to use the name of such plat throughout the platting process. Any secondary or subsequent plat submitted to the Community Development Department for review shall be required to utilize a different name, which plat names for final plats shall follow the name established by the preliminary plat or the MU-PUD (Mixed Use - Planned Unit Development) zoning district. Changes to the proposed plat name after development application submittal, unless requested by City staff, shall be reviewed and final action taken by the Community Development Department Director. 
B.  Duplicate and Confusing Naming Prohibited 
The name of a plat shall not be approved if the name duplicates or could be confused with the name of a subdivision of record or with a plat under current review by the Community Development Department. 
C.  Multiple Filings within Same Preliminary Plat or PUD 
Multiple plat filings within the same preliminary plat shall utilize sequential filing numbers consistent with the name of the preliminary plat, unless the various filings represent distinctly different land uses under the same MU-PUD development plan (e.g., residential and commercial). 
D.  Replat 
Replat names shall be consistent with the name of the original final plat filing unless the land includes acreage from more than one final plat, and characterized by an alphabetic descriptor after the filing number, and shall reflect consistency with the order of the original filing. Replats that include acreage from two or more final plats within the same preliminary plat shall retain the subdivision name and shall be designated with the next available filing number. Replats that include acreage from two or more final plats from two or more preliminary plats (shall require naming different from any of the respective preliminary or final plats and shall be designated as "Filing 1" of the new subdivision. 
7.3.2  Street Naming 
A.  Approval 
All street names shall be reviewed and approved by the Community Development Department Director. 
B.  Road Name Changes 
Applications for road name changes for existing roads shall be submitted to the City Public Works and Utilities Department for review and approval or denial.

B.  Lot Numbering for Vacations or Replats 
A vacation or replat of lots or tracts shall conform to the following standards: 
i.  Vacating a Common Lot Line 
When vacating a common lot line between two lots, the original lot number followed by the letter "A" shall be used to number the new lot (e.g., when vacating the common lot line between Lot 1 and Lot 2, the newly created lot shall be renumbered as Lot 1A). 
ii.  Replatting with Fewer Lots 
When replatting three lots into two lots, the original lot numbers followed by the letter "A" shall be used to number the new lots (e.g., when replatting Lots 3, 4, & 5, into two lots, the new lots should be numbered Lots 3A and 4A). 
iii.  Adjustment to Common Lot Line 
When adjusting the common lot line between two lots, the original lot numbers followed by the letter "A" shall be used to number the new lots (e.g., when realigning the common lot line between lots 7 and 8, the new lots should be numbered 7A and 8A). 
iv.  Replatting Entire Subdivision Filing 
When replatting an entire subdivision filing, all replatted lots shall be numbered consecutively starting with the number "1". 
C.  Tract Labeling 
Tracts within a final plat filing shall be labeled as "Tract" followed by a consecutive letter designation beginning with "A". Tracts shall be further identified by the purpose of the tract (e.g., Open Space) which shall be placed in parentheses immediately after the tract label. 
7.3.4  Addressing 
A.  Address Assignment 
Assignment of numeric addresses is the responsibility of the Community Development Department. 
B.  Address Correction 
Corrections to addresses shown on a final plat shall be reviewed and approved by the Community Development Department Director. 
7.3.5  Survey and Monumentation Standards 
A.  Survey Control Datum 
A City wide Survey Control System has been established by the City of Douglas, through its City Engineer, known as the City of Douglas Survey Control System Datum of May, 2009. This system was established consistent with the Wyoming State Plane Coordinate System, East Zone, NAD 1983 datum for horizontal coordinates and NGVD 1988 datum for vertical elevations. The City Engineer will maintain copies of this Control System and related mapping of the Control Points associated with the system, and make copies available at no charge to surveyors and engineers performing work in the City. 
Survey work in the City of Douglas done in connection with plats or engineering projects submitted to the City shall be performed in relation to the City of Douglas Survey Control System. All Subdivision Plats submitted to the City shall incorporate the following information: 
i.  Horizontal coordinates and vertical elevations consistent with the City Control System shall be shown on the plat for two (2) adjacent boundary corners of the subdivision perimeter, one of which shall be the Point of Beginning of the legal description of the subdivision boundary. Horizontal coordinates shall be designated as "North" and "East" as determined by the survey made for the subdivision, accurate to two (2) significant figures.

Boundaries shall be clearly indicated on the plat. 
C.  Lot Dimensions and Distances 
Bearings and angles and lengths shall be given for all lot lines. In cases where a lot line is a common line, only one set of figures, adjacent to the line described, need be given if the lot descriptions are given to the same bearing, not a reverse bearing. If table data is used, each individual lot shall be separately described giving all bearings and angles and lengths, ensuring that each lot close by data provided and a table shall be included on the same page as the plat. All bearings and lengths on the plat shall close to within plus or minus 0 degrees, 01 minute. 
D.  Curved Boundaries 
Sufficient data shall be given on curved boundaries and all curves on a plat to enable the reestablishment of curves on the ground. Curve data shall include: (1) central angle; (2) radius; and (3) arc length.

7.6 - Agreements and Public Improvements 
7.6.1  Agreements 
The platting and development of a subdivision pursuant to the provisions of this Code often triggers requirements for public improvements, including, but not limited to, roads, parks, and drainage facilities. The construction of public improvements by a subdivider shall be secured via a subdivision improvements agreement (SIA). Where the subdivision of land is not necessary prior to the development of a particular property, the developer may be required to enter into a development improvement agreement (DIA) with the City to guarantee construction of public improvements. Development improvement agreements are typically, but not exclusively, required in association with rezoning or Type B or B-LSR Development Plan applications. Both types of improvement agreements, SIA and DIA, are intended to ensure that new development is responsible for mitigating the impacts created by the development to public services and facilities. A third type of development agreement, which is known as a deferred development agreement, may be used to defer the development of required infrastructural improvements in commercial, business and industrial zones when it is deemed by the City Council to be in the best interest of the City to do so. All subdivision improvement agreements, development improvement agreements, and deferred development agreements shall be submitted to the Community Development Department and the City Attorney in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. 
7.6.2  Financial Assurance Estimate and Security 
All subdivision improvement agreements and development improvement agreements shall be supported by a financial assurance estimate representing one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of constructing the required improvements and security, in a form acceptable to the City Attorney, in the amount of the financial assurance estimate. All financial assurance estimates shall be submitted to the Community Development Department and City Engineer for review and acceptance prior to scheduling the associated application for public hearing. 
7.6.3  Release of Security 
Financial security provided by a developer for the purpose of securing the construction of public improvements shall be released by the City upon inspection and formal acceptance by the City of the respective public improvements. Phased release of financial security may be available provided that the developer supplies the City with replacement or supplemental financial security to secure construction of the individual public improvements that have not been inspected and formally accepted by the City. 
7.6.4  Public Improvements 
When appropriate, the following public improvements shall be required as part of a subdivision development and shall be designed, constructed, and inspected according to applicable criteria and procedures. In unique circumstances, the City Engineer may require specific design criteria to be met to insure the usability of the improvements. 
 Street construction and surfacing; 
 Street resurfacing;

8.2 - Public Improvements 
8.2.1  General 
A.  Construction of Common Development and Public Improvements 
The owner of land for development shall be responsible for constructing common development and public improvements internal to the development, including, but not limited to, streets, drainage facilities, bridges, and related improvements. In the event public improvements have not been extended to the exterior boundary of the subdivision, the developer shall also be responsible for extension of the public improvements. All provisions and ordinances relating to the public improvements within the subdivision shall also pertain to and control exterior public improvements. 
B.  Construction Permit Required 
A construction permit and a notice to proceed shall be obtained from the City prior to construction of any common development or public improvements. 
C.  Oversizing of Public Improvements 
If the City Council, at its sole discretion, requires oversizing or additional extension of public improvements and such oversizing or additional extension is not necessitated by the subject final plat or Type A, B, or B-LSR Development Plan, then the cost associated with construction of the oversizing or additional extension shall be the responsibility of the City. 
8.2.2  Design, Submittal, and Review 
A.  Design 
The provisions of the "Wyoming Public Works Standard Specifications" shall be considered controlling for the design and construction of public improvements within the City. "The Wyoming Public Works Standard Specifications" (2008, or as currently amended) and as modified by the City, which is published by the Wyoming Public Works Council, shall be hereby incorporated into this Chapter by reference as though fully included herein. A copy of the "Wyoming Public Works Standard Specifications" shall be retained on file in the Community Development Department and City Clerk's Office. Construction within or access to any WYDOT owned or maintained right-of-way may require separate review and approval by WYDOT prior to construction. The design and construction of all water and wastewater improvements shall be reviewed and approved by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ). 
B.  Submittal 
All designs for public improvements shall be submitted to the Community Development Department, City Engineer, and City Public Works Department for review concurrent with the associated final plat application, when required pursuant to a subdivision improvement agreement, and concurrent with the associated Type A, B, or B-LSR Development Plan application or large-scale MU-PUD rezoning request, when required pursuant to a development improvement agreement. 
C.  Review 
The Community Development Department, City Engineer, and City Public Works Department shall review the construction drawings for public improvements and must approve the drawings prior to scheduling the associated final plat or development plan for public hearing. 
8.2.3  Subdivision and Development Improvement Agreements 
A.  General 
All required public or common improvements shall be secured and supported by either a subdivision improvements agreement or a development improvements agreement. Subdivision and development improvements agreements shall function as a contract between the developer(s) and the City and shall comply with the requirements of this Code and all applicable requirements of Wyoming State Statutes. 
i.  Improvements Complete or Guaranteed 
Prior to the issuance of the first building permit in an area within any addition, subdivision, or within any development governed by a development improvements agreement, all public improvements shall have been installed and accepted in accordance with the requirements of this Code unless otherwise deferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.2.3.A.iv below. 
ii.  Subdivision Improvements Agreement 
A subdivision improvements agreement shall be required in association with all final plat applications that have been identified by the Community Development Department and the City Engineer as requiring extension or internal construction of public or common improvements. 
iii.  Development Improvements Agreement 
A development improvements agreement may be required in association with any Type A, B, or B-LSR Development Plan application where such development will result in adverse public impacts. The requirement for public improvements in association with a Type A, B, or B-LSR Development Plan shall be roughly proportionate to the burden imposed on the public as a result of the proposed development. In unique circumstances where a large-scale MU-PUD rezoning request is proposed, the City Council shall have the exclusive authority to require a development improvements agreement to ensure that construction of public and common improvements is comprehensively planned and appropriately sited and phased. 
iv.  Deferred Development Agreements 
The governing body may agree to defer the development of required infrastructural improvements in commercial, business and industrial zones when it is deemed to be in the best interest of the City to do so, and provided that: 
a.  The governing body and developer(s) enter into a written agreement that specifically states which improvements will be deferred. The agreement shall also specifically identify the timing and conditions that will dictate the need for completion of the deferred improvements.

Financial assurance may include cash, performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or any other form that is approved by the City Attorney and can be readily converted to cash in an amount not less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the financial assurance estimate amount approved by the City Engineer. The City Council shall also have the right and authority to file a lien when necessary to accomplish completion of the improvements within the subject development. 
Deferred development agreements shall be reviewed annually by the Community Development Department to ensure compliance with the agreement. City staff may elect to send written notice of the review to the developer(s) indicating the current status of the agreement and may elect to provide an update to the City Council at an open and public hearing. 
v.  Phased Large-Scale MU-PUD Zoning District Developments 
The City Council, at its sole discretion, may allow the developer(s) of a large-scale MU-PUD zoning district development, at the developer's request, to enter into a deferred development agreement. The use of a deferred development agreement as a method of guaranteeing the construction of improvements within an MU-PUD zoning district may be appropriate in order to adequately identify and plan for phased development. Additional amendments to the agreement, or separate phase-specific agreements, may be necessary as phased development progresses in order to guarantee construction of phase-specific improvements or compliance with phase-specific conditions within a particular phase. 
vi.  Approval Authority and Execution 
The City Council shall have the exclusive authority to approve a subdivision improvements agreement, development improvements agreement, or deferred development agreement. Approval of a subdivision or development improvements agreement by the City Council shall constitute authorization of the Mayor to execute such agreement.

The action may occur at any step in the platting process prior to the recording of the final plat, and shall take place at a regular public hearing. The City Council shall determine at the hearing the nature and extent of the alleged false or inaccurate information, shall consider any new significant information that has been brought to its attention, and shall have the authority, upon a showing of good cause, to deny the preliminary plan or final plat or suspend or withdraw any approval or require corrective measures to be taken.
