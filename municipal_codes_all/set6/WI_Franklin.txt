§ 96-45. Theft of services and tampering.
No person may intentionally do any of the following:
Obtain or attempt to obtain cable television service from a Grantee by trick, artifice, deception,use of an illegal device or illegal decoder or other fraudulent means with the intent to deprivethat Grantee of any or all lawful compensation for rendering each type of service obtained.The intent required for a violation of this subsection may be inferred from the presence on theproperty and in the actual possession of the person or entity of a device not authorized by theGrantee, the major purpose of which is to permit reception of cable television services withoutpayment. This inference is rebutted if the alleged violator demonstrates that such person orentity purchased that device for a legitimate use.
Give technical assistance or instruction to any person in obtaining or attempting to obtain anycable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the Grantee providingthat service. This subsection does not apply if the alleged violator demonstrates that thetechnical assistance or instruction was given or the installation of the connection, descrambleror receiving device was for a legitimate use.
Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or byother means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution ofcable television services for the purpose of distributing cable television service to any otherdwelling unit without authority from a Grantee.
Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or byother means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution ofcable television services for the purpose of obtaining cable television service without paymentof all lawful compensation to the Grantee providing the service. The intent required for aviolation of this subsection may be inferred from proof that the cable service to the allegedviolator's residence or business was connected under a service agreement with the allegedviolator and has been disconnected by the cable television company and that thereafter thereexists in fact a connection to the cable system at the alleged violator's residence or business.
Make or maintain any modification or alteration to any device installed with the authorizationof a Grantee for the purpose of intercepting or receiving any program or other service carriedby that Grantee which that person is not authorized by that Grantee to receive. The intentrequired for a violation of this subsection may be inferred from proof that, as a matter ofstandard procedure, the Grantee places written warning labels on its converters or decodersexplaining that tampering with the device is a violation of law, and the converter or decoder isfound to have been tampered with, altered or modified so as to allow the reception orinterception of programming carried by the Grantee without authority to do so. The trier of factmay also infer that a converter or decoder has been altered or modified from proof that theGrantee, as a matter of standard procedure, seals the converters or decoders with a label ormechanical device, that the seal was shown to the customer upon delivery of the decoder andthat the seal has been removed or broken. The inferences under this subsection are rebuttedif the Grantee cannot demonstrate that the intact seal was shown to the customer.
Possess without authority any device or printed circuit board designed to receive from a cabletelevision system any cable television programming or services offered for sale over thatcable television system, whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered,scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, or perform or facilitate the performance of any of

the acts under this subsection with the intent that the device or printed circuit be used toreceive the Grantee's services without payment. Intent to violate this subsection for direct orindirect commercial advantage or private financial gain may be inferred from proof of theexistence on the property and in the actual possession of the alleged violator of such adevice, if the totality of circumstances, including quantities or volumes, indicates possessionfor resale.
Manufacture, import into this state, distribute, publish, advertise, sell, lease or offer for sale orlease any device, printed circuit board or any plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuitdesigned to receive the cable television programming or services offered for sale over a cabletelevision system from a cable television system, whether or not the programming or servicesare encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, with the intent that thedevice, printed circuit, plan or kit be used for the reception of that Grantee's service withoutpayment. The intent required for a violation of this subsection may be inferred from proof thatthe defendant has sold, leased or offered for sale or lease any device, printed circuit board,plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit board in violation of this subsection, and duringthe course of the transaction for sale or lease, the alleged violator expressly states or impliesto the buyer that the product will enable the buyer to obtain cable television service withoutcharge.

§ 151-10. Certificate of appropriateness.
Prohibition. No alteration or improvement which is visible on the outside or demolition shall bedone or allowed within a designated historic district or upon a landmark unless a certificate ofappropriateness has been issued by the Historic Preservation Commission. Further, no buildingpermit or demolition permit shall be issued for any landmark or any historic structure until theBuilding Inspector is satisfied that a certificate of appropriateness has been issued.
Criteria in granting a certificate of appropriateness. In reviewing an application for a certificate ofappropriateness, the Commission shall consider the following factors:
The appropriateness to the Historic District or to the landmark of the proposed alteration ordemolition.
Whether such proposed alteration or demolition will further the purposes of this chapter.
Proposed alteration or demolition for any historic structure from the visual perspective of thestreet, public way or public buildings.
Reference to The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as published in § 36of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 67, and as revised from time to time.
By further reference to such specific design standards as the Commission may require for thedesignation of the landmark or historic district. Such specific standards shall relate to thehistorical significance; the architectural value; the unique design, arrangement, texture,material or color of the building, place or area in question; the relation of such improvement tosimilar improvements in the immediate surroundings; and the position of such improvement inrelation to the street or public way and to other improvements.
The Commission shall not deny a certificate of appropriateness whenever the applicantshows that the alteration or demolition will enhance or is not inconsistent with the inherenthistoric value of the landmark or of the historic district.
Application. Certificate of appropriateness may be applied for from the office of the BuildingInspector. The application shall contain such information as requested by the Commission andshall be accompanied by plans and renderings.
Issuance of certificate of appropriateness.
The Commission shall review completed applications presented to it for certificates ofappropriateness at its regular monthly meetings and shall grant or deny the certificate. Thedenial of a certificate shall be accompanied by a written statement indicating the reasons fordenial. Upon granting a certificate, the office of the Building Inspector shall issue to theapplicant a certificate of appropriateness.
A certificate of appropriateness shall expire six months after the date of issuance. Building,demolition or sign permits are separate from the certificate, and the applicant shall alsosecure such permits prior to commencing the work.
Hardship.
Even if a proposed alteration or demolition may be inappropriate owing to conditionsespecially affecting the structure involved, but not affecting the historic district generally,failure to issue a certificate of appropriateness will involve a substantial hardship which is notself-created, financial or otherwise to the applicant, and such certificate may be issuedwithout substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from thepurposes of this chapter, then the Commission may grant a certificate of appropriateness.

(4)
If, however, a proposed alteration or demolition is inappropriate and issuance of a certificateof appropriateness would cause substantial detriment to the public welfare or substantialderogation from the purposes of this chapter, but failure to issue would nonetheless involve asubstantial hardship which is not self-created, financial or otherwise to the applicant, then theCommission may order a postponement of any alteration or demolition while it investigatesalternatives to granting a certificate.
If after a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year from the date of first denial of thecertificate of appropriateness, no alternative agreement has been reached with the applicant,the Commission may issue a certificate of appropriateness for alteration or demolition of thebuilding, place or area in question.
In granting a certificate of appropriateness in such circumstances, the Commission mayprescribe any conditions or limitations that may minimize the adverse impact of the requestedalteration or demolition.
§ 151-11. Ordinary maintenance and repairs; public safety expost facto.
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architecturalfeature in the historic district or landmark which does not involve a change in design, material, color oroutward appearance; prevent any alteration or demolition which the Building Inspector shall certify isrequired by public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition; nor prevent any alteration ordemolition under a permit issued by the Building Inspector prior to the date of petitioning for thecreation of an historic district or prior to the date of designation of a landmark.
§ 151-12. When building or demolition permit is not required.
When neither a building or demolition permit is required, if a proposed alteration or demolitionconstitutes a material change in the exterior appearance of a landmark or of property within an historicdistrict, then a certificate of appropriateness shall be required. Failure to receive a certificate prior toeffecting such material change shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
§ 151-13. Zoning.
Whenever an application for a Zoning Map amendment, variation or special use permit, including amodification or renewal, is submitted to the city for property within a designated historic district orwhich is a landmark, a notice of any public hearing to be held on the application by the PlanCommission or Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall be sent to the Historic PreservationCommission. Such notice shall be the same as that sent to owners of property for which the applicationwas filed. The Historic Preservation Commission may submit its comments to the Plan Commission orBoard of Zoning and Building Appeals, which shall consider such comments, decisions orrecommendation on the application. However, nothing contained in this chapter shall supersede orinvalidate other ordinances of zoning controls.

Editor's Note: This ordinance also superseded former Ch. 167, Sex Offenders, adopted 11-21-2006 byOrd. No. 2006-1895.
§ 167-1. Purpose.
This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in Franklinfrom the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences. The Cityfinds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sexoffenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested fora new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducingopportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense, there is a need to protectchildren where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by statelaw near schools, day-care centers and other places children frequent. The City finds and declares thatin addition to schools and day-care centers, children congregate or play at public parks.

§ 176-11. Reclamation standards.
All nonmetallic mining sites subject to this chapter shall be reclaimed in conformance with thestandards contained below.
General standards.
Refuse and other solid wastes. Nonmetallic mining refuse shall be reused in accordance witha reclamation plan. Other solid wastes shall be disposed of in accordance with applicablerules of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources adopted pursuant to Chapters 289and 291, Wisconsin Statutes.
Area disturbed and contemporaneous reclamation. Nonmetallic mining reclamation shall beconducted, to the extent practicable, to minimize the area disturbed by nonmetallic miningand to provide for nonmetallic mining reclamation of portions of the nonmetallic mining sitewhile nonmetallic mining continues on other portions of the nonmetallic mining site.
Public health, safety and welfare. All nonmetallic mining sites shall be reclaimed in a mannerso as to comply with federal, state and local regulations governing public health, safety andwelfare.
Habitat restoration. When the land use required by the reclamation plan approved pursuant tothis chapter requires plant, fish or wildlife habitat, it shall be restored, to the extent practicable,to a condition at least as suitable as that which existed before the lands were affected bynonmetallic mining operations.
Compliance with environmental regulations. Reclamation of nonmetallic mining sites shallcomply with any other applicable federal, state and local laws, including those related toenvironmental protection, zoning and land use control.
Surface water and wetlands protection. Nonmetallic mining reclamation shall be conducted andcompleted in a manner that assures compliance with the Wisconsin Department of NaturalResources' water quality standards for surface waters and wetlands contained in Chapters NR102 to NR 105, Wisconsin Administrative Code. Before disturbing the surface of a nonmetallicmining site and removing topsoil, all necessary measures for diversion and drainage of runoff fromthe site to prevent pollution of waters of the state shall be installed in accordance with thereclamation plans approved pursuant to this chapter. Diverted or channelized runoff resulting fromreclamation may not adversely affect neighboring properties.
Groundwater protection.
Groundwater quantity. A nonmetallic mining site shall be reclaimed in a manner that does notcause a permanent lowering of the water table that results in adverse effects on surfacewaters or a significant reduction in the quantity of groundwater reasonably available for futureusers of groundwater.
Groundwater quality. Nonmetallic mining reclamation shall be conducted in a manner whichdoes not cause groundwater quality standards in Chapter NR 140, Wisconsin AdministrativeCode, to be exceeded at a point of standards application defined in that chapter.
Topsoil management.
Removal. Topsoil and topsoil substitute material shall be provided as specified in thereclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter in order to achieve reclamation to theapproved post-mining land use. Removal of on-site topsoil and topsoil substitute materialremoval, when specified in the reclamation plan, shall be performed, as prior to any miningactivity associated with any specific phase of the mining operation.

Volume. The operator shall obtain the volume of soil required to perform final reclamation byremoval of on-site topsoil or topsoil substitute material or by obtaining topsoil or substitutematerial as needed to make up the volume of topsoil as specified in the reclamation planapproved pursuant to this chapter.
Storage. Once removed, topsoil or topsoil substitute material shall, as required by thereclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter, either be used in contemporaneousreclamation or stored in an environmentally acceptable manner. The location of stockpiledtopsoil or topsoil substitute material shall be chosen to protect the material from erosion orfurther disturbance or contamination. Runoff water shall be diverted around all locations inwhich topsoil or topsoil substitute material is stockpiled.
Final grading and slopes.
All areas affected by mining shall be addressed in the approved reclamation plan, pursuant to§
176-13
, to provide that a stable and safe condition consistent with the post-mining land useis achieved. The reclamation plan may designate highwalls or other unmined and undisturbednatural solid bedrock as stable and safe and not in need of reclamation or designate otherareas affected by mining, including slopes composed of unconsolidated materials that exceeda 3:1 slope, whether or not graded, as stable and safe. For slopes designated as stable underthis subsection, the regulatory authority may require that either a site-specific engineeringanalysis be performed by a registered professional engineer to demonstrate that anacceptable slope stability factor is attainable at a steeper slope, or the operator perform a fieldtest plot demonstration to demonstrate that a stable and safe condition will be achieved andthat the post-mining land use specified in the reclamation plan will not be adversely affected.
Final reclaimed slopes covered by topsoil or topsoil substitute material may not be steeperthan a 3:1 horizontal to vertical incline, unless found acceptable through one or more of thefollowing: alternative requirements are approved under §
176-18
; steeper slopes are shown tobe stable through a field plot demonstration approved as part of an approved reclamationplan; or stable slopes can be demonstrated based on site-specific engineering analysisperformed by a registered professional engineer. All areas in the nonmetallic mine site wheretopsoil or topsoil substitute material is to be reapplied shall be graded or otherwise preparedprior to topsoil or topsoil substitute material redistribution to provide the optimum adherencebetween the topsoil or topsoil substitute material and the underlying material.
When the approved post-mining land use includes a body of water, the approved final gradeat the edge of a body of water shall extend vertically six feet below the lowest seasonal waterlevel. A slope no steeper than 3:1 shall be created at a designated location or locations,depending on the size of the water body to allow for a safe exit.
Topsoil redistribution for reclamation. Topsoil or topsoil substitute material shall be redistributed inaccordance with the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter in a manner whichminimizes compaction and prevents erosion. Topsoil or topsoil substitute material shall beuniformly redistributed except where uniform redistribution is undesirable or impractical. Topsoil ortopsoil substitute material redistribution may not be performed during or immediately after aprecipitation event until the soils have sufficiently dried.
Revegetation and site stabilization. Except for permanent roads or similar surfaces identified in thereclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter, all surfaces affected by nonmetallic miningshall be reclaimed and stabilized by revegetation or other means. Revegetation and sitestabilization shall be in accordance with the approved reclamation plan and shall be performed assoon as practicable after mining activity has permanently ceased in any part of the mine site.
Assessing completion of successful reclamation.
The criteria for assessing when reclamation is complete and, therefore, when the financialassurance may be released, shall be specified in the reclamation plan approved pursuant to
9/16/2020 City of Franklin, WI Ecode360

this chapter. Criteria to evaluate reclamation success shall be quantifiable.
Compliance with the revegetation success standards in the approved reclamation plan shallbe determined by:
On-site inspections by the City of Franklin or its agent;
Reports presenting results obtained during reclamation evaluations, includingsummarized data on revegetation, photo documentation or other evidence that thecriteria approved in the reclamation plan to ascertain success have been met; or
A combination of inspections and reports.
In those cases where the post-mining land use specified in the reclamation plan requires areturn of the mining site to a pre-mining condition, the operator shall obtain baseline data onthe existing plant community for use in the evaluation of reclamation success pursuant to thissection.
Revegetation success may be determined by:
Comparison to an appropriate reference area;
Comparison to baseline data acquired at the mining site prior to its being affected bymining; or
Comparison to an approved alternate technical standard.
Revegetation using a variety of plants indigenous to the area is favored.
Intermittent mining. Intermittent mining may be conducted provided that the possibility ofintermittent cessation of operations is addressed in an operator's reclamation permit, noenvironmental pollution or erosion of sediments is occurring, and financial assurance forreclamation pursuant to §
176-14
is maintained covering all remaining portions of the site thathave been affected by nonmetallic mining and that have not been reclaimed.
Maintenance. During the period of the site reclamation, after the operator has stated thatreclamation is complete but prior to release of financial assurance, the operator shall perform anymaintenance necessary to prevent erosion, sedimentation or environmental pollution, comply withthe standards of this subchapter, or to meet the goals specified in the reclamation plan approvedpursuant to this chapter.

Site difficulties. Unusual site factors preclude the construction of a sign in accordance withthis chapter which would be reasonably visible to the roadway adjacent to the site frontage.
Undue concentration. The sign as proposed will not result in an undue concentration ofsignage which renders it difficult or confusing to read existing signs.
Granting of variance or appeal.
Should the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals find that an appeal or variance should begranted, the application will be forwarded to the Zoning and Building Administrator withdirections to issue a permit in accordance with its decision. If the Board finds that an appealor variance should not be granted, it shall cause the applicant to be informed of the decisionand of the reasons for such decision, in writing, within 10 days of the date of such decision.

A.
The following are detailed descriptions of the residential zoning districts and their respectivedimensional and bulk regulations, requirements, and design standards. The variousdevelopment options indicated are "open space ratio," or OSR, driven. While the overallmaximum gross density stays essentially the same within each residential zoning district foreach option within a specific residential zoning district, as the minimum OSR increases themaximum permitted net density increases. Under the "conventional" and other optionspresented for each residential zoning district, the site intensity and capacity calculations, as wellas the natural resource protection standards and guidelines set forth in Divisions 15-3.0500 and15-4.0100 of this Ordinance, shall be adhered to.
B.
It is the expressed intent of this Ordinance that each buildable lot of land, with an on-sitesewage disposal system, whether existing or newly subdivided, shall conform to a minimum lotsize of 40,000 square feet and minimum lot width of 150 feet, regardless if the lot conforms witha conventional or a special use OSR subdivision. Therefore, a special use OSR subdivisionshall not circumvent minimum sizes with an on-site sewage disposal system.
C.
Every type of dwelling unit or structure hereafter referenced to, erected in any residential zoningdistrict, shall have a minimum living area in square feet measured from the outside of theexterior walls, including utility rooms, foyers, interior stairwells, hallways, closets, columns, andwalls, and finished half-basements or finished portions of half-basements, but excludingbasements and unfinished half-basements, or unfinished portions of half-basements, openporches, breezeways, garages, and other spaces not used frequently or during extendedperiods for living, eating, or sleeping purposes in accordance with this Division. If the finishedarea of a half-basement or finished portion of a half-basement are included in the minimumliving area of a dwelling, the dwelling shall be automatically considered multi-story and shallmeet the minimum square footage requirements for multi-story.

Promote mixed-use development which may also include cultural and institutional facilities,indoor entertainment facilities, business uses, residential uses (to a lesser extent), and thoseother uses which would contribute to the CC City Civic Center District's role as the "heart" ofthe City of Franklin while also accommodating uses which are under public or public-relatedownership, or which serve a quasi-public purpose.
Foster a pedestrian-oriented City of Franklin Civic Center even though the CC City CivicCenter District has off-street parking requirements.
Foster a balance between people-oriented and automobile-oriented development. The spacesformed in this area, through careful site planning and urban design, are to cater to bothpedestrian and vehicular safety and circulation.
Employ superior building, site, and landscape design standards than most other areas of theCity since the uses in the CC City Civic Center District will convey the image of all of the Cityof Franklin to both residents and visitors. Building design within the CC District shall follow theCity's design guidelines established for buildings located within the CC City Civic CenterDistrict.
Require a landscape surface ratio (LSR) and floor area ratio (FAR) requirement that isconsistent with the B-3 Community Business District.
Single retail establishments are limited to tenant space of 125,000 square feet or less in area.
Require that cross-access for both pedestrian and vehicular circulation be provided betweenadjacent parcels at the time of any new development or redevelopment. In cases whereexisting development on adjacent parcels, not under common ownership, does not allow forthe actual construction of connecting driveways, sidewalks, etc. it shall be sufficient in mostcases to provide the appropriate cross-access easements to to be utilized at the point in timewhen the adjacent parcel undergoes development or redevelopment that would facilitate thecompletion of the connection. The city may require a letter of credit sufficient to ensure theconstruction of the future pedestrian and vehicular connection when actual construction is nottaking place at the time of site plan approval.
Require that a Developers Agreement and Letter of Credit be submitted by theapplicant/developer during the Site Plan approval process for the purpose of securing theinstallation and construction of required public improvements and/or non-principal siteimprovements proposed by the City of Franklin.
While the character of the highly pedestrianized portions of the CC District would be URBANin character, the various requirements of the CC District are established to increase itscompatibility with a SUBURBAN character through the preservation of open space andnatural resource features characteristic of the CC District as set forth in the City of FranklinComprehensive Master Plan.

Design Standards for Non-Residential Buildings [20,000 Square Feet or Less in Area].
Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these design standards is to guide the design of smallernon-residential buildings constructed in the South 27th Street Design Overlay District toensure that, through appropriate use of facades, windows, building orientation, andarchitectural details, new structures and alterations of existing structures are physically andvisually compatible with other buildings in the vicinity. These standards are intended tosupport good quality design in new building construction, enhance street safety, and provide acomfortable street environment by providing features of interest to pedestrians and motorists.Good design results in buildings that are in visual harmony with nearby buildings, leading to acity that is attractive, interesting, active, and safe. These qualities, in turn, contribute to thecreation of a sustainable community which facilitates easy pedestrian movement andestablishment of a rich mixture of uses.

The design standards for buildings greater than 20,000 square feet areintended to ensure that large buildings, and the sites they occupy, are properly located andcompatible with the surrounding area and community character of the South 27th StreetDesign Overlay District. Such projects shall also be subject to the more general standards forthe approval of Special Use Permits or PUD Districts when applicable.
The following requirements are applicable to all new buildings in excess of 20,000 grosssquare feet. These requirements are also applicable when additions to non-residential andmixed use buildings built either before or after the effective date of this Division, bring the totalbuilding size to over 20,000 gross square feet.
Waiver of Standards. The Plan Commission may waive any of the following standards by a3/4 vote of members in attendance, but only if supplemental design elements orimprovements are incorporated into the project (over and above those which are otherwiserequired) which compensate for the waiver of the particular standard. In support of the waiver

request, the applicant shall detail such supplemental design elements in written and graphicalform, and provide an explanation as to the nature of the standards for which the waiver isrequested.
Compatibility with City Plans. The applicant shall provide, through a written report submittedwith the petition for a Site Plan adequate evidence that the proposed building and overalldevelopment project shall be compatible with the City's community character, urban design,natural area preservation, commercial development, redevelopment, or community facilityobjectives as expressed in adopted elements of the City's Comprehensive Master Plan.
Building Materials. Building materials shall be unified throughout the building, and shallcomplement other buildings in the vicinity. Exterior building materials shall be of high andcomparable aesthetic quality on all sides. Building materials such as glass, brick, decorativeconcrete block, or stucco shall be used. Decorative architectural metal with concealedfasteners may be approved if sensitively incorporated into the overall design of the building.
Building Design. The building exterior shall be unified in design throughout the structure, andshall complement other buildings in the vicinity. The building shall employ varying buildingsetbacks, height, roof treatments, door and window openings, and other structural anddecorative elements to reduce apparent size and scale. A minimum of 20% of all of thecombined facades of the structure shall employ actual facade protrusions or recesses. Aminimum of 20% of all of the combined linear roof eave or parapet lines of the structure shallemploy differences in height, with such differences being six feet or more as measured eaveto eave or parapet to parapet for buildings over 50,000 square feet. Roofs with particularslopes may be required by the City to complement existing buildings or otherwise establish aparticular aesthetic objective. Ground floor facades that face and are on properties that are inany part within 100 feet of public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas,awnings, or other such features along no less than 50% of their horizontal length. Theintegration of windows into building design is strongly encouraged.
Building Entrances. Public building entryways shall be clearly defined and highly visible on thebuilding's exterior design, and shall be emphasized by on-site traffic flow patterns. Two ormore of the following design features shall be incorporated into all public building entryways:canopies or porticos, overhangs, projections, arcades, peaked roof forms, arches, outdoorpatios, display windows, distinct architectural details. Unless exempted by the PlanCommission all sides of the building that directly face or abut a public street or public parkingarea shall have at least one public entrance, except that the City shall not require buildingentrances on more than two sides of any building.
Building Color. Building facade colors shall be non-reflective, subtle, neutral, or earth tone.The use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors on facades shallbe prohibited. Building trim and architectural accent elements may feature brighter colors, butsuch colors shall be muted, not metallic, not fluorescent, and not specific to particular uses ortenants. Standard corporate and trademark colors shall be permitted only on sign face andcopy areas.
Building Location. Modest building setbacks are encouraged. Where buildings are proposedto be distant from a public street, the overall development design shall include smallerbuildings on pads or outlots closer to the street.
Screening. Mechanical equipment, refuse containers and any permitted outdoor storage shallbe fully concealed from on-site and off-site ground level views, with materials identical tothose used on the building exterior. Loading docks shall be completely screened fromsurrounding roads and properties. Said screening may be accomplished through loadingareas internal to buildings, screen walls which match the building exterior in materials anddesign, fully opaque landscaping at time of planting, or combinations of the above. Gates andfencing may be used for security and access, but not for screening, and shall be of highaesthetic quality.

Traffic Impact. All projects that include buildings over 20,000 square feet shall have directaccess to an arterial or collector street, or shall dedicate public roads which have directaccess to a public street. Vehicle access shall be designed to accommodate peak on-sitetraffic volumes without disrupting traffic on public streets or impairing pedestrian safety. Thisshall be accomplished through adequate parking lot design and capacity; access drive entrythroat length, width, design, location, and number; and traffic control devices; and sidewalks.The site design shall provide direct connections to adjacent land uses if required by the City.Prior to development approval, the applicant's traffic engineer shall complete and present atraffic impact analysis following Wisconsin Department of Transportation guidelines. Wherethe project will cause off-site public roads, intersections, or interchanges to function belowlevel of service C, as defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the City may denythe application, require a size reduction in the proposed development, or require that thedeveloper construct and/or pay for required off-site improvements.
Natural Resources Protection. Existing natural features shall be integrated into the site designas a site and community amenity.
Signage. The plan for exterior signage shall provide for modest, coordinated, andcomplimentary exterior sign locations, configurations, and colors throughout the development.All freestanding signage within the development shall compliment on-building signage.Monument style ground signs are strongly preferred over pole signs, and consolidated signsfor multiple users are strongly preferred over multiple individual signs. The City may requirethe use of muted corporate colors on sigange if propsed colors are not compatible with theCity's design objectives for the area.
Division 15-3.0400. Planned Development Districts
§ 15-3.0401. Intent of the Planned Development Districts.
General Intent. The PDD Planned Development Districts are intended to be created, pursuant to§ 62.23(7)(b) of the Wisconsin Statutes as amended, for the purpose of permitting developmentsthat will: derive maximum benefit from coordinated area site planning, diversified location ofstructures, and mixed compatible uses that result in the provision of a safe and efficient system forpedestrian and vehicular traffic, attractive recreation and landscaped open spaces, economicdesign and location of public and private utilities and community facilities; and ensure adequatestandards of construction and planning. The unified and planned development of a site, in singleor corporate ownership or control at the time of application, may be permitted in a PlannedDevelopment District with one or more principal uses or structures and related accessory usesand structures. The regulations within a Planned Development District need not be uniformthroughout the individual PDD District except for those types of intensity standards set forth below.
Open Space, Land Use Intensity and Land Use Density Intent. All PDD Planned DevelopmentDistricts shall, however, specify land use maximum or minimum intensity standards including,where applicable: the open space ratio (OSR), maximum gross residential density, maximum netresidential density, maximum floor area ratio (GFAR and NFAR), and minimum landscape surfaceratio (LSR). These shall be established on an individual PDD District basis in order to regulate theintensity of development on the site. The plan maps shown in the City of Franklin ComprehensiveMaster Plan only identify PDD District areas which were existing at the time of the adoption of theCity of Franklin Comprehensive Master Plan. New PDD Districts may be permitted by the City ifthe owner or his agent can prove to the City that the resulting PDD District will achieve a betterdesign, identical or lesser intensity land uses (in terms of dwelling units, land use type, or GFARand NFAR), and identical or greater OSR than that which is indicated on the adopted City ofFranklin Comprehensive Master Plan maps.

of this Ordinance, which standards may limit or prohibit the uses set forthbelow in this Section.
Permitted Uses in the FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay District. Any use of land, exceptdevelopment involving structures, that is permitted in the underlying basic use district. Examplesof such use would be normal earth-grading activities to permit utilization of the lands for openspace, outdoor recreation, yard, parking, and similar uses are permited so long as the watercarrying and storage capacity of the floodplain is not decreased; croplands in an agriculturaldistrict; required yards in a residential district; or parking or loading areas in a commercial orindustrial district, provided that inundation depths for parking and loading areas do not exceed twofeet or that such areas are not subject to flood velocities greater than two feet per second uponthe occurrence of a one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood.
Special Uses in the FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay District.
Residential, institutional and commercial structures provided that the structure is permitted inthe underlying basic use district, and provided that such floodplain fringe areas shall be filledto an elevation of at least two feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrenceinterval flood. Such fill shall extend for at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the structureplaced thereon. All structures shall be provided with dryland access to lands outside thefloodplain. Where existing streets or sewer lines are at elevations which make dryland accessimpractical, the City may permit development where access roads are at or below the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood stage, provided that the City has written assurancefrom appropriate police and fire departments and emergency service agencies that rescueand relief service will be provided to properties in the area by wheeled vehicles during a floodevent, or the City has an adopted natural disaster plan concurred with by the WisconsinDepartment of Emergency Government and approved by the Wisconsin Department ofNatural Resources. The finished surface of the lowest floor (excluding basement or crawlway)shall be constructed or placed at an elevation that is at least two feet above the elevation ofthe one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood. Basement or crawlway floors may be placedat the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood elevation, provided that the basement orcrawlway is floodproofed to the flood protection elevation. Residential, commercial, orinstitutional structures placed on fill may be removed from the floodplain fringe overlay districtprovided that the fill is contiguous to lands lying outside the floodplain; that compensatorystorage has been provided in accordance with the requirements of paragraph B.7. of thisSection; and the property owner or his agent has complied with all the requirements foramending the zoning map as set forth in Division 15-9.0200 of this Ordinance. Mobile homesshall not be permitted as a conditional use in the FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay District.
Industrial structures provided that the structure is permitted in the underlying basic use districtand provided that the fill requirements for residential and commercial structures in the FFOdistrict are complied with. However, when the intent and purpose of this ordinance cannot befulfilled by filling the floodplain fringe due to existing and committed development, and whenthe City Plan Commission has made a finding to this effect, all new structures and alladditions to existing structures in the Floodplain Fringe Overlay District shall be floodproofedto an elevation of at least two feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-year recurrenceinterval flood. Certification of floodproofing shall be made to the Building Inspector and shallconsist of a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that thefloodproofing measures are consistent with the flood velocities, forces, depths, and otherfactors associated with the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood level for the particularstream reach. Structures placed on fill may be removed from the floodplain fringe overlaydistrict provided that the fill is contiguous to lands lying outside the floodplain; thatcompensatory storage has been provided in accordance with the requirements of paragraphB.7. of this Section; and the property owner or his agent has complied with all therequirements for amending the zoning map as set forth in Division 15-9.0200 of thisOrdinance.

Accessory structures that are associated with a permitted use provided that they are notattached to the principal structure; are not designed for human occupancy; have a low flooddamage potential; are firmly anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement; areconstructed with the lowest floor at or above the one-hundred-year recurrence interval floodelevation; any mechanical or utility equipment is elevated or floodproofed to or above theregional flood elevation; and are constructed to not obstruct the flow of flood waters or causeany increase in flood levels during a one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood event. Suchaccessory structures that are less than 600 square feet in size and valued at less than$10,000 may be constructed with the lowest floor no more than two feet below the regionalflood elevation provided the structure will not be subject to flood velocities greater than twofeet per second upon the occurrence of the regional flood. Any stored materials that arebuoyant, flammable, explosive, or injurious to property, water quality or human, animal, plan,fish, or aquatic life shall be stored at or above an elevation at least two feet above theregional flood or be floodproofed, adequate measures shall be taken to ensure that suchmaterials will not enter the water body during flooding.
Municipal water supply and sanitary sewerage collection systems provided that the system isfloodproofed to an elevation of at least two feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-yearrecurrence interval flood, and is designed to eliminate or minimize infiltration of floodwatersinto the system. Certification of floodproofing shall be made to the Building Inspector and shallconsist of a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that thefloodproofing measures are consistent with the flood velocities, forces, depths, and otherfactors associated with the one-hundred-year recurrence interval flood level for the particularstream reach.
Filling to remove lands from the FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay District provided that such fillshall be to an elevation at least two feet above the elevation of the one-hundred-yearrecurrence interval flood and further provided that such lands are contiguous to lands lyingoutside of the floodplains. No such FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay District shall be removedfrom the Official Zoning Map until the filling is complete and until the property owner, or hisagent, has complied with all the requirements for amending the zoning map as set forth inDivision 15-9.0200 of this Ordinance.
Water quality ponds.
Any areas permitted to be filled and removed from the floodplain fringe overlay district shallprovide compensating flood storage capacity on a volume-for-volume basis, except asdiscussed below herein, in the vicinity of the area removed from the floodplain fringe.
Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered as providing an equal volume ofstorage. The excavated area shall drain between flood events. Calculations for thecompensation shall be prepared by a professional engineer and shall be field-checked andreported on by a professional engineer or registered land surveyor before the certificate ofoccupancy for said property is issued.
If the one-hundred-year flood profile and floodplain boundary are adjusted throughimplementation of a flood mitigation system plan that is designed to 1) reduce the floodhazard to existing buildings and 2) to not create an increase of greater than or equal to 0.01foot in the one-hundred-year flood profile at locations upstream or downstream of the projectreach, those portions of the floodplain fringe overlay district that would be removed from thefloodplain through implementation of the plan can be developed, or redeveloped, even if anequal volume of compensatory storage is not provided.
For such adjustments to the floodplain fringe overlay district, the flood mitigation system plan,including engineering data and calculations showing the new flood profile, shall be submittedto, and approved by, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the FederalEmergency Management Agency, and the floodplain zoning map shall be revised to reflectthe changed floodplain fringe overlay district boundary in accordance with § 15-9.0207.

Uses within the AO-1 District shall be permitted only inaccordance with the following guidelines:
Residential Uses. For all residential uses measures to achieve a noise level reduction(outdoor to indoor) of 25 dB must be incorporated into the design and construction of theresidential structure(s). Mobile home parks or courts shall not be permitted.
[Commentary: Normal construction can be expected to provide a noise level reduction of 20dB; thus, the reduction requirements are about 5 dB over standard construction and normallyassume mechanical ventilation and closed windows year round. Noise level reduction criteriawill not eliminate outdoor noise problems. However, building location and site planning,design and use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor noise exposure particularlyfrom ground level sources. Measures that reduce noise at a site should be used whereverpractical in preference to measures which only protect interior spaces.]
Nonresidential Uses. For land uses in the SIC categories of 805, 806, and 82 (nursing andpersonal care facilities, hospitals, and educational facilities), cultural facilities includingchurches, auditoriums, and theaters, measures to achieve a noise level reduction (outdoor toindoor) of 25 dB must be incorporated into the design and construction of the structure(s).Outdoor music shells or amphitheaters shall not be permitted.

Evidence submitted to the Common Council to determine that no existing tower, structure oralternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist ofany of the following:
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meet theapplicant's engineering requirements.
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant'sengineering requirements.
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support theapplicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with theantenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers orstructures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share anexisting tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing areunreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to beunreasonable.
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existingtowers and structures unsuitable.
The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the useof towers or structures, such a cable microcell network using multiple low-poweredtransmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternativetechnology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed torender the technology unsuitable.

Wetland Buffers. Wetland buffers, as defined in Division 15-11.0100 of this Ordinance, are to bedetermined as the undisturbed land area (including undisturbed natural vegetation) within 30 feetlandward of the delineated boundary of any wetland and parallel to that delineated wetlandboundary. Delineated wetland boundaries shall be determined as set forth in § 15-4.0102H. of thisOrdinance. The area of wetland buffers (in square feet and acres) shall be measured andgraphically delineated on the "Natural Resource Protection Plan." Disturbance of a wetland asmay be specifically allowed under this Ordinance also allows for the disturbance of theappurtenant wetland buffer upon the same terms and conditions, unless otherwise specificallyprovided under this Ordinance or an approval granted hereunder.
Wetland Setbacks. Wetland setbacks are defined in Division 15-11.0100 of this Ordinance. Ifconstruction or disturbance occurs in that area of land which lies between the landward edge ofthe required wetland buffer and the required wetland setbacks then:
Permanent vegetative cover shall be established or reestablished and maintained throughoutthe remaining area (or adjacent to that area, as applicable in the case of the construction ofstormwater management facilities and stormwater quality ponds) in which the construction ordisturbance is located. The vegetative cover required under this Section shall be sufficient toprovide filtering of pollutants from up slope overland flow areas. Seeding of non-aggressivevegetative cover shall be used and native vegetation is preferable. Turf grasses areprohibited. The vegetative cover within such area of the wetland setback which is outside ofthe wetland buffer may be mowed and otherwise similarly maintained.
Non-vegetative materials, such as rock rip-rap, may be employed as necessary to preventerosion such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur.
Disturbance of a wetland buffer as may be specifically allowed under this Ordinance alsoallows for the disturbance of the appurtenant wetland setback upon the same terms andconditions, unless otherwise specifically provided under this Ordinance or an approvalgranted hereunder. The area of wetland setbacks (in square feet and acres) shall bemeasured and graphically delineated on the "Natural Resource Protection Plan".
Exemptions. The following artificial wetlands are exempt from the wetland provisions of Part 4 ofthis Ordinance unless the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources determines, under theprovisions set forth under NR 103.06(4) of the Wisconsin Administrative Code, that the artificialwetland has significant functional values or uses under NR 103.03 (1)(e), (f) or (g) of theWisconsin Administrative Code:

However, the above exemptions do not exempt existing sedimentation and stormwaterdetention basins, sewage lagoons, cooling ponds, waste disposal pits, fish rearing ponds,and landscape ponds from the lakes and ponds protection standards provisions of thisOrdinance as set forth in Tables 15-3.0503 and 15-4.0100 for the purposes of theperformance of site intensity and capacity calculations for residential and nonresidentialdevelopment to determine maximum permitted density yields and/or maximum permittedfloor area yields of sites.
Natural Resources Measurement. All land area within a proposed development, Certified SurveyMap, Subdivision Plat, or Condominium consisting of the natural resource features defined in thisOrdinance shall be accurately measured. The total square feet and acreage of each naturalresource feature shall be multiplied by its respective "Natural Resource Protection Standard" asset forth in Table 15-4.0100 "Natural Resource Protection Standards" of this Ordinance todetermine the amount of each natural resource feature to be protected by a conservationeasement. The methodology, termed "Site Intensity and Capacity Calculations," to be used forsuch calculations is set forth in Division 15-3.0500 of this Ordinance. If two or more naturalresource features are present on the same area of land, only the most restrictive natural resourceprotection standard shall be used. [For example, if floodplains and woodlands and forests occupythe same space on a site, the natural resource protection standard would be 100% (100% is theresource protection standard for a floodplain) for this area representing the higher of the twostandards.] Those areas to be demolished due to improvements or site grading or disturbedthrough the application of permitted mitigation techniques shall also be measured and so notedbut shall not be counted as a natural resource area to be preserved.
§ 15-4.0103. Natural Resource Features Mitigation.
Intent of Mitigation. The City of Franklin recognizes that, under certain circumstances, propertyowners, Subdividers, or non-residential Condominium Developers may wish to develop in portionsof those protected natural resource features areas that are shown as eligible for mitigation asindicated at Table 15-4.0100. In Paragraph B. of this Section, the conditions for mitigation andmitigation standards are set forth for the various natural resource features for which mitigation isallowed under the provisions of Table 15-4.0100. The intent of this Section is not to provide for orallow mitigation under all circumstances, but rather to set specific standards to be applied onlyunder certain circumstances when the extent of or the nature of the natural resources features ona site, when balanced against the benefit of the proposed development to the community,considering practicable alternatives available for the development, render strict application of thenatural resource protection regulations to such natural resource features to be unreasonable andthat such natural resources features may be better preserved and/or enhanced by using a morepermissive mitigation approach, so that the functional values of natural resource features will bepreserved or enhanced in co-existence with development.
Mitigation Standards. The following methods, requirements, standards and/or criteria shall befollowed for the mitigation of those natural resource features that may be mitigated under therequirements set forth under Table 15-4.0100:
Woodlands and Forests. The following shall be applicable to woodland and forest areas:

Mitigation shall include the planting of 1.25 acres of new woodland/forest for every oneacre, or portion thereof, of disturbed woodland/forest for which mitigation is required. Thenew woodland/forest shall survive at least two growing seasons, or shall be replaced.
Mitigation shall include the replacement of woodlands/forests that have been disturbed.Such mitigation shall consist of the planting of new woodland/forest areas, as specified inParagraph (a) above, using the following numbers of plants per acre of mitigated area:
10 canopy trees, minimum 4-inch caliper*
25 canopy trees, minimum 2.5-inch caliper*
100 canopy trees, minimum 5-foot high whips
35 understory trees, minimum 5-foot high whips

*Note: Four-inch caliper canopy trees may be substituted with twelve-foot highevergreen trees; 2.5-inch caliper canopy trees may be substituted with six-foot highevergreen trees.
The species of plants used in the mitigation of woodlands/forests shall be similar to thosethat are destroyed.
The land upon which the mitigation is to take place shall be protected with a deedrestriction and conservation easement as a permanent natural resource featuresconservation easement.
No tree-cutting or removal, subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance, shall reducethe woodland/forest natural resource features protection requirements of this Ordinance.
Lakes and Ponds. Lakes and ponds may be mitigated as may be permitted under therequirements of this Ordinance. Where permitted under the requirements of this Ordinance,the required lakes and ponds natural resource protection standard may be reduced and/ormitigated only if such reduction and/or mitigation is part of a City Engineer approvedstormwater drainage system that meets, at a minimum, all of the following criteria:
The time of concentration of stormwater flows remains unchanged or is lengthened.
Stormwater storage capacity is unchanged or increased.
Additional water is not backed up onto adjoining properties.
Floodplains. Floodplains may be mitigated as may be permitted under the requirements ofthis Ordinance.
Wetlands and Shoreland Wetlands. Wetlands and shoreland wetlands as may be permittedunder the requirements of this Ordinance. In addition, a permit from the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers pursuant to the requirements of § 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344)shall be submitted to the City of Franklin certifying that filling has been approved andpermitted by the Corps, as a condition of City review. No person shall deposit any solid fill orother solid material into any wetland unless a "Natural Resource Protection Plan" in fullcompliance with this Unified Development Ordinance as determined by City staff has beenfiled and such filling has been previously permitted by the City of Franklin pursuant to themitigation provisions of this Part

Wherenew shore buffer is created or expanded, mitigation requires new/expanded shore buffer at aratio of 1.5 times the shore buffer acreage permanently disturbed. Restored and created newshore buffer shall be planted with native plant species and provide for soils of equal or greaterquality than those found in the disturbed shore buffer.
Off-Site Mitigation. Off-site mitigation may be permitted by the Plan Commission provided thatsuch off-site mitigation occurs within the same subwatershed as the natural resource feature, orproperty, being mitigated, and the Plan Commission determines that on-site mitigation isunavailable or less beneficial to the environment than the mitigation proposed to occur off-site.Off-site mitigation outside of the same subwatershed as the natural resource feature or propertybeing mitigated, may be permitted by the Plan Commission provided that such off-site mitigationoccurs within the City and the Plan Commission determines that off-site mitigation within the samesubwatershed is unavailable or less beneficial to the functional values of the natural resourcefeature type being mitigated or less beneficial to the environment or to living creatures than themitigation proposed to occur outside of the same subwatershed. All mitigation shall follow themethods, requirements, standards, and/or criteria set forth under Paragraph B of § 15-4.0103 ofthis Ordinance.

Area Circulation Plan May Be Required. The City of Franklin Plan Commission may requirethe preparation of an area circulation plan for the proposed development, Certified SurveyMap, Subdivision Plat, Condominium, or site plan or covering several properties in an areasurrounding a proposed Certified Survey Map, Subdivision Plat, Condominium, ordevelopment. The delineation of the area for the preparation of an area circulation plan shallbe determined by the Plan Commission upon recommendation of either the City Engineer orCity Planner. Such a plan may require the sharing of access locations or temporary access.All landowners, except those with a previously approved Certified Survey Map, SubdivisionPlat, Condominium, or site plan, shall be required to conform to such an area circulation planonce it is adopted by the Plan Commission as a component, or element, of the City ofFranklin Comprehensive Master Plan. The Plan Commission may require that such an areacirculation plan be prepared based upon the conduct of a traffic impact analysis conducted bya licensed professional engineer with expertise in traffic engineering. The City Engineer andCity Planner shall review all such studies and assist the Plan Commission.
Vehicular Nonaccess Reservations Required. The Plan Commission may require that deedrestrictions be placed on Certified Survey Maps, Subdivision Plats, Condominiums, or parcelsfor which a site plan is proposed in order to limit vehicular access to abutting arterial,collector, or minor streets and highways. A landscaped bufferyard of adequate opacity,determined by the Plan Commission or by Division 15-5.0300 of this Ordinance, shall beprovided in vehicular nonaccess reservations along the property line abutting a public streetright-of-way. In such situations, vehicular access to such lots may be provided by an abuttingminor or collector street at designated access driveways.

Plans as set forth in this Division. On matters that require zoning approval by the Plan Commission,the Plan Commission shall act as the Architectural Review Board, and the Plan Commission mayrequest assistance of the Architectural Board.
§ 15-7.0802. Principles and Standards of Review.
The following principles and standards for architectural review are used by the Architectural ReviewBoard in its review, approval or denial of the Architectural Review Application. These are also intendedto be a design aid for builders and owners to use in the preparation of architectural plans. Toimplement this Ordinance, the following architectural review principles and guidelines are established:
Building Scale and Mass. The relative proportion of a building to its neighboring existing buildings,to pedestrians or observers, or to other existing buildings shall be maintained or enhanced whennew buildings are built or when existing buildings are remodeled or altered.
Building Rooflines and Roof Shapes. The visual continuity of roofs and their contributing elements(parapet walls, coping, cornices, etc.) shall be maintained in building development orredevelopment.
Materials. Material selection for architectural design shall be based upon the prevailing materialalready used on existing buildings in the area. No building shall be permitted where any exposedfacade is constructed or faced with a finished material which is aesthetically incompatible withother building facades in the area or which presents an unattractive appearance to the public andsurrounding properties.
Colors. Since the selection of building colors has a significant aesthetic and visual impact upon thepublic and neighboring properties, color shall be selected in general harmony with the existingarea or neighborhood buildings.
Design Repetition. A building design may not be repeated within four lots, adjacent or facing onsame street. This shall apply to all buildings, whether or not they are constructed by the samebuilder.
Elevations of Buildings Facing the Public Streets on a Corner Lot. Buildings located on corner lotsshall continue the major front elevation design elements around the corner elevation.
Building Elevations Clad with a Singular Exterior Surface Material. Building elevations clad with asingular exterior surface material shall provide some additional architectural design element(s) tobreak up the plane of the wall. This may be done by the addition of window(s), gable end walltreatments, siding design and accent panels, or other architectural design treatments consistentwith the principal building design.
Foundations Below Overhanging Bays. Buildings shall be designed with foundations below allbays which overhang the building foundation. The Architectural Review Board will allow theconstruction of bay windows, projections of floors above the first floor. Front window bays will bepermitted, provided that they are a minimum of 12 inches above grade.
Enclosure of Metal Furnace Vents. All chimney and fireplace vents shall be enclosed in a chaseconstructed of materials similar to those materials used on the building elevations; metal housingsdesigned by the vent manufacturer to enclose the chimney vents are acceptable.
§ 15-7.0803. Applications for Architectural Review.
Architectural Review Applications including Architectural Plans and related data and materials shall besubmitted to the Building Inspector who shall transmit all Architectural Review Applications and theiraccompanying data and materials to the Architectural Review Board for their review and approval.

It is the purpose of this Division tohelp preserve the natural resources; to protect the quality of the waters of the State and of theCity; and to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the people, to the extentpracticable, by minimizing the amount of sediment and other pollutants carried by runoff ordischarged from construction sites to lakes, streams, nature conservancy areas and wetlands, byminimizing the amount of airborne dust and by preventing the destruction of natural resourcesintended to be preserved by this ordinance, through the administration and enforcement of thepermit, plan, control measure and maintenance requirements of this Division.
Authority.
This ordinance is adopted under the authority granted by § 62.234, Wis. Stats. This ordinancesupersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under § 62.23, Wis. Stats., thatrelate to construction site erosion control. Except as otherwise specified in § 62.234, Wis.Stats., § 62.23, Stats., applies to this ordinance and to any amendments to this ordinance.

§ 15-8.0601. Authority.
This ordinance is adopted by the Common Council under the authority granted by s. 62.234 Wis.Stats. This ordinance supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under s. 62.23Wis. Stats., that relate to storm water management regulations.
§ 15-8.0602. Findings of Fact.
The Common Council finds that uncontrolled, runoff has a significant impact upon water resources andthe health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and useof natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can:
Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour,diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing streamtemperature;
Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and watersupply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavymetals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants;
Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads;
Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading;
Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways, and other drainage facilities;
Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks andvolumes;
Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding; and
Aggravate excessive infiltration and inflow of water into sanitary sewer connections during peakstorm events causing the conveyance system to surcharge, overflow or backup into basements.

It is the purpose of this Division to establish long-term, post-construction runoff managementrequirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and the aquatic environmentby integrating local, state, and federal storm water quantity and quality standards. This Divisionimplements the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) rules on release rates fordevelopment creating more than a de minimis amount of new impervious surface to reduce theprobability of increased regional floods as the metropolitan area approaches full build-out forecast for2050. It also incorporates Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources quantity and qualityrequirements as found in NR 151, Wis. Adm. Code.
§ 15-8.0604. Storm Water Quality and Quantity ManagementApplicability.
[Amended
6-7-2016
by
Ord. No. 2016-2218
]
The water quality management duties apply to property development disturbing one or more acresand the water quantity management duties apply to development disturbing one or more acres orincreasing impervious surface by one-half acre or more, unless the site is exempt underparagraph (2) or (3).
Note: The one acre land disturbance threshold is consistent with state and federal laws regardingapplicability of construction site erosion control permits. The half-acre or more of new impervioussurface is the MMSD criteria.
A site meeting any one of the following criteria is exempt from storm water quality requirements:
A redevelopment post-construction site with no increase in exposed parking lots or roads.
A post-construction site with less than 10% connected imperviousness based on completedevelopment of the post-construction site, provided the cumulative area of all parking lots androoftops is less than one acre.
Nonpoint discharges from agricultural facilities and practices.
Nonpoint discharges from silviculture activities.
Routine maintenance for project sites under five acres of land disturbance if performed tomaintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purpose of the facility.
Underground utility construction such as water, sewer, and fiberoptic lines. This exemptiondoes not apply to the construction of any above-ground structures associated with utilityconstruction.
Water quantity management duties do not apply for:
Residential infill where the lot is five acres or less, the development is exclusively residential,the net increase in the area of impervious surface is less than 10% of the area of the site, andeach boundary of the site is contiguous to: sites that contain earlier development served bysanitary sewers, streets, or public water supply when the governmental unit receives theplans for the new development or parkland; or other public land, a utility right-of-way, or awatercourse; or,
Sites where the area of impervious surface after development will be 5% or less of the totalarea of the site;
Recreational trails if the trail is less than or equal to 10 feet in width and has a continuouspervious buffer at least 5 feet wide on each side, disregarding interruption by streets,

driveways, or other impervious surfaces crossing the trail. [; or]
Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in paragraph (1), this ordinance applies topost-construction sites of any size that, in the opinion of the City Engineer or designee, islikely to result in runoff that exceeds the capacity of the existing drainage facilities or the levelof flooding protection in a watercourse that causes undue channel erosion, that increaseswater pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter, or that endangersproperty or public safety.
Comity. State agencies should design and incorporate best management practices for surfacewater quality and storm water quantity management for new impervious surfaces. The runoffmanagement techniques should be the same as flood abatement plans and techniques utilized bylocal governments in the watershed. The lead agency preparing an environmental assessment fora federal or state project should identify the mitigating runoff management techniques to preventincreases in peak flood flows from new impervious areas.
Note: See Trans 400 (Environmental Assessment) and Trans 401 (2003 revisions to conform withNR 151 standards). Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) and Wis. DNR have ajurisdictional memorandum of understanding per § 281.33 (2), Wis. Stats., limited to managementof pollutants in storm water. Trans 401 is narrowly tailed to BMPs for pollution abatement anddesign criteria for transportation projects. Neither DNR nor DOT rules address post-constructionpeak runoff and flooding in fully urbanized areas, but each agency's environmental assessmentshould consider the impacts of new impervious surfaces and the technical and economicallyfeasible alternatives to mitigate the adverse impacts. More stringent local storm watermanagement requirements for peak runoff do not conflict with the state policy on controllingpollutants discharged from storm water point sources. The state rules address different adverseimpacts of storm water runoff based on different probabilities and storm intensity. Finally, Trans401 allows a de minimis exemption from water quality BMPs for highway improvements of lessthan 1.5 miles and widening of a roadbed by less than 100 feet. Chapter
13
of MMSD Rules andthis local ordinance do not treat impervious highways any different than other impervious surfaces.The same threshold of one-half acre or more of new impervious surface for purposes of waterquantity BMPs applies.

or after October 1, 2004, the responsible party shall meet the total suspended solids reduction,peak flow control, infiltration, and protective areas standards applicable to the older developmentor meet the redevelopment standards of this ordinance, whichever is more stringent.
Requirements. The water quality and quantity plan required under subd. (2) shall include thefollowing:
Total Suspended Solids. BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to control totalsuspended solids carried in runoff from the post-construction site as follows:
For new and in-fill developments, by design, reduce to the maximum extent practicable,the total suspended solids load by 80%, based on the average annual rainfall, ascompared to no runoff management controls. No person shall be required to exceed an80% total suspended solids reduction to meet the requirements of this subdivision.
For redevelopment, by design, reduce to the maximum extent practicable, the totalsuspended solids load from parking areas and roads by 40%, based on the averageannual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. No person shall berequired to exceed a 40% total suspended solids reduction to meet the requirements ofthis subdivision.
Maximum Extent Practicable. If the design cannot meet a total suspended solidsreduction performance standard of subs. 1. to 2, the storm water management plan shallinclude a written, site-specific explanation of why the total suspended solids reductionperformance standard cannot be met and why the total suspended solids load will bereduced only to the maximum extent practicable.
Note: Pollutant loading models such as DETPOND, WinSLAMM, P8, or equivalentmethodology may be used to evaluate the efficiency of the design in reducing totalsuspended solids. Use the most recent version of the model and the rainfall files andother parameter files identified for Wisconsin users unless directed otherwise.
Off-Site Drainage. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP from offsite shall betaken into account in determining the treatment efficiency of the practice. Any impact onthe efficiency shall be compensated for by increasing the size of the BMP accordingly.
Water Quantity and Management of Peak Runoff.
BMPs shall manage the volume, timing, and peak flow rate of runoff to prevent increasesin the regional flood and stream bank erosion rates.
These BMPs may be implemented on either a watershed basis or an individual site basis.
When implemented on a watershed basis, the BMPs implemented at a particular siteshall comply with the findings of the relevant local or regional storm water managementplan, rather than subs. 6 and 7.
By design, BMPs shall be employed to maintain or reduce the 1-year, 24-hour post-construction peak runoff discharge rate to the 1-year, 24-hour pre-development peakrunoff discharge rate, or to the maximum extent practicable.
By design, BMPs shall be employed to meet both of the following for the 2-year, 24-hourstorm:
Maintain or reduce the 2-year, 24-hour post-construction peak runoff discharge rateto the 2-year, twenty-four-hour pre-development peak runoff discharge rate, or to themaximum extent practicable (per City of Franklin), and

Achieve a maximum runoff release rate of 0.15 cubic feet per second per acre orutilize the volumetric design procedure to limit post-development runoff volumes toexisting condition runoff volumes during the critical time period (per MMSD).
By design, BMPs shall be employed to maintain or reduce the 10-year, 24-hour post-construction peak runoff discharge rate to the 10-year, 24-hour pre-development peakrunoff discharge rate, or to the maximum extent practicable.
By design, BMPs shall be employed to meet the both of the following for the 100-year,24-hour storm:
Maintain or reduce the 100-year, 24-hour post-construction peak runoff dischargerate to the 100-year, 24 hour pre-development peak runoff discharge rate, or to themaximum extent practicable (per City of Franklin), and
The stricter of the following (per MMSD):
Achieve a maximum runoff release rate of 0.5 cubic feet per second per acre orutilize the volumetric design procedure to limit post- development runoffvolumes to existing condition runoff volumes during the critical time period, or
A rate determined for the individual site that distributes runoff over the criticaltime sufficient to comply with sub. 1.
Note: § 13.11(3)(b)(2), MMSD Rules, permits an individual site exemption fromthe 0.5 cfs release rate if an analysis shows that the runoff will be distributedover the critical time (a defined term) so as not to reduce the level of protectiondownstream.
The runoff curve numbers in Table 1 shall be used to represent the actual pre-development conditions. Peak discharges shall be calculated using TR-55 runoff curvenumber methodology, Atlas 14 precipitation depths, and the appropriate NRCSWisconsin MSE3 or MSE4 precipitation distribution. On a case-by-case basis, the CityEngineer may allow the use of TP-40 precipitation depths and the Type II distribution.
Note: The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)  Wisconsin has calculatedcounty-specific Atlas 14 precipitation depths and they are to be used in combination withthe appropriate NRCS MSE3 or MSE4 precipitation distribution.

Pond Maintenance Guidelines.
Trees and Brush
Trees and brush may be permitted on slope surfaces or berms.
Stump Removal and Sprout Prevention
Stumps of trees should be removed so vegetation can be established and the surface mowed.Stumps can either be removed by pulling or with machines that grind them down. All woody
9/16/2020 City of Franklin, WI Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/FR1719?guid=FR1719&children=true 815/943
(4)
material should be removed to about 6 inches below the ground surface. The cavity should befilled with well-compacted soil and grass vegetation established.
Stumps of trees in riprap areas that cannot usually be easily pulled or ground down can bechemically treated so they will not continually form new sprouts. Certain herbicides are effectivefor this purpose and can even be used near water supply reservoirs if applied by licensedpersonnel. These products should be painted, not sprayed, on the stumps. Other instructionsfound on the label should be strictly followed when handling and applying these materials. Onlya few commercially available chemicals can be used along shorelines or near water.
Landscaping
Vegetation shall be examined regularly, at least twice a year during the first two growingseasons. Stunted growth of pond vegetation or growth and excessive invasive species indicatethat increased maintenance and intervention will be necessary.
Native landscaping prairie area shall be managed by hand removal for invasives during the first2-3 years of the growing season in order to become well established. Burning, cutting, orselective herbicide for management of invasives and woody species should take place asneeded on a two-year cycle after the third growing season. Emergent and submergentvegetation around the perimeter of the pond areas shall be inspected annually and any non-native and invasive species be removed. Herbicides should not be used near open waterareas.
Structural Inspection and Maintenance
After construction and site grading are complete, the pond should be checked by the CityEngineer for correct design depth and volume. If sediment has deposited during construction orsite grading, the pond shall be re-excavated.
The annual inspection by the City Engineer and/or maintenance of the following items shallinclude inspection of:

Pond inlets and outlets for structural integrity and blockage,

Riprap at pipe and culvert outlets for placement, integrity, and effectiveness,

Inspection of berms for cracks, excessive settlement, or seepage.
Sediment Removal (Dredging)
This component includes monitoring of the levels of the sediment on an annual basis. Whenthe sediment in the forebay (or the main basin) reaches a depth of two feet, the material shallbe removed so that the original volume of the permanent pool is maintained. In general, ponddredging is expected to occur once every 10 to 15 years. The following practices help ensuredredging is not warranted prematurely:

Construction site erosion control,

As-built survey of the pond at time of completion,

Successful re-vegetation and/or restoration of pond surroundings.
Nuisance Waterfowl Control
Nuisance waterfowl control is generally achieved through the use of upland or shoreland buffersconsisting of un-mowed tall vegetation. The buffer zone can be mowed in the early summer ofthe second full growing season. Refer to Appendix "F" of the City of Franklin Storm WaterManagement Plan Update dated December 2002 by Bonestroo, Rosene, Anderlik andAssociates.
Constructed Wetlands.
In some situations, a sedimentation basin followed by a natural wetland buffer (to act as a pre-filterto a natural wetland), a restored wetland, or a constructed wetland "can" be an effective means ofremoving some suspended solids, nutrients, and other potential pollutants from storm water runoff.The primary function of the sedimentation basin is, as already noted, to remove buoyant debrisand suspended solids and the related potential pollutants. Storm water then passes into therestored or constructed wetland where physical (e.g., settling) and biological (e.g., nutrient uptake
9/16/2020 City of Franklin, WI Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/FR1719?guid=FR1719&children=true 816/943
(5)
(6)
by vegetation) processes remove additional potential pollutants. The restored or constructedwetland offers opportunities to develop wildlife habitat, education (e.g., self-guided tours), andaesthetic benefits.
In addition to regular maintenance activities, several design features can be incorporated to easethe maintenance of restored or constructed wetlands. One potential maintenance concern inrestored or constructed wetlands is clogging of the outlet. Restored or constructed wetlandsshould be designed with a non-clogging outlet such as a reverse-slope pipe, or a weir outlet with atrash rack. A reverse-slope pipe draws from below the micropool extending in a reverse angle upto the riser and establishes the water elevation of the micropool. Because these outlets drawwater from below the level of the micropool, they are less likely to be clogged by floating debris.
Restored or constructed wetlands should incorporate design features that make sedimentcleanouts of both the forebay and the shallow pool easier. Restored or constructed wetlandsshould have direct maintenance access to the forebay to allow this relatively routine (five to sevenyear) sediment cleanouts. In addition, the shallow pool should generally have a drain to drawdown the restored or constructed wetland for the more infrequent dredging of the main cell of therestored or constructed wetland.
In general, the introduction of natural features in constructed wet detention basins will not onlyincrease pollutant removal capacity, but also result in a new water body that can potentially cometo offer wildlife habitat values. In order to help this process, the wet detention ponds must bespecially designed to have the appropriate geometry, location, size, and vegetation. Such facilitiesare called constructed wetlands and have been shown to be effective, successful, and reliable inthe long run.
Because of their natural appearance, water quality benefits, and need for minimum maintenance,constructed wetlands are preferred and should be encouraged whenever appropriate and/orpossible. However, it should be noted that storm water wetlands are designed specifically for thepurpose of treating storm water runoff, and typically have less biodiversity than natural wetlandsboth in terms of plant and animal life.
Bioretention Facilities.
Bioretention areas are landscaping features adapted to treat storm water runoff on thedevelopment site. They are commonly located in parking lot islands or within small pockets inresidential land uses. Surface runoff is directed into shallow, landscaped depressions. Thesedepressions are designed to incorporate many of the pollutant removal mechanisms that operatein forested ecosystems. Runoff from larger storms is generally diverted past the facility to thestorm drain system or another BMP. The remaining runoff filters through a prepared or amendedsoil mixture which acts as a pollutant removal system. When underlying soils are not conducive toinfiltration the filtered runoff is collected in a perforated underdrain and sent to the storm drainsystem.
Bioretention systems can be applied to a wide range of development. Bioretention can be appliedin many climate and geologic situations, with some minor design modifications. In cold climates,bioretention areas can be used as a snow storage area. When used for this purpose, or if used totreat parking lot runoff, the bioretention area should be planted with salt-tolerant and non-woodyplant species, and the composition of the soil mixture should be designed specifically toaccommodate this purpose. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Storm Water Post-Construction Technical Standard No. 1004, Bioretention for Infiltration, may be used as areference for design, operation and maintenance of these facilities.
Forebays (Pre-Settlement Basins).
Pre-settlement basins or forebays consist of additional storage space located near a storm waterpractice inlet that serves to trap incoming coarse sediments before they accumulate in the maintreatment area. In general, the surface area of the forebay is typically about 10% of the volume ofthe main pool.
The forebay is designed to settle out coarse sediment particles before they reach the main pool.By trapping these sediments in the forebay, it is possible to greatly reduce the maintenance

burden of the pond. Coarse sediments are trapped in the forebay, and these sediments areremoved from the smaller pool on a five to seven year cycle.
It is recommended that wet detention ponds or constructed wetlands with a total main pool area ofgreater than 0.5 acres should have a forebay area to create an additional level of sedimentremoval and maintenance reduction.
Miscellaneous Maintenance.
Debris and Obstructions
It is important to regularly remove any accumulation of debris, which may act to block the primaryoutlet, the trash rack leading into the outlet pipe, or the outlet pipe itself. If any of these itemsbecome obstructed, a rise in the pond level could occur, creating undue stress and endangeringthe slopes and berms. In addition, debris can promote deterioration of the slopes throughabrasive actions.
Animal Burrows
Animal burrows provide a seepage path for water through the berms. Concentrated seepage canresult in slope failure. All burrows should be filled in with soil or grout, topped, and seeded forerosion protection and live trapped and removed if necessary.
Riprap
Maintenance of riprap areas should be relatively minor. Any displaced riprap should be replaced.This may be occurring near the water surface, when ice accumulation can move riprap.
Riprap is placed over geotextile fabric. Roots from vegetation may act to compromise this fabric,thereby reducing its effectiveness. Therefore, all vegetation in riprap areas should be removedusing methods described in subd. (3).
§ 15-8.0611. Financial Guarantee.
Establishment of the Guarantee. The Common Council may require the submittal of a financialguarantee; the form and type of which shall be acceptable to the City Attorney.

(7) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
(8) Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result
in conflicts between property owners; and
(9) Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to
locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
1.4 TITLE
This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of
Franklin, Wisconsin.
1.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS
(1) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood
or base flood.
UDO Attachment 1:4 06 - 01 - 2018
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or AZones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Franklin
Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No
changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be
effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in
the office of the City Clerks Office, City of Franklin. If more than one map or
revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel

Number 55079CV001A, 55079CV002A, 55079CV003A, 55079CV004A, and
55079CV005A, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
dated September 26, 2008.
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA
(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
(a) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry
the regional floodwaters.
(b) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between
the regional flood limits and the floodway.
(c) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or
may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.
(4) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and
actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (a) or
(b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended
according to s. 8.0. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived
from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a
map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for
documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which
the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments
UDO Attachment 1:5 06 - 01 - 2018
FRANKLIN CODE
required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an
applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to s. 7.3(3)
and the criteria in (a) and (b) below.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall
determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be
determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any
information provided by the Department.
(5) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for
removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the
regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the
floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to s. 8.0.
(6) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in
compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state,
and federal regulations.
(7) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties
are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits.
State agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and
bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when s.
30.2022, Stats., applies.
(8) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
(a) This ordinance supersedes all less-restrictive provisions of the Unified
Development Ordinance or any municipal zoning ordinance enacted
under s. 62.23 or s. 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another
ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall
continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions,
but not otherwise.
(b) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall
prevail.

UDO Attachment 1:6 06 - 01 - 2018
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the
minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the Common Council
and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the
Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116,
Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the
standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on
the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(10) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering
experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height
may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not
imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will
be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this ordinance create
liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance
on this ordinance.
(11) SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by
a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected.
(12) ANNEXED AREAS
The Milwaukee, Racine and Waukesha County floodplain zoning provisions in
effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by
the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and
enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands
are described on the municipalitys official zoning map. County floodplain
zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of
administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning
administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood
elevation and the location of the floodway.
(13) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed
building, construction and or development site is in a flood-prone area, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and
practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other
UDO Attachment 1:7 06 - 01 - 2018
FRANKLIN CODE
service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering
or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. All land
divisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All land
divisions proposals (including manufactured home parks and condominiums)
shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development
that meets the subdivision definition of this ordinance.
