The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public has confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is established a code of ethics for all city officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards, committees and commissions of the city as well as any individuals who are candidates for elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination papers with the city. The purpose of this code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. The provisions and purpose of this code and such rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best interests of the city and are promulgated under the authority granted to the city pursuant to Section 19.59(1), Wisconsin Statutes.

Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this state and carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and municipality and to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their prime concern.

In cases where an employee’s previous rate of pay exceeds the maximum of the new lower salary grade, such an employee will be paid at the maximum of the new lower salary grade. (Ord. 2411-15 § 4 (part), 2015: Ord. 2303-12 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2131-08 § 1 (part), 2008)

The rates of pay established for these titles are in recognition that a certain amount of overtime is considered normal and appropriate for supervisory and management titles. Such employees, with department head approval, work on a flexible schedule, so that the daily work schedule may be adjusted from time to time as necessary and appropriate to fulfill assigned duties and responsibilities. Such adjustments may include starting and quitting times that are earlier or later than established in the normal work schedule of the department, and may include more or less than eight hours in any particular day and more or less than forty (40) hours in any particular week. These provisions shall not be construed as allowing compensatory time off at more than 1.0x, allowing time off for extended personal illness without charge to sick leave, or allowing time off for extended vacation.

Incumbents of titles contained in Part I, Section II, (technical and clerical) of the salary ordinance adopted annually pursuant to this chapter shall be eligible for compensatory time off at the rate of 1.5x in lieu of cash payment for overtime worked in excess of forty (40) hours per workweek, provided an enabling agreement between the employee and the city is reached.

2.40.120 Discipline of employees.

Any appointing officer or department head is vested with disciplinary or removal power. Such appointing officer or department head shall be allowed full freedom in such matters, it being the intent and spirit of this chapter to provide a fair and just approach to municipal employment, but, in no sense, to curtail responsible administrative officers in securing efficient service. All persons holding positions in the civil service shall be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge, by the appointing authority, subject to appeal to the civil service commission as set forth below.

A.    If the appointing authority has reason to believe an employee may have engaged in conduct which may result in discipline, the appointing authority shall promptly investigate the circumstances of such situation. The affected employee may be suspended, with pay, pending the results of the investigation and given the opportunity to present any information or statements the employee wishes the department head to consider before making any final determination.

B.    After the meeting with the employee has been concluded, the appointing authority shall decide whether any misconduct occurred and, if so, the appropriate penalty.

C.    The appointing authority may only discipline employees subject to this chapter for just cause. (Ord. 2412-15 § 4 (part), 2015: Ord. 2257-11 § 3, 2011: Ord. 2131-08 § 1 (part), 2008)


2.40.130 Appeals of disciplinary actions.

An employee who is dissatisfied with disciplinary actions taken by the appointing authority may take the following steps:

A.    If the penalty does not result in any direct loss of economic benefit to the employee, i.e., suspension, demotion or discharge, the employee may submit a written response to the appointing authority’s disciplinary decision, and such written response shall be included in the employee’s personnel file. The employee may also discuss the matter with the appointing authority’s direct supervisor. There shall be no further appeal of these actions.

B.    If the penalty causes the direct loss of economic benefits to the employee, the employee may file a request for hearing before the civil service commission within five days of the date on which the appointing authority announces the discipline. Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the appointing authority shall, within ten days, serve on the civil service commission and the employee a statement of the underlying facts which led to the disciplinary decision, the rules of conduct or standards violated by the employee’s actions, and any other information the appointing authority deems relevant to the decision to discipline the employee. The employee shall, within ten days of receipt of this statement, file an answer.

C.    Unless otherwise stipulated by the parties, the civil service commission shall then set a date for hearing not more than thirty (30) days after receipt of the information listed in subsection B of this section.

D.    The sole issue before the civil service commission shall be: based on the evidence and information presented to the appointing authority at the time of his decision, was the appointing authority’s decision reasonable? If the commission decides the decision was unreasonable, the commission shall decide on an appropriate remedy under the circumstances.

E.    The commission shall adopt rules for hearings. (Ord. 2131-08 § 1 (part), 2008) 


2.40.140 Wages and benefits.

The wages and benefits covering employees governed by this chapter shall be set by the council. Those wages and benefits may be modified or reduced at the discretion of the council from time to time without violating the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2131-08 § 1 (part), 2008)

A.    A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Section 19.37, Wisconsin Statutes. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 2.60.040(F)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.

B.    If the legal custodian has doubts as to whether the requested records are exempt from disclosure, he shall have three days to confer with the city attorney before making the proper determination.

C.    A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 2.60.060. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Section 19.37(1), Wisconsin Statutes, or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney. (Ord. 2131-08 § 1 (part), 2008)


2.60.060 Limitations on right to access.

A.    As provided by Section 19.36, Wisconsin Statutes, the following records are exempt from inspection under this section:

1.    Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;

2.    Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state;

3.    Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection;

4.    A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret;

5.    Employment records under Section 103.13, Wisconsin Statutes.

B.    As provided by Section 43.30, Wisconsin Statutes, public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this section.

C.    In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, may deny the request in whole or in part only if he determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.    Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which were necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them;

2.    Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing;

3.    Records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance or discipline of any city officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a city officer or employee unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure;

4.    Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention. Among, but not limited to, the reasons for denying all or parts of police records as the following:

a.    This portion contains confidential information furnished only by a confidential source who has requested anonymity as a condition of relaying this information,

b.    This portion would identify a confidential source and this would jeopardize a criminal investigation,

c.    This portion would identify a confidential source and this would endanger the life or physical safety of this source,

d.    This portion would disclose the contents of a communication between executive personnel on matters of policy, the disclosure of which would inhibit the frank and full discussion of matters necessary to set policy,

e.    This portion will jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation in that it will disclose evidence,

f.    This portion will impair the ability of the investigating officers to function effectively in that it will disclose techniques used in investigations,

g.    This portion names law enforcement personnel. Disclosure will impair their effectiveness in their duties and subject them to harassment and physical injury,

h.    This portion identifies citizens. Disclosure may cause undue damage to the reputation of citizens in the community and violate the right to privacy under Section 895.50, Wisconsin Statutes,

i.    This information is unsubstantiated; if released, it would unduly damage the reputation of the individual or individuals involved,

j.    This portion identifies a person. Disclosure of such persons in this context would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect on their reputation,

k.    This portion identifies a juvenile. Disclosure of such person and information is in violation of Section 48.396, Wisconsin Statutes,

l.    This portion contains employee performance evaluation data,

m.    This portion contains information not made public as part of a written public speech, presentation or press release;

5.    Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of city property, investing of city funds or other city business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure;

6.    Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data;

7.    Communications between legal counsel for the city and any officer, agent or employee of the city when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the city or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under Section 905.03, Wisconsin Statutes.

D.    If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the city attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the city attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgment of the custodian and the city attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure. (Ord. 2131-08 § 1 (part), 2008)


2.60.070 Destruction of records.

The destruction of city records shall be governed by the Records Disposition Authorizations of the Wisconsin Public Records Board dated August 31, 2015, which are on file in the office of the city clerk. The destruction of any public record which is not provided for therein shall only be done pursuant to Wisconsin law. (Ord. 2430-15 § 1, 2015: Ord. 2131-08 § 1 (part), 2008)


2.60.080 Preservation through microfilm.

Any city officer or the director of any department or division of city government may, subject to the approval of the mayor and the council, keep and preserve public records in his possession by means of microfilm or other photographic reproduction method. Such records shall meet the standard for photographic reproduction set forth in Section 16.61(7)(a) and (b), Wisconsin Statutes, and shall be considered original records for all purposes. Such records shall be preserved along with other files of the department or division and shall be open to public inspection and copying according to the provisions of state law and of Sections 2.60.040 and 2.60.060.

F.    Right of Appeal.

5.08.070 Franchise renewal.

A.    Current Federal Statutory Process.

1.    The city may, on its own initiative, during the six-month period which begins with the thirty-sixth (36) month before the franchise expiration, commence a proceeding which affords the public in the city appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of: (a) identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests, and (b) reviewing the performance of the grantee under the franchise. If the grantee submits, during such six-month period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of such proceeding, the city shall commence such proceeding not later than six months after the date such notice is submitted.

2.    Upon completion of the proceeding under subsection (A)(1) of this section, the grantee may, on its own initiative or at the request of the city, submit a proposal for renewal. The city may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted.

3.    Upon submittal by the grantee of a proposal to the city for the renewal of the franchise, the city shall provide prompt, public notice of such proposal and renew the franchise or issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed, and at the request of the grantee or on its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding, after providing prompt, public notice of such proceeding.

4.    The city shall consider in any administrative proceeding whether: (a) the grantee has substantially complied with material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law; (b) the quality of the grantee’s service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints and billing practices, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in the light of community needs; (c) the grantee has the financial, legal and technical ability to provide the services, facilities and equipment as set forth in the grantee’s proposal; and (d) the grantee’s proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the costs of meeting such needs and interests.

5.    In any proceeding under subsection (A)(4) of this section, the grantee shall be afforded adequate notice and the grantee and the city, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceedings under subsection (A)(1) of this section), to require the production of evidence and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding.

6.    At the completion of a proceeding under subsection (A)(4) of this section, the city shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding and transmit a copy of such decision to the grantee. Such decision shall state the reasons therefore.

7.    Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with the procedures set forth above, shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described at subsection (A)(4)(a) through (A)(4)(d) of this section pursuant to the record of the proceeding under subsection (A)(4) of this section. The city may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise or on events considered under subsection (A)(4)(b) of this section unless the city has provided the grantee with notice and the opportunity to cure or in any case in which it is documented that the city has waived its right to object.

8.    The grantee may appeal any final decision or failure of the city to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section. The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that: (a) any action of the city is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section; or (b) in the event of a final decision of the city denying the renewal proposal, the grantee has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the city with respect to each of the factors described in subsection (A)(4)(a) through (A)(4)(d) of this section on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the administrative proceeding.

B.    Franchise Renewal in the Event of Change in Federal Law. A franchise may be renewed by the city upon application of the grantee pursuant to the procedure established in this section, and in accordance with the then applicable law.

1.    At least twenty-four (24) months prior to the expiration of the franchise, the grantee shall inform the city in writing of its intent to seek renewal of the franchise.

2.    The grantee shall submit a proposal for renewal which demonstrates:

a.    That it has been and continues to be in substantial compliance with the terms, conditions and limitations of this chapter and its franchise;

b.    That its system has been installed, constructed, maintained and operated in accordance with the accepted standards of the industry, and this chapter and its franchise;

c.    That it has the legal, technical, financial and other qualifications to continue to maintain and operate its system, and to extend the same as the state of the art progresses so as to assure its subscribers high quality service; and

d.    That it has made a good faith effort to provide services and facilities which accommodate the demonstrated needs of the community as may be reasonably ascertained by the city.

3.    After giving public notice, the city shall proceed to determine whether the grantee has satisfactorily performed its obligations under the franchise. To determine satisfactory performance, the city shall consider technical developments and performance of the system, programming other services offered, cost of services, and any other particular requirements set in this chapter; shall consider the grantee’s reports made to the city and the Federal Communication Commission; may require the grantee to make available specified records, documents, and information for this purpose, and may inquire specifically whether the grantee will supply services sufficient to meet community needs and interests. Industry performance on a national basis shall also be considered. Provision shall be made for public comment.

4.    The city shall then prepare any amendments to this chapter that it believes necessary.

5.    If the city finds the grantee’s performance satisfactory, and finds the grantee’s technical, legal and financial abilities acceptable, and finds the grantee’s renewal proposal meets the future cable-related needs of the city, a new franchise shall be granted pursuant to this chapter as amended for a period to be determined.

6.    If the grantee is determined by the city to have performed unsatisfactorily, new applicants may be sought and evaluated and a franchise award shall be made by the city according to franchising procedures adopted by the city. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 7), 2000)

A.    In accepting this franchise, the grantee shall acknowledge that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and shall agree to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to such power.

B.    Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other present or future lawful exercise of the city’s police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction, or applies exclusively to the grantee or cable television systems which contains provisions inconsistent with this franchise, shall prevail only if upon such exercise the city finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare or such exercise is mandated by law. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 8), 2000)

However, the city may require a construction bond to be posted by the grantee for any construction subsequent to the completion of the initial service area, in a reasonable amount and upon such terms as determined by the city.

D.    The bond shall contain the following endorsement:

It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City, by registered mail, a written notice of such intent to cancel and not to renew.

The grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold harmless the city, all associated, affiliated, allied and subsidiary entities of the city, now existing or hereinafter created, and their respective officers, boards, commissions, employees, agents, attorneys, and contractors (hereinafter referred to as “indemnities”), from and against:

1.    Any and all liability, obligation, damages, penalties, claims, liens, costs, charges, losses and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, expert witnesses and consultants), which may be imposed upon, incurred by or be asserted against the indemnities by reason of any act or omission of the grantee, its personnel, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors, resulting in personal injury, bodily injury, sickness, disease or death to any person or damage to, loss of or destruction of tangible or intangible property, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and unauthorized use of any trademark, tradename, copyright, patent, service mark or any other right of any person, firm or corporation, which may arise out of or be in any way connected with the construction, installation, operation, maintenance or condition of the system caused by grantee, its subcontractors or agents or the grantee’s failure to comply with any federal, state or local statute, ordinance or regulation;

2.    Any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, penalties, claims, liens, costs, charges, losses and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, expert witnesses and other consultants), which is imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the indemnities by reason of any claim or lien arising out of work, labor, materials or supplies provided or supplied to the grantee, its contractors or subcontractors, for the installation, construction, operation or maintenance of the system caused by grantee, its subcontractors or agents and, upon the written request of the commission, shall cause such claim or lien to be discharged or bonded within fifteen (15) days following such request;

3.    Any and all liability, obligation, damages, penalties, claims, liens, costs, charges, losses and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, expert witnesses and consultants), which may be imposed upon, incurred by or be asserted against the indemnities by reason of any financing or securities offering by grantee or its affiliates for violations of the common law or any laws, statutes, or regulations of the state of Wisconsin or United States, including those of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, whether by the grantee or otherwise; excluding therefrom, however, claims which are solely based upon and shall arise solely out of information supplied by the city to the grantee in writing and included in the offering materials with the express written approval of the city prior to the offering.

C.    Assumption of Risk. The grantee undertakes and assumes for its officers, agents, contractors and subcontractors and employees, all risk of dangerous conditions, if any, on or about any city-owned or controlled property, including public rights-of-way, and the grantee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnities against and from any claim asserted or liability imposed upon the indemnities for personal injury or property damage to any person arising out of the installation, operation, maintenance or condition of the system or the grantee’s failure to comply with any federal, state or local statute, ordinance or regulation.

D.    Defense of Indemnities. In the event any action or proceeding shall be brought against the indemnities by reason of any matter for which the indemnities are indemnified hereunder, the grantee shall, upon notice from any of the indemnities, at the grantee’s sole cost and expense, resist and defend the same with legal counsel mutually acceptable to the city attorney and grantee; provided further, however, that the grantee shall not admit liability in any such matter on behalf of the indemnities without the written consent of the city attorney or its designee.

E.    Notice Cooperation and Expenses. The city shall give the grantee prompt notice of the making of any claim or the commencement of any action, suit or other proceeding covered by the provisions of this section. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the city from cooperating with grantee and participating in the defense of any litigation by the city’s own counsel. The grantee shall pay all reasonable expenses incurred by the city in defending itself with regard to any such actions, suits or proceedings. These expenses shall include all out-of pocket expenses such as attorney fees and shall also include the reasonable value of any services rendered by or on behalf of the city attorney if such service is determined necessary and appropriate by the city attorney and the actual expenses of the city’s agents, employees or expert witnesses, and disbursements and liabilities assumed by the city in connection with such suits, actions or proceedings. No recovery by the city of any sum under the security shall be any limitation upon the liability of the grantee to the city under the terms of this section, except that any sum so received by the city shall be deducted from any recovery which the city might have against the grantee under the terms of this section.

F.    Nonwaiver of Statutory Limits. Nothing in this agreement is intended to express or imply a waiver of the statutory provisions, of any kind or nature, as set forth in Wisconsin Statutes Section 893.80 et seq., including the limits of liability of the city as exists presently or may be increased from time to time by the legislature. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 16), 2000)


5.08.170 Rights of individuals.

A.    The grantee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, channel users or general citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, income or sex. The grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination which are incorporated and made part of this chapter by reference.

B.    The grantee shall strictly adhere to the equal employment opportunity requirements of the Federal Communications Commission, state and local regulations, as amended from time to time.

C.    The grantee shall, at all times, comply with the privacy requirements of state and federal law.

(Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 18), 2000)


5.08.190 Service availability and record request.

The grantee shall provide cable communications service throughout the entire franchise area pursuant to the provisions of this franchise and shall keep a record for at least two years of all written requests for service received by the grantee. This record shall be available for public inspection at the local office of the grantee during regular office hours. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 19), 2000)


5.08.200 System construction.

A.    New Construction Timetable.

1.    Within two years from the date of the award of the initial franchise, the grantee must make cable television service available to every dwelling unit within the initial service area.

a.    The grantee must make cable television service available to at least twenty (20) percent of the dwelling units within the initial service area within six months from the date of the award of the franchise.

b.    The grantee must make cable television service available to at least fifty (50) percent of the dwelling units within the initial service area within one year from the date of the award of the franchise.

2.    The grantee, in its application if any, may propose a timetable of construction which will make cable television service available in the initial service area sooner than the above minimum requirements, in which case the schedule will be made part of the franchise agreement, and will be binding upon the grantee.

3.    Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless specifically approved by the city, will be considered a violation of this chapter for which the provisions of either Sections 5.08.370 or 5.08.460 shall apply, as determined by the city.

4.    In special circumstances the city can waive one hundred (100) percent completion within the two year time frame; provided, substantial completion is accomplished within the allotted time frame, substantial completion construed to be not less than ninety-five (95) percent and justification for less than one hundred (100) percent must be submitted subject to the satisfaction of the city.

B.    Line Extensions.

1.    In areas of the franchise territory not included in the initial service areas, the grantee shall be required to extend its system pursuant to the following requirements:

a.    No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. Grantee is authorized to extend the cable system as necessary within the city. To expedite the process of extending the cable system into a new subdivision, the city will forward to the grantee an approved engineering plan of each project. Subject to the density requirements, the grantee shall commence the design and construction process upon receipt of the final engineering plan. Upon notification from the city that the first home in the project has been approved for building permit, the grantee shall have a maximum of three months to complete the construction/activation process within the project phase.

b.    The grantee must extend and make cable television service available to every dwelling unit in all unserved, developing areas having at least twenty (20) dwelling units planned per street mile, as measured from the existing system, and shall extend its system simultaneously with the installation of utility lines.

c.    The grantee must extend and make cable television service available to any isolated resident outside the initial service area requesting connection at the standard connection charge, if the connection to the isolated resident would require no more than a standard one hundred seventy-five (175) foot drop line.

2.    Early Extension. In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of service, the grantee shall provide, upon the request of a potential subscriber desiring service, an estimate of the costs required to extend service to the subscriber. The grantee shall then extend service upon request of the potential subscriber. The grantee may require advance payment or assurance of payment satisfactory to the grantee. The amount paid by subscribers for early extensions shall be nonrefundable, and in the event the area subsequently reaches the density required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be treated as consideration for early extension.

3.    New Development. In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall give the grantee reasonable notice of such construction or development, and of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for the grantee’s installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults and laterals to be provided at the grantee’s expense. The grantee shall also provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if the grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults and laterals within five working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or property owner, then should the trenches be closed after the five-day period, the cost of new trenching is to be borne by the grantee. Except for the notice of the particular date on which trenching will be available to the grantee, any notice provided to the grantee by the city of a preliminary plat request shall satisfy the requirement of reasonable notice if sent to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee prior to approval of the preliminary plat request.

C.    Special Agreements. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the grantee from serving areas not covered under this section upon agreement with developers, property owners, or residents provided that five percent of those gross revenues are paid to the city as franchise fees under Section 5.08.270.

1.    The grantee, in its application, may propose a line extension policy which will result in serving more residents of the city than as required above, in which case the grantee’s policy will be incorporated into the franchise agreement, and will be binding on the grantee.

2.    The violation of this section shall be considered a breach of the terms of this chapter for which the provisions of either Sections 5.08.370 or 5.08.460 shall apply, as determined by the city. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 20), 2000)


5.08.210 Construction and technical standards.

A.    Compliance With Construction and Technical Standards. The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in a manner consistent with all laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements and FCC technical standards. In addition, the grantee shall provide the city, upon request, with a written report of the results of the grantee’s annual proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to Federal Communications Commission standards and requirements.

B.    Additional Specifications.

1.    Construction, installation and maintenance of the cable television system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All cables and wires shall be installed, where possible, parallel with electric and telephone lines. Multiple cable configurations shall be arranged in parallel and bundled with due respect for engineering considerations.

2.    The grantee shall at all times comply with:

a.    National Electrical Safety Code (National Bureau of Standards);

b.    National Electrical Code (National Bureau of Fire Underwriters);

c.    Bell System Code of Pole Line Construction; and

d.    Applicable FCC or other federal, state and local regulations.

3.    In any event, the system shall not endanger or interfere with the safety of persons or property in the franchise area or other areas where the grantee may have equipment located.

4.    Any antenna structure used in the system shall comply with construction, marking and lighting of antenna structure, required by the United States Department of Transportation.

5.    All working facilities and conditions used during construction, installation and maintenance of the cable television system shall comply with the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

6.    RF leakage shall be checked at reception locations for emergency radio services to prove no interference signal combinations are possible. Stray radiation shall be measured adjacent to any proposed aeronautical navigation radio sites to prove no interference to airborne navigational reception in the normal flight patterns. FCC rules and regulations shall govern.

7.    The grantee shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby power for headend and transport system for a minimum of two hours.

8.    In all areas of the city where the cables, wires and other like facilities of public utilities are placed underground, the grantee shall place its cables, wires or other like facilities underground. When public utilities relocate their facilities from pole to underground, the grantee must concurrently do so. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 21), 2000)


5.08.220 Use of streets.

A.    Interference With Persons and Improvements. The grantee’s system, poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located, erected and maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger or interfere with the lives of persons or interfere with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets and public ways, or interfere with any improvements the city may deem proper to make, or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property.

B.    Restoration to Prior Condition. In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, landscaping, driveway or other surfacing by the grantee, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the city, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping or surface of any street or alley disturbed, in as good condition as before the work was commenced and in accordance with standards for such work set by the city.

C.    Erection, Removal and Common Uses of Poles.

1.    No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to location, height, types and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby.

2.    Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for use in serving the city are available for use by the grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the city may require the grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the grantee are just and reasonable.

3.    In the absence of any governing federal or state statute, where the city or a public utility serving the city desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the grantee, but agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the city may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the city shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the city determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee’s operations.

D.    Relocation of the Facilities. If at any time during the period of this franchise the city shall lawfully elect to alter, or change the grade of any street, alley or other public ways, the grantee, upon reasonable notice by the city, shall remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense unless the utilities are compensated, in which case the grantee shall be similarly compensated.

E.    Cooperation with Building Movers. The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building-moving permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.

F.    Tree Trimming. Except in the case of an emergency, the grantee shall not remove any tree or trim any portion, either above, at or below ground level, of any tree within any public place without the prior consent of the city. The city shall have the right to do the trimming requested by the grantee at the cost of the grantee. Regardless of who performs the work requested by the grantee, the grantee shall be responsible, shall defend and hold the city harmless for any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the land surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 22), 2000)


5.08.230 Operational standards.

A.    The grantee shall put, keep and maintain all parts of the system in good condition throughout the entire franchise period.

B.    Upon the reasonable request for service by any person located within the initial service area, the grantee shall, within thirty (30) days, furnish the requested service to such person within terms of the line extension policy. A request for service shall be unreasonable for the purpose of this subsection if no trunk line installation capable of servicing that person’s block has as yet been installed.

C.    The grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Such interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and shall occur during periods of minimum system use.

D.    The grantee shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere with television reception of subscribers or persons not served by the grantee, nor shall the system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any manner the operation of the various utilities serving the residents within the confines of the city nor shall other utilities interfere with the grantee’s system.

E.    The grantee shall have knowledgeable, qualified grantee representatives available to respond to customer telephone inquiries twenty-four (24) hours per day and seven days per week.

F.    Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time, including wait time and the time required to transfer the call, shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds. This standard shall be met no less than ninety (90) percent of the time as measured on an annual basis.

G.    Under normal operating conditions, the customer will receive a busy signal less than three percent of the total time that the office is open for business.

H.    Standard installations will be performed within seven business days after an order has been placed. A standard installation is one that is within one hundred seventy-five (175) feet of the existing system.

I.    Excluding those situations which are beyond its control, the grantee will respond to any service interruption promptly and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours from the time of initial notification. All other regular service requests will be responded to within thirty-six (36) hours during the normal work week for that system. The appointment window alternatives for installations, service calls and other installation activities will be: “morning”; or “afternoon”; not to exceed a four-hour “window” during normal business hours for the system, or at a time that is mutually acceptable. The grantee will schedule supplemental hours during which appointments can be scheduled based on the needs of the community. If at any time an installer or technician is running late, an attempt to contact the customer will be made and the appointment rescheduled as necessary at a time that is convenient to the customer.

J.    Customer service centers and bill payment locations will be open for walk-in customer transactions a minimum of eight hours a day Monday through Friday, unless there is a need to modify those hours because of the location or customers served. The grantee and city by mutual consent will establish supplemental hours on weekdays and weekends if it would fit the needs of the community.

K.    Subscriber Credit for Outages. Upon service interruption and/or outages of subscriber’s cable service, the following shall apply:

a.    For service interruptions and/or outages of over four hours and up to seven days, the grantee shall provide, at the subscriber’s written request, a credit of one-thirtieth of one month’s fees for affected services for each twenty-four (24) hour period service is interrupted for four or more hours for any single subscriber, with the exception of subscribers disconnected because of nonpayment or excessive signal leakage.

b.    For service interruptions and/or outages of seven days or more in one month, the grantee shall provide, at the subscriber’s written request, a full month’s credit for affected services for all affected subscribers.

L.    The grantee will provide written information in each of the following areas at the time of installation and at any future time upon the request of a subscriber:

1.    Product and services offered;

2.    Prices and service options;

3.    Installation and service policies;

4.    How to use the cable services.

M.    Bills will be clear, concise and understandable, with all cable services itemized.

N.    Credits will be issued promptly, but no later than the subscriber’s next billing cycle following the resolution of the request and the return of the equipment by the grantee if service has been terminated.

O.    Subscribers will be notified a minimum of thirty (30) days in advance of any rate or channel change; provided, that the change is within the control of the grantee.

P.    The grantee shall maintain and operate its network in accordance with the rules and regulations as are incorporated in this chapter or may be promulgated by the Federal Communication Commissions, the United States Congress, or the state of Wisconsin.

Q.    The grantee shall continue, through the term of the franchise, to maintain the technical standards and quality of service set forth in this chapter. Should the city find, by resolution, that the grantee has failed to maintain these technical standards and quality of service, grantee shall be required to implement a plan for resolution. Failure to make such improvements within three months of such resolution will constitute a breach of a condition for which penalties contained in Section 5.08.460 are applicable.

R.    The grantee shall keep a monthly service log which will indicate the nature of each service complaint for which a work order is generated or which is received in writing, received in the last twenty-four (24) months, the date and time it was received, the disposition of such complaint, and the time and date thereof. This log shall be made available for periodic inspection by the city. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 23), 2000)


5.08.240 Continuity of service mandatory.

A.    It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If the grantee elects to over build, rebuild, modify or sell the system, or the city gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances.

B.    If there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator acquires the system, the grantee shall cooperate with the city, new franchisee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs for its services until it no longer operates the system.

C.    If the grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days without prior approval of the city or without just cause, the city may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or a permanent operator is selected. If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the grantee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the system received by the city that are the result of the grantee’s failure to perform. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 24), 2000)


5.08.250 Complaint procedure.

A.    The city manager is designated as having primary responsibility for the continuing administration of the franchise and implementation of complaint procedures.

B.    During the terms of the franchise, and any renewal thereof, the grantee shall maintain a central office for the purpose of receiving and resolving all complaints regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, and similar matters. The office must be reachable by a local, toll-free telephone call to receive complaints regarding quality of service, equipmental functions and similar matters. The grantee will use its good faith efforts to arrange for one or more payment locations in a central location where subscribers can pay bills or conduct other business activities.

C.    As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, the grantee shall, by appropriate means, such as a card or brochure, furnish information concerning the procedures for making inquiries or complaints, including the name, address and local telephone number of the employee or employees or agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed.

D.    When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists other evidence, which, in the judgment of the city, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the city shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall fully cooperate with the city in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report, if requested, within thirty (30) days after notice. Such report shall include the following information:

1.    The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the special tests;

2.    What system component was tested;

3.    The equipment used and procedures employed in testing;

4.    The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved;

5.    Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may be required.

The city may require that tests be supervised, by an independent professional engineer or equivalent of the city’s choice. The engineer should sign all records of special tests and forward to the city such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and recommending actions to be taken. Should such a test prove that the grantee failed to meet the technical standard, the grantee shall bear the cost of the test. If the test should prove that the grantee met the technical standards, the city shall bear the cost of the test.

E.    The city’s right under this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the city has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 25), 2000)


5.08.260 Grantee rules and regulations.

The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this franchise, and to assure an uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 26), 2000)


5.08.270 Franchise fee.

A.    Since the streets of the city to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the city are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and since the grant to the grantee to the streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, the grantee shall pay to the city an amount equal to five percent of the grantee’s gross revenues from the operations of the grantee within the confines of the city or contract area. If the statutory five percent limitation on franchise fees is raised or the federal statute deletes the franchise fee limitation entirely, then the franchise fee may be subject to renegotiation.

B.    This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the city by the grantee.

C.    The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be payable quarterly on a calendar year basis to the city within forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of gross revenues in such form as established between the city and the grantee.

D.    The city shall have the right to inspect the grantee’s books and records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter for any calendar year; provided, however, that any such audit shall take place within twenty-four (24) months following the close of a particular calendar years. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee by the city which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.

E.    If any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or penalty, is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at the legal maximum rate charged by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for late tax payments, and the grantee shall reimburse the city for any additional expenses and costs incurred by the city by reason of the delinquent payment(s). (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 27), 2000)


5.08.280 Transfer of control or controlling interest.

A.    Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, a franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the city. The grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly owned subsidiary of the grantee and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise back to the grantee without such consent; providing, that such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee. The proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as determined by the city and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. The city shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to act upon any request for approval of such a sale or transfer submitted in writing that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and by the city. The city shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to consent is not communicated in writing to the grantee within one hundred twenty (120) days following receipt of written notice and the necessary information as to the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of time. The city shall not unreasonably withhold such consent to the proposed transfer.

B.    Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, the grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control or controlling interest of the grantee. The word “control” as used in this chapter is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of ten percent of the voting shares of the grantee. Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the qualification of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the city in such inquiry.

C.    The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this franchise.

D.    In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of an initial franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system.

E.    In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control or an assignment of the franchise be approved without the successor in interest or the assignee becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 28), 2000)


5.08.290 Availability of books and records.

A.    The grantee shall fully cooperate in making available at reasonable times, and the city shall have the right to inspect, where reasonably necessary to the enforcement of the franchise, books, records, maps, plans and other like materials of the grantee applicable to the system, at any time during normal business hours; provided, where volume and convenience necessitate, the grantee may require inspection to take place on the grantee premises.

B.    The following records and/or reports are to be made available to the city upon request, but no more frequently than once on an annual basis unless mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the city:

1.    A quarterly review and resolution or progress report submitted by the grantee to the city;

2.    Periodic preventive maintenance reports;

3.    Any copies of FCC Form 395-A (or successor form) or any supplemental forms related to equal opportunity or fair contracting policies;

4.    Subscriber inquiry/complaint resolution data and the right to review documentation concerning these inquiries and/or complaints periodically;

Should federal or state law permit further rate regulation beyond the basic service, the city shall assume such rate regulation and adopt appropriate procedures for such regulation. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 36), 2000)


5.08.370 Forfeiture and termination.

B.    The foregoing shall not constitute a substantial breach if the violation occurs but is without fault of the grantee or occurs as a result of circumstances beyond its control. The grantee shall not be excused by mere economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers or employees.

C.    The city may make a written demand that the grantee comply with any such provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to the franchise. If the violation by the grantee continues for a period of thirty (30) days following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city may place the issue of termination of the franchise before the city board. The city shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and the issue(s) which the board is to consider.

D.    The city board shall hear and consider the issue(s) and shall hear any person interested therein and shall determine in its discretion whether or not any violation by the grantee has occurred.

E.    If the city board shall determine the violation by the grantee was the fault of the grantee and within its control, the board may, by resolution declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be forfeited and terminated unless there is compliance within such period as the board may fix, such period shall not be less than sixty (60) days; provided, no opportunity for compliance need be granted for fraud or misrepresentation.

F.    The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed upon the board agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The board then may terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding that the grantee has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the period, in its discretion. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 37), 2000)


5.08.380 Foreclosure.

Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a substantial part of the system, the grantee shall notify the city of such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this chapter governing the consent of the city to such change in control of the grantee shall apply. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 38), 2000)


5.08.390 Right of acquisition by the city.

If the city has denied the grantee’s petition for renewal of its franchise as provided by Section 5.08.070, the city must exercise its option to purchase the system within sixty (60) days of the denial of renewal and at least six months prior to the end of the franchise. Nothing shall prohibit the grantee in the event of the election of the city to purchase the system from requesting the court to set a reasonable bond of the city to secure the purchase price.

A.    Within one hundred twenty (120) days after his/her election or appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this chapter and remedied all defaults there under; and

B.    Such receiver or trustee, within the one hundred twenty (120) days, shall have executed an agreement, duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this chapter and the franchise granted to the grantee.

B.    If the city determines that a material provision of this chapter is affected by any subsequent action of the state or federal government, the city and the grantee shall negotiate to modify any of the provisions in this chapter to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of this agreement. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 41), 2000)

5.08.450 Theft of services and tampering.

A.    No person may intentionally do any of the following:

1.    Obtain or attempt to obtain cable television service from a grantee by trick, artifice, deception, use of an illegal device or illegal decoder or other fraudulent means with the intent to deprive that grantee of any or all lawful compensation for rendering each type of service obtained. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from the presence on the property and in the actual possession of the defendant of a device not authorized by the grantee, the major purpose of which is to permit reception of cable television services without payment. This inference is rebutted if the defendant demonstrates that he or she purchased that device for a legitimate use;

2.    Give technical assistance or instruction to any person in obtaining or attempting to obtain any cable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the grantee providing that service. This paragraph does not apply if the defendant demonstrates that the technical assistance or instruction was given or the installation of the connection, descrambler or receiving device was for a legitimate use;

3.    Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or by other means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution of cable television services for the purpose of distributing cable television service to any other dwelling unit without authority from a grantee;

4.    Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or by other means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution of cable television services for the purpose of obtaining cable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the grantee providing the service. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from proof that the cable service to the defendant’s residence or business was connected under a service agreement with the grantee and has been disconnected by the grantee and that thereafter there exists in fact a connection to the system at the defendant’s residence or business;

5.    Make or maintain any modification or alteration to any device installed with the authorization of a grantee for the purpose of intercepting or receiving any program or other service carried by that grantee which that person is not authorized by that grantee to receive. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be interred from proof that, as a matter of standard procedure, the grantee places written warning labels on its converters explaining the tampering with the device is a violation of law and the converter decoder is found to have been tampered with, altered or modified so as to allow the reception or interception of programming carried by the grantee without authority to do so. The trier of fact may also infer that a converter decoder has been altered or modified from proof that the grantee, as a matter of standard procedure, seals the converters or with a label or mechanical device, that the seal was shown to the customer upon delivery of the decoder and that the seal has been removed or broken. The inferences under this paragraph are rebutted if the grantee cannot demonstrate that the intact seal was shown to the customer;

6.    Possess without authority any device or printed circuit board designed to receive from a system any cable television programming or services offered for sale over that system, whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, or perform or facilitate the performance of any of the acts under subsections (A)(1) through (A)(5) of this section with the intent that device or printed circuit be used to receive that grantee’s services without payment. Intent to violate this paragraph for direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain may be inferred from proof of the existence on the property and in the actual possession of the defendant of a device if the totality of circumstances, including quantities or volumes, indicates possession for resale;

7.    Manufacture, import into this state, distribute, publish, advertise, sell, lease or offer for sale or lease any device, printed circuit board or any plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit designed to receive the cable television programming or services offered for sale over a system from system, whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, with the intent that the device, printed circuit, plan or kit be used for the reception of that grantee’s services without payment. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from proof that the defendant has sold, leased or offered for sale or lease any device, printed circuit board, plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit board in violation of this paragraph and during the course of the transaction for sale or lease the defendant expressly states or implies to the buyer that the product will enable the buyer to obtain cable television service without charge.

B.    Civil Liability for Theft of Telecommunications Service (Including Cable Television Service.)

1.    Any person who incurs injury as a result of a violation of Section 5.08.450 may bring a civil action against the person who committed the violation. Except as provided in subsection (B)(2) of this section, if the person who incurs the loss prevails, the court shall grant the prevailing party actual damages, costs and disbursement.

2.    If the person who incurs the loss prevails against a person who committed the violation willfully and for the purpose of commercial advantage or prevails against a person who has committed more than one violation of Section 5.08.450, the court shall grant the prevailing party all the following:

a.    Except as provided in subsections (B)(2)(e) and (B)(2)(f) of this section, not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00);

b.    Actual damages;

c.    Any profits of the violators that are attributable to the violation and that are not taken into account in determining the amount of actual damages under subsection (B)(2)(b) of this section;

d.    Notwithstanding the limitations under Wisconsin Statutes 799.25 or 814.04, costs, disbursement and reasonable attorney fees;

e.    If the court finds that the violation was committed willfully and for the purpose of commercial advantage, the court may increase the amount granted under subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00); and

f.    If the court finds that the violator had no reason to believe that the violator’s action constituted a violation of this section, the court may reduce the amount granted under subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section.

3.    If damages under subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section are requested, the party who incurred the injury shall have the burden of proving the violator’s gross revenue and the violator’s deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the violation.

4.    In addition to other remedies available under this section, the court may grant the injured party a temporary or permanent injunction. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 45), 2000)


5.08.460 Penalties.

For the violation of any of the following provisions of this franchise, penalties shall be chargeable to the security as applicable as follows and the city may determine the amount of the fine for other violations which are not specified in a sum not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation, with each day constituting as separate violation.

City may impose any or all of the above enumerated measures against grantee, which shall be in addition to any and all other legal or equitable remedies it has under the franchise or under any applicable law;

F.    Any violations for noncompliance with the customer service standards of Sections 5.08.230 through 5.08.250: two hundred dollars ($200.00) per day for each day, or part thereof, that such noncompliance continues;

G.    Any other violations of the franchise agreement to be determined by the city in a public hearing but not specifically noted in this section shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day, per violation. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 46), 2000)


5.08.470 Procedures.

A.    Whenever the city believes that the grantee has violated one or more terms, conditions or provisions of this chapter or the franchise, and wishes to impose penalties, a written notice shall be given to the grantee informing it of such alleged violation or liability. The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific violation so as to afford the grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. The grantee shall have thirty (30) days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to correct the violation before the city may impose penalties, unless the violation is of such a nature so as to require more than thirty (30) days and the grantee proceeds diligently within the thirty (30) days to correct the violation, or as promptly as possible thereafter to correct the violation. In any case where the violation is not cured within sixty (60) days of notice from the city, or such other time as the grantee and the city may mutually agree to, the city may proceed to impose liquidated damages.

B.    The grantee may, within ten days of receipt of notice, notify the city that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has, in fact, occurred. Such notice by the grantee to the city shall specify with particularity the matters disputed by the grantee and shall stay the running of the thirty (30) day cure period pending the city’s decision as required in this section. The city shall hear the grantee’s dispute. Grantee must be given at least five days written notice of the hearing. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. After the hearing, the city shall provide grantee a copy of its action, along with supporting documents. In the event the city upholds the finding of a violation, the grantee shall have thirty (30) days subsequent, or such other time period as the grantee and the city mutually agree, to such determination to correct the alleged violation before penalties may be imposed.

C.    The rights reserved to the city under this section are in addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by this franchise or authorized by law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to penalties shall affect any other right the city may have.

D.    The city shall stay or waive the imposition of any penalty set forth in this chapter upon a finding that any failure or delay is a result of acts of nature or due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the grantee. (Ord. 1759 Part 1 (§ 47), 2000)

b.    Upon the granting of a “Class B” intoxicating liquor license, the licensee shall meet all conditions set forth in Chapter 125, Wisconsin Statutes, and the Brookfield Municipal Code and pay the license fee, prior to issuance of the license, within ninety (90) days of filing the application with the city clerk. Failure to do so is grounds for revocation of the license. This provision does not apply to premises where operation is delayed by construction lasting ninety (90) days or more as verified by the inspection services department as provided in subsection (D)(2) of this section.

2.    a.    For premises construction that will take more than ninety (90) days, an applicant may, after receiving approval of its plan and method of operation from the common council, apply for a “Class B” intoxicating liquor license. The common council may grant the license with the condition that it will not be issued until the applicant meets the qualifications set forth in Chapter 125, Wisconsin Statutes, and the Brookfield Municipal Code, pays the licensee fee, receives an occupancy permit pursuant to Section 15.04.290, and receives fire department approval. No application will be considered under this provision unless it is accompanied by a construction timeline and the inspection services department verifies the accuracy of the timeline. The construction timeline shall include the time frame for installation of footings and foundation, framing, roofing, plumbing and electrical systems, flooring, and fixtures, as well as a projected date for the issuance of an occupancy permit.

b.    No such license granted under subsection (2)(a) of this section may be renewed unless the inspection services department verifies, in its sole discretion, that construction is occurring in a manner consistent with the timeline submitted with the licensee’s initial application. If the department determines that construction is not occurring in a manner consistent with the timeline, the building permit is revoked pursuant to Section 15.04.190, or the building permit lapses pursuant to Section 15.04.220, grounds shall exist for revocation or nonrenewal of the license.

c.    If a license has been granted under subsection (2)(a) of this section, the licensee shall meet all conditions set forth in Chapter 125, Wisconsin Statutes, and the Brookfield Municipal Code, obtain an occupancy permit, receive approval from the fire department, and pay the license fee within eighteen (18) months of the date of the initial granting of the license.

d.    No license may be granted under subsection (2)(a) of this section if there are three or less “Class B” intoxicating liquor licenses available in the city. (Ord. 2530-18 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2478-17 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2017)

A copy of the lease, deed, or management agreement that demonstrates proof of right of possession for the license period shall be provided with an applicant’s application. Loss of the right of premises subjects the license to revocation.

C.    Business Type Limitations. Fast food and casual dining restaurants are limited to applying for “Class A”—cider only, Class “B” (fermented malt beverage), and “Class C” (wine) licenses. For purposes of this chapter, fast food and casual dining restaurants means a restaurant where the food is pre-prepared or rapidly prepared upon ordering and the customer interaction and transaction generally occurs at a centralized location such as a counter or drive-up window.

Chapter 9.05 ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES

Sections:

9.05.010    Findings.

9.05.020    Definitions.

9.05.030    Sale to minors prohibited.

9.05.040    Possession by minors prohibited.

9.05.050    Vending machines and self-service displays prohibited.

9.05.060    Nuisance enforcement.


9.05.010 Findings.

The common council of the city of Brookfield finds that:

A.    The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the property and persons in the city by prohibiting persons under eighteen (18) years of age from possessing electronic smoking devices and prohibiting the sale of electronic smoking devices to persons under eighteen (18) years of age; and

B.    Persons under age eighteen (18) are prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products, and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors. There are new tobacco-less products, however, commonly referred to as “electronic cigarettes,” “e-cigarettes,” “e-cigars,” “e-cigarillos,” “e-pipes,” “e-hookahs,” or “electronic nicotine delivery systems,” which allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking. These products may be purchased by minors and are being marketed without age restrictions or health warnings and come in different flavors that appeal to young people; and

C.    The production and distribution of electronic smoking devices is not currently regulated by federal or state authorities, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has not completed testing of these products. But, initial studies by the FDA have determined that electronic smoking devices can increase nicotine addiction among young people and contain chemical ingredients known to be harmful, which may expose users and the public to potential health risks; and

D.    The use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly in recent years, as evidenced by the fact that:

1.    Between 2017 and 2018, e-cigarette use rose from eleven and seven-tenths (11.7) percent to twenty and eight-tenths (20.8) percent among high school students and from three and three-tenths (3.3) percent to four and nine-tenths (4.9) percent among middle school students;

2.    In 2017 to 2018, sixty-seven and eight-tenths (67.8) percent of current youth e-cigarette users cited the availability of appealing flavors as the primary reason for use;

3.    In 2018, more than three million (3,000,000) middle and high school students were current users of e-cigarettes, and e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco products among youth; and

E.    Existing studies on electronic smoking devices’ vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including:

1.    Chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, lead, nickel and chromium;

2.    PM 2.5, acrolein, tin, toluene, and aluminum, which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, neurological effects, damage to reproductive systems, and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke; and

F.    Some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution, creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine; and

G.    A study published in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health suggests that electronic smoking devices “may have the capacity to ‘re-normalize’ tobacco use in a demographic that has had significant denormalization of tobacco use previously”; and

H.    Electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape, size, and color, with the user exhaling a smoke-like vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products; and

I.    The purported health benefits from electronic smoking devices have not been scientifically proven, and use of these devices has not been proven safe, either for their users or for bystanders. More than one study has concluded that exposure to vapor from electronic smoking devices may cause passive or secondhand vapor inhalation. Clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of electronic smoking devices have not been submitted to the FDA for the more than four hundred (400) brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market, and consumers have no knowledge of whether electronic smoking devices are safe; what types of concentration of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain; and what dose of nicotine the products deliver. The World Health Organization has strongly advised consumers against the use of electronic smoking devices until they are “deemed safe and effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body.” The World Medical Association has determined that electronic smoking devices “are not comparable to scientifically proven methods of smoking cessation” and that “neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established”; and

J.    Research indicates electronic smoking devices may lead youth to try tobacco products. In addition, research indicates that youth who use electronic smoking devices are more likely to use tobacco products, including cigarettes, than those youth who do not use electronic smoking devices; and

K.    Electronic smoking devices are currently unregulated and have been proven to emit nicotine, ultrafine particles, volatile organic compounds, and other toxins. Inhalation of nicotine is proven to be dangerous to everyone, especially children and pregnant women. Exposure to ultrafine particles may exacerbate respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, and may constrict arteries which could trigger a heart attack. The volatile organic compounds, such as formaldehyde and benzene, found in electronic smoking device aerosols are proven carcinogens; and

L.    The use of electronic smoking devices in smoke-free locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment; and

M.    A Harvard University health study found high levels of diacetyl in thirty-nine (39) of fifty-one (51) unique flavors of chemicals used in electronic smoking devices. Diacetyl is associated with bronchiolitis obliterans and other severe respiratory diseases among workers who have inhaled heated vapors containing diacetyl; and

N.    Existing studies on electronic smoking devices’ vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances, including: carcinogens such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, lead, nickel, and chromium; PM 2.5, acrolein, tin, toluene, and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects, such as skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, neurological effects, damage to reproductive systems, and premature death from heart attacks and stroke; inconsistent labeling of nicotine levels in electronic smoking device products; and in one instance, diethylene glycol, an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans; and

O.    Many news stories have detailed police reports of individuals using electronic smoking devices to smoke illegal narcotics, such as marijuana wax, synthetic marijuana, liquid marijuana, and hash oil; and

P.    As of August 2019, the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention has found several cases of severe breathing complications and lung disease linked to vaping. Since April 2019, the FDA has received one hundred eighteen (118) new reports of e-cigarette users experiencing seizures and similar incidents. In total, the agency has received one hundred twenty-seven (127) reports of neurological events following e-cigarette use between 2010 and 2019; and

Q.    That in 2016, the FDA adopted regulations prohibiting the sale of electronic smoking devices to any person under age eighteen (18). (Ord. 2573-19 § 1 (part), 2019)

1.    The common council adopts the findings stated in Section 9.05.010.

2.    Additionally, the common council of the city of Brookfield finds that:

a.    The smoking of cigarettes and tobacco products is hazardous to an individual’s health and affects the health of nonsmokers when they are in the presence of smoking.

b.    Numerous scientific studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor pollution.

c.    Reliable scientific studies, including studies conducted by the Surgeon General of the United States, have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard to nonsmokers; particularly to children, the elderly, individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease.

d.    Health hazards induced by breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function, decreased exercise tolerance, bronchoconstriction, and bronchospasm.

e.    Air pollution caused by smoking is an offensive annoyance and irritant and smoking results in serious and significant physical discomfort to nonsmokers.

9.34.010 Findings and intent.

A.    Whereas the common council has the power, through Section 62.11(5), Wisconsin Statutes, to enact legislation promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the public.

B.    Whereas the common council has reviewed the holdings and findings of the following court cases Vill. Of Menomonee Falls v. Ferguson, 334 Wis.2d 131 (Wis. Ct. App. 2011); City of S. Milwaukee v. Kester, 347 Wis.2d 334 (Wis. Ct. App. 2013); Smith v. Doe, 123 S. Ct. 1140 (2003); McKune v. Lile, 122 S. Ct. 2017 (2002); Hoffman v. Vill. of Pleasant Prairie, 249 F. Supp. 3d 951 (E.D. Wis. 2017); Vasquez v. Foxx, 895 F.3d 515 (7th Cir. 2018); Doe v. Miller, 405 F.3d 700 (8th Cir. 2005); Evenstad v. City of West St. Paul, 306 F. Supp. 3d 1086 (D. Minn. 2018).

C.    Whereas, based upon a 2003 study by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, titled Recidivism of Sex Offenders Released from Prison in 1994, sex offenders released from prison were four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime as compared to non-sex offenders released from prison. Of those individuals included in the study, forty (40) percent of new sex crimes committed by those sex offenders released from prison had occurred within the first twelve (12) months of release. Further, child molesters who were released from prison were at least six times more likely to be rearrested for another sex crime against a child as compared to a non-sex offender released from prison.

D.    Whereas the common council has conducted a review of other reports and studies related to creating and implementing specific desistance factors to reduce recidivism of sex offenders. The studies and reports that have been reviewed include the following: Tatar, J. & Jones, M. (August 2016). Recidivism after Release from Prison, State of Wisconsin Department of Corrections; Steiner, B., Makarios, M.D., & Travis, L.F. (2015). Examining the Effects of Residential Situations and Residential Mobility on Offender Recidivism. Crime and Delinquency, 61(3), 375-401; Kyle, D. (2016). Examining Sexual Offenses through a Sociological Lens: A Socio-Cultural Exploration of Casual and Desistance Theories, European Journal of Probation, 8(3), 170-184; Horney, J., Osgood, W., & Marshall, I.H. (1995). Criminal Careers in the Short-Term: Intra-Individual Variability in Crime and Its Relation to Local Life Circumstances. American Sociological Review, 60(5), 655-673; Mann, R.E., de Vries Robbe, M., Maruna, S., & Thornston, D. (2015). An Exploration of Protective Factors Supporting Desistance from Sexual Offending. Sexual Abuse; A Journal of Research and Treatment, 27 (1), 16-33.

E.    Whereas the common council acknowledges that literature on sex offender recidivism, sex offender desistance, and sex offender residency restrictions contains studies which report varying effectiveness of certain strategies. The common council intends to use these strategies and studies to best create a regulatory framework which protects the children of the city of Brookfield (hereafter “city”), yet allows for a constructive and safe assimilation of designated sex offenders into the community.

F.    The common council finds that the risk of recidivism decreases over time from the date of the last conviction, especially in circumstances where offenders have community connections, goals, and employment. The common council is also aware that absent a domicile clause, the city would have open doors for nonresident sex offender residency when other communities have closed doors, inviting a substantial increase in child sex offender placements, thereby increasing potential negative impacts on the health, safety, welfare, and additional cost to the city and its residents. Studies show increased recidivism rates for offenders who frequently move or do not have established community networks. These studies support maintaining a domicile clause thereby limiting designated offenders with no ties to the community and increasing the likelihood that a designated offender implements appropriate and existing community support while allowing the community to remain intelligently attentive, aware, and provide adequate and appropriate intervention if needed.

G.    Accordingly, the common council has created this regulatory measure designed to protect the health and safety of the children in the city against the threat posed by certain designated sex offenders. Sex offenders who prey on children represent a substantial danger to victims, target a particularly vulnerable group within the community who are less able to articulate or report abuse, and create a significant impact on law enforcement time and community resources to investigate abuses and mitigate risks. This chapter is also intended to demonstrate the city’s resolute goal of protecting children in areas of potential vulnerability and impart the community’s confidence by demonstrating safe, productive, and law-abiding behavior while residing within the city. It is the intent of the common council that this regulatory scheme is civil and nonpunitive in order to serve the city’s compelling interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety and welfare of all citizens of the city. (Ord. 2540-19 § 1 (part), 2019)

9.34.090 Appeal.

A designated offender may request an exemption from this chapter.

A.    Procedure. A designated offender may request an exemption from this chapter by submitting a written request for exemption, including any pertinent rationale for an exemption, to the Brookfield police department prior to establishing a residence that would be in violation of this chapter or within thirty (30) days after notification that the designated offender is in violation of this chapter. The chief of police or his/her designee shall conduct a review of the request for an exemption using any pertinent information and the criteria set forth in subsection (C) of this section. The chief of police or his/her designee shall approve, approve an exemption subject to necessary conditions (hereafter “conditional exemption”), or deny the request. The chief of police or his/her designee shall issue the decision within thirty (30) days of receiving the request for exemption and shall provide a written copy of that decision to the designated offender, city clerk, and the city attorney’s office. Any request for an exemption which has not been approved, approved for a conditional exemption, or denied by the chief or his/her designee within thirty (30) days of the request shall be deemed to be denied for the purpose of this chapter.

B.    The decision by the chief of police or his/her designee may be appealed by the designated offender within thirty (30) days by submitting a written appeal to the administrative appeals review board (hereafter “the board”) via the city clerk’s office. The board shall hold a hearing on each appeal, during which the board may review any pertinent information and may accept oral and written statements from any person.

C.    The chief of police or his/her designee and/or the board shall base their decision upon any factors related to the city’s interest in promoting, protecting, and improving the health, safety, and welfare of the community, including, but not limited to:

1.    The nature of the predicate offense causing the appellant to be a designated offender.

2.    Police reports related to the predicate offense if available.

3.    Proximity of the requested residence to the victim.

4.    The age of the offense, offender, and victim.

5.    Recommendation of the probation or parole officer, if one exists.

14.    The designated offender’s current employment or social activities.

15.    The designated offender’s criminal history.

16.    Whether the designated offender meets any of the exceptions listed in Section 9.34.050.

D.    The board shall issue a decision by a majority vote. The board may decide to deny an exemption, issue an exemption, or issue a conditional exemption. A written copy of the decision shall be provided to the designated offender in person or by first-class mail at the designated offender’s last-known address. A designated offender must consent to the terms of the conditional exemption for the conditional exemption to be valid, and must demonstrate acceptance of the terms of the conditional exemption by signing and dating a copy of the board’s decision and conditions. The designated offender must provide a copy of the signed conditional exemption to the city clerk’s office and the city of Brookfield police department. The designated offender will have fourteen (14) days from the date the written conditional exemption is issued to accept and return a signed copy to the appropriate locations or the conditional exemption will be deemed as void and the appeal denied by the board. A designated offender need not sign an exemption that has been denied by the board or an exemption approved without any necessary conditions by the board.

E.    A conditional exemption may include, but is not limited to, the following terms:

1.    Curfew restrictions.

2.    Cohabitant restrictions or requirements.

3.    Sobriety restrictions.

4.    Conduct restrictions.

5.    Residency restrictions.

G.    An exemption expires when the designated offender who was granted said exemption changes his/her domicile and/or changes his or her residence, whether within the city or outside the city.

H.    An exemption or conditional exemption issued by the chief of police or his/her designee or the board may be revoked by the chief of police or his/her designee if the designated offender is found to have violated the conditions or there is probable cause to believe the designated offender has committed (an) additional act(s), which had occurred either before or after the exemption or conditional exemption was issued, that would cause a person to be classified as a designated offender. The chief of police or his/her designee shall provide written notice to the designated offender that the exemption or conditional exemption has been revoked. This notice shall be deemed properly delivered if sent by either first class mail to the designated offender’s last known address or if delivered in person to the designated offender’s last known address. If the designated offender cannot be located, the notice shall be deemed to be properly delivered if a copy is left at the designated offender’s address which had been exempted in the presence of some competent member of the family at least fourteen (14) years of age or a competent adult currently residing there. If notice cannot be so served, it may be served by publishing a Class I notice. The revocation of an exemption may be appealed to the board pursuant to the above procedure.

I.    For the purposes of this chapter, pursuant to Section 68.16, Wisconsin Statutes, the city of Brookfield is specifically electing not to be governed by Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes.

J.    If the board denies the request for exemption or upholds a revocation of exemption or conditional exemption, the designated offender may appeal the decision within thirty (30) days to the circuit court.

K.    Severability. If any part of this section is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the validity of the remaining parts shall not be affected. (Ord. 2540-19 § 1 (part), 2019)

12.15.010 Findings, purpose, and applicability.

In the exercise of its police powers, the city has priority over all other uses of the right-of-way. The purpose of this chapter and Chapters 12.16, 12.17, 12.18, and 12.19 is to provide the city with a process for managing and uniform standards for acting upon requests for the placement of facilities within the right-of-way, city-owned property, and land in which the city has an easement interest consistent with the city’s obligation to promote the public health, safety, and welfare; to manage the right-of-way, its property, its utilities, and its structural integrity; and to ensure that the public’s use is not obstructed or incommoded by the use of the right-of-way, city-owned property, or land in which the city has an easement interest for placement of facilities. The provisions of this chapter are applicable to any registration, excavation, or facilities placement in the right-of-way, on city-owned property, or land in which the city has an easement interest. All references in this chapter to “right-of-way” shall also apply to city-owned property and land in which the city has an easement interest unless specifically noted otherwise. For city-owned property, the terms and provisions of an easement, license agreement, or similar type of agreement between the city and any person may be more stringent than the relevant portions of this title, but cannot be less stringent unless the common council finds that a less stringent agreement is in the city’s best interests and does not conflict with the provisions of this section; the terms of any such agreement shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the code provisions. (Ord. 2592-20 § 1, 2020: Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.020 Administration.

The city engineer and his/her designee are responsible for the administration of this chapter and Chapters 12.16, 12.17, 12.18, and 12.19. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.030 Definitions.

The definitions set forth in Sections 12.16.010 and 12.17.010 apply to this chapter. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.040 Nondiscrimination.

In establishing the rights, obligations, and conditions set forth in this chapter and Chapters 12.16, 12.17, 12.18, and 12.19, the city’s intent is to treat each applicant and right-of-way user in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner, to the extent required by law, while taking into account the unique technologies, situation, and legal status of each applicant or request for use of the right-of-way. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.050 Designation of corridors and limitation of space.

A.    Corridors.

1.    The city engineer may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is or will be placed within the right-of-way in the future. All permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue consistent with the city engineer’s assignment.

2.    Any person who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the person.

B.    Limitation of Space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city engineer may prohibit or limit the placement of new, replacement or additional facilities within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all requests. In making such decisions, the city engineer shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects determined to be in the public interest. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.060 Removal and relocation.

A.    Requirement. Except as prohibited by state or federal law, a person must promptly and at his or her own expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the right-of-way whenever the city orders such removal and relocation and shall restore the right-of-way in accordance with city standards. The city may order removal and relocation to prevent the facility from interfering with a present or future city use of the right-of-way; a public improvement undertaken by the city; an economic development project in which the city has a financial interest or investment; when the public health, safety, or welfare require it; when the facility is abandoned; when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way; or when the applicant is in violation of any provision of this chapter or Chapter 12.16, 12.17, 12.18, or 12.19. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person shall not be required to remove or relocate its facilities from any right-of-way that has been discontinued or vacated in favor of a nongovernmental entity unless and until that entity pays the reasonable costs of removal or relocation to the person.

B.    Order. The order for removal and relocation shall be in writing and include a description of the items to be removed and a reasonable due date for facility removal. The order shall be personally served or sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the facility owner or operator, registrant, or permittee.

C.    City’s Right to Perform Removal. In the event that a person does not remove its facilities as ordered in this section, the city or its designee may perform the removal and bill the facility owner or operator, registrant, or permittee for the costs of removal. All costs shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)

If the person fails to make the restoration required by this section, the city or its designee may perform the restoration and bill the facility owner or operator, registrant, or permittee for the costs of removal. All costs shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice. (Ord. 2592-20 § 2, 2020: Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.080 Storage and disposal of property.

If the city removes a facility, the city shall store the aforementioned facility for thirty (30) days after taking possession of it. At the end of thirty (30) days, if the owner has not claimed the facility, the city may discard it, retain it, or sell it with all proceeds benefitting the city. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.090 Interference with other facilities during municipal construction.

When the city performs work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, shore, or move a registrant’s facilities, the city shall notify the local representative. The registrant or local representative shall meet with the city’s representative within one business day of notice and coordinate the protection, maintenance, supporting, and/or shoring of the registrant’s facilities. The registrant shall accomplish any needed work within seventy-two (72) hours from meeting, unless the city agrees to a longer period. In the event that the registrant does not maintain, support, shore, or move its facilities within the required time period, the city or its designee may perform the work and bill the registrant for the cost of the work. If the registrant completes the work outside the required time period, the city may bill the registrant for any additional costs the city incurs due to the delay caused by registrant. All costs shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.100 Abandonment.

A.    Cessation of Use. In the event that a permitted facility within the right-of-way is not in use for a continuous period of sixty (60) days or longer, the permittee must promptly notify the city and do one of the following:

1.    Provide information satisfactory to the city engineer that the permittee’s obligations for its facilities under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another permittee; or

2.    Remove its facilities from the right-of-way within one year and perform the required restoration under Section 12.15.070, unless the city engineer waives this requirement or provides a later deadline, and post a bond or provide payment sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities and undertaking restoration.

B.    Abandoned Facilities. Facilities of a permittee who fails to comply with subsection (A) of this section and which, for one year, remain unused shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. In addition to any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, the city may, at its option:

1.    Abate the nuisance and recover the cost of removal, restoration, and storage of removed facilities from the permittee or the permittee’s successor in interest;

2.    Take possession of the facilities; and/or

3.    Require removal of the facilities by the permittee or the permittee’s successor in interest.

Applications are public records that may be made publicly available pursuant to state and federal public records law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicant may designate portions of the application materials that it reasonably believes contain proprietary or confidential information by clearly marking each portion of such materials accordingly, and the city shall endeavor to treat the information as proprietary and confidential, subject to applicable state and federal public records law and the city’s determination that the applicant’s request for confidential or proprietary treatment of the application materials is reasonable. The city shall not be required to incur any costs to protect the application from disclosure. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.130 Record retention.

All permittees and registrants shall retain full and complete copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the facility, which includes without limitation all conditions of approval, approved plans, resolutions, and other documentation associated with the facilities permit, registration, or regulatory approval. In the event the city cannot locate any such full and complete permits, registrations, or other regulatory approvals in its official records, and the permittee fails to retain full and complete records in the permittee’s files, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an examination of the missing documents will be conclusively resolved in favor of the city. (Ord. 2564-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.15.140 Penalty.

12.17.020 Purpose.

In the exercise of its police powers, the city has priority over all other uses of the right-of-way. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the city with a process for managing and uniform standards for acting upon requests for the placement of wireless telecommunications facilities within the right-of-way, city-owned property, and land in which the city has an easement interest consistent with the city’s obligation to promote the public health, safety, and welfare; to manage the right-of-way, its property, and utilities; and to ensure that the public’s use is not obstructed or incommoded by the use of the right-of-way, city property, and land in which the city has an easement interest for the placement of wireless telecommunications facilities. The city recognizes the importance of wireless telecommunications facilities to provide high-quality communications and internet access services to residents and businesses within the city. The city also recognizes its obligation to comply with applicable federal and state laws regarding the placement of wireless telecommunications facilities in the right-of-way including, without limitation, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Sections 66.0404(4e), 66.0414, 182.017 and 196.58, Wisconsin Statutes, and this chapter shall be interpreted consistent with those provisions. (Ord. 2592-20 § 3: Ord. 2555-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.17.030 Scope.

A.    Applicability. Unless exempted by subsection (B) of this section, every person who wishes to place a wireless telecommunications facility in the right-of-way, on city-owned property, or land in which the city has an easement interest or modify an existing wireless telecommunications facility in the right-of-way, on city-owned property, or land in which the city has an easement interest must obtain a wireless permit under this chapter. For city-owned property, a person who wishes to place a wireless telecommunications facility on a portion of the land not located in the right-of-way shall enter into a license agreement, easement agreement, or similar type of agreement with the city before applying for a permit. The terms and provisions of such agreement may be more stringent than the relevant portions of this title, but cannot be less stringent unless the common council finds that a less stringent agreement is in the city’s best interests and does not conflict with Section 12.15.010; the terms of any such agreement shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the code provisions. All references in this chapter to “right-of-way” shall also apply to city-owned property and land in which the city has an easement interest unless specifically noted otherwise. 

B.    Exempt Facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall not be applied to applications for the following:

1.    (Repealed by Ord. 2592-20).

2.    Installation of a mobile cell facility (commonly referred to as “cell on wheels” or “cell on truck”) for a temporary period in connection with an emergency or event, but no longer than required for the emergency or event; provided, that installation does not involve excavation, movement, or removal of existing facilities.

3.    Placement or modification of a wireless telecommunications facility by city staff or any person performing work under contract with the city.

4.    Modification of an existing wireless telecommunications facility that makes no material change to the footprint of a facility or to the surface or subsurface of a public street if the activity does not disrupt or impede traffic in the traveled portion of a street and if the work does not change the visual or audible characteristics of the wireless telecommunications facility. (Ord. 2592-20 §§ 4, 9 (part), 2020; Ord. 2555-19 § 1 (part), 2019)

(Ord. 2592-20 § 5, 2020; Ord. 2564-19 §§ 7—9, 12 (part), 2019; Ord. 2555-19 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.17.070 General standards.

A.    Generally. Facilities shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in this chapter in addition to the requirements of any other applicable law or regulation.

B.    Regulations. The decisions on wireless permits shall, at a minimum, ensure that the requirements of this chapter are satisfied, unless it is determined that the applicant has established that denial of an application would, within the meaning of federal law, prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of telecommunications or personal wireless services, or otherwise violate applicable laws or regulations. If that determination is made, the requirements of this chapter and the wireless regulations may be waived, but only to the extent required to avoid the prohibition.

C.    Standards.

1.    Facilities shall be installed and modified in a manner that:

a.    Minimizes risks to public safety;

b.    Ensures that placement of facilities on existing structures is within the tolerance of those structures;

c.    Avoids placement of aboveground facilities or installation of new support structures or equipment cabinets in underground areas in the public right-of-way;

d.    Maintains the integrity and character of the neighborhoods and corridors in which the facilities are located;

e.    Ensures that installations are subject to periodic review to minimize the intrusion on the right-of-way;

f.    Ensures that the city bears no risk or liability as a result of the installations; and

g.    Ensures that applicant’s use does not inconvenience the public, interfere with the primary uses of the right-of-way, including existing utilities, or hinder the ability of the city or other government entities to improve, modify, relocate, abandon, or vacate the right-of-way or any portion thereof, or to cause the improvement, modification, relocation, vacation, or abandonment of facilities in the right-of-way. Specifically, the applicant’s use shall comply with the city’s Public Infrastructure and Development Handbook regarding placement of utilities in the public right-of-way and shall not encroach within five feet of an existing city utility.

2.    No wireless permit shall be issued unless the wireless service provider applicant has immediate plans to use the proposed facility or the wireless infrastructure applicant has a contract with a wireless service provider that has immediate plans to use the proposed facility. Wireless infrastructure applicants shall attach its contract with the wireless service provider to its wireless permit application.

3.    Installation of new and modification of existing small wireless facilities and wireless telecommunications facilities shall meet the following standards:

a.    Facilities and support structures, towers, and utility poles shall not obstruct, impede, or hinder vehicular, pedestrian, or bicycle travel or public safety within the right-of-way, except for authorized temporary lane or sidewalk closures.

b.    Facilities and support structures, towers, and utility poles shall not be located within vision setback lines as set forth in Section 17.112.010(B).

c.    Facilities and support structures, towers, utility poles, and any other ground-mounted equipment shall comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as it is from time to time amended.

d.    New facilities and support structures, towers, and utility poles shall not be located directly in front of any existing residential or commercial structure.

e.    Rigid nonbreakaway poles and other support structures or towers shall be located a minimum of ten feet away from roadway curbs or shoulders, underground facilities, and behind existing or future sidewalks.

f.    The height of a facility, support structure, tower, or utility pole may not exceed the greater of fifty (50) feet above ground level or ten feet above the tallest existing support structure, tower, or utility pole that is in place on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and that is located in the same right-of-way and within five hundred (500) feet of the facility that is the subject of the application. The city engineer may waive this requirement upon consideration of such factors as whether the greater height is necessary and convenient to the provision of utility service to the public and/or will avoid the need for an additional site; whether the proposed facility will be located in a commercial, industrial, or nonresidential area; whether greater separation is required to avoid interference with other equipment on the pole or facility; whether a building or structure is within the fall zone radius of the facility, support structure, tower, or utility pole; and whether nearby buildings are taller than fifty (50) feet.

g.    Equipment mounted to support structures must be a minimum of ten feet above any pedestrian or bicycle thoroughfare or trail and a minimum of twenty (20) feet above any traffic lane.

h.    Unless in conflict with state or federal law, to conceal the nonantenna equipment, all nonantenna equipment shall be installed underground when proposed in an area where utilities or other equipment in the right-of-way is primarily located underground. In all other areas, nonantenna equipment shall be placed underground to the extent feasible. All installations shall be in accordance with the State Electrical Code. Additional expense to install and maintain an underground equipment enclosure does not exempt an applicant from this requirement, except where the applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that this requirement will effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services. Nothing in this subsection is intended to require the applicant to install any electric meter required by the applicant’s electrical service provider underground.

i.    All ground-mounted equipment other than the antenna shall be contained in a secured equipment shroud or cabinet to prevent public safety risks and unauthorized access. Any cables and conduits associated with the equipment shall be concealed from view.

j.    All facilities and support structures, towers, and utility poles shall have subdued colors and nonreflective materials that blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and structures.

k.    The owner and/or operator must post an identification sign at each facility, including current owner/operator emergency telephone numbers. The design, materials, colors, and location of the identification signs shall be subject to city review and approval. If at any time a new owner or operator provider takes over operation of an existing facility, the new personal wireless service provider shall notify the city of the change in operation within thirty (30) days and the required and approved signs shall be updated within thirty (30) days to reflect the name and phone number of the new wireless service provider. The colors, materials and design of the updated signs shall match those of the required and approved signs. No sign shall be greater than two square feet in size.

l.    Any proposed pruning of trees, shrubs, or other landscaping already existing in the right-of-way must be noted in the application and approved by the city.

D.    Standard Wireless Permit Conditions. All wireless permits under this chapter are issued subject to the following minimum conditions:

1.    Compliance. The permittee shall at all times maintain compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and other rules.

2.    Term. A wireless permit shall be valid in perpetuity from the date of issuance unless revoked pursuant to Section 12.17.080(D) or surrendered.

5.    Indemnification. The permittee, by submitting an application for a facilities permit under this chapter, agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the city, its elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, agents, representatives, and volunteers (collectively, the “indemnified parties”) from and against any and all suits, actions, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages, liabilities, interest, attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses of whatsoever kind or nature in any manner caused in whole or in part, or claimed to be caused in whole or in part, by reason of any act, omission, fault, or negligence, whether active or passive, of the permittee or anyone acting under its direction or control or on its behalf, even if liability is also sought to be imposed on one or more of the indemnified parties. The obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the indemnified parties shall be applicable even if the liability results from an act or failure to act on the part of one or more of the indemnified parties. However, the obligation does not apply if the liability results from the sole negligence or willful misconduct of an indemnified party.

6.    Adverse Impacts on Adjacent Properties. The permittee shall undertake all reasonable efforts to avoid undue adverse impacts to adjacent properties and/or uses that may arise from the construction, operation, maintenance, modification, or removal of the facility. At least three business days prior to any construction or placement of the facility, the permittee shall mail a notice to all property owners adjacent to the facility placement location. The notice shall contain the facility’s location, its description and scale image, and an email address and phone number for a representative of the applicant who will be available to answer questions from members of the public about the proposed project.

7.    General Maintenance. The facility, and any associated structures, shall be maintained in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved plans and conditions of approval.

8.    Graffiti Removal. All graffiti on facilities shall be removed at the sole expense of the permittee within two business days after notification from the city.

9.    Relocation. At the request of the city, pursuant to Section 12.15.060, the permittee shall promptly and at its own expense permanently remove and relocate any facility in the right-of-way.

10.    Abandonment. The permittee shall promptly notify the city whenever a facility has not been in use for a continuous period of sixty (60) days or longer and must comply with Section 12.15.100.

11.    Restoration. A permittee who removes or relocates a facility from the right-of-way must restore the right-of-way in accordance with Section 12.15.070.

12.    Record Retention. The permittee shall retain full and complete copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the facility, which includes without limitation all conditions of approval, approved plans, resolutions, and other documentation associated with the wireless permit or regulatory approval. In the event the city cannot locate any such full and complete permits or other regulatory approvals in its official records, and the permittee fails to retain full and complete records in the permittee’s files, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an examination of the missing documents will be conclusively resolved against the permittee.

13.    Radio Frequency Emissions. Every wireless facility shall at all times comply with applicable FCC regulations governing radio frequency emissions, and failure to comply with such regulations shall be treated as a material violation of the terms of the permit.

14.    Certificate of Insurance. A certificate of insurance with the following minimum insurance limits:

a.    Commercial General Liability Insurance. One million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per each occurrence, one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) personal and advertising injury, two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) products and completed operations, and two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) general aggregate—all written on an occurrence basis.

12.18.020 Excavation permits.

A.    Excavation Permit Required. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or elsewhere in this code, no person shall excavate any right-of-way, city-owned property, or land in which the city has an easement interest without first having obtained an excavation permit from the city engineer. For city-owned property, a person who wishes to excavate on a portion of the land not located in the right-of-way shall enter into an easement, entry agreement pursuant to Section 2.80.010, license agreement, or similar type of agreement with the city before applying for a permit. The terms and provisions of such agreement may be more stringent than the relevant portions of this title, but cannot be less stringent unless the common council finds that a less stringent agreement is in the city’s best interests and does not conflict with Section 12.15.010; the terms of any such agreement shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the code provisions. All references in this chapter to “right-of-way” shall also apply to city-owned property and land in which the city has an easement interest unless specifically noted otherwise. No permit shall be required when the excavation is part of a project or work subject to an executed development agreement or subdivider’s agreement with the city.

B.    Area and Dates Specified. The excavation permit shall specify the completion date for the work and the area of the work. No permittee may perform any work or excavate outside the area or dates specified in the permit, except as provided herein. No person shall excavate the right-of-way or maintain an excavation in the right-of-way beyond the date or area specified in the excavation permit without first having obtained an extension from the city engineer. A permittee shall request an extension before the expiration of the initial permit. The city engineer has the sole discretion to determine whether an extension should be granted. (Ord. 2592-20 §§ 8, 9 (part), 2020: Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)

Any application indicating it is submitted under Wisconsin Statutes will be denied if it is incomplete to avoid automatic approval under the provisions of Section 66.0404, Wisconsin Statutes, while waiting for additional information from the applicant.

C.    Joint Applications.

1.    Joint Application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to excavate the right-of-way or place facilities at the same place and time.

2.    Joint Projects with City. Registrants who join in a scheduled excavation performed by the city, whether the registrant has submitted a joint or a single application, are not required to pay the degradation portion of the permit fee.

3.    Shared Fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same excavation may share in the payment of the permit fee. Registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications. (Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)


12.18.040 Permit fees.

A.    Permit Fee Calculation. The total permit fee shall be calculated by adding the administrative cost, restoration deposit, inspection deposit, and degradation fee, if applicable. The common council shall establish the excavation and facilities placement permit fee from time to time by resolution for each of the categories:

1.    Administrative. The city engineer’s estimate of time to review the permit and plans.

2.    Restoration Deposit. The city engineer’s estimate of the cost to restore the right-of-way.

3.    Inspection Deposit. The estimated cost for inspecting the interim and completed work and shall include inspections within and outside the pavement areas of the right-of-way and the size of the project.

4.    Degradation Fee. The general formula for computing the degradation fee for projects involving excavation of paved right-of-way shall be the cost per square yard for street, overlay, and seal coat multiplied by the appropriate depreciation rate for that street multiplied by the area of the patch. Depreciation schedules shall be calculated by the city engineer by type of street. The area of the patch shall generally be square and calculated by adding two feet to each side of the anticipated street cut and then, at the option of the city engineer, extending to the full pavement lane width.

B.    (Repealed by Ord. 2592-20).

C.    Payment of Permit Fees. No permit shall be issued until payment of applicable fees and deposits is received. If the cost of inspection exceeds the inspection deposit amount, the applicant or permittee shall pay the difference within thirty (30) days of demand or be subject to penalty or revocation of the permit.

D.    Refundability. Administrative and degradation fees are nonrefundable. The city shall deduct inspection fees from the inspection deposit; any remaining deposit shall be returned after the city completes its final inspection. The restoration deposit shall be held until the city approves the restoration of the right-of-way and may be held until the expiration of the guarantee period as set forth in Section 12.18.050(C). (Ord. 2592-20 §§ 10, 11, 2020; Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)


12.18.050 Right-of-way restoration.

A.    The permittee must complete the work and restore the general area of the work, right-of-way, and the surrounding areas, including the paving, its base, turf, and landscaping, to city specifications and permit conditions, if any, within the dates specified in the permit.

B.    The city engineer shall prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration either in written general procedures, on a case-by-case basis, or both.

C.    Guarantees. The permittee shall guarantee its restoration work for twenty-four (24) months following its completion. During this period, the permittee shall, upon written notification from the city engineer, correct all defective restoration work using the method required by the city engineer. The correction work shall be completed within ten business days of the receipt of the notice from the city engineer, not including days during which work cannot be done due to circumstances beyond the permittee’s control or when work was prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under Section 12.18.070(B).

D.    Failure to Restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in accordance with city specifications or permit conditions, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete corrections to restoration work required by the city engineer during the guarantee period, the city or its designee may perform such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of date of invoice, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. The city may utilize the restoration deposit to pay the costs of restoration.

E.    City Restoration. A permittee may request to have the city restore the right-of-way. If the permittee requests to have the city restore the right-of-way, the city may accept or reject the request in its sole discretion. If the city accepts, the permittee must still submit all fees and deposits. If the deposits are insufficient to cover the costs, the permittee will be billed for the city’s costs and shall pay the amount thereof within thirty (30) days of date of invoice. (Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)


12.18.060 Inspection.

A.    Standards. The permittee shall perform all work, install, maintain, or remove all facilities in the right-of-way, and connect any utilities according to city specifications and/or in accordance with the conditions specified in the permit.

B.    Notice of Completion. When work under any permit issued hereunder is completed, the permittee shall notify the city engineer. The permittee shall certify, on forms provided by the city engineer, either that the work was completed in conformance with the plans and drawings approved by the city engineer when issuing the permit or shall submit as-built plans and drawings and list the ways in which the as-built plans and drawings differ from the approved plans and drawings. If the excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, the permittee shall notify the city engineer of the actual commencement and end dates as soon as this information is known.

C.    Site Inspection. The permittee shall make the work site available to the city inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.

D.    Restoration. The city inspector shall inspect the area of the work and accept the restoration when it is determined that proper restoration has been made.

E.    Authority of City Engineer. At any time, the city engineer may order the immediate cessation of any work that poses a threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public. The city engineer may issue an order to the permittee to correct any work that does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten business days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the city engineer that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the city engineer may revoke the permit pursuant to Section 12.18.080. (Ord. 2592-20 § 12, 2020; Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)


12.18.070 Other obligations.

A.    Compliance with Other Laws. Obtaining an excavation permit in the right-of-way does not relieve a permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by any city, county, state, or federal rules, laws, or regulations. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state, and federal laws. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.

B.    Prohibited Work. Except in an emergency or with the approval of the city engineer, no right-of-way excavation may be done when the ground is frozen or when conditions are unreasonable for such work. (Ord. 2592-20 § 13, 2020; Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)


12.18.080 Revocation or suspension and appeal.

A.    The city engineer may refuse to issue a permit or may revoke, suspend, or refuse to extend an existing permit if he or she finds any of the grounds stated below. The city engineer’s decision shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the action taken.

10.    The extent to which space is available in the right-of-way for which the permit is sought;

11.    The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way;

12.    The availability of other usable locations in the right-of-way or in other rights-of-way for the facilities of the permittee or applicant;

13.    If the permittee or applicant proposes to install a new pole in the right-of-way, the availability of other existing poles or towers owned by the permittee or applicant or by a third party;

14.    The applicability of ordinances or other regulations of the right-of-way that affect location of facilities in the right-of-way;

15.    The condition and age of the right-of-way and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction;

17.    The applicant or permittee is otherwise not in full compliance with the requirements of this code or state or federal law.

B.    Appeal to Administrative Appeals Board. Any person adversely affected by the decision of the city engineer may appeal that decision to the administrative appeals board, which may decide the issues de novo, and whose written decision will be the final decision of the city. The city elects not to be governed by Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes, in whole for an appeal under this chapter.

C.    Deadline to Appeal. Appeals must be filed within ten business days of the written decision of the city engineer. An extension may not be granted where extension would result in approval of the application by operation of law. (Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)


12.18.090 Work done without a permit.

A.    Emergency Situations.

1.    In an emergency, a person may proceed to take whatever actions are reasonably necessary to respond to the emergency; provided, that those actions do not unreasonably interfere with any city, other registrant’s, or the public’s use of the right-of-way. The person may not excavate to make permanent repairs without first obtaining a permit. Within two business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the person shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the associated fees, and otherwise fully comply with the requirements of this chapter.

2.    The city may take whatever action it deems necessary to protect the public safety as a result of the emergency, the cost of which shall be billed to the registrant, regardless of whether the facilities are damaged by natural forces or by a third party.

B.    Nonemergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, excavates in a right-of-way must subsequently register, if not already registered, and apply for a permit and shall, in addition to any penalties prescribed by ordinance, pay double the normal fee for such permit, deposit with the city engineer the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way, and comply with all other requirements of this chapter. If an after-the-fact permit application is denied, the person shall discontinue use of its facilities and immediately remove them from the right-of-way. (Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)


12.18.100 Penalty.

Any person, firm, partnership, or corporation who violates any part of this chapter shall be subject to the penalty and enforcement provisions in Chapter 1.12. (Ord. 2564-19 § 3 (part), 2019)

Before and after three hundred sixty (360) degree photo simulations must be provided for each utility pole, tower, structure, and aboveground equipment.

4.    A copy of the registrant’s certificate of authority from the PSCW or other applicable state or federal agency if the registrant is required to have such a certificate.

5.    To the extent that filing the facilities placement application establishes a deadline for action on any other permit that may be required in connection with the facility, the application must include complete copies of applications for every required permit, including without limitation electrical permits, building permits, traffic control permits, and excavation permits, with all design engineering completed and with all fees associated with each permit.

6.    A certification by a registered and qualified engineer that the installation can be supported by and does not exceed the tolerances of the structure on which it will be mounted and that all elements of the facility comply with applicable safety standards.

7.    Payment of all required fees.

8.    If an applicant contends that denial of the application would prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of service in violation of federal law, or otherwise violate applicable law, the application must provide all evidence on which the applicant relies in support of that claim. Applicants are not permitted to supplement this evidence if doing so would prevent the city from complying with any deadline for action on an application.

B.    Waivers. Requests for waivers from any requirement of this section shall be made in writing to the city engineer. The city engineer may grant a request for waiver if it is demonstrated that, notwithstanding the issuance of the waiver, the city will be provided with all information necessary to understand the nature of the construction or other activity to be conducted pursuant to the facilities placement permit sought.

C.    Fees. Applicant must provide an application fee, as calculated by the city engineer, which shall include all costs reasonably incurred in reviewing the application, including costs incurred in retaining outside consultants, and an inspection deposit for the cost of inspecting the work.

(Ord. 2592-20 § 15, 2020; Ord. 2564-19 § 4 (part), 2019)


12.19.050 Application processing, refusal to issue, revocation, and appeal.

A.    Review and Approval. The city engineer shall review the application and plans submitted and issue or refuse to issue a permit based on the provisions of this code within sixty (60) days of receiving a complete application in compliance with any applicable federal or state laws based on the type of facility, unless the city engineer and the applicant agree, in writing, to a longer review period. Any application indicating it is submitted under the Wisconsin Statutes will be denied if it is incomplete to avoid automatic approval under the provisions of Section 66.0404, Wisconsin Statutes, while waiting for additional information from the applicant.

B.    Written Decision. In the event that an application is denied, or approved with conditions beyond the standard permit conditions set forth in Section 12.19.060(D), the city engineer shall issue a written decision with the reasons therefor, supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.

D.    Appeal to Administrative Appeals Board. Any person adversely affected by the decision of the city engineer may appeal that decision to the administrative appeals board, which may decide the issues de novo, and whose written decision will be the final decision of the city. An appeal by an infrastructure provider must be taken jointly with the service provider that intends to use the facility. The city elects not to be governed by Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes, in whole for an appeal under this chapter.

E.    Deadline to Appeal. All appeals must be filed within ten business days of the written decision of the city engineer. (Ord. 2564-19 § 4 (part), 2019)


12.19.060 General standards.

A.    Generally. Facilities shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in this chapter in addition to the requirements of any other applicable law or regulation.

B.    Regulations. The decisions on facilities permits shall, at a minimum, ensure that the requirements of this chapter are satisfied, unless it is determined that the applicant has established that denial of an application would, within the meaning of federal or state law, prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of a utility service, or otherwise violate applicable laws or regulations. If that determination is made, the requirements of this chapter and the facilities regulations may be waived, but only to the extent required to avoid the prohibition.

C.    Standards.

1.    Facilities shall be installed and modified in a manner that:

a.    Minimizes risks to public safety;

b.    Ensures that placement of facilities on existing structures is within the tolerance of those structures;

c.    Avoids placement of aboveground facilities or installation of new support structures or equipment cabinets in underground areas in the public right-of-way;

d.    Maintains the integrity and character of the neighborhoods and corridors in which the facilities are located;

e.    Ensures that installations are subject to periodic review to minimize the intrusion on the right-of-way;

f.    Ensures that the city bears no risk or liability as a result of the installations; and

g.    Ensures that applicant’s use does not inconvenience the public, interfere with the primary uses of the right-of-way, including existing utilities, or hinder the ability of the city or other government entities to improve, modify, relocate, abandon, or vacate the right-of-way or any portion thereof, or to cause the improvement, modification, relocation, vacation, or abandonment of facilities in the right-of-way. Specifically, the applicant’s use shall comply with the city’s Public Infrastructure and Development Handbook regarding placement of utilities in the public right-of-way and shall not encroach within five feet of an existing city utility.

2.    No facilities permit shall be issued unless the applicant has immediate plans to use the proposed facility or has a contract with a utility service provider that has immediate plans to use the proposed facility. Facilities permit applicants shall attach their contract with the utility service provider to their facilities permit application.

3.    Installation of new and modification of existing facilities shall meet the following standards:

a.    Facilities and support structures, towers, and utility poles shall not obstruct, impede, or hinder vehicular, pedestrian, or bicycle travel or public safety within the right-of-way, except for authorized temporary lane or sidewalk closures.

b.    Facilities and support structures, towers, and utility poles shall not be located within vision setback lines as set forth in Section 17.112.010(B).

c.    Facilities and support structures, towers, utility poles, and any other ground-mounted equipment shall comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as it is from time to time amended.

d.    New facilities and support structures, towers, and utility poles shall not be located directly in front of any existing residential or commercial structure.

e.    Rigid nonbreakaway poles and other support structures or towers shall be located a minimum of ten feet away from roadway curbs or shoulders, underground facilities, and behind existing or future sidewalks.

f.    The height of a facility, support structure, tower, or utility pole may not exceed the greater of fifty (50) feet above ground level or ten feet above the tallest existing support structure, tower, or utility pole that is in place on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and that is located in the same right-of-way and within five hundred (500) feet of the facility that is the subject of the application. The city engineer may waive this requirement upon consideration of such factors as whether the greater height is necessary and convenient to the provision of utility service to the public and/or will avoid the need for an additional site; whether the proposed facility will be located in a commercial, industrial, or nonresidential area; whether greater separation is required to avoid interference with other equipment on the pole or facility; whether a building or structure is within the fall zone radius of the facility, support structure, tower, or utility pole; and whether nearby buildings are taller than fifty (50) feet.

g.    Equipment mounted to support structures must be a minimum of ten feet above any pedestrian or bicycle thoroughfare or trail and a minimum of twenty (20) feet above any traffic lane.

h.    Unless in conflict with state or federal law, the installation of new facilities and replacements of existing facilities shall be placed underground when proposed in an area where utilities or other equipment in the right-of-way are primarily located underground. In all other areas, facilities shall be placed underground to the extent feasible. All installations shall be in accordance with the State Electrical Code. Additional expense to install and maintain an underground equipment enclosure does not exempt an applicant from this requirement, except where the applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that this requirement will effectively prohibit the provision of utility services. Nothing in this subsection is intended to require the applicant to install any electric meter underground.

i.    All ground-mounted equipment shall be contained in a secured equipment shroud or cabinet to prevent public safety risks and unauthorized access. Any cables and conduits associated with the equipment shall be concealed from view.

j.    All facilities and support structures, towers, and utility poles shall have subdued colors and nonreflective materials that blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and structures.

k.    The owner and/or operator must post an identification sign at each facility, including current owner/operator emergency telephone numbers. The design, materials, colors, and location of the identification signs shall be subject to city review and approval. If at any time a new owner or operator takes over operation of an existing facility, the new owner or operator shall notify the city of the change in operation within thirty (30) days and the required and approved signs shall be updated within thirty (30) days to reflect the name and phone number of the new owner and/or operator. The colors, materials and design of the updated signs shall match those of the required and approved signs. No sign shall be greater than two square feet in size.

l.    Any proposed pruning of trees, shrubs, or other landscaping already existing in the right-of-way must be noted in the application and approved by the city.

D.    Standard Facilities Permit Conditions. All facilities permits under this chapter are issued subject to the following minimum conditions:

1.    Compliance. The permittee shall at all times maintain compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and other rules.

2.    Term. A facilities permit shall be valid in perpetuity from the date of issuance unless revoked pursuant to Section 12.17.080(D) or surrendered.

3.    Contact Information. The permittee shall at all times maintain with the city accurate contact information for the permittee and all utility service providers making use of the facility, which shall include a phone number, mailing address, and email address for at least one natural person.

4.    Emergencies. The city shall have the right to support, repair, disable, or remove any elements of the facilities in emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons or property.

C.    Connection of Properties with “Option” Assessments. Any property with an existing “option” assessment shall be permitted to connect to city water and pay a fee in lieu of the amount that would have been assessed at the time of installation of the water main. Where the property is listed on the “option assessment roll” and a special assessment is established by passage of a final resolution against the property, a water supply charge of five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be part of the special assessment. (Ord. 2391-14 § 1, 2014; Ord. 2003-05 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1819 § 3 (part), 2001; prior code § 13.14)


13.12.030 Program for protecting public water system.

The program for protecting the public water system from contamination due to back flow of contaminants through the water service connection into the public water system. Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapters NR 811.06 and SPS 382.41 require protection of the public water system from contaminants due to back flow of contaminants through the water service connection. Also, the Department of Natural Resources NR 810.15 requires the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination of all potable water systems. Therefore the council ordains as follows:

A.    “Cross-connection” shall be defined as any physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the city water system and the other, water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases or chemical whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two systems.

B.    No person shall establish or permit to be established or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross-connection. No interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the water utility may enter the supply or distribution system of the municipality unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the water utility and by the Department of Natural Resources in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 811.06.

C.    It shall be the duty of the water utility to cause inspections to be made of all properties served by the public water system where cross-connection with the public water system is deemed possible. Residential properties serviced by the utility shall be inspected on a ten-year interval preferably in conjunction with meter changeouts. All nonresidential properties serviced by the utility shall be inspected on a two-year interval, unless otherwise approved by the utility or the DNR. The utility may, but is not required to, perform the cross-connection inspection of the owner’s property. If, in the opinion of the utility, the utility is not able to perform the inspection, the property owner must, at their expense, have the plumbing inspected for cross-connections by a professional qualified to perform cross-connection inspections or by a state of Wisconsin licensed plumber. The frequency of inspections and reinspections based on potential health hazards involved shall be established by the water utility and as approved by the DNR.

D.    Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the water utility shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any property served by a connection to the public water system of the city for cross-connections. If entry is refused, such representative shall obtain a special inspection warrant pursuant to Section 66.0119, Wisconsin Statutes. On request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such property.

E.    The water utility is authorized and directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this title exists and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system. Water services shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes, except as provided in subsection (F) of this section. Water service to such property shall not be restored until the cross-connection has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this title.

F.    If it is determined by the water utility that a cross-connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety and welfare and requires immediate action and a written finding to that effect is filed with the city clerk and delivered to the customer’s premises, service may be immediately discontinued. The customer shall have an opportunity for hearing pursuant to Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statutes, within ten days of such emergency discontinuance.

G.    The city of Brookfield adopts by reference the Brookfield cross-connection control policy manual. This chapter does not supersede the cross-connection control policy manual, but is supplementary to it.

H.    The city adopts by reference the State Plumbing Code, Wisconsin Administrative Code SPS 382.41.

I.    This chapter does not supersede the State Plumbing Code and Chapter 15.12 of this code, but is supplementary to them. (Ord. 2306-12 § 1, 2012: Ord. 2254-11 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1875 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1819 § 3 (part), 2001; Prior code § 13.15)


13.12.040 Penalty for violation of this chapter.

Any person, firm, partnership, or corporation who violates any part of this chapter shall be subject to the penalty and enforcement provisions in Chapter 1.12. (Ord. 2552-19 § 37, 2019)

13.16.010 Construction of sewer trunk line beyond areas having immediate need for sewer service.

A.    Application for Construction. Whenever a landowner desires to or is required by city ordinance to install a sanitary sewer system to serve land which is not then contiguous to a city sewer line, such land owner may request the city to construct the trunk lines in the following manner:

Application shall be made to the director of public works, in writing, for a determination as to the size of the trunk line which would be required under the city sewer plan to service the area in question and such other areas as should reasonably be served by the same trunk line. Within thirty (30) days of the filing of the application, the engineer shall so advise the landowner and inform him of any existing plans by the city for the construction of such trunk line. If, in the opinion of the city engineer, there is no reasonable probability that the trunk line shall be built within five years of making the request, he shall so certify in writing within one hundred twenty (120) days.

B.    Review of Request for Advance Construction. If the landowner desires to have the city undertake the extension of the trunk line to his property in advance of the time when the city shall have decided to so extend such trunk lines, he may make such a request to the director of public works. The request shall be reviewed by the water and sewer board and a recommendation made to the council for final action. The council may, in determining the desirability of authorizing the construction of the trunk line as a public project, consider the following factors:

1.    The need for the use of city funds, if any, on this project as compared with other public projects presently authorized or in the planning stage;

2.    The availability of city staff such as the engineer’s department to prepare plans and supervise the construction of the trunk line at the present time in the light of the existing and future work load;

3.    The probable effect of such construction upon the rate of development within the city.

C.    Financing Cost of Construction. The cost of any such trunk line shall be financed on the following basis unless otherwise agreed by the council for reasons which are in its opinion unique to the particular project:

1.    The developer shall pay for that part of the construction cost of such sewer trunk line as shall, in the opinion of the director of public works, have been necessary to serve his land.

2.    The developer shall lend to the city, without interest, the remaining cost of the sewer construction to be reimbursed, if at all, when any part of the trunk line shall be connected with abutting property or with lines serving other property which it was designed to serve, so much of the cost of extra capacity as shall be applicable to such abutting or other property as shall be recovered by the city by connection charge or special assessment shall be paid to the developer when, if and as received by the city, but, in the latter case, at no interest.

D.    Items Included in Cost of Construction. The cost of any trunk line shall include the cost of all engineering, inspection, legal, fiscal and other work related to the project plus a fee of one-half percent to defray the administrative and clerical expense to the city.

E.    Bond or Cash Deposit. No such trunk line project shall be awarded unless the developer shall have deposited with the city clerk a bond or cash equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the bid of the successful bidder plus such amount as shall be required in the opinion of the director of public works to cover the cost specified in subsection D of this section. (Ord. 2024 § 5 (part), 2005; Ord. 1974-04 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.020 Sewer service charges—System established.

Pursuant to a contract between the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) and the city of Brookfield, entered into in 1958, the wastewater of that part of the city generally located east of the subcontinental divide is treated by the wastewater system operated by the MMSD. Likewise, wastewater of that part of the city generally located west of the subcontinental divide is treated at the Fox River Water Pollution Control Center (FRWPCC).

There is established a uniform system of user charges throughout the city, modified from time to time, as necessary, to pay operation, maintenance and replacement costs, both as charged by the MMSD and as incurred by the city for the FRWPCC. Such charges shall be computed and levied in accordance with federal and state requirements in order to remain eligible for state and federal grants-in-aid. At least biennially, the city will review the wastewater contributions of its users and align its revenue system to recover actual costs. (Ord. 1974-04 § 1 (part), 2004)

The city will maintain the proportionate distribution of operation, maintenance and replacement costs among user classes. The city will generate sufficient revenues to pay the total operation, maintenance and replacement costs. The city will allow new connections only if there is available capacity in all downstream wastewater collection and treatment facilities through which the newly connected flows must pass. The city may reject a connection or contract with users or other municipalities, provided that existing contracts with other municipalities shall be honored. Users may appeal the decisions of the utility to the council. (Ord. 1974-04 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.100 Maintenance, repair and replacement of sewer laterals.

The property owner is responsible for all maintenance including rodding, cleaning, and televising of the sewer lateral and for repair and replacement of the sewer lateral from building to sewer main, unless the repair or replacement is required due to actions or negligence of the city or its representatives. Laterals shall exclude the connection at the main if it is a manufactured connection (wye). Break-in connections are the responsibility of the property owner until the connection is replaced with a manufactured connection. The water and sewer board may issue maintenance, repair and disconnect orders for laterals as necessary for the protection of the public health and the city sewer system.

Any person or industrial user violating any of the provisions of this section or who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction or in any manner causes damage to or impairs the city’s wastewater collection system and/or the FRWPCC wastewater treatment system shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss cost or damage without limitation caused by such violation or discharge. The city shall bill the user for the costs incurred by the city of any cleaning, repair, replacement work or restoration of receiving water damaged by the POTW upsets or any other cleaning, repair damage, forfeitures, administrative costs, penalties or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed cost or failure to comply with other provisions of this section shall constitute a violation of this section enforceable under the provisions of Chapter 13.20. (Ord. 1974-04 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.140 Contract communities—Enforcement beyond city limits.

A.    The city operates a water pollution abatement plant known as the Fox River Water Pollution Control Center as a regional facility for itself and portions of other communities lying west of the subcontinental divide, including at the present time the following: city of New Berlin, village of Menomonee Falls, the Lake Pewaukee Sanitary District, the Sanitary District No. 3 of the city of Pewaukee, the village of Pewaukee and the Sanitary District No. 4 of the town of Brookfield.

13.20.110 Limitation on wastewater strength.

A.    National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.

1.    Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the effluent from the process regulated by the standard, unless otherwise specified in the standard. Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to wastestreams which are transported off-site for disposal as well as those discharged on-site.

2.    All industrial users, except new sources, shall comply with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards within three years from the effective date of the standard or within a shorter time period if specified in the applicable standard.

3.    New sources shall install, have in operating condition and start up all of the pollution control equipment required to meet the applicable pretreatment standards before beginning discharge. Within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, new sources shall meet all application pretreatment standards.

B.    Conversion from Production Based Standards to Mass or Concentration Standards.

1.    a.    When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the city may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating limits for individual users.

b.    Equivalent mass per day limits shall be calculated by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial user’s average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user’s actual long-term daily production, such as average daily production, during a representative year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production.

c.    Equivalent concentration limits shall be calculated by dividing the mass limits derived according to subsection (B)(1)(b) of this section by the average daily flow rate of the industrial user’s process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user’s actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the same representative year used in subsection (B)(1)(b) of this section.

d.    When pretreatment standards specify both daily and long-term limits, the same production or flow figures shall be used in calculating daily and long-term equivalent limits.

2.    Equivalent limits calculated according to subsection (B)(1) of this section shall be considered pretreatment standards for the purposes of this chapter. Industrial users shall comply with the equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limits were derived.

C.    State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on dischargers shall be met by all industrial users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which the state requirements and limitations are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those requirements and limitations contained in this or any other applicable local regulation.

D.    City’s Specific Discharge Limitation.

1.    No user except as authorized pursuant to a wastewater discharge permit shall discharge, either directly or indirectly, into the city’s sewerage system any waste containing concentrations of pollutants in excess of the following:

	Pollutant	Limitation (mg/L)	Pollutant	Limitation (mg/L)

	Arsenic	0.50	Cyanide (T)	2.30

	Cadmium	0.08	Oil & Grease	300**

	Chromium (T)	7.60	Total toxic organics	2.13***

	Copper	2.10	 	 

	Lead	2.80	 	 

	Mercury	3.00 ug/L	 	 

	Molybdenum*	2.20 mg/L or 0.97 lbs/day	 	 

	Nickel	3.30	 	 

	Selenium	1.50	 	 

	Silver	2.90	 	 

	Zinc	2.90	 	 

	* This limit is based on a daily maximum concentration, or a daily mass limitation. Users are required to comply with either the concentration limit or the mass limit for molybdenum.

	** The limitation for oil and grease pertains to total hexane extractable material (HEM) using Method 1664, as established by 40 CFR 136.

	*** Sum of all organic compound concentrations listed in, but not limited to, 40 CFR 122, Appendix D, Table II.

2.    Continuous Monitoring of pH. The city will allow a waiver above the maximum pH limit listed in Section 13.20.100(C), one percent of the total monitoring time subject to the following restrictions:

a.    An industrial user shall not discharge below a pH of five (NR 211.10(2)(b)).

b.    A waiver will not be granted from a categorical standard for an upper pH limit, if such an upper limit exists in the standard.

c.    A waiver will not be granted if the waiver will cause pass-through or interference at the POTW.

E.    City’s Right of Revision. The city reserves the right to establish more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the city’s wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in this section.

F.    Dilution Prohibition. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement, state requirement or local limitation. The city may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

G.    Amalgam Management at Dental Facilities. Any dental office that places or removes amalgam shall implement the amalgam management practices established by the Wisconsin Dental Association. Practices include capturing and recycling all forms of waste amalgam from empty capsules, excess scrap, chair-side traps and vacuum filters. This section does not apply to dental facilities that do not place or remove amalgam, such as orthodontics, periodontics, oral and maxillo-facial surgery, endodontics or prosthodontics.

1.    Every vacuum system where amalgam is placed or removed shall incorporate an amalgam separator that meets ISO 11143 standards by January 1, 2010. Facilities shall install, operate, and maintain the amalgam separator according to manufacturer instructions. The amalgam separator must be of sufficient capacity for the size of dental facility and vacuum system.

2.    Records of amalgam separator maintenance shall be retained for a minimum of three years, and shall be readily available for inspection and copying upon request by the city.

The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.

C.    Prohibition of Bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:

1.    Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production;

2.    There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and

3.    The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (B) of this section.

D.    The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (C). (Ord. 2464-16 (part), 2016: Ord. 1900 § 3 (part), 2002)


13.20.160 Combined wastestreams.

A.    The city shall evaluate and grant requests for combined wastestreams as deemed necessary and warranted. Under no circumstances shall dilution by combined wastestreams be substituted for proper treatment.

B.    Where process effluent is allowed by the city to be mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be calculated by the city. These alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed effluent. The alternative limit for a specified pollutant will be derived by the use of either of the following formulas:

Alternative Concentration
[IMAGE]


Alternative Mass
[IMAGE]


Where:

CT = alternative concentration limit for the combined wastestream.

Ci = the categorical pretreatment standard concentration limit for a pollutant in the regulated stream i.

MT = the alternative mass limit for a pollutant in the combined wastestream.

Mi = the categorical pretreatment standard mass limit for a pollutant in the regulated stream i (the categorical pretreatment mass limit multiplied by the appropriate measure of production).

N = the total number of regulated streams.

Fi = the average flow (at least a thirty (30) day average) of stream i to the extent that it is regulated for such pollutant.

FT = the average daily flow (at least 30-day average) through the combined treatment facility (includes Fi, FD and unregulated streams).

FD = The average daily flow over at least thirty (30) days from:

a.    Boiler blowdown streams, noncontact cooling streams, stormwater streams, and demineralizer backwash streams; provided, however, that where such streams contain a significant amount of a pollutant, and the combination of such streams, prior to treatment, with an industrial user’s regulated process wastestream(s) will result in a substantial reduction of that pollutant, the city upon application of the industrial user, may exercise its discretion to determine whether such stream(s) should be classified as diluted or unregulated. In its application to the city, the industrial user must provide engineering, production, sampling and analysis and such other information so that the city can make its determination; or

b.    Sanitary wastestreams where such streams are not regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard; or

c.    Process wastestreams which were exempted from categorical pretreatment standards from one or more of the following reasons:

i.    The pollutants of concern are not detectable in the effluent from the industrial user;

ii.    The pollutants of concern are present only in trace amounts and are neither causing nor likely to cause toxic effects;

iii.    The pollutants of concern are present in amounts too small to be effectively reduced by technologies known to the administrator of EPA; or

iv.    The wastestream contains only pollutants which are compatible with the POTW.

C.    When deriving alternative categorical limits, the city shall calculate both an alternative daily maximum value using the daily maximum value(s) specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standard(s) and an alternative consecutive sampling day average value using the monthly average value(s) specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standard(s).

D.    The industrial user shall comply with the alternative daily maximum and monthly average limits until the city modifies the limits. Modification is authorized whenever there is a material or significant change in the values used in the calculation to fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant. An industrial user must immediately report any such material or significant change to the city. Where appropriate, new alternative categorical limits shall be calculated within thirty (30) days. (Ord. 2464-16 (part), 2016: Ord. 1900 § 3 (part), 2002)


13.20.170 Wastewater discharge permits.

1.    A permit may also be modified to incorporate special conditions resulting from the issuance of a special order by the city; to incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements; or upon receipt of information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the POTW, personnel, or receiving waters.

2.    Any modifications which result in new conditions in a permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance, if necessary.

3.    A significant industrial user shall submit to the city a permit application form for reissuance of a permit at least sixty (60) days before the expiration date of a permit.

C.    Limitations on Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits will be issued to a specific user for a specific operation and are not assignable to another user or transferable to any other location without the prior written approval of the city. Sale of a user shall obligate the purchaser to seek prior written approval of the city for continued discharge to the city’s sewerage system at least thirty (30) days in advance of the proposed change in ownership.

D.    Discharge Permit Appeals. The user may petition the city to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within thirty (30) days of issuance or user receipt of the permit.

1.    Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.

2.    In its written petition, the user must indicate the permit provisions objected to, the reasons for the objection, and the alternative condition, if any, the user seeks to place in the permit.

3.    The effectiveness of the discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.

4.    If the city fails to act within thirty (30) days of the user appeal, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a discharge permit, not to issue a discharge permit, or not to modify a discharge permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.

E.    Temporary user discharge conditions and requirements may be incorporated into a letter of understanding issued by the city. The letter of understanding will be issued for situations including, but not limited to, an extension of an expiring permit before re-issuance of the permit, to allow a nonroutine discharge, to allow discharge from a groundwater remediation project, or to allow or restrict discharge from a redesigned pretreatment system during upgrade.

F.    All reports required by this permit shall be signed as specified in Section 13.20.270. (Ord. 2464-16 (part), 2016: Ord. 1900 § 3 (part), 2002)

The city will notify an applicable contract community of a facility’s status determination by completing a transmittal of notice of intent to discharge wastewater form. Contract community personnel will be required to conduct or assist city personnel in data gathering activity at an applicable facility as deemed necessary by the city. The Department and the city may notify the user of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of pretreatment system plans and specifications. Any conditional approval or disapproval requires the user to resubmit plans until approval is obtained prior to discharge from said system. (Ord. 2464-16 (part), 2016: Ord. 1900 § 3 (part), 2002)


13.20.190 Baseline monitoring report.

Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, industrial users subject to that standard which are not new sources and which are currently discharging or scheduled to discharge into the city wastewater treatment system, shall submit to the city a report containing the information listed in subsections (A)(1) through (7) of this section. At least ninety (90) days before the commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit a report to the city which contains the information listed in subsections (A)(1) through (5) of this section. New sources shall estimate the information required by subsections (A)(4) and (5) of this section. New sources shall also include in this report information regarding the method of pretreatment that will be used to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. The city may require the industrial user to submit any additional information which the city deems necessary to determine the industrial user’s ability to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards.

A.    Content. Baseline monitoring reports shall include the following information:

1.    The name, address, and location of the industrial user and the name of the owner or operator;

2.    A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the industrial user;

3.    The nature and average rate of production and the standard industrial classification (SIC) of the processes carried out by the industrial user. This description shall include a schematic diagram which indicates points of discharge to the city wastewater treatment system from the processes regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard;

4.    The measured average and maximum flows from the industrial user to the city wastewater treatment system, in gallons per day, from each process regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard and from other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set forth in Section 13.20.160;

5.    The nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge from each of the industrial user’s regulated processes and an identification of applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The nature and concentration of pollutants in each discharge shall be determined in accordance with subsections (A)(5)(a) through (e) of this section as follows:

a.    Sampling and analysis shall be performed to identify the concentration or mass of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process, according to the requirements of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the city. Both daily maximum and average values shall be reported. Average values shall include monthly, four-day or thirty (30) day averages specific to the applicable categorical standard. Samples shall be representative of daily operations. A minimum of four grab samples per day shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. All other samples shall be twenty-four (24) hour flow proportional composites, unless time proportional or grab sampling is authorized by the city. Where alternative sampling is authorized by the city, the samples shall be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow alternative methods shall be documented in the industrial user’s file. Multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior to analysis provided appropriate protocols specified in Chapter NR 219 and in EPA and DNR guidance are followed. Samples for cyanide, total phenols and sulfides may be composited in the laboratory or in the field. Samples for volatile organics and oil and grease may be composited in the laboratory. Other samples may be composited using approved methodologies as authorized by the city.

b.    The industrial user shall collect and analyze a minimum of one representative sample to compile the data necessary for this subsection. Sampling shall be performed during full facility production when substances subject to regulation, including those in batch or periodic discharges, are likely to be present in maximum concentrations. The city may require more frequent monitoring when necessary to access compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. If an industrial user samples any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, the results of this monitoring must be included in the report.

c.    Samples shall be taken at the discharge from the regulated process, or at the discharge from pretreatment facilities; provided, that wastewaters that are not regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard are not mixed with the regulated wastestream prior to the sampling point. If streams which are not regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard are mixed with the regulated stream prior to the sampling point, the industrial user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set forth in Section 13.20.160.

d.    Representative historical data may be used if approved by the city.

e.    The report shall indicate the time, date, and place of sampling, method of analysis, and shall certify that sampling and analysis are representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the city wastewater treatment system.

6.    A statement indicating whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards are being met on a constant basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance, or additional pretreatment, or both, is required in order for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The statement shall be reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified professional.

7.    If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance is needed, the industrial user shall submit the shortest schedule by which additional treatment or operation and maintenance can be provided. The completion date resulting from this schedule may not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard. The schedule shall specify dates for the commencement and completion of the major events necessary to provide the additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance. The length of time between any two dates may not exceed nine months.

a.    Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule, the industrial user shall submit to the city a progress report, including at a minimum a statement of whether the required event was completed by the specified date and if not, the reason for delay, the steps being taken to return to the schedule, and the date on which the required event will be completed. (Ord. 2464-16 (part), 2016: Ord. 1900 § 3 (part), 2002)

13.20.280 Monitoring requirements.

Any significant industrial user subject to an applicable categorical pretreatment standard or a pretreatment standard set forth in this chapter and duly permitted, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new industrial user, after commencement of the permit to discharge to the POTW, shall monitor its wastewater discharges subject to regulation to ascertain compliance with the applicable limitations. Said monitoring shall be conducted in accordance with the frequency set forth in the permit.

Minimum monitoring requirements are for one sampling of the discharge from the user’s process between January 1st to June 30th and a second sampling between July 1st and December 31st. Users shall monitor more frequently if required to do so by the city, or the Department, or the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The monitoring results, including the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by categorical or local pretreatment standards and the measured required time period flow, shall be submitted to the city within fifteen (15) days of the end of the monitoring period. If the user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the permit, the results of such monitoring shall be submitted to the city. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city, the report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production or other measure of operation, the report shall include the user’s actual production or other measure of operation during the monitoring period. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed postage prepaid into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. Reports may be faxed with the posted fax date governing receipt.

A.    Sampling and Reporting Procedures.

1.    Samples shall be obtained utilizing flow proportional sampling techniques. The samples shall be collected over a twenty-four (24) hour period if the discharge occurs over a twenty-four (24) hour period. The samples shall be collected over the period of discharge if less than twenty-four (24) hours. The city may waive flow proportional composite sampling requirements if the user demonstrates to the city that flow proportioned sampling is not feasible. In such cases, users may use time proportioned composite samples or grab samples which the user demonstrates will provide a representative sample, and has been approved by the city. Laboratory sampling and analysis of samples collected shall be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, Chapter NR 219, or other such methods as approved by the Department. Laboratory test results submitted by the user to the city shall be performed by a laboratory certified or registered under Chapter NR 149. The following tests are excluded from this requirement: temperature, pH, flow measurements.

2.    Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics.

3.    Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the industrial user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula as specified in Section 13.20.160.

4.    Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting from all monitoring activities. Such records shall include for all samples:

a.    The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking samples;

b.    The dates the analyses were performed;

c.    The name of the person who performed the analyses;

d.    The analytical techniques or methods used; and

e.    The results of the analyses.

The user shall submit such records with each self-monitoring report to the city.

5.    The city may waive monitoring for noncategorical regulated substances that have not been detected in the wastewater of an industrial user at levels of concern to the city or at the treatment plant. The city may, at any time, require that the monitoring previously waived be again performed as deemed necessary.

6.    The city will conduct monitoring of significant industrial users, independent of user self-monitoring, at a frequency deemed necessary by the city. If the city performs sampling in lieu of the user’s self-monitoring and sampling indicates a violation, the city must repeat the sampling and analysis of the noncompliant parameter(s) within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the violation. The city may conduct monitoring and require reports of insignificant industrial users which discharge process wastewater to the POTW at a frequency deemed necessary by the city.

7.    The industrial user shall notify the city in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of the pollutants in the discharge, including changes in listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification according to Section 13.20.210.

8.    If sampling by the user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis of the noncompliant parameter(s) and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the violation.

9.    Confidential Information. Except for trade secret data determined to be confidential under Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 211.26, “Confidentiality,” all reports required by this chapter shall be available for public inspection upon written request. Effluent data shall be available to the public without restriction.

10.    Records Retention. The user shall retain and preserve for no less than three years any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries thereof relating to monitoring, sampling, and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of the user in connection with its discharge. All records that pertain to matters that are the subject of special orders or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the city shall be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded, and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. Retention time may be increased when requested by the city, Department or EPA.

11.    Severability. The provisions of a permit are severable and, if any provision of the permit or the application of any provision of a permit to any circumstance is held invalid, the application of such provision to other circumstances and the remainder of a permit shall not be affected thereby.

12.    Falsifying Information. Knowingly making any false statement on any report or other document required by this permit or knowingly rendering any monitoring device or method inaccurate may result in prosecution under the criminal laws of Wisconsin as well as being subjected to civil penalties and relief.

B.    Monitoring and Sampling Facilities.

1.    Each industrial user subject to the requirements of the industrial pretreatment program shall provide and operate at the user’s own expense, a monitoring facility to allow twenty-four (24) hour access for inspection, sampling and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the POTW. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user’s premises, except when such a location would cause an extreme hardship on the user. When the city determines such an extreme hardship exists, the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. Before any monitoring facility may be constructed, its location must be approved by the city.

2.    There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. If measuring devices are to be permanently installed, they shall be of a type approved by the city. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable state and local construction standards and specifications.

3.    Plans and specifications for the construction and installation of monitoring facilities shall have the design shown in the diagram titled “Details of Sampling and Gauging Manholes” available from the city. Any alternative design must be submitted for review and receive city approval prior to the beginning of construction.

4.    All industrial users discharging process wastewater shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with an opening of not less than twenty-four (24) inches in diameter and an internal diameter of not less than forty-eight (48) inches which is designed to contain flow measuring, recording, and sampling equipment as requested or required by the city to assure compliance with this chapter. An alternative sampling structure or scheme may be used only if approved by the city (for example, multi-tenant building or categorical process wastestream).

5.    Where a regulated process wastestream is combined prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, the industrial user may monitor either the segregated process wastestream or the combined wastestream for the purpose of determining compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. If the industrial user chooses to monitor the segregated process wastestream, the user shall apply the applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If the user chooses to monitor the combined wastestream, it shall apply alternative discharge limits calculated using the combined wastestream formula as provided in Section 13.20.160. The industrial user may change monitoring points only after receiving approval from the city. Any change in a user’s monitoring point(s) shall not allow the user to substitute dilution for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with applicable standards.

6.    Any industrial user discharging wastewater at a pH below the minimum limit or above the maximum limit may be required to install a continuously monitoring pH chart recording device approved by the city. The recording device shall be cleaned and calibrated on a weekly basis or at a maintenance schedule established by the city. The user shall submit a monitoring report and/or chart recording to the city at a frequency determined by the city.

C.    Inspection and Sampling Authorization. The industrial user shall allow the city or its representatives, exhibiting proper credentials and identification, to enter upon the premises of the user at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection, sampling or records examination. Reasonable hours in the context of inspection and sampling includes any time the user is operating any process which results in a process wastewater discharge to the wastewater treatment system. The city shall have the right to set up on the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.

1.    At a minimum, the city shall inspect each significant industrial user once a year and sample the effluent at least two times per year. The city shall inspect and sample each insignificant industrial user as deemed necessary by the city.

2.    The city shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a plan or other action to control slug discharges. Significant industrial users shall be evaluated within one year of being designated as a significant industrial user. If the city decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:

a.    Description of discharge practices including nonroutine batch discharges;

b.    Description of stored chemicals;

c.    Procedures for immediately notifying the city of slug/spill discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under Sections 13.20.090 or 13.20.100, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days. Users shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised and trained to enact the emergency notification procedure;

d.    If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse spills and any adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), measures and equipment for emergency response, and/or any necessary practices to limit the damage suffered by the treatment plant or the environment after a slug discharge.

ii.    The Department has approved the city’s determination and alternative limits which have been developed according to subsection (F)(2)(b) of this section as follows.

b.    Alternative limits developed according to this subsection shall assure treatment equivalent to that prescribed in the categorical standards which apply to the contributing wastestreams. Alternative limits shall be based on the most stringent categorical limit for each pollutant or the best available treatment technologies for the contributing wastestreams.

3.    Neither dilution nor mixing may be used in lieu of treatment to achieve compliance with applicable limitations; the city requires segregated treatment of wastestreams.

G.    Additional Requirements.

1.    Centralized waste treaters shall submit reports to the city according to Sections 13.20.180 through 13.20.250 and 13.20.280.

2.    The reports required by this chapter shall contain the certification set forth in Section 13.20.260 and be signed according to Section 13.20.270. (Ord. 2464-16 (part), 2016: Ord. 1900 § 3 (part), 2002)


13.20.300 Hauled waste.

The POTW offers disposal services to DNR licensed sanitary pumpers and haulers for wastes generated in the city wastewater treatment system service area. The city has established regulations and procedures governing the acceptance of either domestic septage or holding tank wastes with which the hauler must comply. All wastes must comply with the provisions of this chapter.

A.    Waste Hauler’s License. Any waste hauler seeking disposal privileges at the POTW must obtain a license from the city. The hauler must complete an application for license to dispose of holding tank and septic tank wastes. The application shall contain the name, address and phone number of the applicant; the number and description of each vehicle (including make, year, license and identification numbers, and vehicle capacity); the state DNR sanitary license number; the signature of the responsible company official; a notary public seal; and payment of fees. The application must be completed and received by the city at least thirty (30) days prior to disposal. Upon receipt of a completed application, the city must approve the hauler prior to any disposal at the POTW. The city may not exceed thirty (30) days to accept or reject an application. Upon approval, the city will provide a sticker to the hauler for each vehicle listed in the application. The sticker shall be affixed to the rear of the vehicle in a clearly visible location. The license is renewable annually requiring the completion of another application and payment of fees. Licenses are nontransferable to any new owner or operator. The hauler must inform the city of any proposed changes to the hauler’s approved license application, in writing, at least ten days prior to the proposed change.

B.    Questionnaire. The hauler must obtain a septic tank/holding tank generator questionnaire from the city and distribute to each tank generator. The questionnaire must be completed and signed by the generator owner or principle executive officer and returned to the city. The city must approve the generator tank discharge prior to disposal. The city may require additional information of the generator by sampling and analysis of tank contents and/or inspection of the generator facility. The hauler shall ensure that tank generators and hauler operators are informed of and comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter. The city may not exceed thirty (30) days to accept or reject a generator disposal. The city must receive the certified lab report of analysis at least ten days prior to discharge if applicable.

C.    Sanitary Waste Disposal Permit. Each shipment of hauled waste shall be accompanied by a completed sanitary waste disposal permit supplied by the city. The permit shall include an identification of the waste; the total gallons delivered; the name, address, license number and signature of the hauler; operator and the source generator name, address, phone number, generator facility type, date, and generator signature. The permit must be presented to an authorized POTW employee prior to the disposal of the hauled waste. The POTW employee must sign the permit to allow the disposal and will provide a sample bottle. A sample shall be required of each load of hauled waste.

D.    General Rules.

1.    Hauled waste may be discharged only at a location and time designated by the city;

2.    The hauler must be licensed by the Department in accordance with Chapter NR 113 of the Wisconsin Administrative Code;

3.    The hauler must meet the requirements of subsections (A) through (C) of this section;

4.    If sample analysis indicates that the waste is nondomestic in nature, then the hauler and/or generator of the waste shall bear all costs associated with conducting the analysis. Nondomestic waste shall be sampled and analyzed at a frequency deemed necessary by the city;

5.    The hauler may not mix loads from different generator sources;

6.    All hauled waste shall be identified as either septic tank or holding tank waste. If holding tank waste and septic tank waste are combined in the same load, the entire load shall be charged at rates established for septic tank waste. Hauled waste shall be identified as septic tank waste if BOD or TSS is greater than five thousand (5,000) mg/L;

7.    License fees are payable prior to the acceptance of any hauled waste. The hauler shall promptly pay all costs charged for disposal but in no case shall payment be later than thirty (30) days past invoice. Payment shall be by invoice only, no cash transactions allowed. The fee schedule may be revised as deemed necessary by the city;

8.    The city retains the right to revise the general rules as deemed necessary. Revisions shall become effective thirty (30) days after notice of the change is sent to approved haulers.

E.    Enforcement. In addition to any enforcement action deemed necessary by the city in accordance with Section 13.20.320, the city may take action as cited in the following situations:

1.    Disposal Permit Misrepresentation. If the hauler operator intentionally misrepresents a sanitary waste disposal permit by incorrectly documenting required information or falsifying a signature, then the city may:

a.    Revoke the waste hauler’s license;

b.    Prohibit discharge privileges for the hauler at the POTW for a period of up to three years;

c.    Charge the hauler for any costs that the hauler avoided by misrepresenting the waste; and/or

d.    Refer the hauler to city legal staff.

2.    Exceedance of a Pretreatment Standard. If a sample from a hauled discharge indicates an exceedance of any federal, state or local pretreatment limit, then the city may:

a.    Issue the hauler and/or generator of the waste a notice of noncompliance and repeat analysis on the next hauled discharge from the violating generator, and/or repeat analysis directly from the violating generator holding tank;

b.    Prohibit discharge privileges for the violating generator of the waste for a period of up to three years;

c.    Revoke the waste hauler’s license;

d.    Prohibit discharge privileges for the hauler at the POTW for a period of up to three years; and/or

e.    Charge the hauler for any sample collection or lab analysis costs, or any costs for damage done to the treatment facility equipment or processes.

3.    Discharge at a Location or Time Other Than That Designated by the City. If the hauler discharges any waste in a manner distinct than as designated by the city, then the city may:

a.    Revoke the waste hauler’s license;

b.    Prohibit discharge privileges for the hauler at the POTW for a period of up to three years; and/or

c.    Refer the hauler to city legal staff.

4.    Failure to Pay Fees. If a hauler fails to pay the city any required fees within thirty (30) days past invoice, then the city may:

a.    Revoke the waste hauler’s license; and

b.    Prohibit discharge privileges for the hauler at the POTW until all fees are paid.

5.    Suspicious Discharges. If inspection of a hauler vehicle or its contents or any other circumstances causes the city to suspect that the discharge is inconsistent with the sanitary waste disposal permit, pretreatment standards, or requirements of this chapter, then the city may order a hauler to not begin discharging or to cease discharging.

6.    Failure to Cooperate. If a hauler fails to allow the city to inspect or sample, or fails to cooperate with any other requirement or regulation, then the city may:

a.    Revoke the waste hauler’s license; or

b.    Prohibit discharge privileges for that particular hauler operator.

7.    Appeals. Any hauler or generator aggrieved by an enforcement action under this section may petition the city to reconsider within thirty (30) days of the action. The petition must be in writing and clearly state the reasons why the action should not be taken. The city may require the hauler to show cause before the water and sewer board. The hauler shall be entitled to a written reply from the city within fifteen (15) days after the city receives the petition. The hauler’s request shall not stay any enforcement action pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply. (Ord. 2464-16 (part), 2016: Ord. 2024 § 5 (part), 2005; Ord. 1900 § 3 (part), 2002)

13.20.320 Enforcement.

The city shall undertake the enforcement actions necessary to assure compliance with this chapter. The city shall have primary responsibility for enforcing all pretreatment standards and requirements with possible interaction from the Department or EPA. The city shall develop and implement an enforcement response guide. This guide shall outline the various enforcement responses used by the city, the violations for which the responses will be used, the timing of these responses, and the persons responsible for each response. The order of responses taken shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user; more than one action may be taken against a user; and actions may be concurrent.

A.    Notice of Noncompliance. If the city has determined that a user has violated the requirements of this chapter, the user’s discharge permit, or any other local, state or federal standard or requirement, then the city may issue the user a written notice of noncompliance.

1.    The notice shall identify the violation, the consequences of further violations, and the user response deadline of fifteen (15) days from the date of written notification (unless a shorter timeframe is necessary due to the nature of the noncompliance).

2.    The user response will require a description of the cause of the violation, and a plan and timeframe for user resampling and/or correction of the noncompliance, or other provisions that return the user to compliance.

B.    Notice of Violation. If the city has determined that a user has violated or continues to violate requirements of this chapter, the user’s discharge permit, or any other local, state or federal standard or requirement, or has failed to respond to a notice of noncompliance, then the city may issue the user a written notice of violation.

1.    The notice shall be either served upon the user personally or delivered by certified mail (return receipt requested), identify the violation, indicate that the city intends to publish the user’s name if required by subsection (I) of this section, identify the user response deadline of thirty (30) days from the date of written notification (unless a shorter timeframe is necessary due to the nature of the noncompliance), and/or require the user to attend an enforcement conference to discuss the user response.

2.    The user response will require a description of the cause of the violation, and a remedial action plan with a compliance schedule for correction of the noncompliance, or other provisions that return the user to compliance.

3.    Submission of this plan does not relieve the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.

C.    Special Order. If the city has determined that a user has violated or continues to violate the requirements of this chapter, the user’s discharge permit, or any other local, state or federal standard or requirement, then the city DPW may order a user to take certain actions before a certain time to remedy a violation.

1.    The order shall be written, served upon the user personally or delivered by certified mail (return receipt requested), state the reasons for the order, and indicate the specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified.

2.    If authorized in the order, the user may meet with the city within thirty (30) days of the date of user receipt of the order to discuss the allegations and, where necessary, establish a corrective action plan.

3.    An order may include the issuance of administrative fines of no less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall after thirty (30) calendar days be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance. A lien against the user’s property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city water and sewer board will finalize the decision. In the event that the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any accrued penalty shall be returned to the user.

D.    Emergency Suspension of Service. The city may, for good cause shown, suspend the discharge permit and sewer service to a user when it appears to the city that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens to present an imminent danger to the environment, system, or the public. Any user notified of the suspension shall, within a reasonable period of time as determined by the city, cease all discharges. In the event of failure of the user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the city shall commence judicial proceedings to compel the user’s compliance. The city shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the user of the elimination of the conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.

E.    Bulkheads. The city may order the insertion of a bulkhead in the user’s sewer connection if the city determines that the user has failed to adequately respond to a notice of noncompliance, notice of violation, or previous order for discharging prohibited substances or toxic pollutants; or the user has discharged or will imminently discharge a prohibited substance or toxic pollutant in an amount likely to harm the environment, the POTW, the sewer system, or the public. A user may remove a bulkhead only after the user has received written authorization from the city. No person may remove or tamper with a bulkhead.

F.    Revocation of Permit. The city may revoke a discharge permit to any user which fails to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; which fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics; which fails to reapply for a discharge permit within the time period specified; which refuses reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; for violations of conditions of this chapter or any local, state or federal standard or requirement; or which discharges, caused to be discharged, or in any manner aids in the discharge of any toxic or hazardous pollutant or any other prohibited discharge.

G.    Show Cause Hearing. If the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the city may order any user which causes or allows a discharge to occur which is prohibited to show cause before the water and sewer board why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of the hearing, the reason why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Where the city determines that a reasonable basis exists for believing that a violation has occurred, the user shall have the burden of going forward by producing evidence that no violation has occurred. The user’s burden shall include the entire burden of proof as to all facts relevant to establishing any affirmative defense available to the user under 40 CFR Part 403. Findings of fact, determinations, conclusions and corresponding orders shall then be rendered verbally or in writing by the water and sewer board. The user shall be bound by such findings, determinations, conclusions and corresponding orders, including any and all time during which the user and/or anyone on its behalf seeks further legal or equitable relief. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent of office of the user.

H.    Judicial Proceedings. When the city finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, a discharge permit, or any other local, state or federal standard or requirement, the city legal counsel may, following the authorization of such action by the city, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief or other remedies, including injunctive relief, against the user as the city deems appropriate.

I.    Annual Publication. An annual public notification will be published in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice in the area served by the POTW of industrial users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. A significant industrial user is in significant noncompliance if any of the following criteria apply. A nonsignificant industrial user is in significant noncompliance if criterion 3, 4, or 8 applies.

1.    Sixty-six (66) percent or more of all the measurements of the industrial user’s wastewater for the same pollutant taken during a six-month period exceeded by any magnitude any numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including an instantaneous limit;

2.    Thirty-three (33) percent or more of all of the measurements of the industrial user’s wastewater for the same pollutant taken during a six-month period equaled or exceeded the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including an instantaneous limit multiplied by either 1.4 for BOD, TSS, and fats-oil-grease; 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH; or exceeded a pH limit by 0.4 standard units;

3.    The city has reason to believe that the user has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference, pass-through or endangerment of the health of POTW personnel or the general public because of a violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement;

4.    The user has discharged a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment, or has resulted in the city’s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;

5.    The user has failed to meet, by ninety (90) days or more, a milestone date contained in a compliance schedule within a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining compliance;

6.    The user has failed to provide within forty-five (45) days of a deadline a required report containing all required monitoring results and other information, such as a baseline monitoring report, ninety (90) day final compliance report, periodic self-monitoring report, or report on compliance with a compliance schedule;

7.    The user has failed to accurately report noncompliance; or

8.    Any other violation or group of violations which the city has determined that has adversely affected the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

J.    Right of Appeal. Any user or interested party shall have the right to request, in writing, an interpretation, modification, or reversal by the city on any matter covered by this section, and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a user and deals with matters of performance, compliance or enforcement with this subsection for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a user’s request shall not stay enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply. The request must be received by the city within thirty (30) days after the user received notice of the enforcement activity. The request shall contain facts and reasons supporting modification or reversal of the activity. The user or interested party shall be entitled to a written reply from the city within thirty (30) days after the city receives the request.

K.    Penalty for Violation of This Chapter.

1.    Any person, firm, partnership, or corporation who violates any part of this chapter shall be subject to the penalty and enforcement provisions in Chapter 1.12.

2.    Recovery of Cost Incurred by the City. Any person or user violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any other federal, state, or local regulation or requirement, or discharges or causes a discharge of a deposit or obstruction, or in any manner causes damage to or impairs the wastewater treatment system, shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss, cost or damage, without limitation, caused by such action or discharge. The city shall bill the person or user for the costs incurred by the city for any cleaning, repair, replacement, or restoration of the system, or any other cleaning, repair, replacement, restoration, forfeiture, or penalty caused by the violating discharge or action.

13.24.040    Well head protection.


13.24.010 Statement of purpose and authority.

The residents of the city depend exclusively on groundwater for a safe drinking water supply. Certain land use practices and activities can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality. The purpose of the well head protection ordinance is to institute land use regulations and restrictions to protect the city of Brookfield’s municipal water supply and well fields, and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city.

Statutory authority of the city to enact these regulations was established by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1983, Wisconsin Act 410 (effective May 11, 1984), which specifically added groundwater protection to the statutory authorization for municipal planning and zoning to protect public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 1624 § 1, 1997)


13.24.020 Application of regulations.

A.    The regulations specified in the well head protection ordinance shall apply to all lands that lie within the five-year “time of travel” (TOT) of each city municipal well or one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet minimum. These lands must be within the city corporate limits and have a well head protection area delineated in a well head protection plan accepted by the city.

B.    No new use or change in use of any structure, land or water shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered and no development shall commence without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. (Ord. 1624 § 2, 1997)


13.24.030 Definitions.

As used in this chapter the following terms are defined in this section:

“Agricultural uses” means and includes pesticide and/or fertilizer storage and use, septage and/or sludge spreading, animal waste landspreading, animal waste facilities and animal confinement facilities related to the production of crops and use of livestock for commercial purposes.

“Aquifer” means a saturated, permeable geologic formation that contains and will yield significant quantities of water.

“Cone of depression” means the area under which the water level in an aquifer is lowered by the pumping of a well.

“Facility” means something created, built, installed or established to serve a particular purpose.

“Five-year time of travel (TOT)” means the area upgradient of a pumping well from the outer boundary of which it is determined or estimated that groundwater and potential contaminants will take five years to reach the pumping well.

“Groundwater divide” means ridge in the water table, or potentiometric surface of an aquifer, from which groundwater moves away in both directions. The line of highest hydraulic head in the water table or potentiometric surface.

“Well head protection area” is defined to include the area as calculated in Part 5 of the well head protection plan for each well.

“Natural vegetation” means and includes native trees, shrubs and prairie species and non-native plants, excluding lawns.

“Nonconforming use” means an existing legal use of land, structure, building or accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

“Recharge area” means an area in which water reaches the zone of saturation of an aquifer by surface infiltration and directly supplies groundwater recharge to a well.

“Well field” means a piece of land used primarily for the purpose of locating wells to supply a municipal water system. (Ord. 1624 § 3, 1997)


13.24.040 Well head protection.

Lands immediately surrounding each municipal well are subject to the most stringent land use and development restrictions. This is due to the close proximity to each municipal well and the correspondingly high threat of potential contamination.

Lands surrounding each well will be subject to the following required minimum horizontal separation distances between a well and the following land uses and facilities.

A.    Fifty (50) feet between a well and a storm sewer main;

B.    Two hundred (200) feet between a well and any sanitary sewer main, lift station or oil tank. A lesser separation distance may be allowed for sanitary sewer mains where the sanitary sewer main is constructed of water main materials and joints and pressure tested in place to meet current AWWA 600 specifications. In no case may the separation distance between a well and a sanitary sewer main be less than fifty (50) feet;

C.    Four hundred (400) feet between a well and a septic tank receiving less than eight thousand (8,000) gallons per day, a cemetery or a storm water detention or retention pond or infiltration facility. Storm water facilities may be located closer to a well head if a hydro-geologic investigation indicates lesser separation distances would provide adequate protection from well contamination. Any person seeking a storm water facility exception shall submit a written request to the city engineer who will determine whether the proposed reduction adequately protects the well head;

D.    Six hundred (600) feet between a well and any gasoline or fuel oil storage tank installation that has received written approval from the Wisconsin Department of Commerce or its designated agent under Section COMM 10.10, Wisconsin Administrative Code;

E.    One thousand (1,000) feet between a well and outer limits of land used for the application of municipal, commercial or industrial waste; industrial, commercial or municipal wastewater lagoons or storage structures; and septic tanks or soil absorption units receiving eight thousand (8,000) gallons of wastewater per day or more;

14.12.010 Design methodology.

A.    The site-specific stormwater management system plan required under the provisions of this title shall be designed in accordance with good engineering practice. The specific methods to be used in the calculation of peak rates of discharge, volumes and water quality conditions and of the hydraulic capacities of storage and conveyance facilities shall be left to the judgment of the professional engineer preparing the plan subject, however, to the approval of the city.

B.    The site-specific stormwater management system plan shall be designed such that natural topography and land cover features such as swales, natural depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural ground water recharge areas shall be preserved and used to the extent practicable.

C.    Guiding Principles for Stormwater Management. To satisfy the requirements of this section, a stormwater management plan shall, to the maximum extent practicable, adhere to the following guiding principles:

1.    Preserve natural watershed boundaries and drainage patterns;

2.    Reserve adequately sized areas for stormwater infiltration, detention and treatment early in the site planning process;

3.    Locate stormwater BMPs prior to runoff leaving the site or entering waters of the state, and outside of wetlands, floodplains, primary or secondary environmental corridors or isolated natural areas;

4.    Minimize soil compaction and maintain pre-development ground water recharge areas;

5.    Minimize impervious surfaces and have them drain to vegetated areas for pollutant filtering and infiltration;

6.    Emphasize vegetated swales, warm season and wetland plantings, and low flow velocities for stormwater conveyance, treatment and infiltration, especially for transportation related projects;

7.    Allow for different stormwater management strategies for cleaner runoff (i.e., roofs) versus more polluted runoff (i.e., heavily used streets and parking lots);

8.    Provide for emergency overflow in all stormwater BMP designs;

9.    Distribute stormwater bioretention and infiltration BMPs throughout the site plan for large land developments.

D.    Total Suspended Solids. By design, each stormwater management plan shall meet the following post-development total suspended solids reduction targets, based on average annual rainfalls, as compared to no runoff management controls:

1.    For new land development, eighty (80) percent reduction in total suspended solids load;

2.    For redevelopment, forty (40) percent reduction of total suspended solids load;

3.    For in-fill development that occurs prior to October 1, 2012, forty (40) percent reduction total suspended solids load;

4.    For in-fill development that occurs after October 1, 2012, eighty (80) percent reduction of total suspended solids load.

E.    Infiltration. BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the following requirements, except as provided in subsections 1 through 8 below.

1.    Residential. For residential developments one of the following shall be met:

a.    Infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least ninety (90) percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than one percent of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area,

b.    Infiltrate twenty-five (25) percent of the post-development runoff volume from the two-year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm with a type II distribution. Separate runoff curve numbers for pervious and impervious surfaces shall be used to calculate runoff volumes, not composite curve numbers, as prescribed in NR 151. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than one percent of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area;

2.    Nonresidential. For nonresidential development, including commercial, industrial and institutional development, one of the following shall be met:

a.    Infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least sixty (60) percent of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area,

b.    Infiltrate ten percent of the post-development runoff volume from the two-year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm. Separate curve numbers for pervious and impervious surfaces shall be used to calculate runoff volumes, not composite curve numbers, as defined in TR-55. However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no more than two percent of the project site is required as an effective infiltration area;

3.    Modeling. Refer to NR 151 for details on calculating runoff volumes and pre-development conditions;

4.    Pretreatment. Pretreatment shall be required before infiltrating parking lot and road runoff from commercial, industrial and institutional areas. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect ground water quality in accordance with subsection 8 below. Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil/grease separators, sedimentation or bioretention basins, filtration swales or filter strips. All designs shall comply with NR 151;

5.    Infiltration Exclusions. Infiltration of runoff shall not be credited toward meeting the requirements of this subsection for the following:

a.    Runoff from outdoor material storage and loading docks for tier 1 and tier 2 industrial facilities, as identified in NR 216(2) Wis. Admin. Code,

Code and City Code 13.24.040(c), or within one hundred (100) feet of a private well as specified in s. NR 812.08(4), Wis. Adm. Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices for residential development, not including rooftop runoff,

g.    Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in s. NR 720.03(2), Wis. Adm. Code are present in the soil through which infiltration will occur;

6.    Infiltration Exemptions. The infiltration requirements of this subsection do not apply to frozen soil conditions and may be exempted if soils have a measured infiltration rate of less than 0.6 inches per hour and the city determines it would be impracticable to modify existing soil conditions;

7.    Alternate Runoff Uses. Where storage and reuse of runoff are employed, such as to support green roofs, landscape watering, toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation, such alternate uses shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this section;

8.    Ground Water Protection.

a.    Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this subsection shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to ground water and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Chapter NR 140 Wis. Adm. Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable.

b.    The discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application.

c.    No stormwater BMP shall be installed that meets the definition of an injection well under Chapter NR 812 Wis. Admin. Code.

The erosion control plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction;

2.    Where land disturbing activity occurs within a protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of seventy (70) percent or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur;

3.    Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins, that are designed to control pollutants from non-point sources may be located in the protective area, but shall not encroach into wetlands, floodplains or primary or secondary environmental corridors.

H.    Protective Area Exemptions. The protective area requirements of this subsection may be exempted and do not apply to the following:

1.    Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges and culverts;

2.    Structures constructed in accordance with s. 59.692(1v), Wisconsin Statutes; and

I.    Fueling and Vehicle Maintenance Areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen.

J.    Site Drainage. Measures shall be implemented to ensure proper site drainage, prevent property damage and protect public health and safety, including the following minimum requirements:

1.    Drainage Easement. Perpetual drainage easements or other deed restrictions shall be recorded on the property to preserve major stormwater flow paths and permanent stormwater BMP locations. Covenants in these areas shall not allow buildings or other structures and shall prevent any grading, filling or other activities that interrupt or obstruct flows in any way. Covenants shall also specify maintenance responsibilities and authorities in accordance with City Ordinance 14.24.

K.    Site Grading. Site grading shall ensure positive flows away from all buildings, roads and driveways, be coordinated with the general stormwater drainage patterns for the area, and minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties.

L.    Street Drainage. All street drainage shall be designed to prevent concentrated flows from crossing the traffic lanes to the maximum extent practicable. Design flow depths at the road centerline for on-street drainage, shall not exceed six inches during the peak flows generated by the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area.

M.    Bridges and Cross-Culverts. All new or modified bridges and cross-culverts shall comply with applicable design standards and regulations, facilitate fish passage and prevent increased flooding or channel erosion upstream or downstream from the structure. Design flow depths at the road centerline for all crossings shall not exceed six inches during the peak flows generated by the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm, using planned land use conditions for the entire contributing watershed area. All pre-development runoff storage areas within the flow path upstream of bridges and cross-culverts shall be preserved and designated as drainage easements, unless compensatory storage is provided and accounted for in modeling. As-built documentation shall be submitted in accordance with City Ordinance 14.32.030(G) for all new or modified structures that are located within a mapped floodplain or that the city determines to be necessary to maintain floodplain modeling for the applicable watershed.

N.    Subsurface Drainage. Basement floor surfaces shall be built one foot above the seasonal high water table elevation, as documented in the submitted soil evaluations, and shall avoid hydric soils as much as possible. The city shall be notified of any drain tiles that are uncovered during construction, which the city may require to be restored or connected to other drainage systems. No discharge of ground water from tile lines, sump pumps or other means shall be allowed onto another persons land or any public space without the written approval of the owner or unit of government.

O.    Open Channels. All open channel drainage systems shall at a minimum be designed to carry the peak flows from a ten-year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm using planned land use for the entire contributing watershed area. Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3h:1v unless otherwise approved by the city for unique site conditions.

P.    Storm Sewers. All storm sewers shall be designed in accordance with applicable city technical standards and specifications.

Q.    Structure Protection and Safety. Flows generated by the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm under planned land use conditions may exceed the design capacity of conveyance systems, but shall not come in contact with any buildings. For buildings designed for human occupation on a regular basis, the following additional requirements shall apply:

1.    The lowest elevation of the structure that is exposed to the ground surface shall be a minimum of two feet above the maximum water elevation produced by the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm, including flows through any stormwater BMP that may temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one foot; and

2.    The structure shall be set back at least fifty (50) feet from any stormwater BMP that may temporarily or permanently store water at a depth of greater than one foot. Setback distance shall be measured from the closest edge of water at the elevation produced by the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm.

14.12.020 Water quality criteria.

The stormwater management facilities and measures required to serve land use development, redevelopment and property land division activities subject to this title shall be designed to meet the following minimum standards:

A.    Stormwater discharges shall be treated to achieve the levels of pollutant removals specified in the adopted city stormwater management system plan. In areas for which the city has not prepared a stormwater management system plan, the levels of pollutant reduction required shall be specified by the city upon due consideration of recommendations contained in the adopted regional water quality management plan and priority watershed plans. Unless otherwise specified in the above plans, stormwater discharges shall generally be designed to remove, on an average annual basis, a goal of eighty (80) percent of the total suspended solids load based on no controls. To achieve this level of control, stormwater practices shall be designed to accommodate, at a minimum, the runoff volume resulting from 1.5 inches of rainfall.

B.    Discharge of urban stormwater pollutants to wetlands shall be minimized to the extent practicable. Significant degradation of wetland functional values due to stormwater pollutant loading shall be avoided.

C.    Stormwater discharges shall be pretreated prior to infiltration to prolong maintenance of the infiltration capacity and to prevent discharge of stormwater pollutants and concentrations that would result in exceedences of ground water quality standards established by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

D.    Stormwater detention, retention and infiltration facilities shall not be located closer than one hundred (100) feet from a well serving a private water system; or four hundred (400) feet from a well serving a municipal public water supply system; or within the wellhead protection area of a well serving a municipal public water supply system, if such a protection area has been delineated.

E.    The design criteria and standards contained in “The Wisconsin Stormwater Manual” prepared and published by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources shall be used in the design of stormwater facilities and measures. (Ord. 2112-07 § 6, 2007; Ord. 1749 § 1 (part), 2000)


14.12.030 Stormwater discharge criteria.

A.    The conveyance and storage facilities incorporated into the site-specific stormwater management system plan required under this Title 14 shall be designed as an integral part of complementary minor and major subsystem. The minor subsystem shall be designed to avoid nuisance flooding of streets and yards and shall accommodate the peak rate of runoff from rainfall events up to and including the ten-year recurrence interval event. The rainfall intensity shall be determined based on appropriate times of concentration from relationships established and published by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission. The complementary major subsystem shall consist of the public streets and interconnected flow paths to the streets and from the streets to receiving streams and watercourses. The major system shall be designed to accommodate peak rates of discharge from rainfall events up to and including the one hundred (100) year recurrence interval event without inundation of exposed basements, building basement window wells, basement entryways, or the first floors of buildings, utilizing a one foot freeboard.

B.    The peak flow discharge rates of stormwater runoff from the site under the post-development site conditions shall not exceed the rates under the existing, or predevelopment conditions, as calculated in Section 14.08.070(F) or as required by Chapter 13 of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District Rules on Surface Water and Storm Water Runoff Management. (Ord. 1902 § 5, 2003; 1749 § 1 (part), 2000)


14.12.040 Stormwater volume criteria.

Water quality control facilities included in the stormwater management system plan required under this Title 14 shall be designed in conformance with the adopted city stormwater management system plan. In areas for which the city has not prepared a stormwater management system plan, the facilities shall be designed to accommodate a stormwater runoff volume specified by the city based upon recommendations contained in the adopted regional water quality management plan and priority watershed plans. (Ord. 1749 § 1 (part), 2000)


14.12.050 Exceptions.

The city may establish stormwater management requirements either more or less stringent than those set forth in this Title 14; provided, that the engineer finds that one or more of the following conditions applies:

A.    A higher level of quality in the stormwater discharge is required to protect sensitive environmental resources;

B.    A higher level of protection from ponding or flooding is required to protect the public health and safety;

C.    Provisions are available to manage the stormwater runoff by off-site facilities; provided, that all of the following conditions are met for the off-site facilities: the facilities are in place; the facilities are adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater runoff control equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site facilities and measures meeting the requirements of this Title 14; and a legal entity exists that is responsible for the maintenance of the facilities.

D.    To meet the requirements of Chapter 13 of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District Rules on Surface Water and Storm Water Runoff Management. (Ord. 1902 § 6, 2003; 1749 § 1 (part), 2000)

The city shall notify the permit holder in writing of any changes required in the facilities and measures to bring them into compliance with the approved plan and the requirements of this title.

E.    Inspection Log. The permit holder shall provide a qualified professional to conduct inspections and maintain an inspection log for the site. All best management practices shall be inspected within twenty-four (24) hours after each rain event of 0.5 inch or more that results in runoff, or at least once each week. The inspection log shall include the name of the inspector, the date and time of inspection, a description of the present phase of construction, the findings of the inspection, including an assessment of the condition of erosion and sediment control measures and the installation of stormwater management BMPs, and any action needed or taken to comply with the ordinance codified in this chapter. The inspection log shall also include a record of BMP maintenance and repairs conducted under subsection F below. The permit holder shall maintain a copy of the inspection log at the construction site. The city may view or obtain a copy at any time during normal business hours until permit termination under subsection F below.

F.    BMP Maintenance. The permit holder shall maintain and repair all best management practices within twenty-four (24) hours of inspection, or upon notification by the city, unless the city approves a longer period due to weather conditions. All BMP maintenance shall be in accordance with approved plans and applicable technical standards until the site is stabilized. The permit holder, upon approval by the city, shall remove all temporary erosion control practices such as silt fence. The permit holder, in accordance with approved plans and applicable technical standards, shall maintain permanent stormwater management practices until maintenance responsibility is transferred to another party or unit of government pursuant to the recorded Stormwater Maintenance Agreement.

G.    Upon final approval of the constructed stormwater management facilities, the developer or subdivider shall have an “as-built” plan prepared by a licensed professional engineer or registered land surveyor correctly showing the locations, configurations and elevations of the completed facilities and measures. The “as-built” plan shall be prepared to the same scale, contour interval and vertical datum as the approved site-specific stormwater management plan and shall be subject to the approval of the city. Any construction bond or letter of credit shall be withheld until an approved as-built plan has been submitted to, and approved by, the city.

H.    If so directed by the city, the permit holder shall repair at the permit holder’s own expense any and all damage to adjoining municipal facilities and drainageways caused by stormwater runoff where such damage was caused by activities not in compliance with the approved site-specific stormwater management plan.

I.    The permit holder shall permit access to the site and property concerned by the city for the purpose of inspecting the stormwater management facilities and measures for compliance with the approved site-specific stormwater management plan.

J.    Where a site-specific stormwater management plan proposes changes in the direction, in the peak rates, or in the total volume of runoff from a site, the city may require the permit holder to make appropriate legal arrangements with adjacent property owners concerning the prevention of damage to property or danger to public health and safety.

A.    General. No building or structure shall be moved into the city from another jurisdiction. No person shall move, or cause to be moved, within or out of the city, any buildings or structures or otherwise move or cause to be moved a building or structure upon any public right-of-way of the municipality without first obtaining a permit therefor from the director and upon the payment of the required fee. Every such permit issued by the director for the moving of a building shall designate the route to be taken and the conditions to be complied with and shall limit the time during which the moving operations shall be continued. The director may refuse to issue a permit under this section if the director reasonably determines that such building or structure may not be moved without unduly damaging such building or structure, any public right-of-way or any property of the municipality or others or that such moving would unduly endanger or otherwise be contrary to the public health and safety.

B.    Moving Damaged Buildings. No building shall be moved within the municipality that has deteriorated or has been damaged by any cause (including such moving and separation from its foundation and service connections in case of moved buildings) greater than or equal to fifty (50) percent or more of its assessed value and no permit shall be granted to move such building within or into the municipality.

C.    Continuous Movement. The movement of buildings shall be a continuous operation during all the hours of the day, and day by day and at night, until such movement is fully completed. All of such operations shall be performed with the least possible obstruction to thoroughfares. No building shall be allowed to remain overnight upon any street crossing or intersection, or so near thereto as to prevent easy access to any fire hydrant or any other public facility. Lighted lanterns shall be kept in conspicuous places at each end of the building during the night.

D.    Street Repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall, within one day after the building reaches its destination, report the fact to the director who shall thereupon, in the company of the city engineer, inspect the streets and highways over which the building has been moved and ascertain their condition. If the removal of the building has caused any damage to a street or highway, the person to whom the permit was issued shall forthwith prove them in good repair as they were before the permit was granted. On the failure of the permittee to do so within ten days thereafter to the satisfaction of the director, the department shall repair the damage done to such streets and hold the person obtaining such permit and the sureties on his bond responsible for the payment of same. 

E.    Conformance with Municipal Code. No permit shall be issued with respect to a building or structure under this section until the director has made an investigation of such building at the location from which it is to be moved and is satisfied from such investigation that the building or structure is in a sound and stable condition and of such construction, dimensions, aesthetics and quality that it will meet the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable legal requirements in all respects. A complete plan of all further repairs, improvements and remodeling, with reference to such building or structure, shall be submitted to the director and the director shall make a finding of fact to the effect that all such repairs, improvements and remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of this chapter and that when same are completed, the building, as such, will so comply therewith. In the event a building or structure is to be moved from the city to some point outside of the boundaries thereof, the provisions, with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for proposed alterations to such building, may be disregarded.

F.    Bond.

1.    Before a permit is issued under this section, the party applying therefor shall deliver a bond to the city in a sum, to be fixed by the director, and which shall not be less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The bond is to be executed by a corporate surety or two personal sureties to be approved by the director conditioned upon, among other things, the indemnification to the city for any costs or expenses incurred by it in connection with any claims for damages to any persons or property and the payment of any judgment, together with the costs of expenses incurred by the municipality in connection therewith, arising out of the removal of the building or structure for which the permit is issued.

2.    Unless the director, upon investigation, shall find it to be a fact that the excavation exposed by the removal of such building or structure from its foundation shall not be so close to a public thoroughfare as to permit the accidental falling therein of travelers to the location, nature and physical characteristics of the premises and the falling into such excavation by children under twelve (12) years of age unlikely, the bond required by subsection (F)(1) of this section shall be further conditioned upon the permittee erecting adequate barriers and, within forty-eight (48) hours, filling in such excavation or adopting and employing such other means, devices or methods approved by the director and reasonably adopted or calculated to prevent the occurrences set forth herein.

3.    The director may require security different than or in addition to that specified in subsection (F)(1) of this section, as more fully described in Section 15.04.750.

G.    Letter of Credit. The director shall require a letter of credit, based on the city format, for the following:

1.    Site restoration of the vacated site;

2.    Abandonment of all water wells per state code, if necessary;

3.    Grading, topsoil and seeding of the site to be occupied.

H.    Insurance. The director shall require, in addition to the bond above indicated, public liability insurance covering injury to one person in the sum of not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) and for one accident in a sum not less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), together with property damage insurance in a sum not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or such other coverage deemed necessary.

I.    Plan Commission Approval.

1.    No permit under this section shall be issued unless it has been found as a fact by at least a majority vote of the plan commission based on the following criteria:

a.    The building will not be at variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the buildings already constructed or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood;

b.    The building will be in character with the applicable zoning district established by the city;

c.    The building shall not cause a substantial depreciation in the property values of the district neighborhood;

C.    Utilities.

1.    Definitions. For the purposes of this subsection, “abandonment” or “abandon” means, in the case of a sanitary sewer lateral, excavating and detaching the lateral on a property at the city’s sewer main or other approved method as determined by the city engineer; in the case of a water service lateral, excavating and detaching the lateral on a property at the city’s public water main or other approved method as determined by the city engineer.

For the purposes of this subsection, “disconnect” or “disconnection” means, in the case of a sanitary sewer lateral, terminating the lateral on the property from the city’s sewer main at the property or easement boundary line with a temporary watertight cap; in the case of a water service lateral, excavating and detaching the lateral on the property at the property line/curb stop, or another location at the city’s discretion, to ensure that an air gap sufficient to prevent cross-connection and contamination is present.

2.    The owner of the building or structure to be razed or his/her agent shall notify all utilities having service connections within the building or structure such as water, electric, gas, sewer and other connections in accordance with all applicable regulations of such utilities. The owner shall abandon sanitary sewer and water service laterals unless the owner intends to reuse the sanitary sewer or water service laterals for a new building or structure and has the building plans for the new building or structure filed with the city at the time of the raze permit application. The owner shall secure an excavation permit and plumbing permit issued under Chapter 12.18 and Section 15.12.070 to abandon or disconnect sewer and water services and shall complete such abandonment or disconnection per the specifications of the city engineer and plumbing inspector. All disconnections of sanitary sewer laterals shall require the owner to submit a visual recording of the lateral to the city engineer and plumbing inspector for inspection.

3.    A permit to demolish or raze a building or structure shall not be issued until it is ascertained that service connections and appurtenant equipment, such as meters and regulators, have been removed, abandoned, disconnected, visually recorded, and/or sealed and plugged in a safe manner. With the city engineer and director’s approval, the director may issue a raze permit prior to the visual recording of a sewer lateral if the owner signs an agreement to submit the visual recording to the city within six months, complete all necessary repairs within ninety (90) days of receiving notice to repair, posts a letter of credit or cash deposit with the city in an amount to visually record and facilitate any necessary repairs or removal as determined by the city engineer, and grants the city a temporary easement to perform the visual recording, removal, and/or securing of the sewer lateral and sewer main per the specifications of the city engineer and plumbing inspector in the event the owner fails to complete such work. The city attorney shall approve any letter of credit and easement.

D.    Excavations shall be filled with structural fill to match lot grade within five days of removal of the structure. Any such excavation shall be protected with such fences, barriers and/or lights as the director may deem necessary.

15.04.340 Fences.

A.    Legislative Purpose. This section is enacted with express reference to the Brookfield concept and it is intended that the Brookfield concept, as defined in this code, be adhered to with respect to all matters subject to this section. The intent of this section is to place restrictions on fencing so the city of Brookfield may maintain the open spaces and vistas which are desired as part of the Brookfield concept.

B.    Fences Regulated. Fences shall not be constructed within the city, except as hereinafter provided:

1.    Decorative Fences. Decorative fences which are more than fifty (50) percent open and less than four feet in height such as picket fences and split rail fences and wrought iron used for ornamental purposes. A chain link fence shall not be considered a decorative fence within the intent of this subsection.

2.    Swimming Pool or Tennis Court Fences. Fences in connection with swimming pools or private tennis courts, as described in Sections 15.04.330 and 15.04.360, respectively, which are part of the approved swimming pool or tennis court plan.

3.    Privacy or Patio Fences. A fence designed to provide privacy for a patio, not over six feet in height nor more than twenty (20) feet in total length, shall be allowed, provided a building permit is obtained from the director and such fence is located in the rear yard.

4.    Screening Fences. Fences, including garden walls, required of business or industry for screening purposes, under other provisions of this code, shall require a permit after processing under subsections (D) and (E) of this section.

5.    Pet Enclosures. One pet enclosure not in excess of one hundred (100) square feet or more than six feet in height. Such enclosure shall be in the rear yard and not closer than twenty (20) feet to the lot line.

Fences to enclose an area in the rear yard for a children activity area or a garden, not in excess of six feet in height and enclosing not in excess of five hundred (500) square feet of the rear yard. Fence must have no greater visual impact than a chain link fence.

7.    Nonresidential Fences. Fences located between nonresidential and residential or public lands. The preferred method of buffering residential or public lands from the impacts of nonresidential uses is the installation of naturalized landscape features and/or the enhancement of existing natural landscape features. The plan commission may review requests for the installation of fences to serve similar purposes and shall determine whether the preferred method of natural landscape features is capable of accomplishing the buffering goals, and if not, then shall consider whether the erection of a fence or other alternatives should be pursued. The expressed goal of the applicant as well as the location, design, impact on the neighborhood, construction materials to be used, architecture, and the relationship of the proposed fence with the adjacent building or landscaping are all factors which will be considered when applications for nonresidential fences are reviewed. If approved, the fence shall be designed in such a way as to be architecturally compatible with the nonresidential building and be of uniform appearance as determined through the development review processes outlined in the city zoning code.

8.    I-94 and Train Tracks Corridors. Residential fencing along the I-94 corridor and/or abutting train tracks shall conform to the following:

Plants shall be spaced so that in ten years’ time they have matured into a continuous vegetative screen. Suitable plants include upright evergreens, coniferous trees and shrubs such as honeysuckle, lilac or multiflora rose.

9.    All fencing must be located on the subject property. No fencing shall be allowed in the right-of-way area.

10.    Residential Fences. Fences located between residential property and commercial or industrial property in order to screen the residents from unsightly property, noise, business activities, or similar situations that detract from the quiet enjoyment of residential property. Residential property owners shall be permitted, at their own expense, to construct a fence to screen the situations described above. The right of a residential property to maintain such a fence shall cease upon a change of the neighboring commercial or industrial property to residential property. The fence shall conform to the following:

a.    Location. Fences shall be placed in a manner that preserves existing vegetation and natural screening.

b.    Design. Only natural materials such as wood stockade, board on board or masonry materials shall be used.

11.    Special Needs Residents.

a.    For this subsection, “special needs” means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of an individual; a record of such impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment. “Major life activities” includes seeing, hearing, learning, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and brain functions, but is purposefully not as broad as the definition found in § 42 USC 12102, Definition of Disability.

b.    The director shall issue a fence permit for properties where a special needs individual resides who has a documented need for an enclosed yard area, subject to the provisions of this subsection and subsections (C), (D), (F), and (I) of this section. All fence permits shall automatically expire five years after issuance, but shall expire sooner on the date that the need for the fenced yard no longer exists, the special needs individual no longer resides there, or the property is sold. Upon expiration, the fence shall be removed within fifteen (15) days, unless the permit is renewed or another permit under this subsection is issued for the property.

c.    To apply for a fence permit under this subsection, an applicant shall provide independent medical certification that a resident of the property has special needs and their safety, health, and welfare would benefit from an enclosed yard area and an executed fence removal covenant from the property owner. The covenant will be recorded by the city at the applicant’s cost, obligating the property owner to remove the fence upon the expiration of the permit. The permit renewal process shall be the same as the application process, including a permit fee, except the removal covenant will not be required.

ii.    Materials and Design. Natural materials such as wood or masonry are preferred, although vinyl or composite fencing may be used.

iii.    Color. Colors must be natural, earthen tones, unless the vinyl or composite fence brand is only available in white in which case, information from the manufacturer on lack of color availability must be submitted with the application.

iv.    Height. The fence shall not be more than six feet high.

v.    Landscaping. Fences shall be screened by trees and shrubs located outside the fence to cover at least fifty (50) percent of the fence. If existing vegetation does not provide this screening, plants shall be added outside the enclosed space. Plants shall be spaced so that in ten (10) years’ time they will have matured to meet this requirement. Suitable trees and shrubs are upright evergreens and others that will provide screening year round.

C.    Prohibited Fences. No person shall install:

1.    An electric, razor, hog or chicken wire fence. No part of a fence structure may have these materials.

2.    A fence composed solely of fence posts. Lot line posts shall be permitted at the intersections of lot lines only.

If the fence is located a minimum of five feet from the rear and side property lines, the applicant may submit a survey which is over one year old. Any individual who is issued a permit with a survey which is over one year old shall, as a condition of accepting the permit, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officers and agents from all and any claims in the event that the residential deck is located within an easement, floodplain, drainageway or other similar encumbrance. The survey must accurately portray existing conditions;

4.    Such other items required under Sections 15.04.140 through 15.04.260 as the director may deem applicable;

provided, however, that no permit shall be required for decorative fences described in subsection (B)(1) of this section.

E.    Permit Processing. All permit applications under subsections (B)(4), (B)(8), and (B)(10) of this section shall be referred to the plan commission, which shall pass upon the purpose, appearance, materials, design, location, height, harmony with the principal structure on the subject lot and neighboring structures, and consistency with the stated legislative purpose of this section. If the plan commission approves an application, the director shall issue such a permit.

F.    Setback Areas. Fences or portions thereof within setback areas are prohibited except for those described in subsection (B)(1) of this section. All fencing must be located on the subject property. No fencing shall be allowed in the right-of-way area.

15.04.350 Honey beekeeping permitted.

A.    Definitions. The following definitions will be used in the interpretation and application of this section:

“Abut/abutting” means where any property touches the prospective beekeeper’s property, including spots that touch at only one point like at corners.

“Beekeeper” means a person who places man-made hives on their property for keeping honey bees.

“Colony” means a honey bee family or social unit living together in a hive or other shelter in all stages of life.

“Hive” means a manmade or natural structure housing a colony of honey bees.

“Recreation area” means a playset, sport court, pool, patio, deck, or permanent seating area, gazebo, and similar equipment or structures plus a five-foot perimeter from the recreational item, existing on abutting property at the time a beekeeping permit is applied for.

“Setback” is as defined at Section 17.04.020.

B.    Beekeeping Allowed.

1.    Honey beekeeping is allowed in the city with permission from all abutting property owners of the property where the hive is kept upon issuance of a permit. These provisions do not overrule private covenants or declarations of restrictions that may be applicable to private property. Keeping honey bees in violation of this section is prohibited.

2.    Types of Bees. Bees must be Western honey bee Apis mellifera species only, although of varying ecotypes such as German or black honey bee, Apis mellifera mellifera; Italian honey bee, Apis mellifera ligustica; Carniolan honey bee, Apis melliferacarnica; or Caucasian honey bee, Apis mellifera caucsica. Keeping apis mellifera scutellata (Africanized honey bee) is prohibited.

C.    Location Requirements.

1.    Honey bees may not be kept on a lot less than a one third of an acre (thirteen thousand two hundred (13,200) square feet).

2.    Honey bees may be kept only in R-1 to R-3 zoned districts and on any privately owned, recreationally zoned property.

3.    No hives may be placed in the setback and must be twenty-five (25) feet from the side or back lot lines and fifty (50) feet from any recreation area or principal building on abutting properties.

4.    No hives may be located in front yards. For this subsection the front yard is the area extending across the full width of the lot from a line parallel to the front or main entrance of the principal structure to the base setback line.

5.    Hive entrances must be located so that they do not face the neighboring property’s principal structure or recreation area and that the general flight pattern is in a direction that will minimize honey bee contact with humans and neighboring structures and vehicles.

D.    Permit, Permission, and Inspection Required.

1.    A beekeeper must apply to and be issued a permit by the inspection services department. The applicant must provide a survey to scale that includes the proposed hive location, its distance to property lines, recreation areas and principal structure on abutting properties, and the size of the lot. The applicant may submit a survey which is over a year old; however, the survey must accurately portray existing conditions and if during inspection it is determined it does not, the permit will be revoked and any colonies and hives will be required to be removed immediately.

2.    Neighbor Permission Required.

a.    Prior to applying for a permit, a prospective beekeeper must obtain written permission from the property owners of any single-family home whose property abuts the parcel. Permission must be provided on the city’s form and filed with the application. This requirement does not apply to privately owned parcels zoned recreational.

b.    Neighbor permission may be withdrawn by filing written notice with the department. Permission withdrawal may not be submitted by anyone obtaining abutting property after a permit is issued. If permission is withdrawn, the department will notify the beekeeper in writing, sent via U.S. mail, return receipt requested, that the permit is void and the beekeeper shall have ninety (90) days in which to remove the colony and hive from the date notice is received. If the department receives permission withdrawal notice after August 1st, then the colonies and hives must be removed no later than May 1st of the subsequent year.

c.    Only one property owner signature is required for either permission or permission withdrawal per parcel regardless of the number of persons who may own the property or which property owner, if more than one, gave permission initially.

3.    A beekeeper has one year in which to locate and install any hives from the date the permit is issued. The failure to locate hives on the property in this time period will result in the permit’s expiration. Once a permit has expired, a beekeeper must begin the permit process again from the start, including obtaining neighbor permission.

4.    The beekeeper must notify the department in writing within seven days that the hives have been installed. The department will inspect the property for compliance with this section within forty-five (45) days from notification receipt. If the hives do not comply with this section, the department will issue a written compliance letter and the failure to comply with the notice in the time set forth will result in permit revocation and the colony and hives must be removed immediately. If a beekeeping permit is revoked, a permit shall not be issued to the beekeeper for two years.

5.    The city will maintain a public database on its website with the name and address of all permitted beekeepers.

6.    The permit fee is as set in Section 15.04.780(1).

E.    Other Requirements.

1.    No more than two hives are allowed on the minimum size lot, except that one additional temporary hive for splitting is allowed, prior to its removal to another location or until recombined with existing hives, until no later than October 15th. Additional permanent hives may be allowed at a rate of one per each additional half acre.

2.    A constant supply of water shall be provided for all hives from a source within ten feet of the hive entrance(s) to prevent honey bees from seeking water sources at nearby properties, except when temperatures are below freezing. The source shall include a way for the honey bees to access the water from a solid surface. Water shall be maintained so as not to become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

3.    No beekeeper shall keep honey bee colonies or hives that cause any nuisance, unhealthy conditions, create a public threat or interfere with the normal use and enjoyment of any public property or property of others.

4.    No one may operate a commercial enterprise offering honey bees, honey bee byproducts, or beekeeping supplies unless the operation complies with the home occupation regulations of the zoning district. (Ord. 2538-19 § 1, 2019)

(Ord. 2311-12 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 1819 § 3 (part), 2001; prior code §§ 16.03(1), (2). Formerly 15.12.030, 15.12.040)


15.12.070 Plumbing permits.

A.    Required. No work contemplated by this chapter shall be started until a permit has been issued by the plumbing inspector or his/her authorized agent. No permit shall be required for the elimination of leaks, removing obstructions in waste pipes, or restoring defective valves, faucets and similar appliances to an efficient operating condition.

B.    Plumbers to Be Licensed. All plumbing work shall be done only by a plumber licensed by the state of Wisconsin. The city of Brookfield allows the owner/occupant of a single-family dwelling who has occupied the dwelling for at least thirty (30) days to perform plumbing installation upon such premises. A plumbing permit must be obtained and inspections are required. The plumbing installation shall be performed by the owner/occupant only. No one else shall be permitted to perform such installation unless licensed by the state of Wisconsin as a master plumber. Owners may not install their own plumbing in a new construction home installation.

C.    The licensed master plumber to whom a permit is issued shall be responsible for the proper installation of all plumbing listed in the application; actual installation may be performed by any plumber licensed by the state of Wisconsin and employed by the permit holder or employed by the firm or corporation of which such permit holder is a member, officer or employee.

D.    Permits May Not Be Assigned. The subcontractor or assignee of a licensed master plumber in his employ shall obtain a new permit before performing the work. Two initial fees shall not be charged for the same installation; the first permit shall be cancelled and the fee paid by the first permit holder shall be credited to the subcontractor or assignee if a new permit is issued to him; but the plumbing inspector may refuse to issue a permit to the first permit holder’s subcontractor or assignee for any reason for which refusal would have been justified if the assignee or subcontractor had sought the original permit.

E.    Application. The application shall be in writing upon forms which the plumbing inspector shall provide and shall include the name of the owner and the description of the property on which the work is to be done along with such pertinent information as the plumbing inspector may require and shall state that the property owner and the applicant shall be bound by and subject to the provisions of this chapter.

F.    Issuance, Term, Suspension and Revocation. When the plumbing inspector is satisfied that the work proposed by the applicant can be done in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and after the appropriate fees have been paid to him/her, he/she shall issue the permit. Such permit shall be good for the continuous performance of the work named thereon. A permit shall automatically expire:

1.    When work has not started within three months from the date such permit was issued;

2.    Upon the written request of the person who received the permit;

3.    When work ceases for sixty (60) days without good and reasonable cause for same;

4.    On completion of the work for which it was issued, provided the plumbing inspector may, upon notice, suspend or revoke such permit for violation of the provisions of this chapter.

G.    Restrictions on Issuance.

1.    When the installation of any plumbing occurs contrary to the regulations of this chapter, the plumbing inspector shall issue an order to the violator and/or property owner to remedy the defective work. Failure to comply with the order shall be deemed sufficient reason for withholding future permits, in addition to other penalties provided in this code.

2.    If, after the issuance of a permit, there is an unreasonable delay in the performance of the plumbing work, or if there is a failure to promptly respond to official communications, or a failure to request final inspection, then such acts shall also be deemed sufficient reason for withholding future permits.

H.    Appeals for Failure to Issue—Suspension and Revocation. Any person directly interested who is aggrieved by the decision of the plumbing inspector to refuse to issue a permit or to suspend or revoke such permit or to order work stopped under Section 15.12.060 may obtain review of such determination. (Ord. 2311-12 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 1541 § 1 (part), 1996; prior code §§ 16.04, 16.05. Formerly 15.12.050)

15.12.100 Holding tank guarantees prohibited.

A.    Holding tanks require a state permit that shall be issued only if the applicant files a pumping and transport agreement with the city as a written guarantor. Tanks require a warning device which is either an audible or indoor illuminated alarm, which alarms may malfunction and which do not meet their purpose if activated during times when no one is on the property to respond thereto. Malfunctioning holding tanks are a public health nuisance.

B.    The city will not hereafter be a guarantor to private pumping and transport agreements for holding tanks, except in the case of an existing building with septic tank problems found by the council to be unsolvable, and the council determines that a holding tank is necessary to prevent severe hardship.

B.    Erosion and Other Pollutant Control Requirements. The following requirements shall be met on all sites described in subsection A of this section.

1.    Site Dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by control measures specified in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Stormwater Construction and Post-Construction Technical Standards (in accordance with Chapter NR 151, Wisconsin Administrative Code). If the water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than one hundred (100) microns during dewatering operations, then no control is needed before discharge, except as determined by the inspection services department. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site, adjacent land or receiving channels.

2.    Waste and Material Disposal. All waste and unused building materials, including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials or hazardous materials, shall be properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system.

3.    Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each work day.

4.    Drain Inlet Protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected with a straw bale, filter fabric or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design criteria standards and specifications.

5.    Site Erosion Control. The following criteria apply only to land development or land disturbing activities that result in runoff leaving the site.

a.    Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall be protected as described in subsection (B)(5)(c) of this section. Sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less than 0.5 ft/sec across the disturbed area for the two-year twenty-four (24) hour storm. Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels. For allowable velocities in different types of channels, soil conservation service guidelines shall be followed.

b.    All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time.

c.    Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by meeting either subdivisions (5)(c)(i) and (ii) or (5)(c)(i) and (iii) of this subsection.

i.    Where activities will result in disturbed ground being left inactive for ten or more days, positive controls for keeping all erosion on-site, including such measures as placement of silt fences, hay bales, detention basins, phased construction or stabilization of the disturbed ground with temporary or permanent seeding; temporary or permanent seeding and mulching; sodding or covering with tarps shall be employed to the satisfaction of the city. Seeding without mulch may be allowed if the seeding is started and completed between May 1st and September 15th. If temporary seeding is used, a permanent cover shall also be required as part of the final site stabilization. Seeding or sodding shall be conducted as specified in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Stormwater Construction and Post-Construction Technical Standards (in accordance with Chapter NR 151, Wisconsin Administrative Code) or by inspection services department. Variances from the requirements of this subdivision may be granted by the inspection services department upon application, but only if the applicant’s failure to comply is due to extended periods of rain or other construction delays beyond the control of the responsible party.

ii.    For sites with ten or more acres disturbed at one time or if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more sedimentation basins shall be constructed in addition to other erosion control measures. Each sedimentation basin shall be designed and constructed as specified in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Stormwater Construction and Post-Construction Technical Standards (in accordance with Chapter NR 151, Wisconsin Administrative Code).

iii.    For sites with less than ten acres disturbed at one time, filter fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures shall be placed along all side slope and down slope sides of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes through the site, filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel.

d.    Runoff from sites on slopes of twelve (12) percent or more may require additional or different controls than listed in subdivision (5)(c) of this subsection. Control measures for such slopes shall be approved by the engineering department.

e.    Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material should not be located with a down slope drainage length of less than twenty-five (25) feet to a roadway or drainage channel. Straw bales or filter fence barriers shall be placed immediately on the down slope side of the piles. If remaining for more than thirty (30) days, they shall be stabilized by mulching, vegetative cover, tarps or other means. Where soil or dirt storage piles resulting from in-street utility repairs are located closer than twenty-five (25) feet to a roadway or drainage channel, adequate control measures shall be taken to prevent erodible materials from entering the adjacent ditch or storm sewer system. Stormdrain inlets must be protected with straw bale or other appropriate filtering barriers. If any soil or dirt storage pile described in this subdivision is in existence for more than six months, the filter fabric or straw bales shall be replaced upon orders of the inspection services department.

It is the intent of the common council to regulate the growth of certain regulated vegetation within the city for the following reasons: In exercise of its police power and in recognition of further statutory authority conferred by Section 66.0407, Wisconsin Statutes, the council finds that attractive and well-maintained property will enhance the neighborhoods and city and will provide a suitable environment for increasing aesthetic and property value. The “Brookfield Concept,” as embodied in the Brookfield Municipal Code, Title 15 is to establish and maintain substantial open space around structures for generous light, air, convenience of access, safety from fire and the enhancement of property values. (Ord. 1819 § 3 (part), 2001; Ord. 1655 Part I (part), 1998)


15.24.020 Definitions.

As used in this chapter, the following shall apply:

“Appropriate landscaping” means a minimum of grading and seeding on a vacant residential lot sufficient to comply with Chapter 15.20 of the City of Brookfield Municipal Code (Erosion Control). Commercial, industrial, and other uses must comply with landscape plans approved by the city.

“Brush” means any cut vegetative material, regardless of size.

“Eradicate” means the use of chemicals, cutting, tillage, or any or all of these in effective combination, at such time and in such manner as will effectively prevent regulated vegetation from maturing.

“Regulated vegetation” includes, but is not limited to, noxious weeds consisting of those species defined in Section 8.32.030 of the Brookfield Municipal Code and Section 23.235 of Wisconsin Statutes.

“Turf grass” means grasses commonly used in regularly cut lawns or play areas, such as, but not limited to bluegrass, fescue, and ryegrass blends.

“Wooded area” means any property, whether developed or otherwise, which contains mature tree cover, as determined by the director of inspection services or his/her designee. Wooded areas are not subject to the maintenance requirement of this section. (Ord. 1819 § 3 (part), 2001; Ord. 1655 Part I (part), 1998)


15.24.030 Obligation to eradicate regulated vegetation.

Every person, partnership, or corporation owning, occupying or controlling land located in the city, without regard to its level of development, shall eradicate all “regulated vegetation” thereon. (Ord. 1655 Part I (part), I, 1998)


15.24.040 Maintenance of vacant lots.

A.    A vacant lot is not required to be landscaped until the point where sixty-five (65) percent of the residential or commercial subdivision in which it is located has been developed. A lot is considered developed at the time of final building inspection. Once the sixty-five (65) percent figure is reached, individual land owners are required to mow and provide appropriate landscaping for their lots and shall maintain turf grass at a height not to exceed eight inches. Owners of all vacant lots are required to destroy all regulated vegetation regardless of the degree of development of the subdivision.

B.    Lots in which materials or debris have been illegally dumped by the property owner or others shall be cleaned up within the time limits prescribed by written notice. The time limit contained in the notice shall be for not less than five days nor more than thirty (30) days. The property owner is responsible for the removal of regulated vegetation, materials and/or debris from the site.

C.    If a property owner fails to comply with the requirements of this section, the director of inspection services, or his designee, after first giving at least five days but not more than thirty (30) days written notice by mail to said owner, is authorized to perform or have performed the required maintenance. The cost of any such maintenance shall be charged against the owner of the property and shall become a lien upon the property as a special charge in accordance with the Wisconsin Statutes or a municipal citation may be issued to the property owner pursuant to Section 1.12.010 of the Brookfield Municipal Code.

D.    The provisions of this section do not apply to government owned properties designated as open space in the city’s park and open space plan or government owned properties that have a conservation easement upon them. (Ord. 1898 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1655 Part I (part), II, 1998)


15.24.050 Maintenance of developed properties.

A.    Landscaping, plantings and other decorative surface treatments, including common species of grass, shall be installed and maintained to present an attractive appearance. Turf grasses shall be maintained to a height not to exceed eight inches in length. Dead tree or bush limbs shall be removed from the property when they pose a safety concern (as determined by the director of inspection services or his/her designee). Brush shall be removed from the property unless it is being used for composting. Plantings shall be maintained so as to enhance the appearance and value of the neighborhood and the city and shall comply with all provisions of the Brookfield Municipal Code. An exception to these requirements is that portion of a lot which is a wooded area of mature tree growth.

B.    Duty of Abutting Property Owners.

1.    The abutting property owner shall maintain the area between the curb and sidewalk and shall maintain the right-of-way area between their property line and the street pavement.

Noxious weeds as defined in Section 8.32.030 of this code shall be destroyed as provided by said section and the Wisconsin Statutes. The only exception to the maintenance provisions shall be the determination of the director of inspection services that the physical characteristics of the right-of-way make said maintenance hazardous for the property owner.

2.    The physical or other characteristics that the director of inspection services shall consider in making this determination with respect to an exception from the maintenance requirements for ditch areas shall include, but not be limited to, slope, depth at bottom, and side structure. The presence of the following shall be deemed hazardous for maintenance by the property owner and shall be maintained by the city:

Slope of ditch is steeper than 2:1 and

Depth of ditch is greater than 3 feet

3.    If a property owner fails to comply with the requirements of this section, the director of inspection services, or his designee, after first giving at least five days but not more than thirty (30) days’ written notice by mail to said owner, is authorized to perform or have performed the required maintenance. The cost of any such maintenance shall be charged against the owner of the abutting property and shall become a lien upon the abutting property as a special charge in accordance with the Wisconsin Statutes or a municipal citation may be issued to the property owner pursuant to Section 1.12.010 of the Brookfield Municipal Code. (Ord. 1655 Part I (part), III, 1998)


15.24.060 Natural landscaping regulations.

Any owner or lessee, with the consent of the owner, of land which is zoned residential in the city may choose to natural landscape their property subject to the following regulations:

A.    Noxious weeds, as defined in Wisconsin State Statutes shall not be permitted on property within the city.

B.    No vegetation (except trees) shall exceed a maximum height of thirty (30) inches, as measured from the road edge to the top of the vegetation, in the location designated as the vision triangle or in the city right-of-way of road intersections. Trees in the vision triangle or in city right-of-way at road intersections shall be trimmed to a height of sixty (60) inches, as measured from the road edge to the bottom branches, to allow for a clear view of oncoming traffic. The City Engineer shall have the authority to modify these dimensions as required by local conditions to ensure the safety of vehicular travel in the area. A vision triangle is also referred to as vision setback or vision setback line and has the same definition as contained set forth in Section 17.04.020.

C.    Naturally landscaped properties shall be maintained in a healthy and vigorous condition, as opposed to one of impairment and decline. Properties shall not be unmanaged or overgrown in ways that may adversely affect human health or safety.

Chapter 15.28 IMPACT FEES

Sections:

15.28.010    Impact fees.


15.28.010 Impact fees.

A.    Fee Option.

1.    Parks and Recreational Transportation Trails. If the proposed subdivision or certified survey map does not encompass a proposed park or recreational transportation trail, a fee for the acquisition and development of public parks and recreational transportation trails reasonably necessary to accommodate the new development shall deposited with the Department of Building Inspection for payment to the city treasurer within fourteen (14) days of issuance of a building permit in the amounts shown below for each proposed dwelling unit within the plat or certified survey map. Fees paid to the city treasurer under the provisions of this section shall be placed in a nonlapsing separate, segregated, interest-bearing account for city parks and shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and the special fund shall be used exclusively for the acquisition and development of parks and recreational transportation trails within the city.

a.    Park and Recreational Transportation Trail Fee Amounts; Zones. For purposes of determining park and recreational transportation trail fee amounts, the city identifies zones corresponding to land sections as identified in a map entitled “City of Brookfield Land Section Map.” This map is adopted by reference within Section 17.100.120 entitled: “Development impact fee administration.”

b.    Park and recreational transportation trail fees for all land sections in the city except Sections 5 and 13 shall be seven hundred forty-seven dollars ($747.00) for each single-family housing unit and five hundred twenty-one dollars ($521.00) for each multiple-family housing unit.

c.    Park and recreational transportation trail fees for lands in Land Section 5 shall be eight hundred ninety-one dollars ($891.00) for each single-family housing unit. (No multiple-family development is planned in land Section 5).

d.    Park and recreational transportation trail fees for lands in Land Section 13 shall be eight hundred seventy dollars ($870.00) for each single-family housing unit and six hundred six dollars ($606.00) for each multiple-family housing unit.

2.    Wetland Preservation. If the subdivision, subject property, or certified survey map does not encompass a wetland or if the city plan commission does not require wetlands to be shown as an outlot in the subdivision or certified survey map, a fee for the acquisition of wetlands shall be deposited with the Department of Building Inspection for payment to the city treasurer within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of a building permit in the amount of ninety-six dollars ($96.00) for each proposed dwelling unit within the plat or certified survey map for residential subdivisions; and four dollars and nineteen cents ($4.19) for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area, or fraction thereof, in nonresidential developments. Fees paid to the city treasurer for wetland preservation under the provisions of this section shall be placed in a nonlapsing separate, segregated, interest-bearing account for wetland preservation and shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and the special fund shall be used exclusively for the acquisition of wetlands within the city.

The wetland preservation fee is intended, in part, to provide for the acquisition of one thousand six hundred fifty-three (1,653) acres of privately owned wetlands in accordance with the recommendations of the city park and open space plan. The fee for commercial development is intended to require these developments to contribute towards open space preservation for community-wide stormwater management purposes.

B.    Bikeway Program. The council adopted a “Bikeway Master Plan for the City of Brookfield” on July 19, 1988, by Resolution 3764. The bikeway plan determined that a comprehensive system of bikeways was necessary to enhance bicycle safety, use and enjoyment, and to contribute to the quality of life in the city. Accordingly, each subdivider or developer of land shall develop bikeways as provided for in the bikeway plan.

1.    Whenever a bikeway designated on the city’s bikeway master plan is encompassed in or adjacent to a tract of land for which a subdivision or certified survey map is proposed, the subdivider shall construct all portions of the bikeway shown on the bikeway master plan that is encompassed on or adjacent to said lands in accordance with established city specifications.

2.    If the subdivision, subject property, or certified survey map does not encompass a bikeway or is not adjacent to a bikeway, a fee for the development of bikeways shall be paid to the city treasurer within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of a building permit in the amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each proposed dwelling unit within the plat or certified survey map for residential subdivisions; and twenty dollars ($20.00) for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area, or fraction thereof, in nonresidential developments. Public site fees collected for bikeways by the city treasurer under the provisions of this subsection shall be placed in a nonlapsing separate, segregated, interest-bearing account for bikeways and shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and the special fund shall be used exclusively for the development of bikeways within the city.

3.    As a form of security that the required bikeway will be completed, or where the plan commission determines that the construction of the bikeway should be delayed, the subdivider shall pay an amount equal to the bikeway fee set forth in subsection (B)(2) of this section, to be used as security to ensure bikeway construction. Where the fee has been paid for security purposes, an itemization of the bikeway construction costs shall be presented to the director of public works. The deposited fees shall be returned to the subdivider in full if the construction costs are equal to the amount of the deposited fee. The cost per lineal foot of bikeway shall not exceed a maximum established annually by the board of public works. If the cost is less than the deposit, the difference shall be placed in the special fund for bikeway development. If the construction costs exceed the amount of the deposited fee, the city shall pay the difference, not to exceed the established maximum cost per lineal foot, to the subdivider. The annual maximum cost per lineal foot for bikeway construction shall be computed by the board of public works using prevailing cost for such construction in the area of the city.

a.    Subdividers must pay a bikeway fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per lot for residential developments and twenty dollars ($20.00) per one thousand (1,000) square feet for nonresidential developments. The bikeway fee applies to both residential and nonresidential developments. Where the development includes a portion of bikeway designated on the bikeway master plan, the developer shall construct the bikeway adjacent to or within the development as shown in the bikeway master plan. The bikeway fee is intended, in part, to provide for the construction of one hundred eleven (111) miles of bikeway in accordance with the recommendations of the city bikeway master plan.

16.08.010 Compliance with design principles.

The subdivider or his agent shall comply with the general principles of design and minimum requirements for the layout of subdivisions set forth in Chapter 16.16 and with the provisions of Chapter 16.20 establishing minimum design standards and procedures for the installation of subdivision improvements of this chapter, and in every case shall pursue the following procedure.

Any owner or representative of the owner of land located within the corporate limits or within the extraterritorial plan approval jurisdiction shall first submit to the plan commission or its representative such information as may be required by the plan commission, pursuant to Chapter 16.12, to describe or outline the existing conditions of the site and the proposed development thereof. The applicant shall be supplied with pertinent information on plan commission requirements not herein contained, such as elements of the master plan. (Ord. 2102-07 § 1 (part), 2007)


16.08.030 Preliminary plat.

A.    Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision which shall conform with the provisions set forth in Chapters 16.12 and 16.16 and shall file with the city clerk an application, in writing, for the approval of the preliminary plat, accompanied by such copies of the preliminary plat as shall be required by the city clerk to comply with Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes.

The 2035 comprehensive plan discourages land splits of previously platted residential lots. In the case of this subsection, “platted residential lots” includes lots created via subdivision plat, certified survey map, assessor’s plat and unrecorded subdivisions. However, the city may consider a land split of a platted residential lot if the applicant can show that, in the opinion of the plan commission, the land split adheres to the intent and objectives of the 2035 comprehensive plan through an assessment of the following standards by the plan commission:

1.    The land split will not negatively impact the integrity, composition and character of its surrounding neighborhood such as, but not limited to, a material and detrimental departure from the prevailing lot configuration of the surrounding neighborhood, as defined in subsection (A)(2) of this section;

2.    The land split is a logical division of property in relationship to the average size and width of existing lots in the surrounding neighborhood, even if the average size and width of the lots contained within the surrounding neighborhood exceed current minimum dimensions required in the subdivision and zoning codes, i.e., this subsection supersedes other provisions of the subdivision and zoning codes for the purpose of the consideration of land splits of platted residential lots; and

3.    The land split would not result in the deterioration of any natural environment such as a wetland or upland woods, protected under the provisions of the zoning code, as determined by expert opinion, the costs of such review to be borne by the applicant; and

4.    The land split otherwise complies with other provisions of the subdivision code and standards of the zoning code, except as noted in this subsection.

 

The plan commission shall make a written determination that the land split complies with the above standards.

B.    The preliminary plat shall be checked as to its conformity with Brookfield’s 2035 comprehensive plan and the principal standards and requirements set forth in this chapter and appendices thereto and copies of said plat will be referred, in the case of subdivisions but not land splits, to the governmental authorities outside the city specified in Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes.

C.    After review of the preliminary plat and negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of public improvements which will be required under Chapter 16.20 of this title, the council shall, within ninety (90) days of its submission, approve, approve conditionally or reject the plat. As part of its action, the council will consider the recommendation of the plan commission.

D.    The subdivider shall be notified, in writing, of any conditions of approval or the reasons for rejection.

E.    Approval of the preliminary plat and the subdivision improvement plans and specifications shall entitle the subdivider to final approval of the layout shown by such plat if the final plat conforms substantially to the plat and conditions of approval have been met and complies with all city ordinances.

F.    At the times designated, the subdivider shall pay the following fees to the city:

1.    Filing Fee. At the filing of the preliminary plat a filing fee specified in Section 3.28.010(FF).

2.    Review Fee. The subdivider will be billed an engineering review fee specified in Section 3.28.010(KK).

3.    Inspection and Miscellaneous Costs. From time to time, as billed by the city, the developer shall pay the actual cost to the city for such inspection as the city engineer deems necessary to assure that the construction of the required public improvements is in compliance with the specifications and ordinances of the city or any other competent governmental authority and shall pay the costs of any legal, administrative or fiscal work which may be undertaken by the city in order to assure such compliance. Legal work shall include the drafting of a subdivider’s agreement between the city and the subdivider, setting forth the responsibilities of each party with regard to the construction of improvements. (Ord. 2221-10 § 3, 2010; Ord. 2102-07 § 1 (part), 2007)


16.08.040 Subdivision improvements, plans and specifications.

A.    As soon after the approval of the preliminary plat as practicable, or sooner if the subdivider so prefers, the subdivider shall file, in writing with the city clerk, two complete sets of the plans and specifications for the construction of subdivision improvements required in conformity with Chapter 16.20.

B.    The construction plans and specifications shall be checked by the city engineer for conformity to the preliminary plat and the principles and provisions set forth in this chapter.

C.    The city engineer shall, as soon as practical, but in any event within ninety (90) days of its submission, give approval, approve with conditions or reject the proposed subdivision improvements.

Upon approval of both the preliminary plat and plans and specifications for the required subdivision improvements and the issuance of any permits by the city and the state which may be required, the subdivider may either:

A.    Construct and install the required subdivision improvements; or

B.    Upon obtaining written approval of the plan commission, post with the city cash, negotiable securities, or other security running to the city, approved by the city attorney to assure the satisfactory installation of the improvements and survey monuments required by Chapter 16.20. The bond shall equal one hundred ten (110) percent of the city engineer’s estimate of the cost of such improvements, monuments and the engineering and other fees to be paid by the developer in accordance with Section 16.08.030(F)(3).

If the subdivider posts a surety bond or other security, it shall have good and sufficient surety therein and be approved by the mayor and the council. The subdivider shall execute a subdivider’s agreement with the city in a form satisfactory to the city attorney and the city engineer reciting the obligations for which the deposit or bond shall be security. The agreement may include the obligation of the city, if any, to reimburse the developer for possible oversize design of his improvements as provided by this chapter. In addition:

1.    No occupancy permit shall be issued for any structure in the proposed subdivision until the improvements have been installed and accepted by the city unless the owner signs a waiver in a form approved by the city attorney;

16.08.060 Final plat.

A.    Upon either:

1.    Completion of all improvements, the tender of waiver of liens therefor, and the payment of all costs incurred by the city which are to be reimbursed hereunder; or

2.    The posting of cash, negotiable securities or surety bond as required by this chapter;

the subdivider shall submit to the city clerk the final plat and such copies thereof as shall be required, provided that the final plat shall be submitted within twenty-four (24) months of the approval of the preliminary plat. If the final plat is not submitted within twenty-four (24) months after the last required approval of the preliminary plat, the plan commission may refuse to approve the final plat.

B.    The city clerk shall forthwith forward the plat to the plan commission and shall forward the necessary copies of the plat to the director of the planning function of the department of resource development as required by Section 236.12, Wisconsin Statutes. The plan commission shall refer the final plat to the city engineer for review. If found satisfactory, the plat will be returned to the plan commission together with a two-fold certificate showing the following:

1.    The technical details of the plat itself have been checked and found satisfactory;

2.    That all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed, in case these are to be completed by the subdivider instead of furnishing cash, negotiable securities or surety bond as permitted under Section 16.08.050 and Chapter 16.20.

C.    The plan commission shall refer the final plat with its recommendations to the council within thirty (30) days of its submission unless the time is extended by the council. The council shall approve or reject the final plat within sixty (60) days of its submission to the city clerk unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. Reasons for rejection shall be stated in the minutes of the council meeting, or a copy thereof, or a written statement of such reasons shall be supplied the subdivider.

D.    The plat shall be recorded in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 236, Wisconsin Statutes. (Ord. 2102-07 § 1 (part), 2007)

The preliminary survey map shall be reviewed by the plan commission for recommendation to the council. The council shall approve, approve conditionally or reject the preliminary survey map. The fee specified in Section 3.28.010(GG) shall be required at the time of submittal. The subdivider will also be billed an engineering department review fee as specified in Section 3.28.010(KK).

B.    Final Survey Map. The final survey map in the form of a certified survey map shall be submitted to the director of community development and reviewed by the plan commission for recommendation to the council. The council shall approve, approve conditionally or reject the final survey map. The certified survey map shall comply with the provisions of Section 236.34, Wisconsin Statutes, and shall be recorded with the register of deeds for Waukesha County after approval of the common council within six months of the final approving action of the council and no more than two years after council approval of the preliminary survey map.

1.    Such certified survey map shall describe the entire lands involved in the process of division, provided, however, where the division results in a residual parcel in excess of three acres not intended for immediate sale or other conveyance, the engineer may waive the requirement for inclusion of the residual parcel in which case a supplementary map of reasonable accuracy shall be attached showing the relationship of the residual parcel to the parcels being divided.

2.    Prior to approval by the director of community development or his or her designee of a final certified survey map, the applicant shall pay to the city a fee for checking and verifying the map, a fee as specified in Section 3.28.010(HH). No application fee is required for certified survey maps for single-family residential uses that do not create a new parcel or lot, but payment of the actual fees for recording, as determined by the director of community development, shall be required.

B.    The street layout of a subdivision shall be in general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas in the entire neighborhood. The streets shall be designed and located in relation to existing and officially planned streets, to topographical conditions and natural terrain features such as streams and existing tree growth, to public convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets. All streets shall be designed consistent with the city’s Public Infrastructure and Development Handbook.

C.    All streets in a subdivision abutting a state or county highway shall meet all the requirements of the state or county regulations pertaining thereto.

D.    Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a public street so designated on the master street plan, adopted by the plan commission, such part of such street shall be platted by the subdivision at the location and width indicated on the plan.

E.    Street Classification.

1.    Major streets shall be those having inter-city or regional importance and shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of major streets and highways and shall be of such right-of-way width as may be required for the construction of an urban-type pavement section, provided, however, the right-of-way shall not be of a width less than one hundred twenty (120) feet.

2.    Secondary streets shall be interneighborhood and shall be properly related to the mass transit system, to special traffic generating from facilities such as schools, churches and shopping centers, to population densities and to the major streets into which they feed. The dedicated right-of-way widths shall be of such a width as to provide adequate space for the design of an urban type street section; provided, however, in no case shall the right-of-way width be less than ninety (90) feet.

3.    Collector and minor local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and sewer systems, and to require the minimum amount of street to provide convenient safe access to property. Right-of-way width shall be of such a width to provide the necessary areas for the design of an urban-type street section, provided, however, no minor street right-of-way shall be less than sixty (60) feet. A minor street used as a frontage street may have a minimum right-of-way width of fifty (50) feet.

F.    Provision shall be made so that all proposed streets shall have a direct connection with or be continuous and in line with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect.

G.    Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the plan commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. Cul-de-sacs and deadend streets are to be minimized but may be approved when necessitated by topography or environmental features.

H.    Street Names. New street names shall not duplicate the names of existing streets within the city and within towns and municipalities adjacent to the city, except for streets that are continuations of others already in existence and named which shall bear the name of the existing streets.

I.    Reserve Strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be encouraged where their control is definitely placed in the city under conditions approved by the plan commission.

J.    Half Streets. Where a half street is adjacent to the subdivision, the other half of the street shall be dedicated by the subdivider.

K.    Intersections.

1.    Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of thirty (30) feet or of a greater radius where the plan commission considers it necessary.

2.    Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous.

3.    Sight distances shall be provided and maintained for intersections of new subdivision streets with existing streets consistent with the minimum sight distances per AASHTO standards.

L.    Alleys.

1.    Alleys may be provided in commercial and industrial districts, or other definite and assured provisions shall be made for service access such as off-street loading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.

2.    Alleys shall not be approved in residential areas unless necessary because of topography or other exceptional circumstances.

3.    The width of alleys shall be not less than thirty (30) feet.

4.    Deadend alleys are prohibited.

(Ord. 2102-07 § 1 (part), 2007)

A.    The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but block length in residential areas shall not exceed one thousand three hundred (1,300) feet nor have less than sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth between street lines.

B.    Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than fifteen (15) feet wide, and public utility easements not less than that required in Section 16.16.050 may be required by the plan commission through the center of blocks more than nine hundred (900) feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and to better facilitate the master plan for water and sewer utility services.

C.    Lots in General.

1.    The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated.

2.    Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the zoning code. In addition, no lot, including lots on a cul-de-sac, shall have a lot width less than one hundred thirty (130) feet at the fifty (50) foot setback line or a lot depth of less than one hundred thirty (130) feet measured from the street frontage. In the case of corner lots, the minimum lot depth shall be measured from the narrowest street frontage. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or radial to the right-of-way line of the street or cul-de-sac on which the lot faces.

3.    Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated, as required in the zoning code.

4.    Residential lots, fronting on major streets and highways, should be platted with extra depth or reserve strips to permit generous distances between the buildings and such traffic ways.

5.    Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A proportion of two and one-half to one shall normally be considered as a desirable maximum for lot widths of one hundred (100) feet or more.

6.    In determining the minimum lot areas under this chapter and to meet the zoning code requirements, the following conditions must be met:

a.    Ninety (90) percent of the minimum lot area shall be at least two feet above the approximate high water elevation of any lake or stream affecting the area.

b.    Eighty (80) percent of the minimum lot area shall be at least three feet above the highest ground water level, as estimated by the subdivider or his agent from soil boring test data.

c.    Such building sites shall meet the requirements of Sections 17.136.010 and 17.88.230.

D.    Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit full building setbacks on both streets as required by applicable provisions of the zoning code.

E.    Every lot shall front or abut on a public street. Lots with an access only to existing private streets shall be permitted only with plan commission approval.

F.    Lots at right angles to each other should be avoided wherever possible, especially in residential areas.

G.    Absent a public interest, side lot lines shall be at right angles or radial to street lines.

H.    In case a tract is subdivided into parcels containing one or more acres, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the resubdivision of any parcels into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the zoning code.

I.    Lots shall follow municipal boundary lines whenever practicable, rather than cross them.

J.    Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.

K.    Lots shall be comprised of the minimal number of lot lines practical and should generally not exceed four sides unless there is a public interest. (Ord. 2102-07 § 1 (part), 2007)


16.16.050 Easements.

A.    Utility easements shall be provided at the rear of all residential lots and along the side lot lines where required to accommodate utilities (i.e., natural gas, telephone, electric, cable TV) that cannot be placed in the right-of-way.

16.16.070 Landscaping requirements.

A.    Findings. The council hereby finds that street-yard landscaping of all new one- and two-family residential subdivisions which abut upon major or secondary streets and for all new multifamily and nonresidential subdivisions and development which abut upon any street is for the good of the public health and safety and, therefore, is an improvement required from the subdivider or developer.

B.    Definitions. The following definitions apply in this section:

“Department” means the community development department.

C.    Landscape Standards. The landscape standards set forth in the most recent edition of the Residential Development Landscape Standards and in the most recent edition of the Site Development Standards for Nonresidential Uses are adopted by reference and made a part hereof. Copies are available on the city’s website or for purchase in the department. If any provision of the Brookfield Municipal Code conflicts or is inconsistent with the standards, the provisions of the code shall apply.

D.    Landscape Plan. Prior to the approval of a subdivision, plat, or certified survey map, the subdivider shall submit to the department three copies of a landscape plan completed to the same scale as the plat or map in compliance with the standards and code. The plan commission shall review the plan for compliance with the standards and code and approve, approve with modifications, or reject the plan.

E.    Financial Security and Easement. If the subdivider has not fully installed the landscaping at the time of common council approval of the final plat or certified survey map, the subdivider shall comply with the following:

1.    Installation. To secure installation of the landscaping, the subdivider of less than five parcels shall deposit with the city a letter of credit or cash; the subdivider of five or more parcels shall deposit with the city a letter of credit, cash, bond, or a combination thereof. The amount of the aforementioned security shall be as set forth in Section 3.28.010(R), minus the value of landscaping completed to date and/or any credit for existing and qualified landscaping based on current landscape installation costs for material and labor. The city attorney shall approve any bonds or letters of credit submitted. The amount of the security shall remain in force until installation is completed and approved by the department, but may be reduced upon substantial completion to an amount equal to the total cost to complete any uncompleted landscaping plus ten percent of the total cost of the completed improvements.

2.    Temporary Easement. The property owner shall grant to the city or its authorized agents a temporary access easement to enable it to perform the landscape installation if the subdivider fails to comply with the time requirement set forth in this section or as extended by the plan commission or the city receives notification of the expiration or cancellation of the security. The easement may not terminate until the landscaping is fully installed and approved by the department. The city attorney shall approve any terms and conditions of the easement.

F.    Time for Installation. All landscaping shall be installed no later than one year from the date the common council approves the final plat or final certified survey map, unless the plan commission grants an extension. If the date of final site approval occurs between September 30th and May 1st, the subdivider shall automatically be granted an extension beyond the initial one-year period until the next occurrence of June 1st.

G.    Enforcement. Upon completion of the landscape installation, the subdivider shall notify the department so that it can inspect the installation. If inspection reveals that the landscaping installation is fully completed and meets the requirements of this section, the department will issue an installation certificate and authorize the release of the security required in this section. If the subdivider does not comply with the landscape installation per the time required by this section, the city or its authorized agents may install the landscaping and deduct the same from the security required in this section.

The total structural repairs or alterations to a building which does not conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located shall not, during its life, exceed fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the building unless permanently changed to a conforming use.

E.    Special Exceptions for Certain Nonconforming Uses. Subject to Section 17.08.060, a special exception may be granted to an existing legal nonconforming use by the council upon petition of the owner where such use is determined to be not adverse to the public health, safety and welfare; would not conflict with the spirit or intent of this title or would not be otherwise detrimental to the community and particularly the surrounding neighborhood. Such special exception status shall be granted only after recommendation of the plan commission following a public hearing. The procedure for petition and hearing shall be as prescribed for a zoning change. A petition for a special exception shall be filed with the department of community development along with proof of payment of the fee and costs specified in Section 3.28.010(E). (Ord. 1993-04 §§ 1, 2, 2004; Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1912-03 § 2 (part), 2003; Ord. 1725 § 2 (part), 2000; prior code § 17.19)


17.08.050 Prior permit.

A.    Construction Permitted. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size or designated use of any building or part thereof for which a building permit has been issued before August 1, 1961, and the construction of which shall have been substantially started within six months from the date of such permit and diligently carried on.

B.    Subsequently Nonconforming. Any such use which does not conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located shall, however, subsequently be considered a legal nonconforming use. (Prior code § 17.20)


17.08.060 Discretionary approvals and special exceptions.

A.    Approval Required. Where certain uses and situations are of such special nature or their effect is so dependent upon actual contemporary circumstances as to make impractical the absolute predetermination of permissibility or the listing of specific standards which could be automatically applied in each case to determine permissibility, provision has been made in this section for the determination of such cases by an appropriate body such as the plan commission, the council or the board of zoning appeals. In such cases, the uses enumerated may be permitted if the appropriate body determines that there is compliance with the standards or conditions, if any, set forth as modified or expanded by this section. A petition for a special exception shall be filed with the department of community development along with proof of payment of the fee and costs specified in Section 3.28.010(E). No application fee shall be required for special exception petitions for single- or two-family residential uses that do not include a home occupation or other nonresidential use, but payment of the actual costs of publication, as determined by the city clerk, shall be required.

B.    Basis of Approval. An application for a discretionary approval or a special exception may be granted by the body or bodies hereinafter designated if such grant, except insofar as elsewhere herein expressly provided, shall not:

1.    Violate the spirit or general intent of this title;

2.    Be contrary to the public health, safety or general welfare;

3.    Be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive or a nuisance by reason of noise, dust, smoke, odor or other similar factor;

4.    For any other reason, cause a substantial adverse effect on the property values and general desirability of the neighborhood;

5.    Violate the building location, height and area regulations of the district in which the proposed use is located, except as may be elsewhere expressly provided.

The approving body may grant the application for a special exception for a nonconforming use upon express conditions, including the period of time in which all or part of the use may be permitted which it may deem necessary to assure compliance with the foregoing standards. Where this title elsewhere requires that the approving body consider the location, building, site plan and plan of operation of the proposed use, the applicant shall submit details concerning compliance with those standards so as to permit the approving body to be able to determine the compatibility of the proposed use with the area; the suitability of architectural and landscape treatment; the provision for parking, traffic circulation, drainage, sewage disposal and for such planting screen as may be reasonably necessary to protect the surrounding area and for operational control devices where necessary to eliminate noise, dust, odor or smoke.

C.    Determination in Writing. The conditions of approval or reasons for disapproval shall be stated in writing by the determining body and made a permanent part of the minutes of such body.

D.    Approval of Plan Commission-May Be Overruled by Council-When Made Final. Whenever the plan commission makes a determination, pursuant to this section, resulting in the approval of any use, or the approval of the location or plan of operation of any use or in the grant of any use permit, this approval or grant may be overruled or modified at the next regular meeting of the council following this approval or grant by a majority vote of all the members-elect of the council. If so overruled, this approval or grant shall not become effective and no such approval or grant shall become final or effective for any purpose, or vest any rights in any person prior to conclusion of the next regular meeting of the council. If the council fails to overrule or modify this approval or grant at this meeting or fails to take any action regarding the same at this meeting, this approval or grant shall be final and effective thereafter. (Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1912-03 § 2 (part), 2003; Ord. 1725 § 2 (part), 2000; prior code § 17.21)

c.    Notice of the zoning change to be considered at a public hearing shall be published as required by state law. Whenever the proposed change will affect the district classification of any property, the city clerk shall mail notice of this hearing once to all owners of this property or of lands lying within three hundred (300) feet of this property and within the city unless the total number of owners shall exceed ten, in which case he shall send notices to the ten or more owners as shall, in his opinion, together with the published notice, assure that a substantial segment of such owners shall be aware of the hearing. He shall also send ten days’ written notice of this hearing to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within one thousand (1,000) feet of the lands affected. Failure to give this notice shall not invalidate any change or amendment. (Ord. 2520-18 § 1, 2018; Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1912-03 § 2 (part), 2003; Ord. 1725 § 2 (part), 2000; Ord. 1618 § 1, 1997; prior code § 17.42)

17.12.010 Established.

There shall be a board of zoning appeals consisting of five members appointed by the mayor, subject to confirmation by the council, for terms of three years, except that of these first appointed, one shall serve for one year, two for two years, and two for three years. The members of the board shall serve without compensation and shall be removable by the mayor for cause upon written charges and after public hearing. The mayor shall designate one of the members chairman. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired terms of members whose terms become vacant. The mayor may appoint, for a term of three years, an alternate member of such board, in addition to the five members above provided for, who shall act, with full power, only when a member of the board refuses to vote because of interest or is absent. The above provisions with regard to removal and the filling of vacancies shall apply to such alternate. (Prior code § 17.41(1))


17.12.020 Meetings.

The board shall adopt rules governing its procedure consistent with the terms of this chapter. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. Such chairman or, in his absence, the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record. (Prior code § 17.41(2))


17.12.030 Appeals.

A.    How Filed. Appeals to the board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the administrative officer in connection with this chapter. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The appellant shall pay to the city treasurer the fee specified in Section 3.28.010(G) at the time of filing his appeal.

B.    Stay. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.

C.    Hearing. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it and shall give the following notices of hearing:

1.    Public notice by publication and posting as provided in the board’s rules;

2.    Notice by mail to the parties in interest;

3.    Notice by mail to the owners of property abutting the property involved in the appeal or other matter before the board. This last notice shall be mailed to the owners’ addresses as shown in the records of the city assessor at least seven days prior to the hearing.

The board shall decide the matter within a reasonable time. At the hearing any person may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. (Ord 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; prior code § 17.41(3))


17.12.040 Powers.

The board of zoning appeals shall have the following powers:

A.    To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of Chapter 8.08 and Title 15 of the Municipal Code;

B.    To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this chapter upon which such board is required to pass under this title;

C.    To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases, such variances from the terms of this title as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title will result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this title shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Variances must not permit a lower degree of flood protection than a point two feet above the regional flood elevation for the particular area or be contrary to Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 116 or other applicable state flood plain regulations. (Ord. 1617 § 1, 1997; prior code § 17.41(4)(a))


17.12.050 Decision-making procedures.

A.    When considering an area variance, the board shall use the following standard to determine if unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty exists: whether compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions that govern setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density or other such matters would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome.

B.    When considering a use variance, the board shall use the following standard to determine if unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty exists: whether compliance with the strict letter of the use restrictions will mean that no reasonable or feasible use of the property can be made.

C.    In making its determination, the board may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance and operation, in addition to any which may be stipulated in this title, as the board may deem necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest and welfare.

D.    Enforcement of Decision. In exercising the abovementioned powers, such board may, in conformity with the provisions of this title, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and, to that end, shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and may issue or direct the issue of a permit; provided, that no such action shall have the effect of permitting in any district a use prohibited in that district or of rezoning or of amending the zoning code.

E.    Required Vote. A quorum shall be four members of the board. The vote of three members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative official or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this title or to effect any variation therefrom. The grounds of every such determination shall be stated by the moving member on the audio-taped record. (Ord. 2044-06 § 1, 2006: Ord. 1994-04 § 1, 2004: prior code § 17.41(4)(b)-(e))


17.12.060 Further appeal.

Any person or persons, aggrieved by any decision of the board or any taxpayer or any officer, department, board or bureau of the city, may appeal from a decision of the board within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board in the manner provided in Section 62.23(7)(e), Wisconsin Statutes. (Prior code § 17.41(4)(f))


17.12.070 Relationship to plan commission.

Whenever the provisions of this title shall require that any person obtain both the approval of the plan commission in connection with any phase of the use of the land and a variance or exception from the board, the person shall first apply to and receive the required approval of the plan commission before making application to the board, provided, wherever the required approval of the plan commission and the requested variance are, in the opinion of the mayor and the clerk, so closely interrelated as to make a joint hearing by the plan commission and the board of zoning appeals desirable, the mayor and the clerk may schedule such a joint hearing at a time which is convenient to the members of both governing bodies. (Prior code § 17.41(4)(g))

17.16.020 Zoning map.

A.    Districts Mapped. The boundaries of such districts are shown upon a map designated as the zoning map of the city of Brookfield and made part of this title and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this title as if the matters and information set forth by the map were all fully described herein. Such map shall be kept on file in the offices of the city and shall be kept up to date by the city clerk.

B.    Determination of Boundaries. In determining the exact boundaries of the various districts, the following rules shall apply:

1.    Unless otherwise specifically indicated on the zoning map, the district boundaries are lot lines; U.S. Public Land Survey section lines, one-quarter section lines or one-sixteenth section lines; right-of-way lines of streets, highways, railroads or alleys; and where the districts designated on the map are bounded approximately by such lines they shall be construed to be the boundary of such district; however, a street, highway, railroad or alley abutting a zoning district shall be considered to be in the more restrictive adjacent zoning classification.

2.    Where district boundary lines are indicated as adjacent and parallel or approximately parallel to a street, highway or railroad line, unless specifically dimensioned, such district boundary shall be assumed to be three hundred (300) feet from the right-of-way line with which it is parallel.

3.    The boundaries of conservancy districts, as drawn, are intended to represent the edge of swamps, marshes, flood lands or the ordinary high water mark of a stream or watercourse and shall be finally determined by the actual conditions in each specific situation; provided, however, that along a stream or watercourse, such line shall not be less than one hundred (100) feet from the center of such stream or watercourse.

4.    The boundaries of the floodplain districts are based on technical data contained in the Flood Insurance Study, city of Brookfield, Waukesha County, Wisconsin, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and dated November 5, 2014.1 The map illustrates the floodlands utilizing the best cartographic information available. The city declares, however, that the exact boundaries should reflect the water surface profile set forth in the flood insurance study, and should be verified and analyzed by a permit applicant or petitioner, and approved by the city.

5.    The boundaries of the wetland preservation districts are based on the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Maps for the city of Brookfield, dated January 31, 1986, and stamped “Final.” The map illustrates the wetlands utilizing the best cartographic information available. The city declares, however, that the exact boundaries should be field-verified by a permit applicant or petitioner and approved by the city.

6.    In all other cases not covered by the foregoing, the boundaries shall be determined by use of the scale on the zoning map.

C.    Fees. The fee for issuance of a zoning letter indicating the official zoning district designation of a property and enumerating the applicable section(s) of this title for the zoning district(s) shall be as specified in Section 3.28.010(H). Such zoning letter shall include an adopted land use if appropriate. (Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1725 § 2 (part), 2000; prior code § 17.27)


17.16.030 Annexations.

Annexations to or consolidations with the city subsequent to the effective date of this code shall be placed in the R-1 single-family residential district unless the annexation ordinance temporarily places the land in another district. Within one year, the plan commission shall evaluate and recommend a permanent classification of such lands to the council. Annexations containing lands that, prior to annexation, were regulated under the provisions of the Waukesha County Shoreland-Floodland Protection Ordinance shall be governed in the following manner:

A.    Annexations containing floodlands shall be governed by the provisions of the Waukesha County Shoreland Zoning Ordinance until such time that the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) certifies that amendments to this title meet the requirements of Wis. Adm. Code NR 116.

B.    Annexations Containing Shorelands. Pursuant to Section 59.971 (7), Wisconsin Statutes, any annexation of land which was regulated by the Waukesha County Shoreland-Floodland Protection Ordinance shall be designated within the SP Shoreland Protection Overlay District for annexed areas. Such regulations shall be administered and enforced by the zoning administrator. (Prior code § 17.275)1

17.40.010 Approval by council.

The council may authorize, by ordinance, after a public hearing and a recommendation by the plan commission held and made in the manner provided herein, the location and development in the R-1 and R-2 residence districts of a planned residential development of single-family dwellings, on not less than forty (40) acres of land; and provided, that:

A.    The plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter;

B.    The buildings shall be used only for single-family dwellings and permitted accessory uses such as garages, storage space and project activities;

C.    1.    The specific requirements of this chapter for intensity of land use and yards for the designing residential district in which the development is located shall be maintained.

2.    All other sections of this chapter may, by specific mention, be varied in whole or part for any planned residential development under this section.

3.    However, in no case shall the allowable lot area in any residential district be reduced to less than the lot area required in the next less restricted residential district and in no case shall a reduction of lot width be allowed to less than one hundred twenty (120) feet.

4.    Where a reduction of lot area or width is allowed, within the limits above, an area equal to the reduction allowed shall be added to the public open space required by Title 16 unless otherwise provided in accordance with Section 17.40.020;

D.    All requirements of city ordinances relating to the division of land, construction of buildings and the official plan must be complied with. (Prior code § 17.32(1))


17.40.020 Lease of open space for private use.

In order further to encourage developers to preserve substantial areas as open space, the developer who requests an ordinance authorizing a planned residential development may make it a condition of his offer of the extra open space required by a planned residential development that all or a specific part of such land be leased for the use of the residents of the proposed subdivision or some other group of persons designated in the lease. Such lease would provide that:

A.    The land would be maintained in an orderly and attractive fashion by the lessee or agent at lessee’s cost;

F.    Such lease shall be for an indefinite term;

G.    The city may, at any time after fifteen (15) years from the start of the lease, upon one hundred twenty (120) days’ notice in writing, cancel the lease in order to put the land to a public use. In the event of such cancellation, the city shall pay lessee the market value of any improvements on the land, such as tennis courts and swimming pools, exclusive of grading, which lessee shall have made and which lessee shall not choose, within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of cancellation, to remove from the leased land. The market value of any compensable improvements shall be determined by mutual agreement within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice of cancellation or referred by each party of arbitration with each party selecting an appraiser and the two thus selected choosing a third arbitrator. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be conclusive on both parties. Their expenses shall be borne equally by both parties. (Prior code § 17.32(2))

17.41.040    Procedure.

17.41.050    Standards for planned development districts by predominant land use.


17.41.010 Statement of purpose.

The planned development district or PDD provides regulatory framework to encourage improved community benefits as to matters such as environmental and aesthetic design, stormwater management, preservation of natural topography, and the like, and allowing for greater flexibility in the development of land than that allowed in standard districts, while achieving substantial compliance with the intent of the zoning code and existing or future city plans. The district allows variation in the relationship of uses, structures and spaces in developments organized internally as cohesive projects, and carefully related to other nearby developments and lands. (Ord. 1690 § 1 (part), 1999)


17.41.020 Allowed uses.

The PDD allows those uses that are approved for that district through the city review and approval process, selected from among all uses allowed in any other districts, singly or in combination, unless restricted by applicable overlay districts. The district makes no differentiation between permitted and special exception or conditional uses, since all uses will receive discretionary review. Restaurants, limited food establishments or taverns that were permitted as part of the original specific plan for a property or amendments thereto are permitted to have outdoor seating not exceeding twenty-five (25) percent of the indoor seating capacity. No extraordinary separation between the outdoor seating and residential uses contained within the PDD is required. The location and operating hours for the outdoor seating and adequacy of parking will be subject to plan commission approval. (Ord. 2251-11 § 14, 2011: Ord. 1690 § 1 (part), 1999)


17.41.030 Lot size, lot width, height, floor area, maximum lot coverage, landscape surface ratio, open space requirements, signs and parking requirements.

This district has no predetermined specific lot area, lot width, height, floor area ratio, yard, usable open space, sign and off-street parking requirements. Such requirements are determined for each district on an individual basis through the city review and approval process. (Ord. 1690 § 1 (part), 1999)


17.41.040 Procedure.

The following requirements shall apply to applications for the PDD, in addition to normal zoning amendment procedural requirements in Section 17.08.070:

A.    General Plan. To commence the city review and approval process, the applicant shall file the following with the city:

1.    A description of the character of the intended development;

2.    Scale drawings of the project area including drawings showing the relationship to surrounding properties, the existing topography and key features. Where a planning unit or node designation has been specified in relevant city plans or zoning, the general map plan shall cover that planning unit or portion of the node as directed by the community development department;

3.    A plan of the proposed project showing sufficient detail to allow evaluation in relation to the standards for approval, as defined in Section 17.41.050;

4.    When requested by the city, a general outline of intended organizational structure of a property owners’ association, deed restrictions, and provisions on shared installation and maintenance of common services;

5.    Analysis of the impact upon the community, demonstrating community benefits warranting PDD status;

6.    Submittal of plans and documents shall generally be consistent with the specifications of the submittal requirements of Section 17.100.050.

7.    Planned Development Districts-General Plan Review Application Fees. Any application for community development review of a planned development district general plan shall include a fee as specified in Section 3.28.010(I).

8.    The applicant will be billed a fee specified in Section 3.28.010(KK) for the engineering department review of any planned development district general plan review.

B.    Referral and Hearing.

1.    After the filing of an application that is deemed complete by the community development department, the application shall be reviewed by the plan commission, which shall forward the application to the common council with recommendations that the plan should be approved as submitted, approved with modifications or disapproved.

2.    Upon receipt of the recommendations of the plan commission, the council shall determine whether or not to initiate a zoning amendment to place the subject lands in the proposed PDD and to schedule the required public hearing.

C.    Action on Amendatory Ordinance to place Lands in the PDD.

1.    If the council initiates a zoning amendment procedure to place the subject lands in the proposed PDD, the council shall determine whether the required public hearing shall be held by the plan commission or common council, and may direct that the report and recommendations previously adopted by the plan commission be included in the record of that hearing without the necessity of referral back to the plan commission.

2.    Before the statutory public hearing, the common council shall review the recommendations of the plan commission and such other evidence and information as the council considers relevant and then shall take action to re-refer, to adopt, or to reject the zoning amendment applying the PDD for the subject property.

3.    If the council votes to approve the rezoning of the subject property to PDD, status of the property shall be that the base zoning will be PDD, with general plan approval only. The map designation will be PDD-General Plan and a numeric and geographic reference identifying the specific district.

D.    Actions Following Approval of a General Plan.

1.    Approval of the rezoning to a PDD shall conditionally entitle the applicant to apply to the city for approval of a specific plan for the area in conformity with the general plan as previously approved by the common council, but all rights to commence development shall be conditioned upon city approval of the specific plan, and shall not make permissible any of the uses or developments until the specific plan is approved for all or a portion of the area included in the general plan.

2.    If the approved general plan is not followed within six months of the date of approval by the common council by submittal of an application for approval of a specific plan, the approval shall be null and void and a new application and approval process shall be required to obtain general plan approval. The zoning of the property shall revert without hearing to the prior zoning classification. The six-month deadline may be extended for good cause for up to six additional months by the director of community development.

E.    Specific Plan Application. The specific plan shall be submitted to the plan commission, through the department of community development and shall include detailed construction and engineering plans and related detailed documents and schedules as described below:

1.    An accurate map of the area covered by the plan including the relationship to the total general plan;

2.    The pattern of public and private roads, driveways, walkways and parking facilities;

3.    Detailed lot layout per specifications of Chapter 17.100-17.124 and 17.136 of the Municipal Code; subdivision plat per Chapter 16.16, if by plat or certified survey map, as applicable;

17.50.010 Purpose.

The village area business district (VAB) is intended to encourage and promote a well-planned mixed-use environment with commercial, office and residential components, layered vertically. This section will implement the preferences for the village area neighborhood plan, an update to the city master plan. The specific goal is to encourage efficient land use by facilitating developments that minimize the amount of land needed for surface parking, while at the same time acknowledges the need for parking provided through a combination of on-site and off-site parking facilities. A safe, comfortable and attractive business district is desired for pedestrians, patrons and residents. The district is intended to supplement the objectives of the “B-1” local business district in an area that is characterized by small, shallow or narrow lots; where commercial parcels are adjacent to residential development located on small, narrow or shallow lots, or which have offsets below those required by code; or where the patterns of land division were platted—and largely developed—prior to the establishment of zoning. The regulations of this district address building, use, parking, height, area, aesthetic, and stormwater management requirements, where the intent is to complement the existing, historically significant commercial and mixed-use structures in the district. (Ord. 2068-06 § 2 (part), 2006)


17.50.020 Buildings to retain.

The following buildings are considered to contribute to the character of the village area and/or have medium- to high-architectural significance, and the owners are encouraged to adaptively reuse a building, historically renovate a building and/or relocate a building to another location within the village area to the fullest extent allowed by law.

4.    Facade Materials. Exterior facade materials shall reflect the dominant visual characteristics of the building’s original exterior design, including wood clapboard or simulated clapboard siding (such as fiber-cement siding) with narrow detail, wood shingles, and wood or wood-like trim. Windows shall be trimmed with wood or wood-like casings and hoods. Cornices with brackets or other ornamental detail shall be of wood or wood-like materials. Decorative shingles in gables or pediments, harmonizing with the siding and trim are permitted. Textures achieved through the use of brick, stone, etc., are not permitted.

5.    Color. The colors of building materials shall be of the late nineteenth to early twentieth century period, which include popular jewel colors of the late Victorian period and lighter colors of the neoclassical revival period.

G.    Large first floor windows are required to establish visibility and transparency along the street.

H.    The application of the landscape regulations in the site development standards for nonresidential uses will be limited due to reduced setbacks and offsets. While the preferred location of parking lots is out of view from public streets, it is understood that instances may arise where they are adjacent to streets and therefore become a part of the streetscape. In the instances where parking may be adjacent to the build-to line, O’Malley Alley and/or residential districts, screening shall be designed as follows to maintain and enhance the continuity of the streetscape and/or provide general screening of the parking areas, subject to plan commission approval:

1.    Coverage. The build-to line shall be screened for the entire length (one hundred (100) percent) of the parking lot or vehicle use area and extend ten feet in either direction measured parallel to the parking lot or vehicular use area, or to the building edge or property boundary, whichever is less. Points of access are exempt from this regulation.

2.    Landscape Screens. All screening shall be no greater than three feet in height and shall incorporate both architectural elements (such as planters, garden walls or fences) and plant material.

I.    Buildings on lots with Brookfield Road frontage shall have at least one building entrance facing Brookfield Road.

J.    The style of lighting shall complement the historic character of the business district. Decorative lights are only permitted as regulated in Section 17.120.070 of this code.

17.73.020 General restrictions.

A.    Written Determination. When reviewing and approving or advising on requests for development approvals, the plan commission shall make written determinations that the proposed development is consistent with the land use intent identified for Districts F & G in the Calhoun Road South Neighborhood Plan, incorporated herein by reference.

B.    Intent. The land use intent of this district is for office and multiple-family residential uses to constitute in excess of eighty (80) percent of total developed floor area, and for retail and civic uses to constitute a small portion of the developed floor area.

The intent of the district is also for identified uses to be located in close proximity to each other, including mixing uses in individual buildings. (Ord. 1823 § 1 (part), 2001)


17.73.030 Layout and dimensional standards.

A.    Open Space Features. Two major open space features will be located in full or in part within this district: the planned hedge row and the planned sculptural green, as identified in the Calhoun Road South Neighborhood Plan.

B.    Play Fields. The district will also contain some of the planned, relocated Swanson Elementary School play fields, as identified in the Calhoun Road South Neighborhood Plan.

C.    Land Uses. The remainder of the developable lands in the district are planned to consist of the following uses in the following approximate proportions with densities contingently indicated as follows:

1.    Office: Floor area of approximately five hundred sixty-two thousand, seven hundred eighty (562,780) square feet in four story buildings (average).

2.    Multiple-family dwellings: Floor area of approximately two hundred thirty-eight thousand, one hundred fifty-four (238,154) square feet in floor area in three story buildings (average) or one hundred fifty-nine (159) dwelling units, whichever is greater.

3.    Limited commercial uses: Floor area of approximately five thousand, five hundred thirty-eight (5,538) square feet, predominately located within office buildings.

4.    Civic and public (conditional) uses: Floor area of approximately forty-five thousand, six hundred ninety-two (45,692) square feet.

D.    Densities and Floor Area Ratios. Densities and Floor Area Ratios (FAR) inherent in the above indicated floor area allowances (those being a maximum of 0.3 FAR per each property) may be increased through rezoning to a planned development district (PDD), with the possibility of higher densities within the discretion of the plan commission and common council, contingent upon substantial public benefits determined by the city within the PDD review and approval process.

E.    Height regulations. Height regulations: Seventy (70) feet maximum.

F.    Dimensional Standards. Setback, offset and related dimensional standards shall be determined by the specific plan of a PDD approved by the plan commission and common council or by application of the modified suburban overlay (MSO) district to the subject parcel with a development pattern specified with such overlay district. (Ord. 1823 § 1 (part), 2001)


17.73.040 Conditions for approval—Integrated planning.

Conditions for the zoning approval of plan and method of operation or PDD must meet the following standards to achieve integrated planning within the district, and between the district and certain abutting lands.

A.    Properties tax key parcels 1120-983, 1137-998 and 1137-998-001 must be included in a joint master development agreement with the city of Brookfield before any zoning approval applications will be reviewed by the city. If this cannot be achieved by participation and agreement of owners of all of the parcels, the city may, but is not obligated to determine the detailed development plan and the assignment of development opportunities and responsibilities for the nonparticipating property and to amend the terms of this district to include those elements. Assignment of development opportunities and responsibilities may include allocating the interim allowance of traffic loading under subsection 17.73.050 (A) of this chapter to the participating parcels.

B.    The densities of potentially allowable development densities above 0.3 FAR depend on the plan commission making a written determination that the increase in FAR achieves the intent and provisions of this district and the Calhoun Road South Neighborhood Plan. Such approvals are also contingent upon the property owners participating with the city with respect to the landscape features identified in subsection 17.73.030(A) of this chapter and the reconfiguration of the Swanson Elementary School play fields. Participation above the standard park and open space dedications and/or payments in lieu of dedication or impact fees will be a threshold public benefit to justify higher densities through PDD rezoning. Developments at or below 0.3 FAR shall implement the landscape features of the hedge row and sculptural green elements of the Calhoun Road South Neighborhood Plan contained on the subject property in accord with standard park and open space dedications and/or payments in lieu or impact fees.

C.    The plan commission shall determine if public access to the landscape features is consistent with the elements of the Calhoun Road South Neighborhood Plan and, if so, how public access is created and maintained. (Ord. 1823 § 1 (part), 2001)


17.73.050 Conditions for approval—Coordination with infrastructure availability.

Conditions for the zoning approval plan and method of operation or PDD must meet the following standards in order to achieve coordination with infrastructure availability.

A.    The total incremental increase in average weekday traffic loading from the lands in this district onto Calhoun Road may not exceed two thousand (2,000) average daily trips (ADT) until that stretch of road is widened to four lanes, currently scheduled for the year 2007.

B.    In addition, peaks of traffic loading can be modulated by combining office floor area with multiple-family residential units in this initial build-out period, or other combinations such as civic uses that achieves reductions in peak traffic loads. (Ord. 1823 § 1 (part), 2001)

17.75.010 Purpose.

The Office and Limited Residential/Commercial District No. 3 (O&LR/C No. 3) is intended to encourage and promote a well-planned mixed-use environment with commercial, mixed-use, and residential components. A portion of the district should be designed to include mixed-use buildings with commercial and residential uses layered vertically. A specific goal is to encourage efficient land use by facilitating developments that minimize the amount of land needed for surface parking through the use of underground parking while at the same time acknowledging the existence of bedrock close to existing land surface grades in the district. A safe, comfortable and attractive environment is desired for pedestrians, bicyclists, patrons and residents. This goal would also be enhanced with designs that locate land uses in close proximity to each other in order to promote a pedestrian focused environment. This section will implement the preferences for the 124th Street and Bluemound Road Neighborhood Plan (neighborhood plan), an update to the city master plan. (Ord. 2101-07 § 1 (part), 2007)

17.77.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to encourage and promote well planned, suitable and appropriate mixed-use developments of primarily office-oriented uses with limited residential, commercial and light industrial components within the selected district. It intends to facilitate development (e.g., land use mix, density, and design) that enables the district to adapt to the work environment demands and lifestyle preferences of a multi-generational workforce, and supports walking, cycling, public transit and other modes of transportation where applicable. Any hotel site should have suitable access to accessory commercial areas for convenience and shopping needs. Pedestrian linkages to these commercial areas are preferred. The district encourages diverse multiple-family housing options, including live-work housing, officetel, and co-housing arrangements, to enhance choice and flexibility of residency near employment within the district. A specific goal is to achieve continued incremental improvement in the functionality, sustainability, resiliency and attractiveness of the district using established green neighborhood development standards, such as LEED and Living Community Challenge. The regulations of this district address building, use, height, parking, and area where the intent is transportation efficiency, reduction of vehicle distance traveled, conservation of land, protection of natural areas and safe, appealing, and comfortable street environments. The district allows developers the flexibility to accomplish such goals while compelling and maintaining a high quality of design and character for the surrounding neighborhood.

17.81.010 Purpose.

The light industrial and commercial mixed-use district (LI&CM) is intended to encourage and promote a well-planned mixed-use environment with light industrial, commercial, and office components. A portion of the district should be designed to include mixed-use buildings with commercial and office uses layered vertically, horizontally or among multiple buildings. A specific goal is to encourage efficient land use by facilitating developments that minimize the amount of land needed for surface parking through creative design, lessened setbacks and the use of underground parking where feasible while at the same time acknowledging the existence of bedrock close to existing land surface grades in the district and the necessity of balancing permitted uses with the impact on traffic circulation and the need to display vehicles in the case of automobile or motorcycle dealerships. (Ord. 2375-14 § 1, 2014: Ord. 2173-09 § 1 (part))


17.81.020 Permitted uses.

C.    Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;

D.    Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;

E.    Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;

F.    Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;

G.    Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;

H.    Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and

I.    Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. (Ord. 2345-13 § 1(1.3), 2013)


17.88.040 Title.

This chapter shall be known as the floodplain zoning ordinance for the city of Brookfield, Wisconsin. (Ord. 2345-13 § 1(1.4), 2013)


17.88.050 General provisions.

A.    Areas to Be Regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.

B.    Official Maps and Revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see Article VIII, Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the community development and inspection services departments of the city of Brookfield, Wisconsin. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.

1.    Official Maps—Based on the FIS. (Contact your DNR office if you have questions, or go to http://store.msc.fema.gov to access the FEMA Map Store.)

a.    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM), panel numbers 55133C0206G, 55133C0207G, 55133C0208G, 55133C0209G, 55133C0216G, 55133C0217G, 55133C0218G, 55133C0219G, 55133C0226G, 55133C0227G, 55133C0228G, 55133C0229G, 55133C0236G, 55133C0237G, 55133C0238G and 55133C0239G dated November 5, 2014; with corresponding profiles that are based on the flood insurance study (FIS) dated November 5, 2014. FIS 55133CV001C, 55133CV002C and 55133CV003C.

b.    Approved by: the DNR and FEMA.

2.    Official Maps—Based on Other Studies. Any maps referenced in this section must be approved by the DNR and be more restrictive than those based on the FIS at the site of the proposed development.

a.    Technical Support Data Notebook for Brookfield, WI, dated May 2004 and July 2005, prepared by Ruekert Mielke. Approved by the WDNR.

b.    City of Brookfield Flood Storage District Panels 4 and 5 of 12. Dated November 5, 2014, prepared by WDNR. Approved by the WDNR.

C.    Establishment of Floodplain Zoning Districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into four districts as follows:

1.    The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE zones as shown on the FIRM.

2.    The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE zones on the FIRM.

3.    The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and do not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM.

4.    The flood storage district (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge.

D.    Locating Floodplain Boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsection (D)(1) or (2) of this section. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Article VIII, Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to Section 17.88.280(C) and the criteria in subsections (D)(1) and (2) of this section. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments.

1.    If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.

2.    Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale.

E.    Removal of Lands from Floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments.

F.    Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

G.    Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Section 13.48(13), Wisconsin Statutes, applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Section 30.2022, Wisconsin Statutes, applies.

H.    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.

1.    This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Section 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694, Wisconsin Statutes, for counties; Section 62.23, Wisconsin Statutes, for cities; Section 61.35, Wisconsin Statutes, for villages; or Section 87.30, Wisconsin Statutes, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.

2.    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.

I.    Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 116, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to the ordinance codified in this chapter.

J.    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.

K.    Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected.

L.    Annexed Areas for Cities and Villages. The Waukesha County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 116 and 44 CFR 59 through 72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality’s official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location. (Ord. 2387-14 § 1, 2014; Ord. 2345-13 § 1(1.5), 2013)

Article II. General Standards Applicable to All Floodplain Districts


17.88.060 General development standards.

The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding. 

Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this chapter and all other requirements in Section 17.88.260(B). Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages. (Ord. 2345-13 § 1(2.0), 2013)


17.88.070 Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.

A.    No floodplain development shall:

1.    Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height; or

2.    Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost.

B.    The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of Article VIII, Amendments, are met. (Ord. 2345-13 § 1(2.1), 2013)

i.    Data to determine if the proposed development will cause an obstruction to flow or an increase in regional flood height or discharge according to Section 17.88.070. This may include any of the information noted in Section 17.88.130(A).

3.    Hydraulic and Hydrologic Studies to Analyze Development. All hydraulic and hydrologic studies shall be completed under the direct supervision of a professional engineer registered in the state. The study contractor shall be responsible for the technical adequacy of the study. All studies shall be reviewed and approved by the Department.

a.    Zone A Floodplains.

i.    Hydrology.

(A)    The appropriate method shall be based on the standards in Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 116.07(3), Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Discharge. 

ii.    Hydraulic Modeling. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 116.07(4), Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation, and the following:

(A)    Determination of the required limits of the hydraulic model shall be based on detailed study information for downstream structures (dam, bridge, culvert) to determine adequate starting WSEL for the study.

(B)    Channel sections must be surveyed.

(C)    Minimum four-foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used for the development of cross section overbank and floodplain mapping.

(D)    A maximum distance of five hundred (500) feet between cross sections is allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel at each location. 

(E)    The most current version of HEC-RAS shall be used.

(F)    A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required at each structure.

(G)    Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based on the length of the reach if greater than five hundred (500) feet.

(H)    Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning’s N values, expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as highwater marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted engineering practices.

(I)    The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet. 

iii.    Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided, showing all cross section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed development and whether the proposed development is located in the floodway. 

(A)    If the proposed development is located outside of the floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood elevation.

(B)    If any part of the proposed development is in the floodway, it must be added to the base model to show the difference between existing and proposed conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients remain the same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based on standard accepted engineering practices is provided.

b.    Zone AE Floodplains.

i.    Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the existing study, the appropriate method to be used shall be based on Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 116.07(3), Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Discharge. 

ii.    Hydraulic Model. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 116.07(4), Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation, and the following:

(A)    Duplicate Effective Model. The effective model shall be reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available, models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations shown in the Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot.

(B)    Corrected Effective Model. The corrected effective model shall not include any manmade physical changes since the effective model date, but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for Department review. 

(C)    Existing (Pre-Project Conditions) Model. The existing model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the project associated with the revised (post-project) model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model. 

(D)    Revised (Post-Project Conditions) Model. The revised (post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This model shall reflect proposed conditions. 

(E)    All changes to the duplicate effective model and subsequent models must be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes. 

(F)    Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the effective model and result in water surface elevations and top widths computed by the revised models matching those in the effective models upstream and downstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall not be truncated.

iii.    Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the Department for review which meet the following conditions:

(A)    Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the revised floodplain and floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles, topographic work map, annotated FIRMs and/or flood boundary floodway maps (FBFMs), construction plans, bridge plans. 

(B)    Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour interval, and a planimetric map showing the applicable items. If a digital version of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM may be more easily revised. 

(C)    Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised one percent and two-tenths percent annual chance floodplains and floodway boundaries. 

(D)    If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping data (GIS or CADD) are used then all supporting documentation or metadata must be included with the data submission along with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with FEMA mapping specifications. 

(E)    The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the effective floodplain boundaries. 

(F)    All cross sections from the effective model shall be labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross section lookup table shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme.

(G)    Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown on the map. 

(H)    The stream centerline or profile baseline used to measure stream distances in the model shall be visible on the map.

4.    Expiration. All permits issued under the authority of this chapter shall expire no more than one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance. The permit may be extended for a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) days for good and sufficient cause.

C.    Certificate of Compliance. No land shall be occupied or used, and no building which is hereafter constructed, altered, added to, modified, repaired, rebuilt or replaced shall be occupied, until a certificate of compliance is issued by the zoning administrator, except where no permit is required, subject to the following provisions:

1.    The certificate of compliance shall show that the building or premises or part thereof, and the proposed use, conform to the provisions of this chapter;

2.    Application for such certificate shall be concurrent with the application for a permit;

3.    If all ordinance provisions are met, the certificate of compliance shall be issued within ten days after written notification that the permitted work is completed;

4.    The applicant shall submit a certification signed by a registered professional engineer, architect or land surveyor that the fill, lowest floor and floodproofing elevations are in compliance with the permit issued. Floodproofing measures also require certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the requirements of Section 17.88.300 are met.

D.    Other Permits. Prior to obtaining a floodplain development permit the applicant must secure all necessary permits from federal, state, and local agencies, including but not limited to those required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1344.

For all zoning ordinances and amendments, a Class 2 notice, published twice, once each week consecutively, the last at least a week (seven days) before the hearing. Local ordinances or bylaws may require additional notice, exceeding these minimums.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“High flood damage potential” means damage that could result from flooding that includes any danger to life or health or any significant economic loss to a structure or building and its contents.

•    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

•    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

•    Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

•    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Increase in regional flood height” means a calculated upward rise in the regional flood elevation, greater than 0.00 foot, based on a comparison of existing conditions and proposed conditions which is directly attributable to development in the floodplain but not attributable to manipulation of mathematical variables such as roughness factors, expansion and contraction coefficients and discharge.

“Land use” means any nonstructural use made of unimproved or improved real estate. (Also see “Development.”)

“Lowest adjacent grade” means elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any of the exterior walls of a building.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.

“Maintenance” means the act or process of restoring to original soundness, including redecorating, refinishing, nonstructural repairs, or the replacement of existing fixtures, systems or equipment with equivalent fixtures, systems or structures.

“Manufactured home” means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities. The term “manufactured home” includes a mobile home but does not include a “mobile recreational vehicle.”

“Mobile/manufactured home park, expansion to existing” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed. This includes installation of utilities, construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.

“Mobile/manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land, divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“Mobile/manufactured home park or subdivision, existing” means a parcel of land, divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale, on which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots is completed before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. At a minimum, this would include the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 

“Mobile recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis, four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled, carried or permanently towable by a licensed, light-duty vehicle, is licensed for highway use if registration is required and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. Manufactured homes that are towed or carried onto a parcel of land, but do not remain capable of being towed or carried, including park model homes, do not fall within the definition of “mobile recreational vehicles.”

“Model, corrected effective” means a hydraulic engineering model that corrects any errors that occur in the duplicate effective model, adds any additional cross sections to the duplicate effective model, or incorporates more detailed topographic information than that used in the current effective model.

“Model, duplicate effective” means a copy of the hydraulic analysis used in the effective FIS and referred to as the effective model.

“Model, effective” means the hydraulic engineering model that was used to produce the current effective flood insurance study.

“Model, existing (pre-project)” means a modification of the duplicate effective model or corrected effective model to reflect any manmade modifications that have occurred within the floodplain since the date of the effective model but prior to the construction of the project for which the revision is being requested. If no modification has occurred since the date of the effective model, then this model would be identical to the corrected effective model or duplicate effective model.

“Model, revised (post-project)” means a modification of the existing or pre-project conditions model, duplicate effective model or corrected effective model to reflect revised or post-project conditions.

“Municipality” or “municipal” means the county, city or village governmental units enacting, administering and enforcing this chapter.

“NAVD” or “North American Vertical Datum” means elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1988 adjustment.

New Construction. For floodplain management purposes, “new construction” means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain zoning regulations adopted by this community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purpose of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“NGVD” or “National Geodetic Vertical Datum” means elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1929 adjustment.

“Nonconforming structure” means an existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use. However, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.)

“Nonconforming use” means an existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (Such as a residence in the floodway.)

“Obstruction to flow” means any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development alone or together with any future development will cause an increase in regional flood height.

“Official floodplain zoning map” means that map, adopted and made part of this chapter, as described in Section 17.88.050(B), which has been approved by the Department and FEMA.

“Open space use” means those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures.

“Ordinary highwater mark” means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.

“Person” means an individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, municipality or state agency.

“Private sewage system” means a sewage treatment and disposal system serving one structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure. It also means an alternative sewage system approved by the Department of Commerce, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a system located on a different parcel than the structure.

“Public utilities” means those utilities using underground or overhead transmission lines such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and distribution and collection systems such as water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer.

“Reasonably safe from flooding” means base floodwaters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the floodplain and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings.

“Regional flood” means a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.

“Start of construction” means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.

“Subdivision” has the meaning given in Section 236.02(12), Wisconsin Statutes.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.

“Unnecessary hardship” means where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance.

“Variance” means an authorization by the board of adjustment or appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain zoning ordinance.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Watershed” means the entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water.

“Water surface profile” means a graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.

“Well” means an excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring, drilling, driving or other methods, to obtain groundwater regardless of its intended use. (Ord. 2345-13 § 1(10.0), 2013)

These regulations are adopted by the council pursuant to the authorization contained in Sections 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 144.26, Wisconsin Statutes, and Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 117. (Prior code § 17.395(1)(a))


17.92.020 Purpose.

The purpose of these rules is to:

A.    Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;

B.    Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands;

C.    Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals and organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;

E.    Prohibit certain uses detrimental to wetland area;

F.    Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling wetland excavation, filling and other earth-moving activities. (Prior code § 17.395(1)(b))


17.92.030 Title.

This chapter shall be known as, referred to or cited as the wetland preservation district of Brookfield, Wisconsin. (Prior code § 17.395(1)(h))


17.92.040 Definitions.

For the purpose of administering and enforcing this chapter, the terms or words used herein shall be interpreted as follows: words used in the present tense include the future, words in the singular number include the plural number, and words in the plural number include the singular number. The word “shall” is mandatory, not permissive. All distances, unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally. The following terms used in this chapter shall have meanings, as follows:

“Accessory structure or use” means a detached subordinate structure or a use which is clearly incidental to, and customarily found in connection with, the principal structure or use to which it is related and which is located on the same lot as that of the principal structure or use.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures or accessory structures; the construction of additions or substantial alterations to buildings, structures or accessory structures; the placement of buildings or structures; ditching, lagooning, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction of earthen materials.

“Drainage system” means one or more artificial ditches, tile drains or similar devices which collect surface runoff or groundwater and convey it to a point of discharge.

“Environmental control facility” means any facility, temporary or permanent, which is reasonably expected to abate, reduce or aid in the prevention, measurement, control or monitoring of noise, air or water pollutants, including facilities installed principally to supplement or to replace existing property or equipment not meeting or allegedly not meeting acceptable pollution control standards or which are to be supplemented or replaced by other pollution control facilities.

“Navigable waters” means Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland lakes within Wisconsin, and all streams, ponds, sloughs, flowages and other waters within the territorial limits of this state, including the Wisconsin portion of boundary waters which are navigable under the laws of this state. Under Section 144.26(2)(d), Wisconsin Statutes, notwithstanding any other provision of law or administrative rule promulgated thereunder, shoreland sections required under Sections 61.351 and 62.231, Wisconsin Statutes, and Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 117 do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if:

1.    Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or river;

2.    Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams before ditching;

3.    Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use.

Wisconsin’s Supreme Court has declared navigable bodies of water that have a bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow sufficient to support navigation by a recreational craft of the shallowest draft on an annually recurring basis (Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952) and DeGaynor and Co., Inc., v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975)). For example, a stream which is navigable by skiff or canoe during normal spring high water is navigable, in fact, under the laws of this state though it may be dry during other seasons.

This definition is mandated by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and is adopted by the council under protest. The council disclaims any responsibility for arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable application thereof.

“Ordinary high-water mark” means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.

“Shorelands” means lands within the following distances from the ordinary high-water mark of navigable waters: one thousand (1,000) feet from a lake, pond or flowage and three hundred (300) feet from a river or stream or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater.

“Shoreland-wetland district” means the zoning district, created in this shoreland-wetland zoning chapter, comprised of shorelands that are designated as wetlands on the wetlands inventory maps which have been adopted and made a part of this chapter.

“Unnecessary hardship” means that circumstance where special conditions, which were not self-created, affect a particular property and make strict conformity with restrictions governing area, setbacks, frontage height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this chapter.

“Wetlands” means those areas where water is at, near or above the land surface long enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which have soils indicative of wet conditions.

“Wetland alteration” means any filling, flooding, draining, dredging, ditching, tiling, excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures or dike and dam construction in a wetland area. (Amended during 1997 codification; prior code § 17.395(8))


17.92.050 Jurisdiction.

The jurisdiction of this chapter includes all lands within the city as specified in other sections of this code. (Prior code § 17.395(1)(j))


17.92.060 Municipalities and state agencies regulated.

Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all required permits. State agencies are required to comply if Section 13.48(13), Wisconsin Statutes, applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt from compliance when Section 30.12(4)(a), Wisconsin Statutes, applies. (Prior code § 17.395(1)(k))


17.92.070 Compliance.

The use of wetlands which are regulated under this chapter and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland and nonshoreland areas of the city shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state or federal regulations. (However, see Section 17.92.110 for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a wetland permit unless otherwise expressly excused by a provision of this section and shall meet all applicable local, state and federal regulations. (Prior code § 17.395(1)(c))


17.92.080 Wetland preservation district.

A.    Wetland Preservation Zoning Maps. The following maps are adopted and made part of this chapter and are on file in the office of the director of community development:

1.    The boundaries of the wetland preservation district are based on the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map for the City of Brookfield, dated January 31, 1986, and stamped “FINAL,” and include, but are not limited to, all shoreland wetlands five acres or greater in area shown on that map.

2.    The boundaries of the wetland preservation district are further illustrated on the “City of Brookfield Topographic Maps-Wetland Preservation and Upland Conservancy Zoning Maps,” prepared by the city engineering department at a scale of one inch equals two hundred (200) feet and dated June 18, 1991.

B.    District Boundaries.

1.    The wetland preservation district consists of two classes of wetland which shall be governed by the same use regulations unless otherwise specified.

a.    Shoreland Wetland Subdistrict. Shoreland wetlands are that portion of the wetland preservation district which are shown by the shaded pattern on the afore-referenced “City of Brookfield Topographic Maps-Wetland Preservation and Flood Fringe Zoning Districts.” Shoreland wetlands are five acres or more in area and are located:

i.    Within one thousand (1,000) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds and flowages. The navigability of lakes, ponds or flowages in the city shall be determined by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR);

ii.    Within three hundred (300) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever is greater. For the purpose of this chapter, rivers and streams are presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps until such time that the Department of Natural Resources has made a determination that the waterway is not, in fact, navigable.

b.    Non-Shoreland Wetland Subdistrict. Non-shoreland wetlands are that portion of the wetland preservation district which are shown by the hatch pattern on the afore-referenced “City of Brookfield Topographic Maps-Wetland Preservation and Flood Fringe Zoning Districts.” Non-shoreland wetlands are those wetlands which are:

i.    Not designated as a shoreland wetland;

ii.    Located within a primary environmental corridor delineated on the park and open space plan of the city, or are located outside a Primary Environmental Corridor and are five acres or more in area. In determining if a particular wetland is five acres or larger, the wetland complex, regardless of whether it is divided by property lines or cooperate limit lines, shall be a minimum five acres in area.

2.    When questions of navigability of a stream or the location of the ordinary highwater mark arise, the administrator shall contact the southeast district office of the Department of Natural Resources for a final determination of navigability or ordinary highwater mark.

3.    The boundaries of wetlands, floodplains and shorelands shown on the wetland preservation and flood fringe zoning maps were delineated using the latest aerial photography and topographic cartography available to the city. The maps were prepared to facilitate wetland and floodplain activities only. The city disclaims any representation that the maps show exact boundaries of wetlands, floodplains or shorelands. The city declares that field investigation by a permit applicant or rezoning petitioner to verify wetland, floodplain and shoreland locations is necessary to make such exact boundary determinations. All such verifications shall be reviewed and approved by the city.

4.    When an apparent discrepancy exists or a landowner believes that a discrepancy exists between the city’s final wetland inventory map, or the afore-referenced “City of Brookfield Topographic Maps-Wetland Preservation and Flood Fringe Zoning Districts,” and actual field conditions, the administrator shall contact the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), or agency designated by the DNR, to determine if the wetland inventory map is in error. If the DNR staff, or the designated agency, concurs that the particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the administrator shall have the authority to grant or deny a wetland permit in accordance with the regulations applicable upon correction of the zoning district and to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the wetland inventory map, or the afore-referenced “City of Brookfield Topographic Maps-Wetland Preservation and Flood Fringe Zoning District.” Owners of properties for which corrections are made shall be given ten calendar days advance written notice of the administrator’s intent to make the correction in the zoning district unless the owner(s) waive the ten-day notice.

C.    Permitted Uses. The following uses are permitted, subject to the provisions of Chapters 30 and 31, Wisconsin Statutes; the provisions of other local, state and federal laws, if applicable; and the provisions of the underlying base zoning district:

1.    Activities and uses which do not require the issuance of a wetland permit, provided that no wetland alteration occurs:

a.    Hiking, fishing, swimming, snowmobiling and boating,

b.    The harvesting of wild crops such as marsh hay, ferns, moss, wild rice, berries, tree fruits and tree seeds in a manner that is not injurious to the natural reproduction of such crops,

c.    The practice of silviculture, including the planting, thinning and harvesting of timber,

d.    The pasturing of livestock,

e.    The cultivation of agricultural crops;

2.    Uses which do not require the issuance of a wetland permit and which may involve wetland alterations only to the extent specifically provided below:

a.    The practice of silviculture, including limited temporary water level stabilization measures which are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected,

b.    The maintenance and repair of existing drainage systems to restore pre-existing levels of drainage, including the minimum amount of filling necessary to dispose of dredged spoil, provided that the filling is otherwise permissible and that dredged spoil is placed on existing spoil banks where possible,

c.    The construction and maintenance of fences for the pasturing of livestock, including limited excavating and filling necessary for such construction or maintenance,

d.    The construction and maintenance of piers, docks, walkways, observation decks and trail bridges built on pilings, including limited excavating and filling necessary for such construction or maintenance,

e.    The installation and maintenance of sealed tiles for the purpose of draining lands outside the wetland preservation district; provided, that such installation or maintenance is done in a manner designed to minimize adverse impacts upon the natural functions of the wetland as listed in Section 17.92.120(C),

f.    The maintenance, repair, replacement and reconstruction of existing streets, roads, bridges and bicycle paths, including limited excavating and filling necessary for such maintenance, repair, replacement or reconstruction;

3.    Uses which are allowed upon the issuance of a wetland permit and which may include wetland alterations only to the extent specifically provided below:

f.    Construction of bike paths including excavating and filling necessary for such construction according to city specifications in nonshoreland wetland subdistricts. (Prior code § 17.395(2))

D.    Prohibited Uses.

1.    Any use not listed as a permitted use is prohibited unless the zoning classification of wetland preservation district on the lands concerned is amended and changed to another district in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 17.92.120.

2.    The use of a boathouse for human habitation and the construction or placement of a boathouse or fixed boathouse below the ordinary high-water mark of any navigable water are prohibited.

E.    Shoreland Areas (SP).

1.    For any shoreland area annexed by the city after May 7, 1982, there is hereby established a shoreland setback area of at least fifty (50) feet from the ordinary high-water mark excepting construction of a principal building within this setback area if the land immediately adjacent on each side of the land on which the principal building will be constructed also has a principal building. In such a case, the setback is the same distance as the average setback of the adjacent principal buildings or thirty-five (35) feet from the ordinary high-water mark, whichever is greater.

2.    Any owner of shoreland property annexed by the city after May 7, 1982, that contains vegetation shall maintain the vegetation in a vegetative buffer zone along the entire shoreline of the property and extending thirty-five (35) feet inland from the ordinary high-water of the navigable water excepting that if the vegetation in the vegetative buffer zone contains invasive species or dead or diseased vegetation, the owner may remove it. If the owner removes all of the vegetation, the owner must establish a vegetative buffer zone with new vegetation.

3.    An owner required to maintain a vegetative buffer zone of a shoreland area annexed by the city after May 7, 1982, may remove all of the vegetation in a part of that zone in order to establish a viewing or access corridor that is no greater than thirty (30) feet wide for every one hundred (100) feet of shoreline frontage and extending no more than thirty-five (35) feet inland from the ordinary high-water mark.

17.92.100 Nonconforming structures and uses.

A.    The lawful use of a building, structure or property which existed at the time this chapter, or an applicable amendment to this chapter, took effect and which is not in conformity with the provisions of the chapter, including the routine maintenance of such a building or structure, may be continued, subject to the following conditions.

B.    The wetland preservation provisions of this chapter as set forth in Section 62.231(5), Wisconsin Statutes, shall not limit the repair, reconstruction, renovation, remodeling or expansion of a nonconforming building or structure in existence on the effective date of the wetland provisions of this code, or of any environmental control facility in existence on May 7, 1982 related to such a building or structure. All other modifications to nonconforming buildings and structures are subject to Section 17.08.040.

C.    If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming building or structure is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months, any future use of the building, structure or property shall conform to this chapter.

D.    Any legal nonconforming use of property which does not involve the use of a building or structure and which existed at the time of the adoption or subsequent amendment of this chapter adopted pursuant to Section 62.231, Wisconsin Statutes, may be continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of this section. However, such nonconforming use may not be extended or expanded.

E.    Uses which are nuisances under common law shall not be permitted to continue as nonconforming uses. (Prior code § 17.395(4))

Chapter 17.98 MODIFIED SUBURBAN OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sections:

17.98.010    Statement of purpose.

17.98.020    Overlay district in relation to other zoning.

17.98.030    Overlay district requirements.

17.98.040    Matrix identifying standards for each zoning issue area.

17.98.050    Specific zoning overlay areas.


17.98.010 Statement of purpose.

The purpose of the modified suburban overlay district is to supersede certain provisions of base zoning in certain areas when other available zoning tools or other techniques cannot achieve desired results with standards to protect unique development, building or land use patterns in residential, commercial or mixed-use areas when such patterns are not adequately addressed by applicable zoning regulations; promote reinvestment and redevelopment in residential, commercial, or mixed-use areas where change is desired and when existing zoning regulations hinder achievement of the desired change; or help implement neighborhood plans or planning studies. (Ord. 2577-19 § 1, 2019; Ord. 1692 § 1 (part), 1999)


17.98.020 Overlay district in relation to other zoning.

Each modified suburban overlay district may be used to relax or eliminate requirements of the base zoning districts or to impose additional requirements than those stated in the base zoning district. Where conflict occurs among two or more overlay districts applicable to the same property, the most restrictive of the conflicting provisions prevails. (Ord. 2577-19 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1740 § 1 (part), 2000: Ord. 1692 § 1 (part), 1999)


17.98.030 Overlay district requirements.

Whenever this overlay district is applied to a particular geographic area, the common council will adopt a map or map series showing the geographic extent of the overlay district, the zoning issue area, planning unit, and any parcel(s) within each overlay zoning district. The associated map is considered a supplement document adopted and incorporated herein by reference. The common council will also set forth the permitted uses, if different than the base zoning, and particular standards for each overlay district; the standards may include, but are not limited to, the size, scale, and height of buildings, hours of operation, traffic control, noise control, lighting, odor control, impervious surface coverage, and landscaping.

A.    Development Patterns. New development and redevelopment of properties designated as having a development pattern of new suburban (NS), cluster suburban (CS), combination (CS/NS), residential cluster (RC), context suburban (CTS), or traditional neighborhood development (TND) will be required to achieve the following design characteristics, summarized here and described more specifically for each geographical area.

1. Cluster Suburban. A development pattern where buildings are positioned and clustered on a site in a manner that creates a well-defined pedestrian environment between building entrances. Minimal parking is located in the area between the building cluster and the street (a maximum of a double-row of parking). Cluster suburban acknowledges that most people will drive in their autos to destinations, but will seek to walk between buildings in the cluster area. The development style minimizes the auto-oriented environment along the street and configures buildings to encourage pedestrian usage. The street-side and pedestrian-side building facades convey human scale through fenestration, articulation, detailing or landscape plantings.

2. New Suburban. A development pattern where buildings are oriented toward the street with at least one major pedestrian entrance connected to the street/pedestrian way. No parking is located in the area between the building and the street. A well-defined pedestrian environment is developed between the edge of the street and the street-side facade of the building. While most people will drive their autos to destinations in a new suburban development, greater opportunities for pedestrian access to sites will be created. The street-side building facade conveys human scale through fenestration, articulation, detailing or landscape plantings.

3. Residential Cluster. A residential development pattern characterized by a unified site design for a number of housing units, clustering buildings and providing common open space, potential density increases, and a mix of building types. It permits the planning of a project and the calculation of densities over the entire development, rather than on an individual lot-by-lot basis. Where sites with this development pattern are adjacent to sites planned for a new suburban or cluster suburban development pattern, street yard building setbacks shall approximate those called for in those development pattern standards.

4. Context Suburban (CTS). A development pattern in which development or redevelopment on a parcel that is within a neighborhood context of relatively newer or historic buildings may develop consistent with the building layout and parking layout of the neighborhood context.

5. Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND). A development pattern consisting of a compact, mixed-use neighborhood where residential, commercial and civic buildings are in close proximity to each other, as defined in Section 66.1027(1)(c), Wisconsin Statutes. This development pattern is created by title only to indicate intent of the city to conform with the requirements of the state law. The development pattern may be able to be achieved under one or more of the other development patterns defined in this section or additional development pattern provisions may be incorporated by later amendments, consulting with a document identified as “Model Ordinance for Traditional Neighborhood Development,” dated December, 2000, published by the University of Wisconsin – Extension pursuant to Section 66.1027(2), Wisconsin Statutes, as a nonexclusive and nonbinding guide to the form of development.

6. Combined Development Patterns. Where properties are designated in the matrix found in the following Section 17.98.040 as having a combination of development patterns, the plan commission will allow a combination of patterns within a single site or within a planning unit as defined herein.

7. Standards for the Removal of a Development Pattern Designation. The plan commission may, after finding that a development pattern designated in a matrix for the nonresidential use of a specific property does not serve in the best interests of the community due to the proximity of the residential properties and the existence of certain conditions including, but not limited to, topography, lot size, lot depth, or the impact of a permitted intensive use on adjacent residential properties, recommend that the common council remove the development pattern designation through an amendment to the matrix and removal or amendment of the associated map as needed.

B. Dimensional Standards.

1. As necessary, the development pattern designations will require site plans with dimensional characteristics different than those required by the underlying base zoning. The application of this overlay district constitutes authorization to the plan commission to modify dimensional requirements of underlying base zoning to achieve the purposes and the intent of the development patterns.

The following set of illustrations shows how such modifications may be made to achieve certain standards of the development patterns:

a. Building Setbacks from Streets for “New Suburban” Development. Twenty-five (25) foot1 minimum to seventy (70) foot maximum setback along a street for “new suburban” frontage where a single building is located on an individual lot. Where building clusters are developed on larger lots, the minimum and maximum building setbacks apply only to the building adjacent to street, but the number of buildings set back more than the minimum twenty-five (25) feet or a setback close to twenty-five (25) feet will be minimized.


[IMAGE]


b.    Building Setbacks from Streets for “Cluster Suburban” Development. Twenty-five (25) foot minimum and seventy (70) foot maximum setback if no parking is located in the space between the building and the street. Seventy-five (75) foot minimum (single loading parking) and a one hundred twenty-five (125) foot maximum (double loaded parking) setback when parking is located in such space. Where building clusters are developed on larger lots, the minimum and maximum building setbacks apply only to the buildings adjacent to street, but the number of buildings set back more than the minimum of seventy-five (75) feet or a setback close to seventy-five (75) feet will be minimized.
[IMAGE]


c.    Parking Offset. A minimum of twenty-five (25) feet shall be maintained from back of curb (parking lot) to rear and/or side lot line when commercial use adjoins any residential district, except for intensive uses as regulated elsewhere in this code where greater separations are required. This space shall be developed as a landscaped feature. Minimum height of the landscape buffer shall be three feet. Design specifications are found within the Site Development Standards for Nonresidential Uses.

d.    Landscape Design. Allow parking lot “planting islands” to be consolidated (normally one planting island per twenty (20) parking spaces is required) to create larger landscaped areas within parking lots. Minimum dimensions for the consolidated planting islands shall be twelve (12) feet wide from back of curb to back of curb. Islands shall be a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) feet long to achieve maximum visual effect and plant massing.
[IMAGE]


2.    The dimensional standards in areas designated as Context Suburban (CTS) Development Pattern may be established by the city to establish reasonable consistency with the siting and other dimensional characteristics of relatively newer or other buildings in the contextual vicinity. The diagram below shows one illustration.
[IMAGE]


3.    The matrix will also show dimensional standards that are not related to Development Patterns.

4.    Transfer of Development Rights. If listed within the matrix for the district, the available floor area or lot coverage assigned under the base zoning of a zoning issue area (“sending site”) can be transferred to another zoning issue area (“receiving site”) located within the planning unit or adjacent planning unit provided there is a corresponding reduction in available floor area and lot coverage on the sending site. In addition, a reduction in landscape surface ratio can be established on the receiving site provided there is a corresponding increase in landscape surface ratio on the sending site.

C.    Uses Allowed or Disallowed.

1.    Where indicated in the matrix, the overlay district allows specified uses in addition to those allowed in the underlying base zoning throughout the overlay district.

2.    Where specified in the matrix, the overlay district disallows uses that otherwise would be allowable by the underlying base zoning throughout the overlay district.

3.    The allowance of a use by the base zoning or the use provisions of the overlay district does not exempt new development or redevelopment of a particular use from complying with the other requirements of the overlay district, such as those dealing with site development standards, intensive use, or conditional use requirements.

D.    Planning Units and Nodes. Within the Section 17.98.040 matrix, planning units are depicted on the map series associated with the applicable MSO district. Such planning units may contain a node identified in the city comprehensive plan.

E.    Special Characteristics. This portion of the matrix defines other standards for the associated MSO district.

F.    Additional Standards. In addition to any standards set forth in this chapter, all nonresidential site plans shall comply with the most recent edition of the Site Development Standards for Nonresidential Uses. If a conflict occurs between the language of the Site Development Standards for Nonresidential Uses and this chapter, the language of this chapter shall control.

17.100.010 Findings.

The council declares that the standard regulation of uses, other than on parcels containing single-family residences, consisting of blanket permission for enumerated permitted uses, has proven unsatisfactory and there is a need for supplementary regulations as hereinafter set forth. Standard regulation has resulted in the concentration of like or identical uses, traffic problems, failure and abandonment of many of the uses, visual blight, vandalism and adverse effect upon the values of neighboring properties and the city’s tax base. (Ord. 2606-20 § 27, 2020: prior code § 17.035(1))


17.100.020 Plan commission and council approval required.

A.    In addition to compliance with other requirements of this code relating to zoning, building, use, stormwater control, and site approval, no building permit shall be issued for a multifamily, commercial, or industrial structure or use, nor shall an occupancy permit be issued for a change of use in an existing structure until the plan commission has approved the location, the new, revised, or minor revision plan and method of operation, and suitability of the site for the use requested, except as provided in subsection (B) of this section. Any plan commission decision hereunder shall be subject to council approval, disapproval or modification at the next regular council meeting unless the time for such action is extended by the council. All applicants seeking approvals under this section shall observe the procedures set forth in this chapter.

B.    For existing developments, the director of community development is authorized to administratively approve changes that do not require either a revision or minor revision to the plan and method of operation. Such activities include a reconfiguration of parking lot markings that does not substantially alter parking supply or impact on the site, replacing a roof, replacement of doors or windows, updating or revising a landscape plan, nonmaterial modifications to the facade such as the installation or enlargement of a garage door, door or window treatment, or other change that does not adversely affect traffic or drainage, materially change the architectural design, or approve unauthorized land use.

C.    In this title the following terms shall be defined as:

“Material” means having real importance or great consequences.

“Minor revision to plan and method of operation” means a modification to an approved development’s plan and method of operation such as the addition of outdoor seating at a restaurant or food service operation, an addition to a parking lot, or other similar changes as determined by the director of community development.

“New plan and method of operation” means an application relating to the development of vacant land or the redevelopment of land that was once improved, but is now in a vacant state as a result of the razing of all of the improvements on the land.

“Plan and method of operation” means the outline of the physical development of any parcel, except ones containing single-family residences and their accessory structures, consisting of numerous components as well as the method of operating the use. The components include the items required under Section 17.100.050 which are: the method of operation statement, area study map, site plan, preliminary grading and drainage plan, building plans, building material specifications, architectural rendering, site landscape plan, exterior signs, and any other information deemed necessary for the plan commission to determine whether the proposed development is a permitted use for the site.

“Revised plan and method of operation” means an application relating to an approved development that involves an event which is a triggering event under Resolution No. 4286, adopted May 1, 1990, including, but not limited to because of enumeration, new building construction, building expansion, exterior architectural alteration, or change in use.

The legend and plan should clearly distinguish between existing and proposed plantings. A copy of the standards is available on the city’s website or for purchase in the department. If any provision of the Brookfield Municipal Code conflicts or is inconsistent with the Nonresidential Development Landscape Standards, the provisions of the code shall apply.

2.    Street-Yard Requirements.

a.    Findings. The council hereby finds that street-yard landscaping is for the good of the public health and safety and, therefore, is an improvement required from developers or property owners for all new multifamily, two-family, and nonresidential development which abuts upon any public or private street.

b.    Definitions. The following definitions apply in this section:

“Department” means the community development department.

“Developer” means the person submitting an application for site plan approval.

“Security” means letter of credit or cash deposit.

c.    Street-Yard Plan. Prior to the approval of a site plan pursuant to this subsection, the developer or property owner shall submit a landscape plan in compliance with the plan requirements and procedures provided in the most recent edition of the Nonresidential Development Landscape Standards.

d.    Financial Security and Easement. If the developer or property owner has not fully installed the landscaping at the time of the final site plan approval, the developer or property owner shall comply with the following:

i.    Landscape Installation. To secure installation of the landscaping, the developer or property owner shall deposit with the city a security in an amount specified in Section 3.28.010(P), less the value of the landscaping completed to date and/or any credit for existing and qualified landscaping based on current landscape installation costs for material and labor. The city attorney shall approve any security submitted. The security will remain in force until all required landscaping has been completed and approved by the department.

ii.    Replacement Landscaping. The developer or property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance and replacement of any landscaping for three years after the date of approval of installation from the department. To ensure the maintenance of the landscaping, the developer shall deposit with the city a security in an amount specified in Section 3.28.010(Q). In lieu of posting a second security, the developer or property owner may request that the security for installation of the landscaping be reduced to the amount required in this subsection. The amount of the security shall remain in force until ninety (90) days after the end of the three-year maintenance period.

iii.    Temporary Easement. The property owner shall grant to the city a temporary easement granting access to the city or its authorized agents to perform the initial landscape installation, installation of replacement landscaping, or landscaping maintenance if the developer or property owner fails to comply with the time requirements set forth in this section or the city receives notification of the expiration or cancellation of the security. The city attorney shall approve any terms and conditions of the easement. The easement shall not terminate until ninety (90) days after the end of the three-year maintenance period.

e.    Time for Installation. All landscaping shall be installed no later than one year from the date of final site approval, unless the plan commission grants an extension. If the date of final site approval occurs between September 30th and May 1st, the developer shall automatically be granted an extension beyond the initial one-year period until the next occurrence of June 1st.

f.    Enforcement. Upon completion of the landscape installation, the developer or property owner shall notify the department so that it can inspect the installation. If inspection reveals that the landscaping installation is fully completed and meets the requirements of this section, the department will issue an installation certificate and authorize the release or reduction of the security required for the landscape installation. If the developer or property owner does not comply with the landscape installation per the time required by this section, the city or its authorized agents may install the landscaping and deduct the same from the security. Upon written notification from the city that the landscaping needs replacement or maintenance, the developer or property owner shall ensure that such landscaping is replaced or maintained within thirty (30) days of the date of notification, or if additional time is necessary due to growing conditions, by the date determined by the department and set forth in the written notification. If the developer or property owner fails to make such replacement or maintenance, the city or its authorized agents may install or maintain the landscaping and deduct the same from the security required for maintenance.

I.    Exterior Signs. Two copies of plans, renderings or other pictorialization of any exterior signs shall be submitted with the application for each nonresidential use. The sign portions of the application are submitted for informational purposes as part of the application and require separate application to the building inspection department for final approval and submission to the plan review board, if applicable.

J.    Other. Any other information that is deemed necessary to properly address the request such as traffic studies, a building model, sanitary sewer and water utility locations, etc.

K.    In any case where the applicant proposes to increase the area of impervious surfaces, a stormwater management plan application is required under the provisions of Title 14.

L.    Exceptions for Minor Change to Plan and Method of Operation Applications. Application submittal requirements of subsections (B), (E), (F), (G), and (I) of this section do not apply to minor changes to plan and method of operation and subsections (D) and (H) of this section can be waived by the director of community development depending on the type of project.

M.    The director of community development may waive any of the above documents or information where deliberation by the plan commission or plan review board is unnecessary in the director’s opinion. (Ord. 2595-20 § 4, 2020; Ord. 2440-15 §§ 5—7, 2015; Ord. 2315-13 § 1 (part), 2013; Ord. 2129-08 §§ 2, 3, 2008; Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1912-03 § 1 (part), 2003; Ord. 1725 § 4, 2000; Ord. 1551 §§ 1, 2, 1996; prior code § 17.035(3)(b))

The application deadline for the plan commission and plan review board is as follows:

A.    Plan commission: fifteen (15) days prior to meeting.

B.    Plan review board: ten days prior to meeting.

A pre-application conference shall be arranged by the applicant in advance of these deadlines. (Prior code § 17.035(3)(c))


17.100.070 Plan commission’s decision—Basis of determination.

The plan commission’s decision shall be based on its determination that the proposed structure and use will or will not:

A.    Have a substantial adverse effect on the property values of neighboring properties;

B.    Have a substantial adverse effect on traffic safety;

C.    Be inconsistent with the purposes of this code;

D.    Be inadequately served with present or planned municipal services;

E.    Result in an undue concentration of like or identical uses;

F.    Be substantially in conformance with the Site Development Standards For Nonresidential Uses, March 1990, amended July 2010, and the Non-Residential Development Landscape Standards, February 1996, where applicable, which are adopted by reference and made a part hereof; provided, the plan commission may determine a standard (other than a mandatory standard) may be modified or waived consistent with the spirit and intent of these ordinances; and the plan commission may modify the standards for lot coverage, landscape surface ratio and intensive use offsets in approving amendments for developments approved prior to May 1, 1990;

G.    Be substantially in conformance with the city’s comprehensive plan or relevant portions thereof.

H.    Right-of-Way Dedication. In the event the plan commission determines that the plan and method of operation will generate a probable negative impact on traffic safety, an increase in traffic volume, or some other aspect of traffic flow which can be alleviated by a future road improvement or widening of the roadway abutting the subject property, the plan commission shall require the dedication of land necessary for the ultimate public right-of-way, or any portions thereof, measured from the center line of streets established on the highway width ordinance of Waukesha County, the city master plan or the official map of the city. In addition, the plan commission may require the construction of acceleration/deceleration or bypass lanes where traffic concerns warrant. (Ord. 2231-10 § 1, 2010; Ord. 1737 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1551 § 3, 1996; prior code § 17.035(4))


17.100.080 Termination of approval and completion schedule.

As part of the review and approval of an application under this chapter, certain expectations regarding the commencement and completion of the project may be established by the council or plan commission.

A.    Termination of Approval if Project Is Not Commenced. The council, or the plan commission with council approval, may establish a termination date or reverter for any approval under this chapter. Such date or reverter shall be effective twenty-four (24) months after the date of such approval, unless otherwise established by the council or plan commission, and shall be set forth in the minutes of the council or plan commission. A certified excerpt thereof shall be recorded with the register of deeds where the council or the plan commission considers it appropriate. No further notice or hearing shall be required for such reverter or termination to occur. It is the intent of the council that where proposed projects are not substantially underway by the date of such approval, the approval shall terminate; however, where substantial progress has been made by said date, the council may extend it. Substantial progress shall be evidenced by the petitioner securing valid building permits for the project. Where appropriate, “substantial progress” can be defined in a development agreement or approved new or revised plan and method of operation outlining a percentage of completed construction or project phasing which shall be considered substantial progress for purposes of this chapter.

B.    Completion Schedule. In addition to establishing an expected commencement deadline for the project, the council, or the plan commission with council approval, may establish a completion schedule on a case-by-case basis including a project commencement date, site improvement completion date and a building construction completion date and associated specifications for any site or building construction approved under this chapter. Such completion schedule shall begin with any site or building construction authorized by the city and shall be adhered to per the written specifications established by the council or plan commission. The completion schedule and associated specifications shall be set forth in the minutes of the council or plan commission and development agreement when an agreement is required. A certified excerpt thereof shall be recorded with the register of deeds where the council or the plan commission considers it appropriate. No further notice or hearing shall be required for the city to enforce the completion schedule and associated specifications. Violations of this section are subject to the provisions of Section 17.100.130 of this chapter.

C.    Appeals. Any individual responsible for compliance of the above provisions of this section can file an appeal under the provisions of this chapter if the party feels aggrieved by any decision of the administrative office or body enforcing the provisions of this section. (Ord. 2220-10 §§ 1, 2, 2010; Ord. 2134-08 § 7, 2008: prior code § 17.035(5))


17.100.090 Use or development approval—Limitations.

A use or development approved under this chapter shall be strictly limited to the location, and plan and method of operation as approved. (Amended during 1/21/16 update; prior code § 17.035(6))


17.100.100 Park and recreational transportation trail, wetland preservation and bikeway development impact fees.

In accordance with the city park and open space plan, it is the policy of the city to provide parks and recreational transportation trails for the residents of the city and to acquire and preserve significant wetland areas. The city bikeway master plan recommends the development of a system of bikeways as an alternate means of transportation in the city. The common council of the city has determined that it is equitable for new residential development in the city to make a fair share contribution toward the cost of acquiring and developing parks and recreational transportation trails and acquiring and preserving wetlands and developing bikeways in the city. Accordingly, any property in the city for which parklands or wetlands have not been dedicated or for which a bikeway has not been constructed in accordance with Section 16.16.020, said lands upon which a building permit is being applied for shall pay a one-time park and recreational transportation trail fee, a one-time wetland preservation fee and a one-time bikeway fee within fourteen (14) days of issuance of a building permit.

A.    A park and recreational transportation trail fee in the amount set forth below shall be deposited with the Department of Building Inspection for payment to the city treasurer within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of a building permit. The city treasurer shall place the fee in a nonlapsing separate, segregated, interest-bearing account for city parks and recreational transportation trails which fund shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and which shall be used exclusively for the acquisition and development of parks, playgrounds and recreational transportation trails within the city.

1.    Park and Recreational Transportation Trail Fee Amounts; Zones. For purposes of determining park and recreational transportation trail fee amounts, the city identifies zones corresponding to land sections as identified in a map entitled “City of Brookfield Land Section Map.” This map is adopted by reference within Section 17.100.120 entitled: “Development Impact Fee Administration.” A copy of the map may be found in the city clerk’s office.

2.    Park and recreational transportation trail fees for all land sections in the city except Sections 5 and 13 shall be as specified in Section 15.28.010.

3.    Park and recreational transportation trail fees for lands in Section 5 shall be as specified in Section 15.28.010. (No multiple-family development is planned in Section 5.)

4.    Park and recreational transportation trail fees for lands in Section 13 shall be as specified in Section 15.28.010.

B.    A wetland preservation fee in the amount set forth below for each dwelling unit shall be deposited with the Department of Building Inspection for payment to the city treasurer within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of the building permit. The city treasurer shall place the fee in a nonlapsing separate, segregated, interest-bearing account for wetlands preservation, which fund shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and which shall be used exclusively for the acquisition and preservation of wetlands within the city.

1.    Wetland preservation impact fee amounts. The wetland preservation impact fee is uniform throughout all land sections of the city.

2.    Wetland preservation impact fees shall be as specified in Section 15.28.010(A)(2).

C.    A bikeway fee in the amount specified in Section 15.28.010 shall be paid to the city treasurer prior to the issuance of the building permit. The city treasurer shall place the fee in a nonlapsing separate, segregated, interest-bearing account for bikeways, which fund shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and which shall be used exclusively for the development of bikeways within the city. (Ord. 2103-07 § 4 (part), 2007: Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1608 § 1 (part), 1997)


17.100.110 Wetland preservation and bikeway fees—Nonresidential development.

In accordance with the city park and open space plan, it is the policy of the city to acquire and preserve wetland areas. In addition, the city bikeway master plan recommends the development of a system of bikeways as an alternate means of transportation in the city. The common council of the city has determined that it is fair and equitable for new development in the city to make a contribution toward the cost of acquiring and preserving wetlands, and establishing bikeways in the city. Accordingly, any property in the city for which parklands or wetlands have not been dedicated or for which a bikeway has not been constructed in accordance with Section 16.16.020, said lands upon which a building permit is being applied for shall pay a one-time park and recreational transportation trail fee, a one-time wetland preservation fee and a one-time bikeway fee within fourteen (14) days of issuance of a building permit.

If the building permit application is for an addition to a previously constructed building, the basis for the one-time fee shall be the area of the addition divided by the floor area ratio for the district in which the building is located. The result, expressed in thousands of square feet shall be used to calculate the fee specified in Sections 15.28.010. (For example, a thirty thousand (30,000) square foot nonresidential building addition in a zoning district with a floor area ratio of .30 requires a one hundred thousand (100,000) square foot lot.)

A.    A wetland preservation fee in the amount specified in Section 15.28.010 shall be deposited with the Department of Building Inspection for payment to the city treasurer within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of the building permit. The city treasurer shall place the fee in a nonlapsing separate, segregated, interest-bearing account for wetland preservation, which fund shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and which shall be used exclusively for the acquisition of wetlands within the city.

B.    A bikeway fee in the amount specified in Section 15.28.010 shall be deposited with the Department of Building Inspection for payment to the city treasurer within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of the building permit. The city treasurer shall place the fee in a nonlapsing separate, segregated, interest-bearing account for bikeways, which fund shall be separate from the general fund of the city, and which shall be used exclusively for the development of bikeways within the city. (Ord. 2103-07 § 4 (part), 2007: Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1608 § 1 (part), 1997)


17.100.120 Development impact fee administration.

A.    The ordinance codified in Sections 17.100.100 through 17.100.120 is intended to allocate financial burdens of providing public facilities fairly between existing city residents and owners of existing land and property improvements within the city on the one hand and developers and owners of new land developments on the other, and to comply with Wisconsin Statutes Section 66.0617 on municipal impact fees.

B.    The development fees that the city deems to be impact fees shall be exclusively the following:

1.    Park and recreational transportation trail fees, wetland preservation fees and bikeway fees under Sections 17.100.100 and 17.100.110.

C.    The following city documents on file at the office of the city clerk contain the needs assessments for the impact fees listed under subsection B of this section and document city compliance with the procedural requirements of the Wisconsin Statutes.

1.    “City of Brookfield, Public Facilities Needs Assessment For Parks and Recreational Trails and Wetland Preservations, November, 1996" prepared by the city department of community development;

2.    Public hearing notice, January 7, 1997, and March 4, 1997;

3.    Minutes of January 7, 1997 and March 4, 1997 common council public hearings.

D.    Revenues collected as impact fees shall be placed by the city treasurer in separate, segregated interest-bearing accounts and shall be accounted for separately from other funds of the city. Impact fee revenues and interest earned on impact fee revenues may be expended on a first in, first out basis by the city only for the capital costs for which the impact fees were imposed. Separate accounts shall be kept of fees collected from different impact fee zones, where the particular impact fee ordinance provides for differential fees according to zones (land sections) and revenues collected in particular zones shall be spent in those zones as appropriate.

E.    The map adopted by Ordinance 1608, a copy of which can be found in the clerk’s office, shows land sections as the basis for differential impact fee zones.

F.    The city determines the following lengths of time appropriate for the planning, financing, acquisition and construction and/or equipment of the public facilities listed below:

	Type of Facility	Maximum Time to Use Impact Fees that are Collected from the Time of Fee Collection

	Park and recreational transportation trail	7 years

	Wetland acquisition	7 years

	Bike paths	7 years

Fees that are held by the city and not used within the time period specified herein to pay the indicated capital costs shall be refunded to the owners of record of the properties from which the fee was collected at the time of refund plus interest.

G.    Appeals may be brought by developers or owners as defined in Wisconsin Statutes Section 66.0617(1)(b) as provided herein:

1.    It shall be a condition to the lodging of such an appeal that the impact fee appealed from shall be paid as and when the fee or any installments thereof become due and payable and upon default in making any such payment, such appeal shall be dismissed.

2.    The only questions that are appealable under this section are the following, pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes Section 66.0617(10):

a.    The amount of fee charged to and paid by the appellant developer or owner with respect to a particular development and fee payment for that development;

b.    The method of collection of the fee;

c.    The use of the particular fee charged to and paid by the appellant developer.

A challenge to the use of impact fees that are collected shall address solely the question of whether the fees are being used for the purposes for which they were collected within the allowable time established under subsection F of this section. Appeals as to use of proceeds are not entitled to challenge the city’s public facility plans or needs assessments.

3.    Pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes Section 66.0617(6)(g), the appeal board may authorize the payment of a fee that is otherwise payable at the time of issuance of a zoning or building permit or other required municipal approval as specified within the ordinance imposing the particular impact fee in installment payments. The appeal board may require that interest be paid on installment payments at a rate comparable to the rate charged by the city on installment payments of special assessments modified to reflect then-current interest costs or interest cost estimates.

H.    Appeals must be brought within thirty (30) days of the date of payment of the impact fee by the appellant.

I.    For purposes of this section, the common council of the city shall be the hearing board and notices of appeal shall be filed with the city clerk. An application fee to bring an appeal shall be paid at the time of the filing of the appeal in the amount specified in Section 15.28.010. The appeal fee is nonrefundable and failure to pay this amount shall cause the appeal to be dismissed. (Ord. 2103-07 § 4 (part), 2007: Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1912-03 § 2 (part), 2003; Ord. 1819 § 3 (part), 2001; Ord. 1608 § 3, 1997)

No building shall be erected, structurally altered or moved from one location to another in the city which shall be of such character as to adversely affect the property values and general desirability of the neighborhood.

A.    The building inspector shall submit any such case in question to the plan commission for their determination.

B.    The plan commission shall base its determination upon the following considerations:

1.    Design or appearance of such unorthodox or abnormal character in relation to the surroundings as to be considered unsightly or offensive to the degree that would have a substantial adverse effect on property values in the neighborhood;

2.    Identical design and appearance with adjoining buildings to the degree that monotony and commonness could have an adverse effect on the property values and general desirability of the neighborhood.

C.    The decision of the plan commission shall be stated in writing including the reason for refusing a permit or any conditions of approval. (Prior code § 17.06(3))


17.104.040 Storage of uncovered equipment or materials.

The building inspector or any affected property owner may present such a case, in writing, to the plan commission for determination, and a copy of such presentation shall be mailed to the alleged violator of this provision at least ten days prior to the plan commission meeting thereon and he shall be permitted to present evidence in defense of his storage arrangement. The plan commission shall be entitled to issue written orders stating the manner and time in which such storage shall be enclosed or rearranged or relocated so as to eliminate such adverse effect.

B.    Such that there is no probability of damage resulting to the building or to any other building on the lot or on an abutting property by reason of the combined effect of the proposed grade and the already existing grades of buildings on the lot or on abutting property;

C.    Such that erosion will be avoided as far as practicable;

D.    Such that no unreasonable hazard to traffic or streets will result. (Ord. 1709 § 1, 1999; prior code § 17.06(5))


17.104.060 Preservation of topography.

In order to protect the property owner from possible damage due to change in the existing grade of adjoining lands and to aid in preserving and protecting the natural beauty and character of the landscape, no change in the existing topography of any land shall be made which would result in raising or lowering the elevation at any point by more than one-fourth of the number of feet by which such point is removed from the nearest property line, except with the approval of the plan commission. (Prior code § 17.06(6))


17.104.070 Prohibited practices.

No person shall use a business, industrial or commercial property, except in accordance with the provisions of the location, and plan and method of operation approved by the plan commission and the council.

“Street event” means an organized competition, contest or event of twenty-five (25) or more people who travel on foot, wheelchair, bicycle or similar device, upon any public street, sidewalk or bikepath that does not comply with normal and usual traffic regulations or controls.

2.    Parades and Street Events Prohibited Without a Permit. It shall be unlawful for any person to conduct a parade or street event in or upon any public street, sidewalk or bikepath in the city of Brookfield or knowingly participate in such parade or street event unless and until a permit to conduct such parade or street event has been obtained.

C.    Block Party Permits. A permit shall be required for the blocking of streets for the conducting of a block party. The director of public works or his designee is given authorization to issue block party permits. The procedures and requirements of subsection (E) of this section shall not apply to block party permits.

1.    Barricades Needed. At the time of the issuance of the permit the applicant shall pay to the city a fee as shown in the fee schedule for rental of barricades that are needed for such street closing.

The applicant shall be required to pick up and return the barricades from the highway division located at the public works building during the regular working hours of the highway division. The applicant shall sign for and accept responsibility for the barricades and return thereof. If the barricades are not returned within three working days of the listed date of the block party, the barricades may be picked up by the city and the applicant shall be billed a fee as shown in the fee schedule for such service. If barricades are damaged or not in the same condition as when they were originally picked up, the city shall bill the applicant for repair or replacement of the barricade, whichever is less.

2.    Public’s Rights Retained. Such permit shall not be allowed to unreasonably interfere with the public’s right to use such street nor completely prevent access to and from properties located on the street involved.

4.    Other Requirements. Block parties are allowed for only those residents of the block attending, or residents of the subdivision. Private parties celebrating birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, etc. do not fall within the definition of a block party. If an objection to the plans is made, the applicant must cooperate and accommodate the plans to satisfy the objection. This can be done by choosing a more accommodating date or time or blocking only part of the street.

D.    Exclusions. Temporary uses located within city parks shall be excluded from the provisions of this section, but shall meet the rules and requirements established by the park and recreation commission and other applicable provisions of this code.

E.    Procedure.

1.    Application. Applications for temporary use permit shall be submitted at least sixty (60) days prior to the parade or special event to the zoning and building administrator on a form provided by the administrator or designee.

2.    Initial Permit, Review and Recommendation. The administrator or designee shall review the initial permit application and shall forward the application, together with his recommendation, to the plan review board or its designee. In making his recommendation, the administrator or designee shall consider such factors as traffic safety; appropriate vehicular access and circulation; available parking; public safety, including provision for security personnel; generation of noise; hours of operation; accurate description of area to be used; detailed plan for cleanup of any public areas after the event; sanitary facilities and any substantially adverse effect upon adjoining properties or public streets, the administrator or designee may request reports and/or recommendations from other city departments, including, but not limited to, the police and fire departments, for assistance in preparing the recommendation.

3.    Determination of Plan Review Board. Upon reviewing the application and the recommendation of the administrator or designee, the board or its designee may approve, approve conditionally or deny the application. If denied, the reasons for denial shall be included in the minutes of the meeting. 

4.    The applicant for a temporary use permit for parades or other street events shall agree to indemnify, defend, and hold the city and its employees and agents harmless against all claims, actions, liability, loss, damages, judgments, costs or fees of any kind incurred by the city on account of any injury to or death of any person or damage to property caused by or resulting from the act, error, omission or activities for which the permit is granted. The requirement of insurance shall be determined according to objective standards including but not limited to the size and nature of the event, the number of expected participants, and the potential for physical injury or property damage caused by participants. The indemnification required herein shall not be limited by reason of the specification of any particular insurance coverage required for a permit. If insurance has been determined to be required for an event under subsection (B) of this section, the applicant shall comply with the following:

The insurance required by the city of Brookfield is primary coverage and any insurance or self insurance maintained by the city of Brookfield, its officers, council members, agents, employees or authorized volunteers will not contribute to a loss. All insurance shall be in full force prior to commencing the event and remain in force throughout the entire event, including the cleanup period after the event, and shall comply with requirements set forth in Chapter 3.30 of this code unless otherwise determined by the common council.

5.    The administrator or designee can request a cash deposit to secure the cleanup of temporary use sites related to parades and other events along with a cash deposit to cover the actual costs incurred by the city of Brookfield police and fire departments and the public works department. These shall include the actual costs of each hour of service per officer required to direct traffic, control the crowd, or otherwise related to the conduct and supervision of the parade or event and the dispersal of the crowd thereafter, the cost to provide fire and paramedic services, or each hour of service per employee required to position barricades, sweep streets and post signage, and for the actual cost of all other city equipment, materials or services incurred.

The applicant shall be responsible for any cost incurred by the Brookfield police department, and the Brookfield public works department, or for other city equipment, materials or services as described above, over and above the deposit amount, and will be billed for excess within thirty (30) days after the completion of the parade or event. Failure to pay the amount billed may be used as a basis to deny future parade or event applications. The city attorney is authorized to commence an action to collect the unpaid amount. Any unused portion of the deposit will be refunded to the applicant within thirty (30) days after the completion of the parade or event.

6.    Notification by the Applicant.

a.    The applicant shall deliver written notices announcing an event for which a permit has been granted, to each occupant on the streets to be closed at least seven days prior to the event. The applicant shall provide the zoning and building administrator a sample of any written notice required under this paragraph.

b.    The applicant shall send a copy of the permit at least seven days prior to the event to the alderpersons of the aldermanic district(s) where the street closure is requested along with any merchants or building occupants identified by the zoning and building administrator. The notification shall include contact information for the applicant. The applicant shall provide the zoning and building administrator a copy of the written notice(s) required under this subsection including the addresses to which the notice was sent.

c.    Notice. Notice of an event for which a permit has been granted shall be sufficient if provided to the owner or occupant of each building or use with street frontage or driveway access on the street or portion of streets to be closed, or those whose access is restricted by closure of said streets (e.g., streets with no other access but through the closed street).

7.    In addition to the other standards of review contained in this chapter, a parade permit may be denied because of any of the following factors:

a.    Conduct of the parade will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to its location;

b.    The parade will require the diversion of so great a number of police or fire officers as to prevent normal police and fire protection to the city;

c.    The concentration of the persons, animals, and vehicles associated with the parade will unduly interfere with proper fire, police, or ambulance service to the parade or to any other area of the city;

d.    The parade is reasonably likely to cause injury to persons or properties or provoke disorderly conduct or create disturbances or incite a riot;

e.    The parade is held for the sole purpose of advertising any products, goods, or events;

f.    At least one parade permit or street event permit was previously issued for an event on the same date as the requested parade such that the combination of events would cause any of the factors listed in subsections (E)(7)(a) through (e) of this section to occur.

g.    Failure to pay fees or bills for prior parades or events.

F.    Renewals. Renewal of temporary use permits may be granted by the administrator or designee if the previous year’s operation was in compliance with this chapter and the use is not to be expanded or extended. If the previous year’s operation was not in compliance with this chapter or the use is intended to be extended or expanded, the application and recommendation of the administrator or designee shall be referred to the plan review board as provided in subsection (E)(2) of this section.

G.    Compliance. Where a use does not comply with the conditions of the permit, the temporary use permit may be revoked by the board or its designee, and the use shall be considered a violation of this title.

H.    Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the administrator or designee or the board or its designee relating to the granting or denial of a temporary use permit may appeal the decision to the board of zoning appeals. Such appeal shall be filed with the city clerk within thirty (30) days after the action taken or the filing of the decision granting or denying the temporary use permit. (Ord. 2362-14 § 2, 2014; Ord. 2247-11 § 1, 2011: Ord. 1819 § 2 (part), 2001; prior code § 17.09(3a))


17.108.050 Conditional uses.

A.    Purpose. Certain uses are desirable to the community, but their use may create special circumstances or problems if allowed to develop and locate as a matter of right. To ensure that certain uses are compatible at a certain location and to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, the common council finds that the conditional uses outlined in this section should not be located as a matter of right, but only after appropriate review and approval as provided in this section.

B.    Definitions.

“Abandoned” means the discontinuance, vacation, non-use, or non-occupation of a conditional use.

“Department” means the department of community development.

“Property owner” means the property owner or agent.

C.    Conditional Uses. The use of land and/or structures may be granted a conditional use permit upon specific authorization by the common council pursuant to the requirements of this section. Conditional uses are listed here, and in some instances, in district regulations.

1.    The following may be permitted as a conditional use in all zoning districts except in the conservancy and upland conservancy districts:

Except as otherwise specifically designated a permitted use in this code, these uses may be granted a conditional use permit after June 20, 2020, if located on a lot greater than one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) square feet in size:

i.    Religious use buildings and accessory buildings, including housing, contingent on the buildings being solely used for activities run by the religious institution.

iii.    Residential care facilities.

iv.    Public or private parks or playgrounds.

v.    Schools.

vii.    Sports venues.

f.    Any conditional use existing under subsection (C)(1)(d) of this section may not expand its parcel size unless the parcel expansion renders the parcel containing the use greater than one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) square feet in size.

D.    Pre-Application Conference. Prior to filing an application for a conditional use permit, the property owner shall request for a pre-application conference and meet with the department to discuss the proposed conditional use. The purpose of the meeting is for city staff to provide an opportunity for an informal evaluation of the property owner’s proposal, familiarize the property owner or agent with the applicable provisions of the zoning code, the comprehensive plan, infrastructure requirements, traffic analysis, and any other issues that may affect the proposal. Along with the request for the pre-application conference, the property owner shall provide the department a preliminary outline of the plan and method of operation, a proposed site plan, and site data per Section 17.100.020 and city form PLN-60 so that the department may informally evaluate the proposed development. Such informal evaluation is not binding upon the applicant or the city, but is intended to serve as a guide to the property owner in making the application and advising the property owner in advance of the formal application of the issues that may be presented to the plan commission or common council. If an application is not filed within six months of the pre-application conference, the property owner shall schedule another conference with the department prior to filing the application.

E.    Application. The property owner shall file an application for a conditional use permit with the department on the PLN-60 form furnished by the city, along with payment of the fee specified in Section 3.28.010(AA).

H.    Procedure for Public Hearing. At the public hearing, the plan commission shall review the site, application materials, existing and proposed structures, landscaping, lighting, architectural plans, neighboring areas, parking areas, driveway locations, highway access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, sewerage and water systems, fencing, planting and screenings, hours of operation, and operation of the use. Additionally, the plan commission shall afford the applicant, the city, and the public an opportunity to present evidence to the commission to determine whether the proposed location protects the health, safety, and general welfare of the community; meets the standards of the Brookfield Municipal Code; is consistent with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies, and standards of the City’s comprehensive plan; and meets the standards for conditional use permit issuance as set forth in subsection (J) of this section.

I.    Standards for Conditional Use Permit Issuance. The plan commission shall not recommend an application for approval unless it finds that all of the following conditions are present:

1.    The use complies with the recommendations in the city of Brookfield comprehensive plan and any applicable neighborhood or neighborhood development, including design guidelines adopted as supplement to those plans.

2.    The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare.

3.    The uses, values, and enjoyment of adjacent property for purposes already established will not be substantially impaired or substantially diminished in any foreseeable manner.

6.    Measures have been or will be taken to provide adequate ingress and egress to minimize traffic congestion and to ensure public safety and adequate traffic flow on the public streets.

7.    The conditional use conforms to all applicable regulations of the district in which it is located.

8.    The use does not create adverse impacts such as dust, lighting, air pollution, noise, odor, vibration, glare, heat, or hazardous materials.

9.    The use is located in an area that will be adequately served by and will not impose an undue burden on any of the services provided by the city or other public agencies.

J.    Plan Commission Recommendation. Within sixty (60) days of the public hearing, the plan commission shall make a written recommendation to the common council regarding the application. The recommendation may include requirements and conditions upon the landscaping, architectural design, noise, height, dust emissions, lighting, fencing, hours of operation, traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, parking requirements, and operation of the use as deemed necessary to protect the public interest and comply with the standards in subsection (I) of this section. All such requirements and conditions shall be reasonable and, to the extent practicable, measurable, and be based on substantial evidence and related to the purposes set forth in subsection (A) of this section.

K.    Council Review of Recommendation. Prior to issuing a determination on the conditional use permit application, the common council shall review the plan commission’s written recommendation and determine whether to adopt the recommendation or modify it. Any modifications to the recommendation shall be in writing and based on substantial evidence. If the common council determines that further information and/or reports from the plan commission, city staff, and/or the applicant are needed, the common council may postpone its decision until such information or reports are provided. The common council’s final recommendation shall be mailed to the applicant.

L.    Proof of Achieving Conditions. If the common council’s final recommendation sets forth conditions for the conditional use permit, the plan commission shall hold an evidentiary hearing within forty-five (45) days of the issuance of the final recommendation to determine whether the applicant can demonstrate by substantial evidence that the conditions recommended are or will be satisfied. The applicant and/or city staff may present evidence at said hearing. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the plan commission shall issue a written recommendation, based on substantial evidence, that shall contain the commission’s conclusions and findings of fact supporting its conclusion and a recommendation as to whether the common council should grant or deny the permit.

M.    Council Review of Proof of Achieving Conditions. The common council shall review the plan commission’s written recommendation, conclusions, and findings of fact regarding achieving conditions at its next meeting and determine whether to grant or deny the permit. If the common council determines by substantial evidence that the applicant meets or agrees to meet all of the requirements and conditions of this section and the conditions imposed pursuant to subsection (L) of this section, the common council shall grant the conditional use permit. If not, the common council shall deny the permit.

N.    Appeal of Denial. If the common council denies a person’s conditional use permit application, the person may appeal the decision to the circuit court for certiorari review within thirty (30) days of the date of denial as provided under Section 62.23(7)(de)5, Wisconsin Statutes.

O.    Duration of Conditional Use Permit. All conditional use permits as approved shall run with the land unless sooner revoked or abandoned pursuant to subsection (Q) or (U) of this section or declared null and void pursuant to subsection (R) of this section.

P.    Change of Use. No alteration, extension, or modification of a conditional use permit shall be permitted unless the common council specifically approves it through the same process as an initial application.

Q.    Abandonment of Conditional Use. If a conditional use is abandoned for a period of one year or more, the conditional use permit shall automatically expire. The permit holder shall notify the department in writing within thirty (30) days if the holder’s conditional use is abandoned or discontinued and the date of the abandonment or discontinuance.

R.    Time Limits on Development. The start of construction, if applicable, of all conditional uses shall be initiated within two years of their approval by the common council. A conditional use permittee shall have a valid occupancy permit within two years of the initial issuance of a building permit. Failure to initiate construction or have a valid occupancy permit by said time frames shall render the conditional use permit null and void. The common council may grant an extension of these time limitations for six months if the permittee files a written request for extension sixty (60) days prior to expiration of the time period and demonstrates good cause. Such extension request shall include a timeline or schedule for obtaining necessary permits, receiving state and municipal approvals, and completing construction.

S.    Effect of Denial. No application for a conditional use permit which has been denied wholly or in part by the common council may be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the most recent denial, except on the grounds of new information or changed conditions which the common council finds to be material. If the common council finds the information to be material, the applicant may reapply for the permit.

T.    Use Prohibited and Enforcement. No person shall operate or maintain a conditional use without a conditional use permit or contrary to the permitted conditions. In addition to the revocation process in subsection (U) of this section, the city may also pursue any other option permitted by law to require compliance with this section or the conditions of the permit, including those listed in Section 1.12.010(H).

U.    Revocation of Conditional Use Permit. The common council may revoke a conditional use permit after a hearing is held before the plan commission in accordance with the provisions of this section.

1.    Permits may be revoked for the following causes:

a.    The permit approval was obtained by fraud;

b.    The permit is being or has been exercised contrary to the conditions of such permit, any amendments to it, or in violation of any applicable licenses, permits, regulations, state or federal laws, or the Brookfield Municipal Code;

c.    The use for which the permit approval was granted is being or has been exercised so as to be detrimental to the public health or safety or to constitute a nuisance;

d.    The use for the permit was modified, altered, or expanded without city approval; or

e.    The use has been abandoned as set forth in subsection (R) of this section.

2.    Revocation proceedings may be instituted by the plan commission or common council upon its own motion or upon a sworn written complaint made and filed with the city clerk by the department director, the public works director, the police chief, or the fire chief.

3.    If upon the plan commission or common council’s motion, the plan commission or common council shall direct the city attorney to prepare a summons and complaint and have it served upon the permittee pursuant to Section 801.11, Wisconsin Statutes, not less than ten days prior to the date of such hearing. Upon receipt of a sworn complaint, the plan commission shall direct the city attorney to prepare a summons and have the summons and complaint served upon the permittee pursuant to Section 801.11, Wisconsin Statutes, not less than ten days prior to the date of such hearing.

4.    The summons and complaint shall contain the date and time for appearance by the permittee; a statement of the common council’s ability to revoke the permit in the event any of the allegations are found to be true; a statement of the grounds for revocation; notification to the permittee of an opportunity to be heard, respond to, and challenge the complaint for revocation and to present and cross-examine witnesses under oath; notification to the permittee of the right to be represented by counsel of the permittee’s choice at the permittee’s expense.

5.    If the permittee fails to appear on the date and time designated in the summons or fails to file a written answer with the city clerk within three days of the hearing, the plan commission may take the allegations of the complaint to be true. The plan commission shall then deliberate to determine if revocation is appropriate.

6.    If the permittee appears before the plan commission at the date and time designated in the summons and denies the allegations in the complaint, an evidentiary hearing shall be scheduled. If the permittee appears but does not deny the allegations in the complaint, the complaint may be taken as true and the plan commission shall hear the arguments of the complainant and the permittee in connection with whether to revoke the permit.

7.    If the matter proceeds to hearing before the plan commission, the following procedures shall apply:

This restoration shall include removal of any subsurface structure or foundation, including concrete, used to support the telecommunications facility down to ten feet below the surface. This depth of removal requirement may be modified by the board of public works. After a telecommunications facility is no longer in operation, the facility owner shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to effect removal and restoration unless weather prohibits such efforts or unless a longer period is approved by the board of public works based upon a good faith effort to obtain a new user for such facility.

2.    Security for Removal. The telecommunications facility owner shall provide to the city, prior to the issuance of the conditional use permit or the issuance of an occupancy permit, a performance bond in the amount specified in Section 3.28.010(DD) to guarantee that the telecommunications tower and any telecommunication support facility will be removed when no longer in operation and guaranteeing any municipal costs associated with said removal. The city will be named as obligee in the bond and must approve the bonding company.

I.    Pre-existing Telecommunication Towers. Nonconforming and conforming pre-existing telecommunication towers and facilities may extend, move, or replace the tower and facilities upon review and approval of a revised plan and method by the plan commission. An existing telecommunication tower may be increased in height a maximum of fifty (50) feet, relocated, or reconstructed within fifty (50) feet of its existing location to accommodate co-location subject to meeting all other subsections of this section except subsections F and K of this section. Routine maintenance and repair on telecommunications facilities is permitted.

J.    Compliance.

b.    The permittee has failed to comply with the conditions of approval imposed;

c.    The facility has not been properly maintained in accordance with applicable codes and safety standards.

2.    Revocation Process.

a.    The owner of such site, service provider and/or tower owner shall be notified by certified mail of noncompliance by the community development department.

b.    The party not in compliance shall comply with such notice within thirty (30) days to the satisfaction of the community development department.

c.    If compliance is not obtained within thirty (30) days, the community development department shall notify the board of zoning appeals of the noncompliance and request permission to proceed with the revocation process. This time period may be extended by staff to allow for seasonal limitations.

d.    The board of zoning appeals shall hold a public hearing following publication of a Class 2 notice in the legal newspaper of the city.

e.    A copy of a hearing notice shall be mailed certified to the owner of record of the tower site, the tower owner, and lessees, as disclosed on the most recent annual information report, at least two weeks prior to the hearing date.

f.    An officer of the community development department shall appear at the hearing to present the evidence of noncompliance. All other interested parties may also give testimony to the board of zoning appeals.

g.    In compliance with the procedures of a conditional use hearing, a written decision of the board of zoning appeals will be made.

3.    Abandonment. Any telecommunication facility or support facility that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. Time may be extended upon review and approval of the plan commission, if the tower owner demonstrated a good faith effort to secure new tenants. In such circumstances, the following shall apply:

a.    The owner of such telecommunication facility shall remove said facility including all supporting equipment and building(s) within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the community development department notifying the owner of such abandonment. If removal to the satisfaction of the community development department does not occur within said ninety (90) days, the community development director may order removal utilizing the established bond as provided under subsection I of this section and salvage said antenna or tower and all supporting equipment and building(s). If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all operations of the tower cease.

b.    The recipient of a conditional use permit or occupancy permit for a telecommunications facility under this ordinance shall notify the community development department immediately when the facility is no longer in operation.

K.    Structural, Design and Environmental Standards.

1.    Tower, Antenna and Facilities Requirements. With the exception of those facilities identified in subsection (C)(1) of this section, all telecommunication facilities shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment and be symmetrical to the greatest extent feasible. To this end, all of the following measures shall be implemented:

a.    All telecommunication facilities shall comply at all times with all applicable Federal Communication Commission (FCC) rules, regulations, and standards. To that end no telecommunication facility or combination of facilities shall produce at any time power densities in any inhabited area that exceed the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) adopted standard for human exposure, as amended, or any more restrictive standard subsequently adopted or promulgated by the federal government which applies to the telecommunication facility. All telecommunication towers and antennas shall meet or exceed the standards and regulations, in place at the time of the issuance of the condition use permit, of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Wisconsin State Bureau of Aeronautics, Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA), the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), and any other agency of the state and/or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.

b.    Subject to the considerations in subsection (K)(1)(c) of this section, telecommunication towers shall be constructed out of metal or other nonflammable material, unless specifically permitted by the city to be otherwise. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.

c.    At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings. Where circumstances so justify, a camouflaged tower or alternative support structure may be required. The design and construction of telecommunication facilities and towers, antennas, and related equipment shall be as symmetrical as possible to minimize visual obtrusion.

d.    All ground mounted telecommunication towers shall be self-supporting monopoles or lattice towers except where satisfactory evidence is submitted to the plan commission that a guyed tower is required.

e.    If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.

f.    Satellite dish and parabolic antennas shall be situated as close to the ground as possible to reduce visual impact without compromising their function.

g.    Telecommunication support facilities (i.e., equipment rooms, utilities, and equipment enclosures) shall be constructed out of materials approved in the base zoning district and consistent with the main building on the property. In all noncommercial districts the principal building material shall be assumed to be brick. Telecommunication support facilities shall be measured from the original grade at the base of the facility to the top of the structure, and shall be designed to blend with existing architecture in the area or shall be screened from sight by mature landscaping, and shall be located or designed to minimize their visibility. The height of such structures shall be determined by the plan commission in the context of the built environment.

h.    State or Federal Requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed and such changes are applicable to existing towers, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations to the extent required shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense.

i.    Building Codes-Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, in effect at the time the tower is constructed. Upon request, the tower owner shall provide documentation from an engineer establishing that the project is complete to their specifications, and which concludes that a tower complies with applicable codes and standards and does not constitute a danger to persons or property. Upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring any such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense. Said time period may be extended for a reasonable period of time if there is no immediate danger to persons or property and the tower owner is working diligently to correct the failure.

j.    Telecommunication facilities shall not interfere with or obstruct existing or proposed public safety, fire protection, or supervisory controlled automated data acquisition (SCADA) operation telecommunication facilities. Any actual interference and or obstruction shall be corrected by the applicant at no cost to the city.

k.    Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or operation of a wireless communication system in the city have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the community development department.

l.    Signs. Except as required by federal or state law or as otherwise necessary to provide notice of dangerous conditions, no signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower.

2.    Height. The height of a telecommunication tower shall be measured from the original grade at the base of said tower to the highest part of the tower itself. In the case of building mounted towers the height of the tower includes the height of the portion of the building on which it is mounted. In the case of “crankup” or other similar towers whose height can be adjusted, the height of the tower shall be the maximum height to which it is capable of being raised. The maximum height of any tower at its fullest extension shall be one hundred fifty (150) feet, unless the applicant can establish that there are no other alternatives and/or options available to provide adequate coverage within the city (within the scope of the 1996 Telecommunications Act), and it can be demonstrated that there will be a significant gap in service, or if the plan commission determines that to minimize visual impact an increase in tower height is preferable to the proliferation of towers at the site.

3.    Lighting. Telecommunications towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other applicable regulatory authority. If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.

4.    Vegetation Protection and Facility Screening:

a.    Except exempt facilities as defined in subsection C of this section, all telecommunications facilities shall be installed in such a manner so as to minimize disturbance to existing native vegetation and shall include suitable mature landscaping to screen the facility, where necessary. For purposes of this section, “mature landscaping” shall mean trees, shrubs or other vegetation that meets the minimums from the city’s site development standards.

b.    Upon project completion, the owner(s)/operator(s) of the facility shall be responsible for maintenance and replacement of all required landscaping for a one year period.

c.    Facility structures and equipment, including supporting structures, shall be located, designed, and screened to blend with the existing natural or built surroundings, so as to reduce visual impacts.

5.    Fire Prevention. All telecommunication facilities shall be designed and operated in accordance with all applicable codes regarding fire prevention.

6.    Noise and Traffic. All telecommunication facilities shall be constructed and operated in such a manner as to minimize the amount of disruption caused to nearby properties. To that end all the following measures shall be implemented for all telecommunication facilities, except facilities listed in subsection (C)(1) of this section:

a.    Noise producing construction activities shall only take place on weekdays (Monday through Saturday, nonholiday) between the hours of seven a.m. and seven p.m., except in times of emergency repair; and

b.    Backup generators shall only be operated during power outages and for testing and maintenance purposes.

L.    Setback/Offset Requirements. Except facilities listed in subsection (C)(1) of this section. All setbacks/offsets shall be set by the plan commission with consideration given to general zoning requirements and safety considerations.

M.    Occupancy Permits. An occupancy permit is required from the community development director for the location of all telecommunication facilities, except those described in subsection (C)(1) of this section. The applicant shall submit information required under subsection F of this section, Conditional Use Application, except the conditional use application and fee. Facilities proposed to be colocated on facilities previously approved under this section shall be exempt from submitting information required under subsection F of this section, but shall be required to submit a occupancy permit application for review and approval pursuant to the zoning code.

N.    Appeal Procedures. A person aggrieved by any decision of the city hereunder may, within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the community development department, commence an action seeking the remedy available by certiorari. (Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1794 § 2, 2001)


17.108.100 Special reviews.

A fee specified in Section 3.28.010(EE) shall be charged to an applicant for a special review. A “special review” shall include an administrative interpretation of the classification of a particular proposed use which is not clearly enumerated as a permitted use or any other specific request for the application of a term in this title. (Ord. 1919-03 § 3 (part), 2003; Ord. 1912-03 § 2 (part), 2003; Ord. 1725 § 2 (part), 2000; prior code § 17.095)

17.112.010 Setbacks.

A.    Base setback lines are established for all streets and highways in the city as follows unless otherwise specified by the council:

1.    The base setback line shall be exterior lines of the existing street right-of-way or a future street right-of-way established by a street reservation shown on a recorded plat or certified survey map, or shall be a line running parallel to the centerline of a street or highway, offset from the centerline a distance equal to one-half the ultimate width of the street or highway as established by the city Master Street Right-of-Way Plan, or Waukesha County Street and Highway Width Map, or any future street right-of-way established in the City Official Map. In case a property is affected by two or more of the provisions herein, the line that will result in the greatest width of setback measured inward from the existing property line shall prevail.

2.    Where no portion of an officially mapped street or highway that affects all or part of an underlying, adjoining or nearby property has been acquired by the city for street or highway purposes, the base setback line nonetheless that applies shall be the mapped future right-of-way, with the following provisions uniquely applicable to mapped future street or highway rights-of-way, or portions thereof, that have not been acquired by the city, as described below:

a.    Structural development established before the official mapping of the future right-of-way and continuing forward shall not be deemed to have non-conforming status for zoning purposes because of the mapped right-of-way or the base setback from that mapped right-of-way. Such pre-existing development shall become nonconforming in zoning status as a result of not conforming with the official mapping or associated setback requirements only when some or all of the adjacent right-of-way affecting the subject property is acquired by the city for street or highway purposes.

b.    Structural development occurring after the official mapping of a right-of-way, including structural expansions of pre-existing development where the development or expansion site is proposed to be located on lands where future streets are officially mapped, but not acquired in full or in part by the city for street or highway purposes, or within base setback lines predicated on nearby mapped, but not acquired rights-of-way, shall comply with setbacks from officially mapped future rights-of-way and becomes existing development upon obtaining an occupancy permit from the city and shall be governed by the appeal procedures of Section 12.04.060 of the City Official Map Ordinance and Wisconsin Statutes Section 62.23(6).

[Note: the official map appeal procedures allow the board of appeals to grant relief where official mapping creates hardship conditions under a variance-like process.]

3.    On all other streets, hereinafter designated as “local streets,” the base setback line shall be thirty (30) feet from the center line.

4.    Service streets shall not be considered in determining the base setback line.

5.    Such setback lines shall be parallel to and measured at right angles to the center line of the street or highway.

B.    Vision setback lines are established as follows:

1.    Across each sector between intersecting streets or highways where the grades are not separated, a vision setback line shall be established by a straight line connecting two points on the intersection base setback lines, which points are located fifty (50) feet distant from the intersection of such base setback lines.

2.    Across each sector between the intersection of a street or highway with the railroad where the grades are not separated, a vision setback line shall be established by a straight line connecting points on the base setback line and the railroad right-of-way line, which points are located one hundred (100) feet from the intersection of the base setbackline and the railroad right-of-way line.

C.    No principal building or its accessory building shall be hereafter erected or altered so that any roof or enclosed portion thereof is closer to the base setback line than the setback distance specified by the regulations for the district in which such building is located, with the following exceptions:

1.    Where the nearest existing building on one side of such building is within five hundred (500) feet and has less than the required setback, the average between such existing setback and the required setback shall apply.

2.    Where the nearest buildings on both sides of such building are within five hundred (500) feet, but not closer than two hundred (200) feet and have less than the required setback, the average of such existing setbacks and the required setback shall apply.

3.    Where the nearest buildings on both sides of such building are within two hundred (200) feet and have less than the required setback, the average between such existing setbacks shall apply.

4.    The building inspector shall allow a variance of not greater than two feet by reason of any roof, overhang or eave.

4a.    Structures, including decks, awnings or canopies, limited to supporting outdoor seating associated with a restaurant or tavern that is authorized under the provisions of this code.

5.    Except as described in this section, no existing building or structure of any kind shall be hereafter constructed, erected, moved or replaced, within base or vision setback areas, or in any way remodeled so as to further encroach within the established setback area in any direction, except vertically.

D.    Telephone, cable television and power transmission lines may be constructed within the established setback areas and additions to and replacements of existing structures may be made, subject to approval of the plan commission. Underground installations of the same may be required by other provisions of the municipal code.

E.    In all cases where any of the highways for which setback lines are established by this chapter are located on municipal boundaries, such establishment shall apply only within the city limits.

F.    On corner lots of record as such on August 1, 1961, the effect of the setback regulation shall not reduce the buildable width of such corner lot to less than thirty (30) feet. (Ord. 2251-11 § 17, 2011; Ord. 2045-06 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1934 § 2, 2003; Ord. 1871 § 2, 2002: prior code § 17.10(1))


17.112.020 Offsets.

A.    No principal building or its accessory building or any structure shall be hereafter erected or altered so that the nearest part thereof, whether it be the roof or enclosed portion of a building or the edge of the paved deck surrounding a swimming pool, shall be closer to any lot line than the offset distance specified by the regulations for the district in which such structure is located with the following exceptions:

1.    On a lake shore lot a boathouse may be permitted within five feet of the shoreline. The ordinary high-water line shall be considered the shore lot line.

2.    In the case of any lot of record or which has been platted in an unrecorded subdivision approved by the city or its predecessor government which has a minimum width less than that required by the district in which it is located, the offset from a side lot line may be reduced proportionately to the ratio between the actual minimum width, provided no offset shall in any case be less than ten feet. As it applies to this chapter, the required minimum width for lots within the R-2 and R-3 districts platted before August 15, 1989 shall be one hundred twenty (120) feet. For lots platted after August 15, 1989, the minimum width shall be one hundred thirty (130) feet at the fifty (50) foot setback line.

3.    The building inspector shall allow a variance of not greater than two feet by reason of any roof, overhang or eave.

B.    Where a lot abuts a district boundary line, the offset from such line in the district of less restricted use shall be not less than that required for the district of more restrictive use.

C.    In any district in which multiple-family residence or business use is permitted, two or more principal buildings on adjoining lots may be erected with common or directly adjoining walls, provided they are erected as a single unified construction project and provided that at both ends of such a “row” type building the offset requirements for the district in which such building is located shall be complied with. (Ord. 1996-05 § 5, 2005; prior code § 17.10(2))


17.112.030 Maintenance and use of setback and offset area.

Any such required setback or offset area shall be landscaped and kept clean and free from the accumulation of debris or refuse and shall not be used for the storage or display of equipment, products, vehicles or any other material, provided nothing herein contained shall prevent the installation of a driveway across setbacks or within offset area necessary and incidental to the proper use of the buildings erected on the lot.

For all lots created after October 14, 2004 there shall be a minimum separation of one hundred (100) feet for any driveway from an intersecting public street as measured from the right-of-way to the nearest edge of the driveway and corner/through lots shall have driveway connections to the lesser class public street. (Ord. 1996-05 § 6, 2005; prior code § 17.10(3))

In a split level building, the first floor level shall be the lowest level which is not over another occupied area of the building. The first floor of elevator shafts, atriums, courtyards or vaulted areas shall be measured. Excluded from the measurement shall be:

a.    Basements, used solely for purposes of storage or mechanical equipment or parking of vehicles;

b.    Areas above the first floor of elevator shafts, atriums, courtyards or vaulted areas up five percent additional square feet of floor area ratio. Further special exceptions for these areas require council approval under the provisions of Section 17.08.060 and shall be predicated upon the council’s determination that the application is consistent with the purposes of this chapter and that the design and function of such areas serves such purposes;

c.    Terraces or landings without roofs;

d.    Attics;

e.    Areas beneath building overhangs;

f.    Structures excepted from the height regulations per Section 17.136.030(B);

g.    Above-grade parking decks including ancillary retail or service uses.

3.    Environmentally Significant Lands. Lands located within the regional floodway, regional flood fringe and wetland preservation districts shall not be included in computing maximum floor area ratio, except as provided in Section 17.24.050. Where federal and state agencies and the city, by special approval under the provisions of this code, authorize development of such lands, computations of maximum floor area ratios shall be based upon the buildable area of lots as authorized by the city and other agencies having jurisdiction. The city may impose reasonable conditions on permits issued. Lots and building sites that were platted or developed before July 1, 1991, and which contain lands within the non-shoreland wetland overlay subdistrict may use such subdistrict lands in the calculation of maximum floor area ratio. (Ord. 2362-14 § 4, 2014; Ord. 2231-10 § 2, 2010; Ord. 2068-06 § 4, 2006; Ord. 1691 § 1(b), 1999; prior code § 17.12(1))

C.    Where a lot has less land area or width than required for the district in which it is located and was of record on August 1, 1961, such lot may be used for any purpose permitted in such district, but not for residential purposes for more than one family, except as otherwise provided in Chapter 17.128. (Ord. 1996-05 § 6, 2005; prior code § 17.12(2))


17.116.030 Open space.

A.    No building shall be erected, structurally altered or placed on a lot so as to reduce the usable open area of such lot to less than that specified by the regulations for that district.

B.    To be considered usable, such open area shall be readily accessible and of a size and shape that will be functional with respect to providing for the amenities and necessities of light, air, play space and landscaping. Crop land, pasture land and wooded lands may be included in the calculation of open space. Lands located within the regional floodway, regional flood fringe and wetland preservation districts shall not be included in soft open space, except as provided in Section 17.24.050E. Where federal and state agencies and the city, by special approval under the provisions of this code, authorize development of such lands, computations of required open space shall be based upon the buildable area of lots as authorized by the city and other agencies having jurisdiction. As part of the review under Section 17.100.050, the city shall impose reasonable conditions on permits issued, especially with respect to maintenance.

C.    No part of the open space provided for any building shall be included as part of the open space required for another building, except as hereinafter provided for housing projects. (Ord. 1691 § 1(c), 1999; prior code § 17.12(3))

B.    Maximum Lot Coverage on a Nonresidential Lot. As a development guide in the design and plan commission review of nonresidential development, the sum total footprint area of all principal and accessory buildings and the total surface area of all impervious accessory uses, driveways, sidewalks, parking surfaces and loading areas on a nonresidential lot should not exceed that suggested under the maximum lot coverage standard as specified by the regulations for the district in which such development is located. Greater lot coverage than suggested in the district regulations may be authorized upon approval of the plan commission under the commission’s review authority of Chapter 17.100.

C.    How Measured.

1.    Footprint area shall be measured at the first floor level from outside of exterior wall to outside of exterior wall. In a split level building, the first floor level shall include all area which is not over another occupied area of the building. Fully enclosed atriums, courtyards and vaulted areas shall be measured. Excluded from the measurement shall be patios, decks, terraces or landings without roofs, and areas beneath building overhangs.

B.    Modifications to Required Spaces. The plan commission recognizes that due to the particularities of any given land use or development, the inflexible application of the parking supply requirements set forth in subsection A of this section may result in a land use or development either with inadequate parking supply or parking supply far in excess of its needs. Therefore, the plan commission may permit or require deviations from the requirements of subsection A of this section and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standards set out in subsection (B)(1) and (2) of this section. Whenever the plan commission permits or requires a modification to the prescribed parking supply requirements, it may also request the recording of the same under the provisions of subsection H of this section.

1.    Additional parking spaces can be required if it is determined that the prescribed requirement for a particular development will lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets or unauthorized parking in nearby private parking lots.

2.    A reduction in parking spaces can be required if it is determined that the prescribed requirement for a particular development would result in the wasteful use of property that could more desirably be used for additional building development, in the case of a land use or development which would produce less parking demand, or for environmentally useful or aesthetically pleasing open space.

C.    Parking Location. All required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use for which it is required except that required spaces may be permitted at other locations when and as authorized under subsection D of this section. The requirements of this section shall be considered satisfied if the outer limits of the required parking is provided within five hundred (500) feet of the building entrances being served, such distance being measured along the shortest available route of pedestrian access.

D.    Alternatives to On-Site Parking: Shared or Off-Site Parking

1.    The petitioner shall submit written documentation to the satisfaction of the plan commission that shared parking spaces are available to satisfy the parking requirements.

a.    Shared parking agreements shall provide evidence that either parking lots are large enough to accommodate multiple users or that parking spaces will be shared at certain times of the day (i.e., one activity uses the spaces during daytime hours and another activity uses the spaces during evening hours.)

b.    Off-site parking lots shall be located not more than five hundred (500) feet from the principal building entrance that it is intended to serve.

2.    When a reduction of parking spaces attributable to shared parking or off-site parking is requested, the petitioner shall submit written verification that such parking is available for the life of the applicant’s use or reoccupancy thereof and shall include copies of any contracts, joint lease agreements, easements, and other such documentation to show that such shared parking can be accomplished. The method by which the required shared parking will be provided is subject to the approval of the city attorney and may be requested to be recorded under the provisions of subsection H of this section. Off-site parking spaces shall be clearly posted for the joint use of employees, tenants and/or customers of each respective use sharing those spaces.

E.    Use of Alternative Transportation. Upon demonstration to the plan commission that effective alternative transportation to the single occupant will occur, the plan commission may reduce requirements as follows:

1.    Commercial retail uses located within five hundred (500) feet of a public transit station may reduce parking requirements ten percent.

2.    Industrial and office uses located within one thousand (1,000) feet of a public transit station may reduce parking requirements fifteen (15) percent.

3.    Businesses with employer established rideshare programs may reduce parking requirements for each carpooled or bused employee not to exceed twenty (20) percent of required parking.

4.    One required parking space may be eliminated up to ten percent of the required spaces for priority spaces provided near building entrances for carpool vehicles.

F.    Unclassified and Multiple Uses. In the case of uses not specified herein, the number of spaces specified as the general standard for that class of use or the number of spaces specified for similar use shall apply as determined by the director of community development. In developments involving the establishment or addition of two or more uses on one lot or parcel, the cumulative number of spaces required for each use shall determine the total number of spaces required.

G.    Phased Installation of Required Spaces. The plan commission recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development, a situation may arise where the total number of parking spaces required by this section for a particular development may not need to be installed initially and could be installed in phases. If authorized by the plan commission, the parking supply requirement of subsection A of this section can be installed in phases under the following provisions:

1.    The development’s building or occupancy permit shall state the amount of total parking required under subsection A of this section and the amount of parking to be installed under the initial building or occupancy permit.

2.    A declaration of restrictions or development agreement shall be recorded upon the subject property under the provision of subsection H of this section indicating the conditions which the remainder of the required parking will be installed.

3.    A site plan for the development shall be designed to provide sufficient open space, landscaped to plan commission specifications, on the subject site to accommodate the additional parking spaces otherwise required by this section. Such open space will be in addition to required yards, setbacks, driveways, private streets, and loading and service areas. The open space shall be provided which, if converted to parking spaces, would provide off-street parking to meet the full requirements of this section on the date specified under the conditions recorded in the declaration of restrictions or development agreement.

H.    Recording of Restrictions. The director of community development may require that a declaration of land use restriction be recorded upon the subject property at the Waukesha County register of deeds to ensure that future owners are informed of use restrictions resulting from the administration of this section. (Ord. 2134-08 § 4, 2008; Ord. 1912-03 § 1 (part), 2003; Ord. 1616 § 1, 1997)

No trucks or any other vehicle equipment used in business, commerce or industry shall be parked on a lot or in a garage in a residential district, except, this prohibition shall not apply to one panel or pickup trucks one ton or less in capacity nor to equipment of tradesmen or repairmen performing work on the lot or home; provided, that unless within the forgoing exception, the parking of dump trucks, semitrucks, bulldozers and front end loaders are included in the prohibition established by this chapter. This enumeration is not inclusive and other vehicles of similar nature are also prohibited; provided, further, that the building inspection department may issue an annual parking permit of ten dollars ($10.00) for the parking of commercial vehicles, as follows:

A.    In residentially zoned areas that have not been subdivided and are still primarily agricultural in character;

B.    In sparsely developed areas where homes average more than three hundred (300) feet apart in any area in excess of one thousand eight hundred (1,800) feet as measured at the road right-of-way;

C.    Where a prohibited vehicle or vehicles have been parked for years among trees, behind homes or garages or otherwise generally out of sight, have not been a problem, and the neighborhood has accepted the situation. Such permit may be issued when, in the opinion of the building inspector, such permit will not affect the values of property, the general character and aesthetics and the peace and well-being of the neighborhood, and is not contrary to the intent of this section. Prohibited vehicles may, in any unforeseen emergency, park overnight on a residential lot owned or occupied by the owner or operator of the vehicle with the permission of the police department. Requests that are deemed by the granting authority to be repetitive and contrary to the intent of this section shall be denied. (Prior code § 17.14(2))


17.120.030 Surfacing.

Any off-street parking area other than that provided for a residence, having a capacity for more than four vehicles, shall be surfaced and maintained with a minimum of two inches of bituminous concrete pavement or equivalent hard-surfaced material approved by the building inspector. Adequate base course gravel shall be placed before paving. The pavement shall be maintained in good and serviceable condition. The property owner shall be responsible for the construction and maintenance of such off-street parking area. The plan commission may require extra base and surface where subsoil, drainage or similar conditions make them necessary. (Prior code § 17.14(3))


17.120.040 Screening.

Any off-street parking area other than that provided for a residence which abuts or faces a residence district or which is abutting a street shall provide a planting screen, landscape fence or wall at least four feet in height along the side abutting or fronting on a residence district or abutting a street the width of which has been established as sixty (60) feet or less and said street is abutted on its opposite side by a residence district. (Prior code § 17.14(4))


17.120.050 Offset.

In any off-street parking area located in a nonresidential district, no parking, driveways, loading spaces, paving or vehicle storage shall be permitted within twenty-five (25) feet of an abutting residential district, except where the specific regulations of the district in which the use is located require a greater offset or permit a different offset or where the intensive use regulations of Section 17.108.090 apply. (Prior code § 17.14(5))


17.120.060 Setbacks.

A minimum twenty-five (25) foot setback is required for parking areas, to be measured from the base setback line, unless specific regulations of the district permit otherwise. (Ord. 2575-19 § 3, 2019: prior code § 17.14(6))


17.120.070 Commercial illumination.

All exterior illumination of parking lots, commercial buildings, multifamily buildings of more than four units, institutional and mixed-use developments are intended to be covered by this section.

A.    Illumination of off-street parking areas shall be arranged so as not to reflect direct rays of light onto adjacent streets or properties. Lighting shall be considered as restricted to the parking lot if such lighting is so oriented or aimed as to direct no more than one-half of each fixtures maximum luminous intensity, measured in footcandles, outside the exterior limits of the property, unless the illumination level, in footcandles at such exterior limits measured at any plane, is less than .5 footcandles. The total illumination level produced on the property shall not exceed an average of five footcandles in any plane.

B.    No individual light shall exceed four hundred (400) watts.

C.    The total height of light fixtures, including bases, shall not exceed the roofline of the building or twenty (20) feet, whichever is less, except in parking lots and along streets or service streets serving regional shopping centers and buildings located within five hundred (500) feet of the exterior walls of the regional shopping center, where the total height of light fixtures, including bases, shall not exceed thirty-two (32) feet regardless of any roofline.

D.    All pole heights and light fixtures shall be brought into conformity with this section when fifty (50) percent or more of the poles or light fixtures are changed or replaced on a premises.

E.    Parking lots shall be illuminated by full cutoff fixtures.

F.    Non-cutoff decorative or pedestrian lighting fixtures shall be allowed only to light public sidewalks adjacent to public right-of-way. They shall also be allowed in the established and approved setback of the building(s) in commercial, multi-family buildings of more than four units, institutional, and mixed use developments, except on corner properties where no such light shall be placed within seventy-five (75) feet of the property line abutting residential property. All decorative or pedestrian lighting fixtures shall be affixed with internal reflectors.

G.    Fixtures mounted on building walls shall be shielded or recessed so that the lamp or bulb shall be invisible from a horizontal plane to neighboring residences and streets. Fixtures mounted under canopies, eaves or similar building structures shall be recessed and function as a full cutoff fixture.

H.    Parking lot lighting systems shall be extinguished or reduced to fifty (50) percent no later than thirty (30) minutes after the close of business for the day or after the end of normal office hours for the majority of employees when adjacent to residential districts and when recommended by the plan commission.

J.    Properties zoned “VAB” village area business are allowed to have lighting encroaching onto public right-of-way, subject to plan commission and board of public works approval, and should have lower-intensity bulbs to meet the intent of this section.

K.    In lieu of box lighting for any application (including parking lots), decorative lighting with cut-off, flat lens fixtures are required. (Ord. 2524-18 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2068-06 § 5, 2006; Ord. 2001-05 § 1, 2005: Ord. 1886 § 1, 2002)


17.120.075 Residential illumination.

Lighting on residential properties shall be designed to illuminate specific areas (driveways, entryways, decks, residence facades, landscaping highlights, etc.). Lighting shall not be used to illuminate entire properties. Residential lighting shall be aimed so as to eliminate glare onto neighboring properties. (Ord. 2001-05 § 2, 2005)


17.120.080 Off-street loading and unloading.

A.    Required. In any local business, general business, office and light industry or industrial district, an off-street loading space shall be provided, in addition to the defined off-street parking area, for every ten thousand (10,000) square feet or fraction thereof in excess of three thousand (3,000) square feet of building area, exclusive of storage areas, used for commercial purposes.

B.    Area. Each such loading space shall have an area of at least ten feet wide by forty-five (45) feet long and with a minimum of fourteen (14) feet height clearance. The plan commission may, by a resolution recorded in its minutes, permit exceptions to this requirement if the use and location so warrants. (Prior code § 17.15)


Chapter 17.124 TOP SOIL REMOVAL

Sections:

17.124.010    Procedure for application.

17.124.020    Action on applications.

17.124.030    Removal operation requirements.


17.124.010 Procedure for application.

A.    Permit. Top soil may not be removed from any district in which it is made a permitted use by this chapter until a permit for this purpose shall have been granted by the plan commission, subject to Section 17.08.060(D). Such permit shall be for not to exceed two years and may be renewed thereafter for periods of one year upon application to the plan commission.

B.    Application. Application for a permit to remove top soil shall be accompanied by the following:

1.    A fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each of the first five acres and fifty dollars ($50.00) for each additional acre of land included in the proposed top soil removal operation;

2.    A detailed description of all phases of the contemplated operation with specific identification of the equipment to be used and the methods for controlling dust and noise;

3.    A legal description of the proposed site with a map showing its location together with existing and proposed private access roads and public highways over which the top soil and possible fill will be trucked;

4.    A topographical map with a minimum contour interval of one foot extending beyond the site to the nearest public street and to a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond the lot lines of the property in all directions;

5.    A plan showing drainage during the removal of the top soil and a plan for the restoration of the site, showing the contour, drainage, nature of the fill, if any, and the type of vegetation, if any, expected to grow on the proposed site. (Prior code § 17.22(1))


17.124.020 Action on applications.

A.    Referral to Plan Commission. The application shall be referred to the plan commission for a public hearing within thirty (30) days of which the plan commission shall make its decision on the application in writing.

B.    Public Hearing. A public hearing will be held within thirty (30) days of the date of filing the application. Notices of the hearing shall be sent by mail to the address appearing on the tax roll of the owners of all property which abuts the property lines of the proposed site and such notice shall be delivered at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing.

C.    Basis for Decision. The plan commission shall make its decision after consideration of the effect of the proposed operation and restoration upon the public health, safety and welfare, including those discretionary and mandatory factors listed in Section 17.124.030. The plan commission may, within reasonable limits, require the applicant to vary his proposed plan and method of operation so as to protect the public interest. (Amended during 1/21/16 update; prior code § 17.22(2))


17.124.030 Removal operation requirements.

A.    Mandatory Requirements. No top soil removal operation may be conducted within one hundred (100) feet of a boundary of a residential district or residential structure existing in a business or office and limited industrial district, except with the written consent, duly filed with the plan commission, of such abutting landowners or owners of such structure. If the site is to be filled for later use, it shall be filled with substantial material to a height which will be at least two feet above the flood plain and three feet above the water level. No excavated site shall be permitted which would be reasonably likely to collect stagnant water, whether polluted or unpolluted. The applicant shall provide in the form of an enforceable agreement a plan for controlling of dust during the top soil removal and the beautification of the site during operations and immediately after their completion so that the contour of the land and nature of the growth thereon will be at least as attractive and harmonious with the surrounding neighborhood as prior to the commencement of top soil removal. The beautification requirement may be waived where the plan demonstrates in enforceable form satisfactory to the city attorney that the area will be immediately developed and landscaped in connection with a new use of land following the end of top soil removal. Such plan shall be accompanied by a bond of a licensed surety company or a certified check in an amount deemed by the city engineer to be sufficient to secure the performance of the agreement for the beautification of the site. All machinery, rubble stockpiles and the like shall be removed before the bond or deposit shall be returned to the permittee.

B.    Discretionary Requirements. The plan commission may require fencing or other suitable barriers or the planting of trees and shrubs and other appropriate landscaping in order to screen the operation from the public right-of-way or any residential development. The plan commission may require the making of deed restrictions regarding the future use of the land as security for any representations to that effect made by the applicant. (Prior code § 17.22(3))


Chapter 17.128 SUBSTANDARD LOTS

Sections:

17.128.010    Findings.

17.128.020    Required minimum lot area and width defined.

17.128.030    Permit issuance—Considerations for determination.

17.128.040    Merging lots allowed when.

17.128.050    Common ownership.

17.128.060    Nonresidential lots that are substandard according to the provisions of Ordinance No. 1330.


17.128.010 Findings.

A serious threat to proper land use planning exists in certain areas within the city which were subdivided into lots which are substandard in terms of the subsequently enacted zoning ordinances. In many cases property owners have upgraded many lots within these subdivisions by merging two adjoining substandard lots into one home site before building. Building on unmerged substandard lots would, in many cases, pose a threat to the health, safety and general welfare of the neighborhood within which such lots are located. (Prior code § 17.23(1))


17.128.020 Required minimum lot area and width defined.

As it applies to this chapter, the required minimum lot area and minimum average width for lots within the R-3 district, either platted before August 15, 1989 or within a landsplit, shall be twenty thousand (20,000) square feet and one hundred twenty (120) feet, respectively. Also, as it applies to this chapter, the required maximum average width for lots within the R-2 district, either platted before August 15, 1989 or within a landsplit, shall be one hundred twenty (120) feet. (Prior code § 17.23(2)(a))


17.128.030 Permit issuance—Considerations for determination.

Where, in a residential district, a lot existing on December 8, 1965, or the date of any amendment hereto, shall have a minimum average width or lot area more than one-third smaller than required by the provisions of this title applying to the district where the lot is situated, no building permit shall be issued until the city shall decide in the manner provided herein that the construction of a building on such lot will not impair the health, safety and general welfare of the neighborhood in which such lot is located. In making its decision, the deciding authority shall consider whether construction on a particular lot would impair health, safety and the general welfare of the neighborhood by the unsatisfactory disposal of sanitary wastes or depreciation of property values. The owner of a substandard lot seeking such a decision by the city shall file an application with the city clerk requesting a permit to build on his lot and such application shall be referred to the plan commission for advice to the council. If within sixty (60) days of the filing of the application with the clerk, the council, by resolution, shall decide that the application raises questions of principle which ought to be decided and applied simultaneously to all substandard lots in the subdivision, the council shall, after receiving the advice of the plan commission and after a public hearing, review the circumstances surrounding all substandard lots in the subdivision and make a decision with regard to the status of each substandard lot in such subdivision, all within one hundred twenty (120) days of the filing of the application unless this period shall be extended by consent of the applicant. If the council shall not act within sixty (60) days of the filing of the application, or shall earlier expressly so resolve, the application shall be referred to the board of zoning appeals for disposition in accordance with this chapter. (Prior code § 17.23 (part))


17.128.040 Merging lots allowed when.

The deciding body shall consider whether it is reasonably possible and practical for the substandard lots in question to be merged with all or part of an adjoining or abutting lot so that the resulting building site would comply or more nearly comply with the minimum area and minimum average width provisions of the zoning district and may authorize the granting of a building permit only if satisfied that such a merger is not possible or reasonably practical.
