government at the regular or usual places. The alternate sites may be
within or without the territorial limits of the City. With the approval of

emergency situation without regard to the compliance with timeconsuming
procedures and formalities prescribed by law. All acts of the
Mayor, Common Council and officers shall be valid and binding as if

ETHICS CODE AND BOARD
§ 55-1. Statement of purpose.
§ 55-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ANYTHING OF VALUE  Any money or property, favor, service, payment,
advance, forbearance, loan, or promise of future employment, but does not
include compensation and expenses paid by the state, fees and expenses
which are permitted and reported under § 19.56, Wis. Stats., political
A. The proper operation of democratic government requires that public
officials and employees be impartial and responsible to the people; that
government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal
gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its
government. In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a
Code of Ethics for all City of Reedsburg officials and employees,
whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of
boards, committees and commissions of the City, as well as any
individuals who are candidates for elective office as soon as such
individuals file nomination papers with the City.
B. The purpose of this Ethics Code is to establish guidelines for ethical
standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting
forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests
of the City of Reedsburg and by directing disclosure by such officials
and employees of private financial or other interests in matters
affecting the City. The Common Council believes that a Code of Ethics
for the guidance of elected and appointed officials and employees will
help them avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their
public responsibilities, will improve standards of public service and will
promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the citizens of this
City in their elected and appointed officials and employees. The
Common Council hereby reaffirms that each elected and appointed City
official and employee holds his or her position as a public trust, and any
intentional effort to realize substantial personal gain through official
conduct is a violation of that trust. The provisions and purpose of this
Ethics Code and such rules and regulations as may be established are
hereby declared to be in the best interests of the City of Reedsburg.
§ 48-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-2

PUBLIC EMPLOYEE  Any person excluded from the definition of a public

established or appointed by the Mayor and/or Common Council, whether
paid or unpaid.
SIGNIFICANT INTEREST  Owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, at
least 10% or $5,000 of the outstanding stock of any business.
§ 55-3. Statutory standards of conduct.
There are certain provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes which should, while
not set forth herein, be considered an integral part of any code of ethics.
Accordingly, the provisions of the following sections of the Wisconsin
Statutes, as from time to time amended, are made a part of this chapter
of Ethics and shall apply to public officials and employees whenever
applicable, to wit:
A. A person's spouse, mother, father, child, brother or sister; or
A person's relative by blood or marriage who receives, directly or
indirectly, more than 1/2 of his or her support from such person or from

or her support.

B. Section 946.11, Special Privileges from Public Utilities.
C. Section 946.12, Misconduct in Public Office.

§ 55-2 REEDSBURG CODE § 55-4
1:50
§ 55-4. Responsibility of public office.
Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office
for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of
the United States and the Constitution of this state and carry out impartially
the laws of the nation, state and municipality, to observe in their official acts
the highest standards and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office
regardless of personal consideration, recognizing that the public interest
must be their prime concern.
§ 55-5. Dedicated service.
Officials and employees shall adhere to the rules of work and performance
established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority.
Officials and employees shall not exceed their authority or breach the law
or ask others to do so, and they shall work in full cooperation with other
public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by
officially recognized confidentiality of their work. Members of the City staff
are expected to follow their appropriate professional code of ethics.
§ 55-6. Fair and equal treatment.
§ 55-7. Conflict of interest.
A. Use of public property. No official or employee shall use or permit the
unauthorized use of City-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or
property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services
are available to the public generally or are provided as City policy for
the use of such official or employee in the conduct of official business,
as authorized by the Common Council or authorized board, commission
or committee.
B. Obligations to citizens. No official or employee shall grant any special
consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which
is available to every other citizen. No official or employee shall use or
attempt to use his or her position with the City to secure any advantage,
preference or gain, over and above his or her rightful remuneration and
benefits, for himself or herself or for a member of his or her immediate
family.
C. Political contributions. No official shall personally solicit from any City
employee, other than an elected official, a contribution to a political
campaign committee for which the person subject to this chapter is a
candidate or treasurer.
A. Financial and personal interest prohibited.
(1) No official or employee of the City, whether paid or unpaid, shall
engage in any business or transaction or shall act in regard to
financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is
incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties in the
§ 55-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-7
1:51
public interest contrary to the provisions of this chapter or which
would tend to impair independence of judgment or action in the
performance of official duties.
(2) Any member of the Common Council who has a financial interest or
personal interest in any proposed legislation before the Common
Council shall disclose on the records of the Common Council the
nature and extent of such interest; such official shall not participate
in debate or vote for adoption or defeat of such legislation. If the
matter before the Council involves a member's personal interest
with persons involved, the member may participate in debate or
discussion and vote on the matter following disclosure unless an
ordinance or contract is involved; if an ordinance or contract is
involved, such official shall not participate in debate or discussion
and vote on the matter.
(3) Any nonelected official, other than a City employee, who has a
financial interest or personal interest in any proposed legislative
action of the Common Council or any board, commission or
committee upon which the official has any influence or input or of
which the official is a member that is to make a recommendation or
decision upon any item which is the subject of the proposed
legislative action shall disclose on the records of the Common
Council or the appropriate board, commission or committee the
nature and extent of such interest. Such official shall not
participate in debate or discussion or vote for adoption or defeat of
such legislation.
(4) Any City employee who has a financial interest or personal interest
in any proposed legislative action of the Common Council or any
board, commission or committee upon which the employee has any
influence of input, or of which the employee is a member, that is to
make a recommendation or decision upon any item which is the
subject of the proposed legislative action shall disclose on the
records of the Common Council or the appropriate board,
commission or committee the nature and extent of such interest.
B. Disclosure of confidential information. No official or employee shall,
without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information
concerning the property, government or affairs of the City, nor shall
such information be used to advance the financial or other private
interests of the official or employee or others.
C. Gifts and favors.
(1) No official or employee, personally or through a member of his or
her immediate family, may solicit or accept, either directly or
indirectly, from any person or organization money or anything of
value if it could be expected to influence the employee's official
actions or judgments or be considered a reward for any action or
inaction on the part of the official or employee.
§ 55-7 REEDSBURG CODE § 55-7
1:52
(2) No official or employee, personally or through a member of his or
her immediate family, shall accept any gift, whether in the form of
money, service, loan, thing or promise, from any person which may
tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the
performance of his or her duties or grant in the discharge of his or
her duties any improper favor, service or thing of value. However, it
is not a conflict of interest for any public official or employee to
receive a gift or gratuity that is an unsolicited item of nominal
intrinsic value such as a meal, and that is not intended to influence
the official. Any official or employee who receives, directly or
indirectly, any gift or gifts from any person who is known by said
official or employee to be interested, directly or indirectly, in any
manner whatsoever in business dealings with the City upon which
the official or employee has any influence or input or over which
the official or employee has any jurisdiction, discretion or control
shall disclose the nature and value of such gifts to the Common
Council by January 15 next following the year in which the gift or
gifts are received.
(3) An official or employee is not to accept hospitality if, after
consideration of the surrounding circumstances, it could
reasonably be concluded that such hospitality would not be
extended were it not for the fact that the guest, or a member of the
guest's immediate family, was a City official or employee.
Participation in celebrations, grand openings, open houses,
informational meetings and similar events are excluded from this
prohibition. This subsection further shall not be construed to
prevent candidates for elective office from accepting hospitality
from citizens for the purpose of supporting the candidate's
campaign.
(4) Gifts received by an official or employee or his or her immediate
family under unusual circumstances shall be referred to the
Common Council within 10 days of receipt for recommended
disposition. Any person subject to this chapter who becomes aware
that he is or has been offered any gift, the acceptance of which
would constitute a violation of this subsection, shall within 10 days
disclose the details surrounding said offer to the Common Council.
Failure to comply with this reporting requirement shall constitute
an offense under this chapter.
D. Representing private interests before City agencies or courts.
(1) Nonelected City officials and employees shall not appear on behalf
of any private person (other than himself or herself, his or her
spouse or minor children) before any City agency, board,
commission or the Common Council if the official or employee or
any board, commission or committee of which the official or
employee is a member has any jurisdiction, discretion or control
over the matter which is the subject of such representation.
§ 55-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-7
1:53
§ 55-8. Ethics Board. [Amended 7-26-2010]
(2) Elected City officials may appear before City agencies on behalf of
constituents in the course of their duties as representatives of the
electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations.
However, the disclosure requirements of Subsection A above shall
be applicable to such appearances.
E. Ad hoc committee exceptions. No violation of the conflict of interest
restrictions of this chapter shall exist, however, where an individual
serves on a special ad hoc committee charged with the narrow
responsibility of addressing a specific issue of topic in which that
individual, or the employer or a client of that individual, has an interest,
so long as the individual discloses to the Common Council that such
interest exists.
F. Contracts with the City. No City official or employee who, in his or her
capacity as such officer or employee, participates in the making of a
contract in which he has a private pecuniary interest, direct or indirect,
or performs in regard to that contract with some function requiring the
exercise of discretion on his or her part shall enter into any contract
with the City, unless within the confines of § 946.13, Wis. Stats.:
(1) The contract is awarded through a process of public notice and
competitive bidding or the Common Council waives the
requirement of this chapter after determining that it is in the best
interest of the City to do so.
(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the designation
of a public depository of public funds.
A. The Ethics Board shall consist of five members. The membership of the
Ethics Board shall consist of four citizens and one alderperson. The
nonalderperson members shall not be elected officials, full-time
appointed officials or City employees, nor shall the non-Council
members be currently serving on any other City board, commission or
committee. The City Attorney shall furnish the Board any legal
assistance necessary to carry out its functions.
B. Ethics Board members shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to
confirmation by the Council. Initial terms of office shall be: one citizen

1:54
E. Any person covered by this Ethics Code may apply, in writing, to the
Board for an advisory opinion regarding the propriety of any matter to
which the person is or may become a party. The Board shall meet to
review such a request for an advisory opinion and may advise the
person making the request. Advisory opinions and requests therefor
shall be in writing and shall state all material facts. It shall be prima
facia evidence of intent to comply with this Ethics Code when a person
refers a matter to the Board and abides by the advisory opinion of the
Board if the material facts are as stated in the opinion request.
Meetings held by the Board for deliberation and action upon such
application shall not be open to the public nor shall a nonmember,
Common Council member or the Mayor be authorized to attend any
such meeting of the Board unless requested to do so by the Board.
Advisory opinions rendered by the Board shall be in writing and shall
state the material facts upon which the opinion is based. A record of the
Board's opinions, opinion requests and investigations of violations shall
be closed to public inspection as required by Chapter 19, Wis. Stats.
Except as provided by § 19.59(5)(b), Wis. Stats., the Board shall not
make public the identity of any person requesting an advisory opinion
or of persons or organizations mentioned in the opinion. If the Board
determines that an advisory opinion rendered by the Board would be of
significant value to other officials or employees, the Board may issue a
summary of the opinion, provided that the summary does not disclose
the identity of the person originally requesting the advisory opinion. In
all cases, the Board may request an advisory opinion from the City
Attorney.
F. All complaints alleging that an official or employee committed a
violation of this Ethics Code shall be addressed to the Ethics Board and
shall be filed with the City Clerk-Treasurer. All such complaints shall be
in writing and verified and shall state the name of the official or
employee alleged to have committed a violation of this Ethics Code and
shall further state the evidentiary facts supporting the charge.
G. Within 14 days after the filing of a properly verified complaint with the
City Clerk-Treasurer, the Board shall meet to review the complaint.
Within three business days after its initial review of the complaint, the
Board shall mail a copy of the complaint to the respondent by certified
mail or shall have a copy of the complaint delivered to the respondent
by personal service.
H. Following its initial review of a verified complaint, the Board may make
a preliminary investigation with respect to each alleged violation of this
Ethics Code. No preliminary investigation of an alleged violation of this
Ethics Code may be initiated until a copy of the complaint and notice of
the Board's intent to investigate the charge has been mailed by certified
mail to the respondent or personally served upon the respondent. The
preliminary investigation shall be completed within 30 days of the date
that the complaint and notice thereof is mailed to the respondent or
personally served upon the respondent, except the Board may extend
§ 55-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 55-8
1:55
the investigation period for up to an additional 60 days with notice to
the respondent and to the complainant.
I. If, after its preliminary investigation, the Board finds that probable
cause does not exist for believing that the respondent violated this
Ethics Code, it shall dismiss the complaint. The Board shall promptly
notify the complainant and the respondent by certified mail or personal
service of its decision dismissing the complaint. The Board's decision to
dismiss a complaint shall be final. The same complaint or a complaint
which is substantially similar to the dismissed complaint shall not be
reconsidered by the Board unless, within 20 days of the Board's mailing
or personal service of its dismissal order, the complainant files with the
Board additional material facts which were not available to the
complainant at the time the original complaint was filed and which, if
true, would probably change the Board's decision. The Board's decision
to reconsider or not to reconsider a decision under this subsection shall
be final. If the Board determines that a verified complaint was brought
for harassment purposes, the Board shall so state in its decision.
J. If, after its preliminary investigation, the Board finds that probable
cause does exist for believing the allegations of the complaint, it shall
conduct a hearing on the matter. The hearing shall be held not more
than 60 days after the Board's finding of probable cause. The Board
shall give the respondent and complainant written notice of the hearing
date by mailing a notice thereof to the respondent and to the
complainant by first class mail at least 20 days prior to the hearing date
thereof. The hearing shall be held in closed session except that the
respondent shall have a right to demand that the hearing be held in
open session and, upon such demand, the Board shall conduct the
hearing in open session.
K. The chairperson of the Board shall preside over the proceedings, and
the City Attorney shall provide legal assistance to the Board as needed.
The complainant and the respondent may be represented by an
attorney, and the respondent may also be represented by a union
representative. Both parties may compel the attendance of witnesses by
subpoenas. Subpoenas may be issued by the Chairperson of the Board
pursuant to § 885.01, Wis. Stats. Each party shall be responsible for
serving subpoenas on its respective witnesses and for paying any
witness and mileage fees to the witness as required by the Wisconsin
Statutes.
L. All testimony of witnesses at the proceedings shall be given under oath,
administered by the Chairperson in the form and manner prescribed by
the Wisconsin Statutes. A record of the testimony may be made by
stenographic, electronic or other recording method, as the Board
determines. The record produced at the direction of the Board shall be
the official record of the proceeding. The proceedings may be
adjourned or continued by the Board from day to day until completed.

probative value, but shall exclude immaterial, irrelevant or unduly
repetitious testimony or evidence. Basic principles of relevancy,
materiality and probative force shall govern this proceeding. Hearsay
evidence will not be permitted where direct evidence is reasonably
available. The Board will not base crucial or essential evidentiary
findings on hearsay evidence. Objections to evidentiary offers and
offers of proof of evidence not admitted may be made and shall be noted
in the record. All evidence, including records and documents, shall be
duly offered and made a part of the record. The Chairperson shall rule

the City Attorney may ask questions of the witnesses. No party or
witness shall be permitted to ask questions of any Board member
during the proceedings, unless expressly authorized by the

J. Procedure where business is sold. If a person liable for a tax under this

facts contained in the return being audited or on the basis of any other
information within the Treasurer's possession. One or more such office
audit determinations may be made by the Treasurer as deemed
necessary.
L. Field audit. The Treasurer may, by field audit, determine the tax

within the Treasurer's possession. The Treasurer is authorized to
examine and inspect the state sales tax records, and memoranda, of any
person in order to verify the tax liability of that person or of another
person.
M. Failure to file returns, estimate by Treasurer, penalty. If any person fails
to file a return as required by this section, the Treasurer shall make an
estimate of the amount of the gross receipts under Subsection A. Such
estimate shall be made for the period for which such person failed to
make a return and shall be based upon any information which is in the
Treasurer's possession or which may come into the Treasurer's
possession. On the basis of this estimate, the Treasurer shall compute
and determine the amount required to be paid to the City, adding to the
sum a penalty equal to 10% thereof. One or more such determinations
may be made for one or more periods.
N. Interest charge on unpaid tax. All unpaid taxes under this chapter shall
bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the due date of the

interest at 12% per annum from the due date of the return until the first
day of the month following the month in which said taxes are refunded.

was overpaid was not accompanied by a complete return, no interest
shall be paid thereon.
O. Delinquent returns, late filing fee. Delinquent tax returns shall be
subject to a $10 late filing fee. The tax imposed by this section shall
become delinquent if not paid:

period if one has been granted.

of the return.
P. Added penalty. If, due to negligence, no return is filed, or a return is
filed late, the entire tax finally determined shall be subject to a penalty
of 25% of the tax exclusive of any interest or other penalties. If a person
fails to file a return when due or files a false or fraudulent return with
the intent of either case to defeat or evade the tax imposed by this
section, a penalty of 25% shall be added to the tax required to be paid,
exclusive of interest and other penalties.
Q. Records kept. Every person liable for the tax imposed by this section
shall keep or cause to be kept such records, receipts, invoices and other
pertinent papers in such form as the Treasurer requires.

1:105
§ 138-10. Limitations on right to access.
A. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal
custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably
describes the requested record or the information requested. However,
a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject
matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a
sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request may be
in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under
§ 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request may be
refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be
identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be
refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a
fee is required to show acceptable identification whenever the
requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security
reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
B. Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as
practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the
requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole
or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after
conferring with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is
so general as to be unduly time-consuming, the party making the
request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner
which would permit reasonable compliance.
C. A request for a record may be denied as provided in § 138-10. If request
is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a
written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the
requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written
request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a
written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written
denial of a request shall inform the requester that, if the request for the
record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review
upon petition for a writ of mandamus under § 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or
upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.
A. As provided by § 19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt
from inspection under this section:
(1) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal
law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
(2) Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law
enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require
exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a
condition to receipt of aids by the state;
(3) Computer programs, although the material used as input for a
computer program or the material produced as a product of the
computer program is subject to inspection; and
§ 138-9 REEDSBURG CODE § 138-10
1:106
(4) A record or any portion of a record containing information
qualifying as a common-law trade secret.
B. As provided by § 43.30, Wis. Stats., public library circulation records
are exempt from inspection under this section.
C. In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is
not specifically exempt from disclosure the legal custodian, after
conferring with the City Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in
part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest
resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full
access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which
disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality which
were necessary and given in order to obtain the information
contained in them.
(2) Records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.
(3) Records of current deliberations concerning employment,
dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or
discipline of any City officer or employee, or the investigation
charges against a City officer or employee, unless such officer or
employee consents to such disclosure.
(4) Records concerning current strategy for crime detection or
prevention.
(5) Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of
City property, investing of City funds, or other City business,
whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require
nondisclosure.
(6) Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data
of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a
substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person
referred to in such history or data.
(7) Communications between legal counsel for the City and any officer,
agent or employee of the City when advice is being rendered
concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the
City or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to
become involved, or communications which are privileged under
§ 905.03, Wis. Stats.
D. If a record contains information that may be made public and
information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record
shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the
information that may not be made public from the record before
release. The custodian shall confer with the City Attorney prior to
releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the City
§ 138-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-10
1:107
§ 138-11. Retention of audio and video.
Unless otherwise provided by statute, the following categories of records
shall be maintained for the following periods after their date of creation:
Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If, in the judgment
of the custodian and the City Attorney, there is no reasonable way to
separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without
unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the
entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.
A. Police Department audio tapes: 120 days.
B. Police Department squad and other evidentiary videos. A video may be
erased and reused at such time as the video is deemed by the
Department as having no evidentiary value.

including, but not limited to, data supplied by the City Assessor, the
property owner, tenant or developer, aerial photography, or by
actual on-site measurement. The Director may require additional
information from the property owner as necessary to make the
determination. The ERU value for a nonresidential property shall
be determined by dividing its impervious area by the number of
square feet per ERU and rounding the quotient to the next higher
0.1 ERU. The minimum ERU charge to nonresidential properties
will be one ERU. The billing amount shall be updated by the
Director as necessary based on changes to the amount of
impervious area on the property.

for any individual property may be appealed by filing a written appeal
with the City Clerk-Treasurer not later than 30 days after the date the
payment is due. The appeal shall specify all bases for the appeal and the
amount of the stormwater charge the appellant asserts is
inappropriate. Any appeal not filed within the time permitted by this
section shall be deemed waived. As a condition to maintaining an
appeal, the appellant shall pay all charges billed under protest prior to
filing the appeal.
B. The Director shall review the appeal and determine whether the
challenged determination is fair and reasonable and consistent with the
provisions of this chapter, and whether a refund is due the customer.
The Director shall determine its procedure for deciding such appeals
which, at a minimum, shall provide the appellant with written notice by
certified return receipt mail at least 10 days prior to the meeting at
which the appeal will be reviewed, and an opportunity to present
evidence and be heard on the appeal at such meeting. The Director
shall provide the appellant with its decision, in writing, within 15 days

C. The appellant may appeal the decision of the Director within 30 days
from the date of mailing the Director's decision. An appeal to the

Director, but the appellant shall be afforded the opportunity to present
arguments based on that evidence.
D. If the Council or the Director determines that the decision appealed
from should be reversed or modified, it shall determine whether a
refund is due the customer. Any refund ordered shall be applied as a
credit against the customer's next stormwater billing if the refund will
not exceed the customer's next stormwater billing, and otherwise will
be refunded by the City Clerk-Treasurer from the Stormwater Utility
fund.

pursuant to this chapter for Stormwater Utility costs, the Common
Council may order that the charges be levied against the property as a
special charge pursuant to § 66.0627, Wis. Stats. The mailing of an
invoice reflecting the charges due to the owner shall be notice to the
owner that failure to pay the charges when due may result in such
charges being placed upon the tax roll.
B. In addition to any other method of charging for Stormwater Utility
expenses, the Common Council may by resolution levy special
assessments on property in a limited and determinable area for special
benefits conferred upon property by any public improvements pursuant
to § 66.0703, Wis. Stats. The failure to pay such special assessments

any reason, such determination shall not affect the validity or application of,

adult-oriented use(s) and any other use(s) to be located and
conducted together with such adult-oriented use(s) in the same
physically defined separate area of a building; or if
(b) The operator or a knowledgeable representative of the
operator authorized to speak for and bind the operator fails to
appear at a meeting of the Ordinance Committee at which
consideration of the application is duly scheduled, and if the
Ordinance Committee has any questions about the application
§ 176-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-10
1:137
or the proposed use(s) to which it reasonably requires answers
before deciding the application, or if the operator or the
operator's authorized representative is unable to answer such
questions without an adjournment.
(2) If the Ordinance Committee fails to decide an application for an
adult-oriented use license within the time limits established by this
chapter, the license shall be deemed to be issued on the basis of the
information provided in the application.
B. Notice and opportunity to be heard. The Ordinance Committee shall
cause a written notice to be issued to the operator not less than 10 days
prior to the date of the Ordinance Committee meeting at which the
operator's application is proposed to be considered, stating the date,
time and place of the meeting, the operator's obligation to be present in
person or by knowledgeable representative authorized to speak for and
bind the operator, and, optionally, any additional information that the
Ordinance Committee or staff believes is necessary or desirable to
decide the application. The operator shall be given an opportunity to
present its application and to respond to any concerns that members of
the Ordinance Committee have which might be the basis for denial or
the imposition of any special, limiting condition.
C. Approval. The Ordinance Committee shall approve an application for an
adult-oriented use license if the application and the proposed adultoriented
use(s) and establishment satisfy all of the requirements of this
chapter and if the Ordinance Committee does not find that there is a
reasonable probability that the operator will fail to comply with the
requirements of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this
chapter, based on a substantial pattern of noncompliant behavior
during the five years immediately preceding the date of the application
or other clear and convincing information.
D. Conditions. The Ordinance Committee may impose reasonable
requirements and conditions to ensure compliance by the operator with
the requirements of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this
chapter, and for such purposes may incorporate by reference in its
decision all or portions of the operator's application or other
documents. The Ordinance Committee shall specify whether any
condition imposed on its approval is a condition precedent (must be
satisfied before the license takes effect) or a condition subsequent
(must be satisfied after the license takes effect to avoid a subsequent
suspension and possible termination) and may specify a reasonable
period of time within which to satisfy any such condition. For existing
adult-oriented uses or establishments that are allowed uses pursuant to
Chapter 690, Zoning, conditions precedent shall be avoided unless they
are required to remedy serious health or safety problems or serious
adverse secondary effects in the surrounding area.
E. Physically separate defined area. In the event that the physically
separate defined area to be occupied by an existing allowed adult-
§ 176-10 REEDSBURG CODE § 176-10
1:138
§ 176-11. License.
The Zoning Administrator shall issue an adult-oriented use license within
five business days after Ordinance Committee approval of the application,
if there are no conditions precedent (or that such conditions have been
satisfied). If the Zoning Administrator fails to act timely pursuant to this
section, the license shall be deemed to be issued for purposes of the
operator's right to operate, but a subsequently issued license shall be
valid and binding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no
violation of this chapter shall result from an operator of an existing adultoriented
use or establishment that is an allowed use pursuant to Chapter
690, Zoning, continuing to operate such use or establishment during the
period between the Ordinance Committee's approval of an adult-oriented
use license for such use or establishment, which is not subject to any
conditions precedent, and the issuance of such license to the operator.
An adult-oriented use license shall be personal to the operator and sitespecific
to the approved location, shall not run with the land, shall not be
transferable or assignable and shall not be applicable to an adult-oriented
use or establishment at a location different than the approved location. A
transfer or assignment of an adult-oriented use license shall automatically
terminate such license. (A simple name change by an operator shall not be
deemed to involve an assignment and require a new license, but the merger
or acquisition of an operator shall be deemed to involve an assignment
and shall require a new license.) Except as provided in § 176-12 below, any
initial, renewed or amended adult-oriented use license shall automatically
oriented use and any related interior accessory use(s) involved in the
adult-oriented use license application has not been determined and
will not be determined pursuant to Chapter 690, Zoning, in connection
with a then-currently required site and operational plan approval, the
Ordinance Committee shall determine the physically separate defined
area of such use(s) as part of the license decision.
F. Denial. The Ordinance Committee shall deny the license application if it
finds that the proposed adult-oriented use(s) or establishment fail to
satisfy the requirements of this chapter, or if it finds that there is a
reasonable probability that the operator will fail to comply with the
requirements of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this
chapter, based on a substantial pattern of noncompliant behavior
during the five years immediately preceding the date of the application
or other clear and convincing information. The Ordinance Committee
may deny a license application for lack of specific information which it
reasonably needs to decide the application, if the operator has been
given a reasonable opportunity to supply such information. The
Ordinance Committee shall specifically state its reasons for denying
any adult-oriented use license application.
G. Minor modifications. Applications for minor modifications of adultoriented
use licenses may be informally granted, in writing, by the
Zoning Administrator.
§ 176-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-11
1:139
expire one year after the date of issuance unless it is sooner invalidated or
terminated.
§ 176-12. Satisfaction of license conditions.
A. Conditions precedent. The operator of a proposed adult-oriented use or
establishment shall satisfy all conditions precedent imposed by the
Ordinance Committee on its approval of an application for an adultoriented
use license within the time specified by the Ordinance
Committee in its decision or, if the time was not specified by the
Ordinance Committee, within 270 days after the date of approval. The
operator shall notify the Zoning Administrator, in writing, within the
time prescribed of the satisfaction of any conditions precedent and shall
either provide proof of satisfaction with such notice or request in such
notice an inspection of the premises. The Zoning Administrator shall
make any requested inspection within three business days after receipt
of such notice and shall certify to the Ordinance Committee satisfactory
compliance with any condition precedent and issue the license (or
notify the operator, in writing, why a condition has not been satisfied)
within three business days after receiving such proof or after making an
inspection. In the event that the operator fails to satisfy a condition
precedent within the time prescribed, the Ordinance Committee's
approval shall be automatically suspended. If the operator thereafter
satisfies the condition precedent within one year after the Ordinance
Committee's approval, and files with the Zoning Administrator an
updated application in which the operator certifies that the updated
information is accurate and complete, together with the fee required
for a renewal application, the Zoning Administrator shall certify to the
Ordinance Committee satisfactory compliance with the condition(s)
precedent and issue the license within three business days, unless facts
have changed materially or the requirements of this chapter have
changed materially in the interim, in which event the Zoning
Administrator shall issue a notice to the operator within three business
days that the updated application is being treated as an application for
renewal. If the Zoning Administrator fails to act timely pursuant to this
Subsection A, the action in favor of the operator shall be deemed to
have been taken timely.
B. Conditions subsequent. The operator shall satisfy any conditions
subsequent to the license and obtain the Zoning Administrator's
certification of such satisfaction within the time specified in the license
or, if such time is not specified, within 60 days after the date of
issuance. The operator shall notify the Zoning Administrator, in writing,
within the time prescribed of satisfaction of any conditions subsequent
and provide proof of satisfaction with such notice or request in such
notice an inspection of the premises. The Zoning Administrator shall
inspect the premises within three business days after receiving notice
and a request for inspection. The Zoning Administrator shall certify the
satisfaction to the Ordinance Committee (or notify the operator, in
writing, why the condition has not been satisfied) within three business
§ 176-11 REEDSBURG CODE § 176-12
1:140
§ 176-13. License renewal.
An operator wishing to renew a valid adult-oriented use license shall file
a complete renewal application with the Zoning Administrator, together
with the renewal license application fee specified above, not later than 60
days prior to the expiration of the existing license. The timely filing of a
complete renewal application and the required application fee shall entitle
an operator to continue operating an adult-oriented use or establishment
during the pendency of the application, even if the application is not decided
until after the expiration of the existing license, and until the license is
issued if the Ordinance Committee approves the application without
conditions precedent. Any amendments to this chapter that are enacted
before the Ordinance Committee's decision shall be applicable to a renewal
application. The application for renewal of an adult-oriented use license
shall contain all of the information and documents required for an initial
adult-oriented use license. Such an application may incorporate by
reference specific information filed by the operator in or attached to the
most recent application on the basis of which an adult-oriented use license
was approved by the Ordinance Committee, provided that such previous
application and any applicable attachments thereto are attached to the
renewal application or are on file with the City and readily available to
the Zoning Administrator, if the operator specifies the date of such prior
application and certifies that such information has not changed and is
up-to-date, accurate and complete as of the date of the application. Any
information that has changed since the previous application or which was
incorrectly stated in the previous application shall be updated and
corrected by the operator so that all of the information filed with the City is
accurate and complete as of the date of the application.
§ 176-14. License amendment.
An operator desiring to amend a valid adult-oriented use license shall file
an application for amendment of the license with the Zoning Administrator,
together with the amended license application fee specified above, after
requesting and participating in any preapplication staff conference. Any
amendments to this chapter that are enacted before the Ordinance
Committee's decision shall be applicable to an amendment application. The
application for amendment of an adult-oriented use license shall contain
days after receiving such proof or conducting such an inspection. In the
event that an operator fails to satisfy a condition subsequent and obtain
the Zoning Administrator's certification of such satisfaction within the
time prescribed, the license shall be automatically suspended. During
any such suspension, operations shall be prohibited. Any such
suspension shall be automatically lifted upon the Zoning
Administrator's certification to the Ordinance Committee of satisfactory
compliance with the condition(s) subsequent. If the Zoning
Administrator fails to act timely pursuant to this Subsection B, the
action in favor of the operator shall be deemed to have been taken on
the last day of the time prescribed for such action.
§ 176-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-14
1:141
all of the information and documents required for an application for an
initial adult-oriented use license and shall contain a complete and detailed
description of any proposed changes in use, operation, physical layout
or license provisions and a scale drawing showing any physical changes
in layout. Such an application may incorporate by reference specific
information filed by the operator in the most recent application on the
basis of which an adult-oriented use license was approved by the Ordinance
Committee, provided that such previous application and any applicable
attachments thereto are attached to the application, or that such documents
are on file with the City and are readily available to the Zoning
Administrator, if the operator specifies the date of such application and
certifies that such information has not changed and is up-to-date, accurate
and complete as of the date of the application. Any information that has
changed since the date of the previous application or which was incorrectly
stated in the previous application shall be updated and corrected by the
operator so that all of the information filed with the City is accurate and
complete as of the date of the application.
§ 176-15. Minor modification of license.
An operator desiring a minor modification of a valid adult-oriented use
license shall file an application for minor modification with the Zoning
Administrator, together with the minor modification application fee
specified in § 176-9A of this chapter, after requesting and participating in
any preapplication staff conference required by § 176-6 of this chapter.
The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized but not obligated to grant
a minor modification and, if practicable, the Zoning Administrator shall
give guidance to the operator during the preapplication staff conference
whether an application for a minor modification is advisable. The
application for minor modification shall contain a complete, detailed and
accurate description of the proposed minor modification(s) of the operation,
physical layout or license provisions and a scale drawing showing any
proposed physical modification(s) in layout, any information required to
update or correct any changes or inaccuracies or incomplete statements in
the information filed with the most recent application on the basis of which
the Ordinance Committee approved an adult-oriented use license so that all
of the information filed with the City is accurate and complete as of the date
of the application, together with the certification by the operator that all
such information is accurate and complete as of the date of the application,
and any other information reasonably required by the Zoning Administrator
to determine whether any proposed modification is a minor modification.
Any application for a minor modification of an adult-oriented use license
which the Zoning Administrator declines or fails to issue, in writing, within
10 business days of the filing of the application shall be deemed to be
denied. If the operator still desires to effect the proposed modification(s) in
the license, the operator shall file an application for an amended license.
§ 176-16. Suspension, adjustment or termination of license.
§ 176-14 REEDSBURG CODE § 176-16
1:142
A. Upon receipt of information providing a reasonable basis to believe that
a serious violation of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this
chapter has occurred (for purposes of this section, "serious violation"
shall include any violation which involves criminal activity, involves the
presence of an individual of less than 18 years of age inside the
physically separate defined area of a building within which an adultoriented
use is located, or is of a type reasonably likely to result in
harmful secondary effects in the surrounding area) or that a pattern of
violations of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this chapter
has occurred which reasonably suggests intentional violation by the
operator or a lack of concern about compliance on the part of the
operator or that materially false, misleading or incomplete information
was provided by the operator in or with an adult-oriented use
application; the Ordinance Committee may schedule a hearing to
determine whether such violations occurred (unless a court has already
made such determination), whether the operator committed or was
responsible for such violation(s), and whether adjustments in the
operation, supervision, layout or other aspects of the licensed adultoriented
use(s) or establishment are required, or whether adjustments
in the adult-oriented use license provisions are required to prevent
similar violations in the future, and with respect to materially false,
misleading or incomplete information provided in or with a license
application, what the accurate and complete information is and
whether, how and to what extent any such false, misleading or
incomplete information affected the Ordinance Committee's decision to
approve the license application and whether the license should be
adjusted or terminated in light of such information.
B. The Ordinance Committee shall cause a written notice of any such
hearing to be served upon the operator or upon the individual
apparently in charge of the adult-oriented use or establishment in the
manner of serving a summons under §§ 801.10 and 801.11(1), Wis.
Stats., not less than 10 days before the date of the hearing. The notice
shall specify the alleged violation(s), state the reason for the hearing,
and state the date, time and place of the hearing.
C. If the Ordinance Committee finds that adjustments in the adult-oriented
use license provisions are required to ensure that further similar
violations are prevented, or in light of complete and accurate
information, it may impose such additional or further requirements or
conditions on the license as are reasonably designed to prevent further
similar violations or to deal with the situation presented by complete
and accurate information, and may suspend such license for a
reasonable period of time while such adjustments are being made and
while related requirements or conditions are being implemented or
satisfied. If the Ordinance Committee finds that the operator has
intentionally committed, authorized, approved or knowingly acquiesced
in a serious violation of the provisions of this chapter or of a license
issued pursuant to this chapter, or if a felony has been committed at the
adult-oriented use or establishment for which the operator is
§ 176-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-16
1:143
§ 176-17. Appeal.
At the option of the operator, any denial by the Ordinance Committee of an
initial adult-oriented use license application or of an application to renew or
amend such a license, or any adjustment, suspension or termination of such
a license by the Ordinance Committee, or the imposition of any requirement
or condition by the Ordinance Committee, or any determination by the
Zoning Administrator that a condition of approval has not been satisfied,
may be appealed by the operator to the City Zoning Board of Appeals in
accordance with the procedure and with the effect set out in Chapter 690,
Zoning, § 690-12, Zoning Board of Appeals, but if the operator wishes to
challenge any such denial, condition or determination directly in court,
the Ordinance Committee shall waive any defense based on the operator's
failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Any denial by the City Clerk-
Treasurer of an adult-oriented use work permit may similarly be appealed
by the applicant to the City Zoning Board of Appeals, but if the applicant
wishes to challenge such denial directly in court, the City shall waive any
defense based on the applicant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
§ 176-18. Inspection.
responsible, or if the Ordinance Committee finds, based on a
substantial pattern of violations of this chapter or of a license issued
pursuant to this chapter committed by the operator or for which the
operator is responsible, that a reasonable probability exists that
violations will continue, it may terminate the license. If the Ordinance
Committee finds, in a situation where the operator provided materially
inaccurate, misleading or incomplete information in or with a license
application, that it would not grant an adult-oriented use license based
on the current information (or lack thereof) that it has, or if the license
it would grant would have different provisions in light of such
information or the lack thereof, it may terminate or adjust the license,
and may suspend the license until satisfactory information is provided
and/or for a reasonable period of time while such adjustments are
being made and while related requirements or conditions are being
implemented or satisfied.
D. The operator may be represented by legal counsel at such a hearing
and may make legal arguments, present evidence and call, examine and
cross-examine witnesses. The proceedings shall be recorded by a
recording device or stenographer. Exhibits shall be marked and
preserved. The Ordinance Committee shall make findings of fact and
conclusions of law to support any decision to suspend, adjust or
terminate a license. If a license is terminated pursuant to this section,
the operator shall not file an application for a new license within one
year after the date of termination.
E. The procedures of this section shall be in addition to any other remedies
that the City may have in the event of violations of this chapter or of a
license issued pursuant to this chapter.
§ 176-16 REEDSBURG CODE § 176-18
1:144
§ 176-19. Requirements or prohibitions.
A. The portions of any adult-oriented use or establishment open or
proposed to be open to any customers or members of the public shall be
subject to inspection by City inspectors or police officers at any time
such use or establishment is open to the public to determine
compliance with the requirements of this chapter or of any license
issued pursuant to this chapter. The filing of an application for an adultoriented
use license (or for the renewal, amendment or minor
modification of such license) shall constitute consent to any such
inspection.
B. A person who operates an adult-oriented business or his agent or
employee commits a violation of this chapter if he or she refuses to
permit such lawful inspection of the premises at any time it is open for
business.
A. The following requirements or prohibitions shall apply to licensed
adult-oriented uses and establishments:
(1) The operator (if the operator is an individual), all individuals
identified in response to § 176-8 of this chapter, and all employees
and entertainers working, providing services or entertaining in an
adult-oriented use or establishment shall be at least 18 years of
age.
(2) Any adult-oriented use shall be conducted entirely within a
principal building.
(3) All adult-oriented uses located and conducted together in the same
principal building, and all related indoor accessory uses, shall be
located within the same physically separate defined area of a
principal building, and no other uses shall be permitted in such
defined area except as expressly approved in an adult-oriented use
license.
(4) Any adult-oriented use license shall either designate an entire
principal building as the physically separate defined area or shall
precisely designate the location of the boundary of such defined
area and specify the approved means of physically separating such
defined area from other portions of the building or, if applicable,
from other portions of the applicable unit of a building. In the event
that an adult-oriented use license fails to designate the applicable
physically separate defined area, however, any designation of such
defined area made pursuant to Chapter 690, Zoning, shall be
deemed to be controlling, and in the absence of such a designation,
the entire building shall be deemed to be included in such area.
(5) An adult-oriented use license shall not be issued for any adultoriented
use or establishment if the operator, use(s) or related
operation or layout in question fail to satisfy any applicable
§ 176-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-19
1:145
requirements of this chapter, Chapter 690, Zoning, or any other
City ordinance.
(6) An individual shall not appear live and publicly in an adult-oriented

publicly in an adult-oriented use or establishment without wearing
at least an opaque G-string. An individual appearing live and
publicly in an adult-oriented use or establishment shall not uncover
or expose to view his or her genitals or anus, and a female
individual appearing live and publicly in an adult-oriented use or

nipple of her breast. The operator shall not permit an individual
appearing live and publicly in an adult-oriented use or
establishment to violate this Subsection A(6).
(7) A seminude individual shall not appear live and publicly in any
adult-oriented use or establishment other than on a raised platform
or stage that is at least 23 inches above the surrounding floor
areas. A seminude individual shall not appear live and publicly in
an adult-oriented use or establishment in an area that is not open to
and viewable by customers and members of the public generally
who are within the physically separate defined area occupied by
the adult-oriented use in which such individual is appearing. The
operator shall not permit a seminude individual appearing live and
publicly in an adult-oriented use or establishment to violate this
Subsection A(7).
(8) The raised platform or stage on which any seminude individual
appears live and publicly in an adult-oriented use or establishment
shall be separated from any area of such use or establishment
where any members of the public or customers are permitted to sit,
stand, move about or dance by a separation zone consisting of not
less than six feet of space (measured horizontally from the closest
edge of the raised platform or stage), and a rigid physical barrier
not less than 30 inches high at the outer periphery of such
separation zone. A customer or member of the public shall not sit,
stand, move about or dance within such six-foot separation zone
while a seminude individual is appearing live and publicly in such
adult-oriented use or establishment. The operator shall not permit
a customer or member of the public in an adult-oriented use or
establishment to so occupy such six-foot separation zone while a
seminude individual is appearing live and publicly in such use or
establishment.
(9) Without respect to Subsection A(7) and (8) above, a seminude
individual shall not appear live and publicly in any adult-oriented
use or establishment within six feet of any customers or members
of the public.
§ 176-19 REEDSBURG CODE § 176-19
1:146
(10) An individual less than 18 years of age shall not enter or remain in
the physically separate defined area of a building in which an adultoriented
use is located. The operator of an adult-oriented use or
establishment shall not permit any individual less than 18 years of
age to enter or remain in the physically separate defined area of a
building in which an adult-oriented use is located. The age limit
shall be prominently and clearly posted at all entrances to the
physically separate defined area of a building in which an adultoriented
use is located.
(11) A seminude individual appearing live in an adult-oriented use or
establishment shall not be visible to anyone outside the physically
separate defined area of a building occupied by such use.
(12) Adult-oriented printed or graphic materials (including, without
limitation, any advertising or packaging materials that are

displayed within an adult-oriented use or establishment shall not be
visible to anyone outside the physically separate defined area of a
building occupied by such use.
(13) An adult-oriented movie or other adult-oriented motion-picture

defined area of a building occupied by such use.
(14) An adult-oriented use or establishment shall comply with all
applicable requirements of Chapter 690, Zoning, and of all other
City ordinances.
(15) An adult-oriented use license shall not be granted for the operation
of an adult-oriented use or establishment in the same building as a
residential use or a motel or hotel use, unless both the adultoriented
use or motel or hotel use and the residential use are
existing allowed uses pursuant to Chapter 690, Zoning, and the
only way to access the residential use or motel or hotel use is by an
exterior entrance that is completely separate from the adultoriented
use(s) or establishment.
(16) An individual who appears live and publicly in a seminude
condition in an adult-oriented use or establishment shall not
socialize or mingle with customers or members of the public or
customers in such use or establishment and shall not work as a
bartender, waitress, waiter, hostess or host, or in any other
capacity in such use or establishment that involves direct contact
with customers or members of the public in such use or
establishment during the eight hours immediately before or after
so appearing.
(17) An operator shall not permit any criminal activity in an adultoriented
use or establishment.
§ 176-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 176-19
1:147
(18) A seminude individual appearing live and publicly in an adultoriented
use or establishment shall not touch any customer or
member of the public in such use or establishment, or voluntarily
allow himself or herself to be touched by a customer or member of
the public in such use or establishment. A customer or member of
the public in an adult-oriented use or establishment shall not touch
a seminude individual appearing live and publicly in such a use or
establishment and shall not voluntarily allow himself or herself to
be touched by a seminude individual appearing live and publicly in
such a use or establishment. These restrictions on touching shall be

use or establishment shall not fondle or otherwise touch in
an erotic or indecent manner any other entertainer or employee in
an adult-oriented use or establishment or voluntarily permit herself
or himself to be fondled or otherwise touched in an erotic or
indecent manner by any other entertainer or employee in such a
use or establishment.
(21) Any cubicle, booth or small room or other small, enclosed space
having a floor area less than 100 square feet in an adult use or
establishment, which is used by customers or members of the
public for private viewing of adult-oriented materials or other
similar purposes (but not including a restroom), shall be completely
open at one end to the main room or to an interior aisle, shall be
situated and arranged so as to be easily inspected, shall contain

enforcement. Each requirement of this section that is violated
constitutes a separate violation. In addition to forfeiture, the
airport may seek such other relief, legal or equitable, as is
available.
A. All hangars must be used for an aeronautical purpose. FAA considers
the following uses aeronautical:
(1) Storage of active aircraft;
(2) Shelter for maintenance, repair or refurbishment of aircraft, but
not the indefinite storage of nonoperational aircraft;
(3) Noncommercial construction of amateur-built or kit-built aircraft;
(4) Storage of aircraft handling equipment (e.g., tow bar, glider tow
equipment, workbenches, tools and materials used to service
aircraft); and
(5) Storage of materials related to an aeronautical activity (e.g.,
balloon and skydiving equipment, office equipment, teaching tools).
B. Provided the hangar is used primarily for an aeronautical purpose, an
airport may permit nonaeronautical items stored in hangars, provided
they do not interfere with the aeronautical use of the hangar.
C. While airports may develop more restrictive rules, FAA would not
consider nonaeronautical storage to interfere with the aeronautical use
of the hangar unless the items:
(1) Impede the movement of the aircraft in and out of the hangar;
(2) Displace the aeronautical contents of the hangar. A vehicle parked
at the hangar while the vehicle owner is using the aircraft will not
be considered to displace the aircraft;
(3) Impede access to other aeronautical contents of the hangar;
(4) Are used for the conduct of a nonaeronautical business or
municipal agency function from the hangar, including storage of
inventory); and
(5) Are stored in violation of airport rules and regulations, lease
provisions, building codes or local ordinances.
D. If the airport has empty hangars with no demand for nautical use, the
airport can rent hangar space for temporary nonaeronautical storage,
provided:
(1) Nonaeronautical storage is preapproved by FAA;
(2) A fair market value commercial rental rate is charged; and

BUILDING CONSTRUCTION
A. At least 24 hours prior to initial blasting at a blast site, the blaster in
charge shall make a reasonable effort to notify, in writing or verbally, all
residents or owners of affected dwellings or other structures, as
determined under Subsections B and C, that a blasting operation is to
begin.
B. Affected dwellings or other structures within the City shall be
determined based on the scaled-distance equation, W = (D/Ds) 1/2.
Using a scaled-distance factor, Ds, of 55, affected dwellings or other
structures shall be those located within the distance, D, of the
controlled blasting site area for the weight per delay W of explosives to
be used.
Note: An example calculation to determine D is as follows: For four
pounds of explosives, D = Ds(W) 1/2 = 55(4) 1/2 = 110 feet.
C. Adjacent properties and affected dwellings or other structures within
the ET shall include all those within a maximum 600-foot radius of the
blast site or as calculated under the above formula, whichever is
greater.

No person shall move any building or structure upon any of the public
ways of the City without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Building
Inspector and upon the payment of the required fee as set from time to time
by Common Council. Every such permit issued by the Building Inspector

not less than seven days prior to the intended moving date.
§ 242-19. General provisions.
No permit shall be issued to move a building within or into the City and
to establish it upon a location within the City until the Building Inspector
has made an investigation of such building at the location from which it is
to be moved and is satisfied from such investigation that said building is
in a sound and stable condition and of such construction that it will meet
the requirements of this building code in all respects. Should any repairs,
improvements, or remodeling be contemplated or required with respect to
said building, the same shall be made insofar as possible before the said
building is taken from the premises from which it is to be moved. A complete
plan of all further repairs, improvements and remodeling with reference
to such building shall be submitted to the Building Inspector, and he shall
make a finding of fact to the effect that all such repairs, improvements
and remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of this building
code, and that when same are completed, the building as such will so
comply with said building code. In the event a building is to be moved from
the City to some point outside its boundaries and the boundaries of the
extraterritorial zone, the provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans
and specifications for proposed alterations to such building and placing of
the building on a permanent foundation as set forth in § 242-21B below may

is to be relocated.
C. The Building Inspector shall issue a permit if it is determined that the
exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the building to be
moved or moved and altered will not be so at variance with either the
§ 242-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 242-20
1:239
§ 242-21. Continuous movement.
§ 242-22. Street repair.
Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall, within one day
after said building reaches its destination, report that fact to the Building
Inspector, who shall thereupon, in the company of the Director of Public
Works, inspect the streets and highways over which said building has been
moved and ascertain their condition. If the removal of said building has
caused any damage to any streets or highways, the person to whom the
permit was issued shall forthwith place them in as good repair as they were
before the permit was granted. On the failure of the said permittee to do
so within 10 days thereafter to the satisfaction of the City, said body shall
repair the damage done to such streets and hold the person obtaining such
permit and the sureties on his bond responsible for the payment of same.
§ 242-23. Tree trimming.
If the movement of the building over the City streets and/or alleys requires
the trimming of trees, the same shall be done by a business or individual
who is regularly engaged in such service and is preapproved by the Director
of Public Works. It shall be the responsibility of said business or individual
to clean all trimming debris and replace any trees substantially damaged
during the move. On the failure of this business or individual to do so to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works within 10 business days after
said move, the City will clean up and/or replace such trees if necessary

or supplementary thereto as to cause a substantial depreciation in the
property values of said neighborhood within said applicable district.
A. The movement of buildings shall be a continuous operation during all
the hours of the day and at night, until such movement is fully
completed. All of such operations shall be performed with the least
possible obstruction to thoroughfares. No building shall be allowed to
remain overnight upon any street crossing or intersection, or so near
thereto as to prevent easy access to any fire hydrant or any other public
facility.
B. The building shall be placed on a permanent foundation constructed in
conformance with the building code within 120 days of the first day that
the building is moved from its prior location.
§ 242-20 REEDSBURG CODE § 242-24
1:240
§ 242-25. Insurance.
The Building Inspector shall require, in addition to said bond above
indicated, public liability insurance covering injury to one person in a sum
of not less than $100,000 and for one accident in a sum not less than
$300,000, together with property damage insurance in a sum not less than
$50,000, or such other coverage as deemed necessary.
§ 242-26. Violations and penalties.
In addition to those penalties set forth in § 242-49 of this chapter, any
person violating § 242-21B above shall, upon conviction of such violation, be
subject to a forfeiture of $25 for each day beyond the permitted 120 days
that the building remains unplaced on a permanent foundation, together
with costs of prosecution.
A. Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way in
the City, the party applying therefor shall give a bond to the City in a
sum to be fixed by the Building Inspector and which shall not be less
than $1,000 or as set from time to time by Common Council; said bond
to be executed by a corporate surety or two personal sureties to be
approved by the City Administrator conditioned upon, among other
things, the indemnification to the City for any costs or expenses
incurred by it in connection with any claims for damages to any persons
or property, and the payment of any judgment, together with the costs
and expenses incurred by the City in connection therewith, arising out
of the removal of the building for which the permit is issued. [Amended
at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II)]
B. Unless the Building Inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to be a
fact that the excavation exposed by the removal of such building from
its foundation shall not be so close to a public thoroughfare as to permit
the accidental falling therein of travelers, or the location, nature and
physical characteristics of the premises and the exposed excavation
such as to make intrusion upon the premises and the falling into such
excavation of children under 12 years of age unlikely; the bond required
shall be further conditioned upon the permittee erecting adequate
barriers and, within 48 hours, filling in such excavation or adopting and
employing such other means, devices or methods approved by the
Building Inspector and reasonably adopted or calculated to prevent the
occurrences set forth herein.
C. If the applicant proposes to alter the exterior of the building, the
applicant shall give a bond in an amount not less than $1,000 or as set
from time to time by Common Council to the effect that the applicant
will complete the proposed exterior alterations in the manner set forth
in the plans and specifications and by a date certain. [Amended at

to remove a building shall not be issued until it is ascertained that service
connections and appurtenant equipment, such as meters and regulators,
have been removed or sealed and plugged in a safe manner. Excavations
shall be filled with solid fill to match lot grade, within 30 days of removal
of the structure. Any excavation shall be protected with appropriate fences,
barriers and/or lights.

§ 332-4. Exemptions for water utilities impact fees.
§ 332-5. Impact fees for park facilities.
§ 332-6. Payment of impact fees.

(1) Alterations or expansion of an existing building where no additional
or larger water meter connections are requested.
(2) The replacement of a building or structure with a new building or
structure of the same size and use where no additional or larger
water and/or sewer connections are requested and where the use is
not changed.
B. A change in water meter size shall not be exempted from payment of
the impact fee; however, a credit shall be given for the current impact
fee on the old meter size. For example, at the time of an application for
a change from a five-eighths-inch meter to a one-inch meter, the impact
fee would equal the current impact fee for a one-inch meter less the
current impact fee for a five-eighths-inch meter.

1:287
§ 332-7. Needs assessment.
The basis for the imposition of impact fees is the Park Facilities Needs
Assessment Report and its attachments, as outlined in the needs
assessment prepared by MSA in May 2019, and the Water Impact Fee
Report, prepared by MSA Professional Services, Inc. in May 2019 both of
which are on file in the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer of the City of

Reedsburg Utility Commission prior to issuance of a water meter. A
completed application for water service, and a copy of the building
permit shall be submitted with the payment.
A. Funds collected from impact fees shall be used solely for the purpose of
paying the proportionate costs of providing public facilities that may
become necessary due to land development. These costs may include
the costs of debt service on bonds or similar debt instruments when the
debt has been incurred for the purpose of proceeding with designated
public facilities projects prior to the collection of all anticipated impact
fees for that project, to reimburse the City or Utility for advances of
other funds or reserves, and such other purposes consistent with
§ 66.0617, Wis. Stats., which are recorded and approved by the
Common Council. Section 66.0617, Wis. Stats., was amended by Act
243 of 2017 to:

shall provide to the developer from which it received the fee an
accounting of how the fee will be spent; and

amounts for an increase in service capacity greater than the
capacity necessary to serve the development for which the fee is
imposed; or expenses for operation or maintenance of a public
facility.
B. The City may issue bonds, revenue certificates, and other obligations of
indebtedness in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be
provided by law in furtherance of the provision of capital improvement
projects. Funds pledged toward retirement of bonds, revenue
certificates, or other obligations of indebtedness for such projects may
include impact fees and other City revenues as may be allowed by the
Council. Impact fees paid pursuant to this chapter, however, shall be
restricted to use solely and exclusively for financing directly or as a
pledge against bonds, revenue certificates, and other obligations of
indebtedness for the cost of capital improvements as specified herein.
§ 332-6 REEDSBURG CODE § 332-8
1:288
§ 332-9. Refunds of fees.

years beyond projected commencement of projects or 20 years beyond
projected satisfaction of indebtedness of the specified projects for
which these impact fees are imposed.

refunded to the current owner of the property with respect to which the
impact fees were imposed along with any interest that has accumulated
thereon.
B. The ten-year time limit for using impact fees may be extended for three
years if the City adopts a resolution stating that, due to extenuating
circumstances or hardship in meeting the ten-year limit, it needs an
additional three years to use the impact fees that were collected. The
resolution shall include detailed written findings that specify the
extenuating circumstances or hardship that led to the need to adopt a
resolution under this subsection.
C. An impact fee that was collected before January 1, 2003, must be used
for the purpose for which it was imposed not later than December 31,

current property owner of the property with respect to which the
impact fee was imposed, along with any interest, which has
accumulated.

April 11, 2006, must be used for the purpose for which it was imposed
not later than the first day of the 120th month beginning after the date
on which the fee was collected. Any such fee that is not used by that
date shall be refunded to the current owner of the property with respect

accumulated.
E. With regard to an impact fee that is collected after April 10, 2006, and
is collected more than eight years after the effective date of this
chapter, such impact fees shall be used within a reasonable period of
time after they are collected to pay the capital costs for which they were
imposed, or they shall be refunded to the current owner of the property
with respect to which the impact fees were imposed, along with any
interest that has accumulated.

construction; or the project for which a building permit has been issued
has been altered, resulting in a decrease in the amount of the impact
fee due.

rise to the right to claim a refund.
H. The petition for refund must be submitted to the City for a park
facilities impact fee refund and/or the Reedsburg Utility Commission

I. Within one month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the City
or the Utility Commission must provide the petitioner, in writing, with a
decision on the refund request, including the reasons for the decision. If

donate land in lieu thereof) listed in the needs assessment or capital
improvement plan. If the property owner elects to make such
improvement, the property owner must enter into an agreement with
the City prior to issuance of any building permit. The agreement must
establish the estimated cost of the improvement, the schedule for

renovation or other work, or such annexation.
(2) Time allotment. The Common Council, in making such a conditional
grant of a license, may direct the City Clerk-Treasurer to withhold

work. The Common Council may further require the applicant to
notify the City Clerk-Treasurer upon completion of the work, after

the license.
(3) Failure to complete within time allotted. Any material failure to
conform with all such representations made to the Common
Council as to the proposed licensed premises within the time set for
completion of such work and any extensions of such time shall
render the decision to grant the license void, and shall be deemed a
denial of the application by the Common Council as of the
expiration of the time or extended time for completion of
construction.
§ 349-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 349-7

beverages shall be displayed on the outside of the premises or inside of the
premises as in such matter to be visible from the outside of the premises.
§ 349-9. Retail license quotas.
(4) License fee nonrefundable. In any case where there is a conditional
grant of license, and the license is ordered withheld for a time
period or periods to allow for construction, and the applicant
subsequently fails to satisfy the conditions of the grant of the
license by satisfactory completion of such construction within the
allotted time, the entirety of the license fee shall be nonrefundable.
I. Failure to operate under license. If an applicant fails to operate under a
grant license for four months for reasons other than construction or

limitation that the aggregate number of "Class B" licenses issued

500 inhabitants or fraction thereof in the City as determined by the
last federal census or official State of Wisconsin estimate.
(2) These licenses are nonrenewable in nature and must be applied for

alcohol beverages and shall make those logs available to the City
during normal business hours and at the time that a new license is

which the sale of alcohol beverages accounts for less than 50% of gross
receipts and which does not have a barroom if the City's quota under
§ 349-9B has been reached, thereby prohibiting the issuance of a "Class
B" license to that person. A "Class C" license may not be issued to a
foreign corporation or a person acting as an agent for or in the employ
of another.

A. Findings and purpose. The Common Council finds that businesses such
as restaurants, hotels and taverns make important contributions to the
City's economy. These establishments serve important public purposes,
including increasing the City's property tax base, providing
employment and promoting tourism. Excessive license fees deter new
businesses and are contrary to the above-stated public purposes.
Section 125.51(3)(e)(2), Wis. Stats., requires municipalities to establish
a minimum fee of $10,000 for each reserve "Class B" liquor license
issued. Since the new fee far exceeds the actual cost of licensing the
activity, additional revenue will be available to the City. It is the purpose
of this chapter to utilize revenue generated by § 125.51(3)(e)2, Wis.
Stats., to assist new reserve "Class B" licensees to achieve the
important public purposes identified herein.
B. Following the issuance of an original "Class B" liquor license and upon
application, the Common Council may provide a grant to the licensee in
an amount not to exceed $9,400. Prior to awarding any grant, the
Common Council shall make such findings and establish such
conditions to ensure that any funds awarded hereunder further the
important public purposes identified herein. [Amended 9-12-2005]

beverages are not accessible by underage individuals;

a hazard, the vehicle shall be impounded as set forth below and the
Chief of Police shall cause publication of a notice of such
impounding as a Class 2 notice in the official City newspaper. The
notice shall briefly describe the motor vehicle, the location from
which it was removed and set forth the owner's rights to a hearing
as set forth above.
(7) Reclamation. At any time prior to the sale of an impounded motor
vehicle, any person establishing his ownership or right of
possession of the same may pay the Police Department for the
storage and towing thereof along with such other expenses

§ 402-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 402-3
1:335
expenses incurred in relation thereto. [Amended at time of

such sale shall be published in the official City newspaper as a
Class 2 notice. The sales notice may include one or more
vehicles. At such sale, the highest bid in cash for any motor
vehicle shall be accepted, unless the same is, in the judgment
of the Chief of Police, inadequate. In the event that all bids are
rejected or no bid at all is received, the Chief of Police may, in
his discretion, either readvertise the sale or adjourn the same
from time to time to a definite date each time, or sell such
motor vehicle at a private sale, or junk the same.
(b) After deducting the reasonable and necessary expenses
incident to the care and sale of any motor vehicle, the balance
of the proceeds shall be paid to the City Clerk-Treasurer and
credited to the general City fund. The sale of the motor vehicle
under the provisions of this section shall forever bar all prior
claims thereto and any interest therein except as hereafter
provided.
(c) At any time within two years after the sale of a motor vehicle as
provided herein, any person claiming ownership of such motor
vehicle or a financial interest therein may present a claim to
the Common Council of the City of Reedsburg setting forth
such facts as are necessary to establish such ownership or
interest. If the Common Council is satisfied as to the merit of
such claim, it may allow the same, but in no case shall the
amount allowed exceed the sum paid to the City Clerk-
Treasurer as a result of the sale of such vehicle nor the amount
of the interest of the claimant therein.
(9) Penalties. Any person who shall violate any provision of this or any
order, rule or regulation made hereunder shall be subject to a

The applicant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City of
Reedsburg and its officers, officials, agents, and employees against all loss
or expense (including liability costs and reasonable attorney's fees) by

removed and returned immediately after the event has ended.

as a result of the event, or if the special event has violated any conditions
placed on the event in the permit, or if the special event has violated any
City ordinances.
§ 415-17. Emergency revocation.
The Chief of Police or his or her designee may revoke a special event permit
that has already been issued if the Chief of Police or Fire Chief or his or

RIGHTS-OF-WAY
§ 478-1. Findings.
§ 478-2. Purpose.
A. In the exercise of governmental functions, the City has priority over all
other uses of the public rights-of-way. The City desires to anticipate and
minimize the number of obstructions and excavations taking place to
regulate the placement of facilities in the rights-of-way to ensure that
the rights-of-way remain available for public services and are safe for
public use, and to ensure that facilities are timely maintained,
supported, protected or relocated to accommodate reconstruction or
repairs. The taxpayers of the City bear the financial burden for the
upkeep, maintenance and reconstruction of the rights-of-way, and a
primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-ofway
is the frequent use and excavation by persons who locate facilities
therein.
B. The City finds increased use of the public rights-of-way and increased
costs to the taxpayers of the City and that these costs are likely to
continue into the foreseeable future.
C. The City finds that delays by occupants of the rights-of-way in
maintaining, supporting, protecting or relocating facilities, if they affect
public construction projects, have the potential to significantly increase
public works projects costs borne by the taxpayers.
D. The City finds that occupancy and excavation of its rights-of-way causes
costs to be borne by the City and its taxpayers, including, but not
limited to:
(1) Administrative costs associated with public rights-of-way projects,
such as registration, permitting, inspection and supervision,
supplies and materials.
(2) Management costs associated with ongoing management activities
necessitated by pubic rights-of-way users.
(3) Repair or restoration costs to the roadway associated with the
actual excavation into the public right-of-way.

in terms of decreased useful life, due to excavations into the public
rights-of-way.
A. Based on the foregoing facts, the City enacts this chapter relating to
administration of and permits to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the
public rights-of-way. This chapter imposes reasonable regulations on

disruption of the general public and traffic, the Director of Public Works
is authorized to assess the actual cost of the City employee's time
engaged in the review and inspection of the anticipated work multiplied
by a factor determined by the respective department to represent the
City's cost for statutory expense, benefits, insurance, sick leave,
holidays, vacation and similar benefits, overhead and supervision, said
factor not to exceed 2.0, plus the cost of mileage reimbursed to City
employees which is attributed to the work, plus all consultant fees
associated with the work at the invoiced amount, plus 10% for
administration.

1:378
§ 478-12. Inspection.
permittee must repair the general area of the work and the surrounding
areas, including the paving and its foundations, to the specifications of
the Department. The Department shall inspect the, area of the work
and accept the work when it determines that proper repair has been
made per specifications of the Department.
B. Guarantees. The permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for
36 months following its completion. During this period it shall, upon
notification from the. Department, correct all work to the extent
necessary, using the method required by the Department. Said work
shall be completed within 10 calendar days of the receipt of the notice
from the Department, not including days during which work cannot be
done because of circumstances constituting force majeure.

right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the
Department, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all work
required by the Department, the Department, at its option, may do such
work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within 30 days of
billing, the cost of repairing/restoring the right-of-way.
D. Degradation. The general formula for computing the degradation fee
shall be the cost per square yard for street overlay and seal coat
multiplied by the appropriate depreciation rate for that street
multiplied by the area of the patch. The area of the patch shall be
calculated by adding one foot to each side of the actual street cut. The
degradation fee schedule is available upon request from the Director of
Public Works.
E. Restoration in lieu of repair and degradation. The permittee may elect
to restore the excavation and surrounding pavement in lieu of repair
and a degradation fee. The restoration shall be in accordance with the

health safety or well-being of the public. The City may issue an order to
the registrant or permittee for any work that does not conform to the

relieve the permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits,
licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by any other City, county,
state, or federal rules, laws or regulations. A permittee shall comply with
all requirements of local, state and federal laws. A permittee shall perform
all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and

exhibition, celebration, festival or other event;

and/or insurance;
(5) Failure of the applicant or permittee to complete work in a timely

is available;

(9) The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other
rights-of-way for the facilities of the permittee or applicant;

materially improve its utility service, or to allow the permittee or
applicant to comply with state or federal law or City ordinance or an
order of a court or administrative agency.
C. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Department
revoking, suspending, refusing to issue or refusing to extend a permit

shall be filed within 10 days of the decision being appealed. Following a
hearing, the City Board may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of
the Department.

by verbal notice on an emergency phone number provided by the City of

respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the
necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and otherwise
fully comply with the requirements of this chapter.
B. If the City becomes aware of any emergency regarding a registrant's
facilities, the Department may attempt to contact the local
representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by
the emergency. The City may take whatever action it deems necessary
to protect the public safety as a result of the emergency, the cost of
which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
C. Nonemergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who,
without first having obtained the necessary permit, excavates a right-ofway
must subsequently obtain a permit and shall, in addition to any
penalties prescribed by ordinance, pay double the normal fee for said
permit, pay double all the other fees required by this chapter or other
chapters of the Code of the City of Reedsburg, deposit with the

the placement of new or additional facilities when required to protect
the public, health, safety or welfare.

to maintain, support, shore or move the registrant's facilities, the City
shall notify the local representative. The registrant shall meet with the
City's representative within 24 hours and coordinate the protection,
maintenance, supporting and/or shoring of the registrant's facilities.
The registrant shall accomplish the needed work within 72 hours unless
the City agrees to a longer period.
B. In the event that the registrant does not proceed to maintain, support,
shore, or move its facilities, the City may arrange to do the work and bill
the registrant, said bill to be paid within 30 days.

discontinue its operations in the City must either:
(1) Provide information satisfactory to the Department that the
registrant's obligations for its facilities under this section have

of the right-of-way by the permittee; and the permittee by its acceptance
of a permit to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the right-of-way or of
registration under this chapter agrees that all lawful powers and rights,
regulatory powers, or police power, or otherwise as are the same may be
from time to time vested in or reserved to the City, shall be in full force and
effect and subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt
and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the
public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general law, and
ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.
§ 478-22. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court

(b) Require the registrant, at its own expense, to remove the
facilities in the right-of-way at ground or above ground level; or

period of time for compliance by the user.
H. Any permit issued under this article shall be revocable by the Common
Council for violation of the terms and condition thereof, and such
violations may be subject to penalties listed in this chapter.
A. The City, at its own discretion, may require an industrial user to install a
suitable structure, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances, in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling
and measurement of the wastes being discharged to the public
sewerage system. Such structure, when required, shall be accessible
and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans
approved by the City. The structure shall be installed by the owner at
his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and
accessible at all times. In the event that the industrial user fails to
construct such a structure, the City may do so and shall assess the cost
thereof to the industrial user.
B. The City may require the industrial user to collect representative
samples of its wastewater discharge, to analyze the sample for
parameters specified by the City, and to report the results to the City in
a timely manner. Any samples collected during such monitoring shall
follow a strict chain-of-custody procedure to ensure security of the
samples and anonymity during analysis.
C. The City may elect to independently monitor the discharge of any
industrial user to assess compliance with applicable standards. Any
samples collected during such monitoring shall follow a strict chain-ofcustody
procedure to ensure security of the samples and anonymity
during analysis.
A. The Public Works Department may require pretreatment of industrial
discharges if, in its opinion, pretreatment is necessary to protect the
wastewater facilities or prevent the discharge of incompatible
pollutants and to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The
§ 493-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 493-22
1:415
criteria for such a decision are the existing capacity of the plant relative
to BOD and SS.
B. Existing industries or new industrial users found to be subject to
applicable categorical pretreatment standards shall be in compliance
with these standards in accordance all federal, state, and local laws or
regulations.
C. Grease, oil, and/or sand interceptors or traps may be required to be
installed by the user at its own expense when, in the opinion of the
Public Works Department, such facilities are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease or floatable oils in excess of
limitations specified in § 493-13 hereof, or any sand, inflammable
wastes, or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the Public Works Department and shall
be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning by the user
and for inspection by the Department.
D. When pretreatment facilities are required, the industrial user shall
construct and install the necessary facilities at its own expense, and in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Public Works
Department, and any other local, state, or federal agencies having
regulatory authority with respect to such pretreatment facilities. No
pretreatment plant or facility shall be constructed or operated unless
all plans, specifications, technical operating data and other information
pertinent to its proposed operation and maintenance have been
approved as described.
E. All pretreatment facilities shall be operated and maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operating condition at the
user's expense.
F. The Public Works Department shall determine the wastewater
discharge requirements for the pretreatment facilities. Dilution of an
industrial discharge for purposes of reducing the pollutant
characteristics or concentrations to below the limitations established
by this chapter, or below any other applicable pretreatment standard, is
prohibited.

User Charges
[Adopted as Sec. 13.08 of the former Municipal Codebook]
§ 493-28. Normal wastewater service charge.
§ 493-29. Industrial wastewater service charge.
A. There is hereby levied and assessed, upon each lot or parcel of land
with a building having a lateral available to discharge normal sewage to
the public sewer system, a wastewater service charge based upon rates
established by the Common Council. Said charges shall be assessed and
collected monthly. The wastewater service charges taxed or levied
pursuant to this article shall be collected by the Utility. Wastewater
service charges shall consist of a fixed charge and volume charge to
recover operation and maintenance expenses, debt service,
replacement fund, and depreciation fund expenses from all users in a
fair and equitable manner. Fixed charge shall be the minimum monthly
wastewater service charge as established by resolution of the Common
Council of the City of Reedsburg, as amended from time to time. The
current fixed charges shall be based on the size of the water meter(s)
serving the user.
B. Volume charge. In addition to the minimum fixed charge, there shall be
a volume charge based on water usage as determined from regular
water meter readings by the Water Utility. The charge shall be
determined by resolution of the Common Council, as amended from
time to time.
C. If customers obtain all or part of their water from sources other than
the Water Utility, all or any part of which is discharged into the public
sewers, a flat-rate charge shall be determined for wastewater service.
Should the City determine that the minimum flat-rate charge is less
than the charge would be on a metered basis, the City shall have the
authority to set a higher rate based on estimated total usage and the
metered rate schedule. Should the residential customer request it, a
water meter shall be installed and the customer shall be charged on the
same basis as commercial or industrial customers having private water
supplies.
D. Summer adjustment for water not reaching the sewerage system.
Sewerage bills for residential customers of the sewerage system shall
be reduced by 15% for the billing periods of July, August and
September. For the purposes of this article, "residential customers"
means persons who are full-time residential occupants of a property,
notwithstanding the zoning classification of the property. The Director
of Public Works shall designate the customers who will receive the
seasonal adjustment. Notice of this adjustment shall be given in
sewerage bills in the billing cycle, which precedes the adjustment.
§ 493-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 493-29
1:421
A. Charges for industrial wastewater may be based on the same method
used for normal concentration wastewater described in § 493-28 when
the concentrations of pollutants in said wastewater do not exceed
normal concentration wastewater. Otherwise, charges for industrial
wastewater shall be based on volume, BOD, suspended solids,
ammonia, phosphorus, and such other constituents that affect the cost
of collection and treatment as provided herein; the amount of charge
shall reflect the cost incurred by the Public Works Department in
treating said constituents. Charges shall be made in accordance with
rates established by resolution of the Common Council hereafter.
B. Charges for industrial wastewater based on volume, BOD, suspended
solids, ammonia, and phosphorus shall be calculated as follows:
Waste Charge = FC + VC + PC
Where:
FC = the fixed meter charge based on the rates established in
§ 493-28A
VC = the volume charge as defined in § 493-29C
PC = the pollutant charge as defined in § 493-29D
C. The volume of industrial discharge used for computing the volume
charge shall be the actual volume of waste as determined by an
industrial waste metering installation or, in lieu of such facilities, the
metered water consumption, subject to adjustments as otherwise
provided herein. The volume charge shall be calculated as follows:
Volume Charge (VC) = VD\1,000 x $V
Where:
VD = the volume of industrial discharge for time period, gallons
$V = the unit volume charge established in § 493-29E per
1,000 gallons
D. The pollutant charges shall be based on the actual measured
concentration of the industrial wastewater for BOD, suspended solids,
ammonia, phosphorus and any other constituents; in lieu of actual
discharge measurements, the Department may elect to use average
assumed concentrations. The total pollutant charge shall be the sum of
each individual pollutant charge, calculated as follows:
Pollutant Charge (PC) = VD\1,000 x CP x $P x 0.00834
Where:
VD = the volume of industrial discharge for time period, gallons
CP = the concentration of pollutant as determined by the
Department, mg/L
§ 493-29 REEDSBURG CODE § 493-29
1:422
$P = the unit pollutant charge established in § 493-29E per
pound of pollutant
E. The rates of charge for each of the aforementioned constituents will be
at the prevailing rate at the time. The Reedsburg Common Council may
adjust rates. Said prevailing rates shall be assessed as follows:
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. II)]
Parameter Unit Charge
Volume ($V) $ per 1,000 gallons
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) $ per pound
Suspended Solids (SS) $ per pound
Ammonia-Nitrogen (NH3-N) $ per pound
Phosphorus (P) $ per pound
F. In addition to the above charges, the Public Works Department's costs
of sampling and analyzing industrial wastes may be charged to the
applicable industry.
G. Where industrial wastes are of such a strength or magnitude, or are
delivered over such a period of time that the above charges do not
reflect the actual cost of treatment to the Public Works Department, the
Department reserves the right to establish a special charge for
handling the waste. The portion of charge related to debt service shall
be based on the design capacity required for the particular waste. In no
event shall the charges be less than those charges determined by
applying the above charges.
H. If an industrial user obtains all or any part of its water from sources
other than the City of Reedsburg Water Utility, all or any part of which
is discharged into the public sewers, the user shall be required to have
a water meter or meters installed for the purpose of determining the
volume of water obtained from these other sources. Should the City
determine that the water usage is too small to justify a meter, the City
shall have the authority to waive this requirement and a flat rate may be
charged based on estimated water usage and the metered rate
schedule. The water meters shall be furnished by the Public Works
Department and installed by the user. All costs in connection with the
water meter installation shall be at the expense of the user. The Public
Works Department will charge for each meter at the rate of 50% of the
basic rate set for that size meter charged each period, not a one-time
payment, to compensate for furnishing, reading and servicing the
meter. This charge shall be in addition to the wastewater service
charge.
I. In the event that an industrial user produces evidence satisfactory to
the City that significant amounts of the water used for all purposes do

§ 493-30. Septage, leachate and holding tank disposal service
charges.
Service charges for septage, leachate and holding tank waste are calculated
based on the following assumed concentrations and the unit rates specified
in § 493-29E:
§ 493-31. Late payment charge.
A charge of no more than 1% per month will be added to bills not paid within
20 days from date of issuance. The late payment charge shall be applied
to the total unpaid balance for utility service, including unpaid payment
charges. This charge is applicable to all customers.
§ 493-32. Remedies for failure to pay service charges.
Each wastewater service charge levied by, or pursuant to, this chapter is
hereby made a lien upon the corresponding lot, land, or premises served
by a connection to the sanitary sewer system of the City, and if the same
is not paid within the period allotted for such payment, said charge shall
constitute a lien on the property served and be inserted in the City tax roll
as provided in § 66.0821, Wis. Stats., in the same manner as water rates
are taxed and collected under the provisions of § 66.0809(1) or § 62.69(2)(f),
not reach the sanitary sewer, the user may be permitted to have an
exemption water meter(s) installed. Said meter(s) shall be furnished by
the Public Works Department and installed by the user. All other costs
shall be at the expense of the user requiring the meter(s), including any
piping revisions required to ensure that the exemption meter measures
only water not reaching the sanitary sewer. The City will charge for
each meter at the rate of 50% of the basic rate set for that size
meter charged each period, not a one-time payment, to compensate
for furnishing, reading and servicing the meter. This charge shall be in
addition to the wastewater service charge. The amount of exemption
water measured shall be subtracted from the total amount of water
used by the person to determine the applicable wastewater service
charge.
A. Holding tank waste: $/1,000 gal.
(Based on BOD @ 600 mg/L; SS @ 1,800 mg/L; NH3-N @ 100 mg/L; and
P @ 30 mg/L)
B. Septic tank waste: $/1,000 gal.
(Based on BOD @ 5,000 mg/L; SS @ 15,000 mg/L; NH3-N @ 350 mg/L;
and P @ 300 mg/L)
C. Leachate waste. Based upon analysis of a suitable sample(s), the charge
for leachate waste shall be calculated at the same rate as the surcharge
for industrial wastewater as authorized in § 493-29 of this article.
§ 493-29 REEDSBURG CODE § 493-32
1:424
Wis. Stats., as same has been, and from time to time may be, amended or
recreated, so far as applicable.
§ 493-33. Biannual audit.
A. An audit of the Department's financial standing shall be made
biannually. This audit will be used to review the adequacy of the
existing rates, and said rates shall be adjusted if necessary to provide
sufficient revenues to adequately finance the Department's operation in
accordance with the original intent of the rate structure. The biannual
audit and review shall also be used to ensure that each recipient of
sewage service (or user class) is charged in proportion to the cost of
providing said recipient (or user class) with sewage service. Excess
revenues collected from a class of users shall be applied to the costs
attributable to that class for the next year, and the rates shall be
adjusted accordingly.
B. All sewer customers shall be notified annually of the current sewer
charges.
C. Income from the wastewater service charges that constitutes funds
designated as "replacement" shall be separately accounted for and shall
not be utilized for any other purpose except replacement. These costs
include costs necessary to ensure replacement of all equipment,
accessories or appurtenances to maintain the wastewater facilities.
D. Income from the wastewater service charges that constitutes funds
designated as "depreciation" shall be separately accounted for and shall
not be utilized for any other purpose except reconstruction or
improvements of the collection system.
E. Water bypass meters prohibited in all residential zones. Separate
meters, commonly referred to as "sewer deduct meters," installed by
the property owner for the purpose of measuring water usage for lawn
watering, car washing, swimming pools or similar such usages of water
which bypasses the City sewer systems are prohibited in the City. Sewer
deduct meters existing at the time of passage of this article may
continue to be used until the property changes ownership or the
existing meter fails, at which time the meter's use shall cease and shall
be removed. [Amended 8-27-2007]

SEX OFFENDERS RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
§ 501-1. Purpose.
The City finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to
public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are likely
to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate
of recidivism for sexual offenders and that reducing opportunity and
temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense, there is a
need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places,
in addition to the protections afforded by state law, near schools, day-care
centers and other places children frequent. The City finds and declares
that in addition to schools, day-care centers, and public parks; children
congregate at movie theaters, swimming pools, athletic fields, libraries and
recreational clubs and academies.

Official Map
[Adopted as Sec. 8.01 of the former Municipal Codebook]
§ 537-1. Map established.
An Official Map of the City of Reedsburg is hereby established to conserve
and promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, a
copy of which is on file in the City Clerk-Treasurer's office at the Reedsburg
City Hall.
§ 537-2. Content.
Said Official Map shall show the streets, highways, parkways, parks, and
playgrounds heretofore laid out, adopted and established by law.
§ 537-3. Filing.
The City Clerk-Treasurer shall file with the Register of Deeds for Sauk
County, Wisconsin, a certificate showing that the City has established an
Official Map.
§ 537-4. Effect.
The placing of any street, highway, parkway, park or playground line or lines
upon the Official Map shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to
constitute the opening or establishing of any street, parkway, or playground,
or the taking or acceptance of any land for such purpose.
§ 537-5. Amendment. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see
Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
For the purpose of preserving the integrity of such Official Map, no permit
shall hereafter be issued for any building in the bed of any street, highway
or parkway shown or laid out on such map and no permit for the erection
of any building shall be issued unless a street, highway or parkway giving
access to such proposed structure has been duly placed on such map,
except as provided in § 62.23(6)(d) and (g), Wis. Stats. The proper official
authorized to issue building permits may require each applicant to submit
a plot plan certified by a registered survey and showing accurately the
location of any proposed building with reference to any street, highway
or parkway shown on the Official Map. The streets, highways or parkways
shown on the Official Map may be shown as extending beyond the
boundaries of the City a distance of 1 1/2 miles as provided by Ch. 236,
Wis. Stats. Any person desiring to construct a building in the bed of a
street, highway or parkway so shown as extended may apply to the Building
Inspector for a building permit. Unless such application is made and the
permit granted, or not denied, within 30 days, such person shall not be
entitled to compensation for damage to such building in the course of
construction of the street, highway or parkway. If the land within such
§ 537-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 537-5
1:457
mapped street, highway or parkway is not yielding a fair return, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may in a specific case, by the vote of a majority of its
members, grant a permit for a building in such street, highway or parkway
which will, as little as practicable, increase the cost of opening such street,
highway or parkway or tend to cause a change of such Official Map; and
such board may impose reasonable requirements as a condition of granting
such permit, which requirements shall be designed to promote the health,
convenience, safety or general welfare of the community. Such board shall
refuse a permit where the applicant will not be substantially damaged by
placing his building outside the mapped street, highway or parkway.

Statutory Authority; Finding of Fact; Statement of Purpose; Title;
General Provisions
§ 650-1. Statutory authority. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in § 62.23, Wis. Stats.,
and the requirements in § 87.30, Wis. Stats.
§ 650-2. Finding of fact.
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this
municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general
welfare and tax base.
§ 650-3. Statement of purpose.
This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
§ 650-4. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance" for the
City of Reedsburg, Wisconsin.
§ 650-5. General provisions.
A. Protect life, health and property;
B. Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
C. Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
D. Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
F. Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
G. Discourage the victimization of unwary land buyers and home buyers;
H. Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and
result in conflicts between property owners; and
I. Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the
floodplain.
A. Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be
covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base
flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood
§ 650-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-5
1:545
Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on
the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO Zones.
Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies.
If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive
information shall apply.
B. Official Maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts
are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood
elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or
floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be
reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of
map change process (see Article VIII, Amendments) before it is
effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps shall be effective
until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the
office of the Zoning Administrator, City of Reedsburg. If more than one
map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall
apply.
(1) Official Maps. FIRM panel numbers 55111C0191F, 55111C0192F,
55111C0194F, 55111C0212F, 55111C0213F, and 55111C0214F,

(2) Official Maps based on other studies. Sauk County, City of
Reedsburg, Village of Rock Springs, Flood Storage District, Panel 3
of 4, sources of study: WDNR, effective November 20, 2013.
C. Establishment of districts.
(1) The "floodway district" (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to
carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones
as shown on the FIRM.
(2) The "flood-fringe district" (FF) is that portion between the regional
flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the
FIRM.
(3) The "general floodplain district" (GFP) is those areas that may be
covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have
a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO
Zones, on the FIRM.
(4) The "flood storage district" (FSD) is that area of the floodplain
where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional
flood discharge.
§ 650-5 REEDSBURG CODE § 650-5
1:546
D. Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditions shall be
resolved using the criteria in Subsection D(1) or (2) below. If a
significant difference exists, the Map shall be amended according to
Article VIII, Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a
boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use
permit, whether or not a Map amendment is required. The Zoning
Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual
predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district
boundary was determined and for initiating any Map amendments
required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning
Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be
settled according to § 650-28C and the criteria in Subsection D(1) and
(2) below.
(1) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall
determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood
elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(2) Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the
boundary shall be determined by the map scale.
E. Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain
unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood
elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the
Map is amended pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments.
F. Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this
chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
G. Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to
comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways
and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt
when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
H. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
(1) This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under § 62.23, Wis. Stats., for cities or § 87.30,
Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive
ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions, but not otherwise. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
(2) This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter
§ 650-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-5
1:547
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail.
I. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor
of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter,
required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall
be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the
adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text
amendment to this chapter.
J. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in
this chapter are based on engineering experience and research. Larger
floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that
nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from
flooding and flood damages. This chapter does not create liability on the
part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on
this chapter.
K. Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected.
L. Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Sauk County floodplain
zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in
effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas
until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets
the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59 to 72,
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are
described on the municipality's Official Zoning Map. County floodplain
zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of
administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal
Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the

§ 650-20. Flood storage district.
The flood storage district delineates that portion of the floodplain where
storage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to
reduce the regional flood discharge. The district protects the flood storage
areas and assures that any development in the storage areas will not
decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would cause higher
flood elevations.
proposal upon flood height and flood flows, regional flood elevation
and to determine floodway boundaries.
(a) A hydrologic and hydraulic study as specified in § 650-26B(3).
(b) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the
ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size,
location and layout of all proposed and existing structures on
the site; location and elevations of streets, water supply, and
sanitary facilities; soil types and other pertinent information.
(c) Specifications for building construction and materials,
floodproofing, filling, dredging, channel improvement, storage,
water supply and sanitary facilities.
A. Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the
flood storage district (FSD), as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning
Maps.
B. Permitted uses. Any use or development which occurs in a flood storage
district must meet the applicable requirements in § 650-17.
C. Standards for development in flood storage districts.
(1) Development in a flood storage district shall not cause an increase
equal to or greater than 0.00 of a foot in the height of the regional
flood.
(2) No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage
volume unless an equal volume of storage, as defined by the
predevelopment ground surface and the regional flood elevation,
shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed
development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost
(compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table
is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage.
(3) If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be
developed unless the entire area zoned as flood storage district, on
this waterway, is rezoned to the flood-fringe district. This must
include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the
waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge
calculated without floodplain storage, as per Article VIII,
Amendments, of this chapter.

such as high-water marks, to determine the
reasonableness of the model results. If no historical
data is available, adequate justification shall be
provided for any parameters outside standard
accepted engineering practices.
[i] The model must extend past the upstream limit of the
difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles
in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The
height difference between the proposed flood profile
and the existing study profiles shall be no more than
0.00 feet.
[3] Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be
provided, showing all cross-section locations, floodway/
floodplain limits based on best available topographic data,
geographic limits of the proposed development and
whether the proposed development is located in the
floodway.

floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on
the regional flood elevation.
[b] If any part of the proposed development is in the
floodway, it must be added to the base model to show
the difference between existing and proposed
conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients
remain the same as in the existing model, unless
adequate justification based on standard accepted
engineering practices is provided.
(b) Zone AE floodplains.
[1] Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the
existing study, the appropriate method to be used shall be
based on § NR 116.07(3), Wis. Adm. Code, Hydrologic
AnalysisDetermination of Regional Flood Discharge.
[2] Hydraulic model. The regional flood elevation shall be
based on the standards in § NR 116.07(4), Wis. Adm. Code,
Hydraulic AnalysisDetermination of the Regional Flood
Elevation, and the following:
[a] Duplicate effective model. The effective model shall be
reproduced to ensure correct transference of the
model data and to allow integration of the revised data
§ 650-26 REEDSBURG CODE § 650-26

to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and
downstream of the revised reach. If data from the
effective model is available, models shall be generated
that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations
shown in the Floodway Data Table in the FIS report to
within 0.1 foot.
[b] Corrected effective model. The corrected effective
model shall not include any man-made physical
changes since the effective model date, but shall
import the model into the most current version of
HEC-RAS for Department review.
[c] Existing (preproject conditions) model. The existing
model shall be required to support conclusions about
the actual impacts of the project associated with the
revised (post-project) model or to establish more upto-
date models on which to base the revised (postproject)
model.
[d] Revised (post-project conditions) model. The revised
(post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the
existing model and any proposed changes to the
topography caused by the proposed development. This
model shall reflect proposed conditions.
[e] All changes to the duplicate effective model and
subsequent models must be supported by certified
topographic information, bridge plans, construction
plans and survey notes.
[f] Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to
the stream reach for which the revision is being
requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream
of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the
effective model and result in water surface elevations
and top widths computed by the revised models
matching those in the effective models upstream and
downstream of the revised reach as required. The
effective model shall not be truncated.
[3] Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be
submitted to the Department for review which meet the
following conditions:
[a] Consistency between the revised hydraulic models,
the revised floodplain and floodway delineations, the
revised flood profiles, topographic work map,
annotated FIRMs and/or Flood Boundary Floodway
Maps (FBFMs), construction plans, and bridge plans.
§ 650-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 650-26
1:575
[b] Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour
interval, and a planimetric map showing the
applicable items. If a digital version of the map is
available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM
may be more easily revised.

0.2% annual-chance floodplains and floodway
boundaries.
[d] If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital
mapping data (GIS or CADD) are used, then all
supporting documentation or metadata must be
included with the data submission, along with the
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and
state plane coordinate system in accordance with
FEMA mapping specifications.
[e] The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the
effective floodplain boundaries.
[f] All cross sections from the effective model shall be
labeled in accordance with the effective map, and a
cross section lookup table shall be included to relate
to the model input numbering scheme.
[g] Both the current and proposed floodways shall be
shown on the map.
[h] The stream center line, or profile baseline used to
measure stream distances in the model, shall be
visible on the map.

a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted
on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180
days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement
of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond
initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such
as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For
an alteration, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE  Any man-made object with form, shape and utility, either
permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground,
streambed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled
buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.
SUBDIVISION  Has the meaning given in § 236.02(12), Wis. Stats.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the equalized assessed value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50% of the equalized assessed value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure
has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial
improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not,
however, include either any project for the improvement of a building
required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations
identified by the Building Official and that are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of an historic structure,
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure.
§ 650-37 REEDSBURG CODE § 650-37
1:594
UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP  Where special conditions affecting a
particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict
conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or
density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes
of this chapter.
VARIANCE  An authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for the
construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which
is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in this
chapter.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without
required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing
certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to
be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
WATERSHED  The entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a
watercourse or body of water.
WATER SURFACE PROFILE  A graphical representation showing the
elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a
reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of
the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.
WELL  An excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring,
drilling, driving or other methods to obtain groundwater, regardless of its
intended use.

In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of
any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of
this chapter is required by a standard in Ch. NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and
where this chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in
light of the Ch. NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of
this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to
this chapter.
A. This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under § 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to
the floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another
municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that
ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions, but not otherwise.

use permit, before the Board of Appeals shall be in the form of a
written decision, made within a reasonable time after the public
hearing and signed by the Board chairperson. Such decisions shall

The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety, morals,
prosperity, aesthetics, and general welfare of this community.
§ 690-4. Intent.
It is the general intent of this chapter to regulate and restrict the use
of all structures, lands, and waters. It is also intended to regulate and
restrict lot coverage, population distribution and density, and the size and
location of all structures so as to lessen congestion in and promote the
safety and efficiency of the streets and highways, secure safety from fire,
flooding, panic and other dangers, provide adequate light, air, sanitation
and drainage, prevent overcrowding, avoid undue population concentration,
facilitate the adequate provision of public facilities and utilities, stabilize
and protect property values, further the appropriate use of land and
conservation of natural resources, preserve and promote the beauty of
the community, and implement the community's general plan or plan
components. It is further intended to provide for the administration and
enforcement of this chapter and to provide penalties for its violation.
§ 690-5. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of

air, safety from fire and other danger, undue concentration of population
and ample parking facilities.
§ 690-6. Scope.
It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way
impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances,
except those specifically repealed by this chapter, or with private
restrictions placed upon property by covenants running with the land to
which the City is a party. Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction
§ 690-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 690-6
1:637
upon land, buildings or structures than is imposed or required by such
existing provisions of law, ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of this
chapter shall control.

Appeals) shall adopt rules for its government and procedure.

Appeals may determine. The Chairperson may administer oaths
and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings shall be open
to the public.
(4) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall keep minutes of its proceedings,

thereof. The officers from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith
transmit to the Zoning Board of Appeals all the papers constituting

appeals and give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the
parties in interest and shall decide the same within a reasonable
time. Fees for an appeal are set forth in the current City Fees
Schedule.
B. Powers and duties. The City of Reedsburg Zoning Board of Appeals
shall have all the powers and duties prescribed by law and by this
§ 690-12 REEDSBURG CODE § 690-12
1:654
chapter, within the territorial limits of the City. The Joint
Extraterritorial Board of Appeals shall have all the power and duties
prescribed by law and by this chapter within the extraterritorial limits.
(1) Interpretation. Upon appeal from a decision by an administrative
official to decide any question involving the interpretation of any
provision of this chapter, including determination of the exact
location of any district boundary if there is uncertainty with respect
thereto.
(2) Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized under
current law to authorize a variance from the terms of this chapter.
A use variance grants permission for a use that is not permitted by
this chapter, and an area variance relaxes restrictions on
dimensions, such as setback, frontage, height, bulk, density, and
area. To grant a variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals must find
four things: [Amended 2-26-2018 by Ord. No. 1861-18]
(a) The variance will not be contrary to the public interest.
(b) Substantial justice will be done by granting the variance.
(c) The variance is needed so that the spirit of this chapter is
observed.
(d) Due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship.
(3) Variance hardship. A property owner bears the burden of proving
unnecessary hardship by demonstrating either of the following:
[Added 2-26-2018 by Ord. No. 1861-18]
(a) For an area variance, that strict compliance with this chapter
would unreasonably prevent the property owner from using
the property for a permitted purpose or would render
conformity with this chapter unnecessarily burdensome.
(b) For a use variance, that strict compliance with this chapter
would leave the property owner with no reasonable use of the
property in the absence of a variance. In both situations, the
property owner bears the burden of proving that the
unnecessary hardship is based on conditions unique to the
property, rather than personal considerations, and that the
unnecessary hardship was not created by the property owner.
(4) Prohibited use. Except as specifically provided, no action by the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the effect of permitting, in any
district, uses prohibited in such district.
(5) Expirations. An expiration date for a variance may be granted if
that date relates to a specific date by which the action authorized
by the variance must be commenced or completed. If no such
ordinance is in effect at the time a variance is granted, or if the
§ 690-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 690-12
1:655
Zoning Board of Appeals does not specify an expiration date for
the variance, a variance granted under this subsection does not
expire unless, at the time it is granted, the Zoning Board of Appeals
specifies in the variance a specific date by which the action
authorized by the variance must be commenced or completed. A
variance granted under this subsection runs with the land. [Added
11-23-2015 by Ord. No. 1819-15]
C. Procedure. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall act in strict accordance
with the procedure specified by law and by this chapter. All appeals and
applications made to the Board shall be in writing on forms prescribed
by the Board. Every appeal or application shall refer to the specific
provision of this chapter involved, and shall exactly set forth the
interpretation that is claimed, the use for which the special permit is
sought, or the details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds
on which it is claimed that the variance should be granted, as the case
may be. Every decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be by
resolution, each of which shall contain a full record of the findings of
the Board in the particular case. Each such resolution shall be filed in
the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer, by case number, under one or
another of the following headings: Interpretations; Variances; together
with all documents pertaining thereto. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall notify the Common Council and the Plan Commission of the City of
Reedsburg or the Joint Extraterritorial Committee of each
interpretation and each variance granted under the provisions of this
chapter.
D. Notice and hearing. No action of the Board shall be taken on any case
until after proper notice has been given and public hearing has been
held. Proper notice of a hearing before the Board shall be, besides
public notice, written notice mailed to the owner or his agent and, so far
as it is practicable, written notice to parties of interest. If a quorum is
present, the Zoning Board of Appeals may take action by a majority vote
of the members present.
E. Rehearing. An owner of property, or his or her authorized agent, shall
not file an appeal for zoning variance affecting the same parcel more
often than once every 12 months. An exception to this rule may be made
in those cases where the Board of Appeals determines that:
(1) Conditions affecting the property have changed substantially;
(2) The nature of the request has changed substantially from the date
of the previous petition; or
(3) If the City attorney by a written opinion states that in the attorney's
professional opinion, the decision made by the Zoning Board of
Appeals or the procedure used in the matter was clearly erroneous.
F. Stay. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the
§ 690-12 REEDSBURG CODE § 690-12
1:656
§ 690-13. Amendments and rezoning.
Zoning Board of Appeals that by reason of facts a stay would, in
the Zoning Administrator's opinion, cause imminent peril of life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than
by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals or by a court of record on application and on due cause shown.
A. The Common Council may from time to time on its own motion, or on
petition, or on recommendation of the Plan Commission, amend,
supplement, or repeal the regulations and provisions of this chapter
and change the boundaries of zoning districts. In the event that the
proposed rezoning is not at the request of the municipality, the
petitioner shall pay the fee per the current City Fee Schedule on file in
the City's offices or available on the City's website. [Amended at time
of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
B. Every such proposed amendment or change, whether initiated by the
Common Council or by petition, shall be referred to the Plan
Commission for report thereon before the public hearing hereinafter
provided for.
C. The Common Council, by resolution, adopted at a stated meeting shall
fix the time and place of a public hearing on the proposed amendments
and cause notice to be given as follows:

§ 690-15. Maps and boundaries.
The boundaries of these districts in the territorial limits and extraterritorial
limits of the City are hereby established as shown on a map entitled "City
of Reedsburg Official City and Extraterritorial Zoning Map." This map is on
file in the office of the Zoning Administrator and is hereby incorporated in
this chapter.
§ 690-16. Interpretation of district boundaries.
A. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
aforesaid districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules
shall apply:
(1) Where boundaries approximately follow street, alleys, or highways.
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
the center line or street line of streets, the center line or alley line
of alleys, or the center line of right-of-way line of highways, such
lines shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
(2) Where boundaries parallel street lines, alley lines or highway rightof-
way lines. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they
are approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of
streets, the center lines or alley lines of alleys, or the center lines of
§ 690-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 690-16
1:659
right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be
construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom
as indicated on the Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such
dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on
said Zoning Map.
(3) Where boundaries approximately follow lot lines. Where district
boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such
lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
(4) Where the boundary follows a railroad line. Where the boundary of
a district follows a railroad line, such boundary shall be deemed to
be located midway between the main tracks of said railroad line.
(5) Submerged areas not included in district. All areas within the
territorial and extraterritorial limits of the City which are
underwater and are not shown as included within any district shall
be subject to all of the regulations of the district which immediately
adjoins the water area. If the water area adjoins two or more
districts, the boundaries of each district shall be construed to
extend into the water area in a straight line until they meet the
other district.
(6) District regulations apply to schools, parks, etc. Any areas shown
on the Zoning Maps as park, playground, school, cemetery, water,
street, or right-of-way shall be subject to the zoning regulations of
the district in which they are located. In case of doubt, the zoning
regulations of the most restricted adjoining district shall govern.
(7) Where property has not been included in district. In every case
where property has not been specifically included within a district,
the same shall automatically be classed as lying and being in the R1
Residential District until such classifications shall have been
changed by an amendment to this chapter, as provided by law.
(8) Vacation of public ways. Whenever any street, alley, or other public
way is vacated in the manner authorized by the law, the zoning
district adjoining each side of such street, alley, or public way shall
be automatically extended to the center of such vacation, and all
area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject
to all regulations of the extended districts.
B. Zones. All zones established by this section are as shown on the

Conditional Uses
[Amended 2-23-2009]
§ 690-19. Review and approval. [Amended 2-26-2018 by Ord. No.
1861-18; at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provision,
Art. II)]
The Plan Commission shall review all proposed conditional uses. Upon
receipt of a conditional use permit application, and following publication
in the City of a Class 2 notice under Ch. 985, Wis. Stats., the City Plan
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application. In granting
a conditional use, the Plan Commission may prescribe conditions that it
deems to be necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this chapter. Such
conditions may include special landscaping, architectural design, type of
construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties,
lighting, fencing, planting screens, operational control, deed restrictions,
highway access restrictions, increased yards, parking requirements or any
condition related to the standards below. Preapplication conferences,
amendments, expiration dates, and reapplications of conditional use
permits shall follow the same standards as site plan reviews. The City Plan
Commission must demonstrate that its decision to approve or deny the
permit is supported by substantial evidence. Public testimony alone is not
substantial evidence and cannot be the sole basis for the commission to
deny a conditional use permit. "Substantial evidence" means evidence of
such convincing power that reasonable persons would accept it in support
of a conclusion. Substantial evidence does not include public comment that
is based solely on personal opinion, uncorroborated hearsay, or speculation.
Once granted, a conditional use permit shall remain in effect as long as the
conditions upon which the permit was issued are followed, but the City Plan
Commission may impose conditions, such as the permit's duration, transfer,
or renewal, in addition to any other conditions specified in this chapter. In
determining its findings, the Plan Commission shall take into account:
A. Proposed operation. No conditional use shall be approved by the Plan
Commission unless it finds that the use for which such permit is sought
will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to
the public welfare and will be in harmony with the general purpose of
this chapter and will not place demands on fire, police, or other public
resources in excess of current capacity.
B. Architectural plans; existing and proposed structures. The proposed
conditional land use shall be designed, constructed, operated, and
maintained so as not to diminish the opportunity for surrounding
properties to be used and developed as zoned.
C. Character and use of adjoining buildings and those in the vicinity. The
proposed conditional land use shall not involve uses, activities,
processes, materials, or equipment that would create a substantially

A. Purpose. The purpose of these planned unit development (PUD)
provisions is to permit and encourage design flexibility within certain
zoning districts of this chapter through use of the conditional use
permit procedures. The PUD technique as described in this chapter will
enable both developers and City officials to propose, review and agree
upon site plans which integrate uses such as housing, circulation
networks, nonresidential facilities and open space/recreational areas
which are compatible with the natural environment.
B. Preapplication conference. Prior to the submittal of a PUD application,
the applicant shall meet with the Zoning Administrator and provide the
Zoning Administrator with a concept plan for the proposed PUD.
§ 690-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 690-26
1:669
Examples of information to include on a concept plan are types and
placement of structures, utilities and public facilities, recreational
facilities, lot sizes, densities, landscaping and environmental treatment,
pedestrian and auto circulation, the compatibility of the proposed
development with surrounding uses, financing of the project, and such
other information needed to gain a satisfactory understanding of the
proposed development.
C. Preliminary plan.
(1) Following a preapplication conference, the applicant shall submit a
preliminary plan for the PUD to the Plan Commission. The
preliminary plan must contain that information that is required of a
site plan as set forth in the site plan review article of this chapter as
well as in accordance with the following provisions:
(a) A statement of the objectives of the planned unit development,
including physical, social and economic considerations.
(b) A schedule of development, including phasing of residential,
public, and open space/recreation areas.
(c) A tabulation of the land area percentages (by land use type) for
residential, public, utility and open space/recreation areas.
(d) Any additional information that has been gathered by the
developer that would be useful in giving the Plan Commission a
description of the proposed project.
(2) The Plan Commission shall review the preliminary plan and advise
the applicant of any changes that are required. A formal written
response shall be given to the applicant within 10 days on the
preliminary plan, including all recommendations and comments of
the Plan Commission.
D. Final plan. Once the applicant has been advised of the comments on the
preliminary plan, he or she must submit a final plan to the Plan
Commission within nine months. The final plan shall include all
modifications from the preliminary plan, any additional necessary or
pertinent legal documents, and detailed drawings or plans of elements
that were presented in the preliminary plan. During this time, the
applicant must also submit an application for a conditional use permit
following the procedures outlined in this article and for a zoning
amendment, if necessary, following the procedures outlined in Section
§ 690-13.
E. Modification to final plan. If it becomes necessary, due to unforeseen
circumstances, to modify the approved final plan, the applicant shall
submit, in writing, reasons for modification and the specifications of the
proposed changes to the Zoning Administrator. The Plan Commission
shall then review the proposed changes and shall approve the
modifications, propose alternative changes or disapprove (adhere to
§ 690-26 REEDSBURG CODE § 690-26
1:670
approved final plan); in the case of a use change requiring a zoning
permit, shall be forwarded to the Common Council. The Plan
Commission must ensure that the standards set forth in this article are
not violated by the proposed changes to the final development plan.
F. Application requirements. The application shall show the proposed use
or uses, dimensions and locations of proposed structures and of areas
to be reserved for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, parking, utilities and
public facilities, landscaping, open spaces, architectural drawings and
sketches, and such other information determined during the
preapplication conference and as may be requested by such City
agencies for a determination that it is desirable to deviate from certain
provisions of this chapter.
G. Standards.
(1) Minimum development size. The total area in any given PUD shall
be a minimum of five acres.
(2) Design. All PUDs shall be planned and developed as a single
project.
(3) Exclusions from gross area. Identifiable floodplains, wetlands,
bodies of water and areas with slopes averaging 20% or more shall
be specifically excluded from all building improvements and shall
not be considered in determining the developable area of the PUD.
(4) Uses. PUD uses shall be the same as those listed as permitted and
conditional in the B3 Zone.
(5) Spacing and orientation of building center. While the traditional
front, side and rear yard setback requirements are not necessarily
required for planned unit developments, the Plan Commission shall
establish minimum spacing distances between structures to assure
adequate light, air, privacy and fire protection for all residents. A
building group shall not be so arranged that any permanently or
temporarily occupied building is inaccessible to emergency
vehicles.
(6) Circulation. There shall be an adequate, safe and convenient
arrangement of pedestrian circulation facilities, roadways,
driveways, off-street parking and loading space. There shall be an
adequate amount, in a suitable location, of pedestrian walks, malls
and landscaped spaces to prevent pedestrian use of vehicular ways
and parking spaces and to separate pedestrian walks, malls and
public transportation loading places from general vehicular
circulation facilities. Buildings and vehicular circulation open
spaces shall be arranged so that pedestrians moving between
buildings are not unnecessarily exposed to vehicular traffic.
(7) Paving and drainage. There shall be adequate design of grades,
paving, gutters, drainage and treatment of turf to handle
§ 690-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 690-26
1:671
stormwaters and prevent erosion. Refer to Chapter 147,
Stormwater Utility.
(8) Signs and lighting. Signs and lighting devices shall be properly
arranged with respect to traffic control devices and adjacent
residential districts. Refer to Article XXI, Signs.
(9) Deed restrictions. The following deed restrictions shall be in place
prior to consideration for approval:
(a) Each dwelling unit shall be owner-occupied.
(b) All units must be new construction.
(10) Building heights. To ensure adequate light, ventilation, and open
space amenities in the PUD while allowing a variety of building
types and densities, building heights should be part of the review
process. However, to protect the character of the area, a maximum
building height of 35 feet shall be instituted.
(11) Building requirements:
(a) The minimum width shall be 14 feet.
(b) Each unit built to Uniform Dwelling Code (UDC) or
manufactured home (HUD) code shall be placed on one of the
following foundations:
[1] Floating slab (grade beam);
[2] Frost wall four feet minimum below grade; or
[3] Full basement.
(c) All running gear shall be removed from manufactured homes.
(12) A garage is required to be built prior to occupancy of the principal
residential structure. (Note the two-car off-street parking
requirement applies. If a one-car garage is built, a minimum space
of 10 feet by 20 feet must be provided for a second car.)
(13) Perimeter treatment. To provide adequate separation between the
PUD and incompatible surrounding land uses, a buffer zone may be
established on the perimeter of the development in which no
structures are to be located. The buffer zone shall be at least 20
feet deep and may extend up to 100 feet depending on the PUD's
compatibility with surrounding uses. Adequate screening and
landscaping or protection by natural features shall be included in
the buffer zone.
(14) Open space. "Open space," as defined by the Plan Commission for
the purposes of these PUD design requirements, refers to those
areas established specifically for common use by all residents or
homeowners of the planned unit development. In an effort to
§ 690-26 REEDSBURG CODE § 690-26
1:672
preserve and enhance open space and to provide adequate
recreational areas for residential developments, the designated
common open space shall comprise at least 20% of the total
developable area of the PUD to be used for recreational, park, or
environmental amenities for collective enjoyment by occupants of
the development but shall not include public or private streets,
driveways, or utility easements. Proposed open space shall connect
with existing open space as much as feasibly possible.
(15) Densities for residential development. Since the planned unit
development concept is designed to encourage flexible and
innovative building patterns, density requirements shall be based
on the number of dwelling units per acre rather than the traditional
minimum lot size requirements that would normally be applicable
to the zoning district in which the PUD is located. The density
requirements for residential uses in planned unit developments
shall be seven dwelling units per developable acre. Density
increases may be permitted by the Plan Commission for the
following reasons:
(a) The following formula shall be used in determining the
increase of total additional dwelling units to be allowed as an
incentive for designating additional open space within the
developable area of the PUD:
[1] For every unimproved acre of open space beyond the
minimum requirement, one additional dwelling unit per
three acres is allowed.
[2] For every improved acre of open space beyond the

specific easement, nor grant easements or rights-of-way, without
reasonable compensation therefor.

external design and land use as it affects property within and adjacent
to the industrial park. The Commission shall affix its mark of approval
or disapproval to the plan and return one set to the developer. Approval
by the Commission shall not relieve the developer of any responsibility
to adhere to other applicable regulations of the City or other
governmental agencies. Failure of the Commission to act upon such
building or improvement plans within 30 days after submission to the
City Clerk-Treasurer shall constitute the Commission's approval of such
plans.

buildings that its appearance shall constitute a depreciation to the
neighborhood.
D. The front of all buildings and the sides of those buildings facing side
streets on corner lots shall be faced with decorative masonry, stone, or
finished in a similar architecturally attractive manner approved by the

installed, or be permitted to remain in any zone created by § 690-86 of
this chapter until the owner or his agent shall have applied, in writing,
for a permit thereof and obtained such permit from the Zoning
Administrator. Said permit shall posted in a prominent place in the
premises prior to and during the period of construction, erection,
installation or establishment. Application for such permit shall indicate
the use for which the permit is desired and shall describe and locate the
use with sufficient particularity to permit the Zoning Administrator to
determine whether such use would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue the permit applied for. The City shall have the
right to trim, prune or remove at owner's expense any tree which was
planted after adoption of this chapter and found to be in violation of the
height restriction for the zone in which it is located. Permits shall not be

B. Existing uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced,
altered, or rebuilt, a permit shall be applied for and secured in the
manner prescribed by Subsection A authorizing such change,
replacement or repair. No such permit shall be denied if the structure
will not become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the
effective date of this chapter, or than it was when the application for
permit was made. This section shall not apply to any utility poles now
owned or hereafter constructed by the City of Reedsburg Utility as long
as those poles are replaced or repaired so as to be no higher than

ARTICLE XXII
Wellhead Protection
[Amended 1-24-2011]
§ 690-113. Purpose.
§ 690-114. Definitions.
As used herein, the following words and terms have the following meanings:
AQUIFER  A saturated, permeable geologic formation that contains and
will yield significant quantities of water.
EXISTING FACILITIES WHICH MAY CAUSE OR THREATEN TO CAUSE
ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION  Existing facilities which may cause or
threaten to cause environmental pollution within the limits of the City's
wellfields' recharge areas, which include but are not limited to those sites
set forth in the contaminant inventory detail which was developed in
conjunction with the preparation of the City's wellhead protection plan and
A. City residents depend exclusively on groundwater for a safe drinking
water supply. Certain land use practices and activities can seriously
threaten or degrade groundwater quality. The purpose of this chapter is
to institute land use regulations and restrictions to protect the City's
municipal water supply and to promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the City.
B. This article, which may be cited and referred to as the "City of
Reedsburg Wellhead Protection Ordinance," institutes land use
regulations and restrictions in the Groundwater Protection Overlay
District in order to protect the portion of the recharge area for the City
wells that lie within the City's limits. The recharge areas for the City
wells are those land areas which contribute water to the City wells by
infiltration of water into the subsurface and movement with
groundwater toward the wells.
C. It is further intended that the Groundwater Protection Overlay District
shall be operated in conjunction with the regulations governing the
underlying zoning districts and other overlay districts in the subject
area. Uses permitted by such other districts, but subject to the
provisions of this article, may not be undertaken unless they are also
permitted by the terms of this article. In the event of conflicting
standards between the underlying zoning and these groundwater
regulations, the more restrictive will apply. If conditional use permits
are required for both this overlay district and the underlying zoning
district for a proposed use, the processing of the two permits shall be
treated separately under the terms applicable to each district.
D. The boundaries of the Groundwater Protection Overlay District shall be
a 1,200-foot radius around all City wells and incorporated into and
shown on the City of Reedsburg Zoning Map.
§ 690-113 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 690-114
1:757
which is adopted by reference, and underground storage tanks which may
affect groundwater.
GROUNDWATER DIVIDE  A ridge in the water table, of the potentiometric
surface, from which groundwater flows away at right angles in both
directions. Line of highest hydraulic head in the water table or
potentiometric surface.
GROUNDWATER PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICTS  Those lands
shown on the City of Reedsburg Zoning Map.
POWTS  A private on-site wastewater treatment system as defined at Ch.
SPS 381, Wis. Adm. Code.
RECHARGE AREA  An area in which water reaches the zone of saturation
by surface infiltration and encompasses all areas or features that supply
groundwater recharge to a well.
TIME OF TRAVEL  The determined or estimated time required for a
contaminant to move in the saturated zone from a specific point to a well.
WELL FIELD  A piece of land used primarily for the purpose of supplying
a location for construction of wells to supply the municipal water system.
§ 690-115. Principal permitted uses.
Uses within the Groundwater Protection Overlay District must be permitted
uses in the underlying zoning district as well as in this overlay district. The
following are permitted uses within the Groundwater Protection Overlay
District, provided the separation distances set forth in § 690-118 are
maintained.
A. Parks, provided there is no on-site waste disposal or fuel storage tank
facilities associated with this use.
B. Playgrounds.
C. Wildlife areas.
D. Nonmotorized trails, such as bike, skiing, nature and fitness trails.

(2) Aboveground storage tanks larger than 20 gallons in size,
containing flammable and combustible liquid other than heating oil
or propane.
F. Agricultural uses in accordance with the county land conservation
department's best management practices guidelines.
§ 690-114 REEDSBURG CODE § 690-116
1:758
§ 690-116. Conditional uses.
Although these are conditional uses, the presumption is that these uses
are disfavored and that a conditional use permit will not be granted unless
conditions may be imposed that will ensure to a reasonable degree of
certainty to the City's satisfaction that the groundwater will be protected.
An application for a conditional use permit shall be processed in accordance
with Article VI of this chapter, as supplemented by the terms of this section,
and includes municipally sewered business development, zoned business or
industrial, except for the following uses:
§ 690-117. Prohibited uses.
All uses not expressly identified as "permitted" or "conditional" uses are
prohibited within the Groundwater Protection Overly District. No use
variances shall be granted.
§ 690-118. Separation distances from well.
Uses shall maintain the following minimum separation distances within the
Groundwater Protection Overlay District.
A. Aboveground storage tanks.
B. Asbestos product sales.
C. Automotive service and repair garages; body shops.
D. Blue printing and photocopying services.
E. Car washes.
F. Equipment repair services.

Adm. Code, and receive written approval from the Department of Safety
and Professional Services or its designated local program operator
under § ATCP 93.110, Wis. Adm. Code. These requirements apply to
tanks containing gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol, other alternative

exception use shall not endanger the public health, safety, or
general welfare, nor impair significant aesthetic, scientific,
educational, or agricultural values.
(3) That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the
conditional use will not substantially affect the existing use of
adjacent properties and will not have a substantial adverse effect
on the most suitable long-term future use for the area.
(4) That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, traffic plans, and
other site improvements are or will be provided.
(5) All outdoor lighting shall utilize fully shielded lighting fixtures to
minimize artificial sky glow and prevent light trespass or glare
beyond the property line.
(6) That the nonmetallic mining use shall conform to all government
regulations and standards pertaining to the activity, including air
and water quality standards and stormwater and wastewater
permit discharge requirements.
(7) That the noise, vibration, and dust levels be within the standards as
established by the state.
(8) That an undeveloped buffer zone adjacent to extraction operations,
commencing not less than 50 feet from a property line, or not less
than 600 feet from an established building, or such other distance
as the Plan Commission or RADC finds necessary for the protection
and safety of adjacent properties from mineral extraction sites,
with a stable angle of repose be provided along property lines.
(9) That the reclamation plan, which shall similarly be imposed as a
condition of approval, will be enforceable and, as enforced, will
result in the property being in a final condition which is reasonably
safe, attractive and, if possible, conducive to productive new uses
for the site.
(10) Stormwater runoff leaving the site will be controlled to limit
sediment delivery to surface waters. Appropriate stormwater
discharge or construction site erosion plans may be required.
(11) Nonmetallic mining operations and reclamation shall be conducted
in a manner that does not cause a permanent lowering of the
groundwater table that results in adverse effects on surface waters
or a significant reduction in the quantity of groundwater available
