PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fitchburg, Wisconsin. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2009 Compiled Ordinances, current through December 9, 2009, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2009 Compiled Ordinances and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been arranged in a convenient order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Shelly Hayes and Ellen Torof, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Linda Cory, City Clerk; Mark Sewell, City Attorney, and Susan Sloper, Community Planner, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

To ensure that persons will not be unduly economically burdened or forced to move from their homes by reason of a decision of the city authorities ordering construction of public improvements at the cost of the property benefitted, the city treasurer is hereby directed and authorized to pay or defer any special assessment legally charged against the real estate of any individual for whom the immediate payment of the assessment would be a severe financial hardship as determined under subsection (c) of this section.

(b)  Making a request. A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the authority or custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested.

A request may be made orally or in writing. 
(c)  Filling a request. Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the person making the request of the custodian's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the custodian determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his/her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(d)  Denial of a request. If a request is made orally, the custodian may deny it orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons for denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, a written statement of the reasons for denying the request shall be given to the requester. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that where a request is made in writing, the denial is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1). 
(e)  Restrictions on inspection. The authority or custodian may require supervision during inspection or may impose other reasonable restrictions on the manner of access to an original record if the record is irreplaceable or easily damaged.

(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.08) 
State Law reference Similar definitions, Wis. Stats. § 19.42.  
Sec. 14-2. - Enforcement. 
Any person having concerns or complaints related to this ethics chapter can bring them to the common council for remedy. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.07)  
Sec. 14-3. - Policy. 
(a)  It is declared that high ethical standards among city public officials and city employees are essential to the conduct of free government. The common council believes that a code of ethics for the guidance of city public officials and city employees will help them avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their public responsibilities, will improve standards of public service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of this city in their city public officials and city employees. 
(b)  In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a code of ethics for all city officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards, committees and commissions. The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city. The provisions and purposes of this chapter and such rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best interest of the city. 
(c)  It is the intent of the common council that the rights of individuals affected shall be protected to the fullest extent possible. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.01)  
Sec. 14-4. - Responsibility of public office. 
Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the state and federal constitutions and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state, and municipality and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.02)  
Sec. 14-5. - Standards of conduct. 
(a)  This chapter does not prevent any city public official from accepting other employment or following any pursuit which in no way interferes with the faithful discharge of his/her duties to the city. The common council recognizes that: 
(1)  In a representative democracy, the representatives are drawn from society, and therefore, cannot and should not be without personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government; 
(2)  Citizens who serve as city public officials retain their rights as citizens to interests of a personal or economic nature; that standards of ethical conduct for city public officials need to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are substantial and material; and 
(3)  City public officials need to engage in employment, professional, personal or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves or their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, or may need to maintain investments, which activities or investments do not conflict with specific provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Appointed officials and employees should adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority. Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited from doing so by law or by officially recognized confidentiality of their work. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.03)  
Sec. 14-6. - Fair and equal treatment; use of public property. 
(a)  Interest in appointments. Canvassing the members of the common council in order to obtain preferential consideration in connection with any appointment to the municipal civil service shall disqualify the candidate for appointment. 
(b)  Use of public property. No official or employee shall request or permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally and except where otherwise authorized by action of the common council. 
(c)  Obligations to citizens. No official or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.04)  
Secs. 14-714-30. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE II. - CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
 
Sec. 14-31. - Incompatible activities generally. 
No official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties in the public interest. Personal as distinguished from financial interests include an interest arising from blood or marriage relationships or close business or political association. Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated in this article for the guidance of officials and employees. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.05(1))  
Sec. 14-32. - Incompatible employment. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no official or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render service for private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties or would tend to impair independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties. 
(b)  The city attorney, municipal court judge, or any other legally qualified city official or employee may engage in the private or public practice of law during the period in which they hold their respective offices. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.05(1)(A))  
Sec. 14-33. - Disclosure of confidential information. 
No official or employee shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, government, or affairs of the city, nor shall such information be used to advance the financial or other private interest of the official, employee or others. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.05(1)(B))  
Sec. 14-34. - Gifts and favors. 
(a)  No official or employee shall accept any gift, whether in the form of service, loan, thing, or promise, from any person which to his/her knowledge is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the city. 
(b)  No city public official or employee may use a public position or office to obtain financial gain or anything of substantial value for the private benefit of himself/herself or his/her immediate family or for an organization with which he/she has a financial interest. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.05(1)(C))  
Sec. 14-35. - Representing private interests before city bodies. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no official or employee whose salary is paid in whole or in part by the city shall appear on behalf of private interests before any agency, board, authority, commission, or other official body of the city. He/she shall not represent private interests in any action or proceeding against the interest of the city in any litigation to which the city is a party. 
(b)  This section shall not be construed as prohibiting the appearance of officials or employees when subpoenaed as witnesses by parties involved in litigation which also may involve the city. 
(c)  An alderperson may appear before city agencies on behalf of constituents in the course of his/her duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations. However, no alderperson or other official or employee shall accept a retainer or compensation that is contingent upon a specific action or decision by a city agent. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.05(1)(D))  
Sec. 14-36. - Contracts with the city. 
(a)  No city public official or employee, member of his/her immediate family, nor any organization with which the city public official and employee or a member of his/her immediate family owns or controls at least ten percent of the outstanding equity, voting rights, or outstanding indebtedness may enter into any contract or lease involving a payment or payments of more than $3,000.00 within a 12-month period, in whole or in part derived from city funds unless the city public official or employee has first made written disclosure of the nature and extent of such relationship or interest to the board of ethics and to the department acting for the city in regard to such contract or lease. Said public official or employee shall refrain from voting upon or otherwise participating in the transaction or the making of such contract or sale. 
(b)  Any contract or lease entered into in violation of this section may be voided by the city in an action commenced within three years of the date on which the board of ethics, or the department or officer acting for the city in regard to the allocation of city funds from which such payment is derived, knew or should have known that a violation of this subsection had occurred. 
(c)  This section does not affect the application of section Wis. Stats. § 946.13. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 23.05(1)(E)) 
State Law reference Private interest in public contract prohibited, Wis. Stats. § 946.13.  
Sec. 14-37. - Disclosure of interest in legislation. 
(a)  An alderperson who has a financial or other private interest in any legislation shall disclose on the record to the common council or the board of ethics the nature and extent of such interest. This provision shall not apply if the alderperson disqualifies himself/herself from voting. 
(b)  An alderperson shall disqualify himself/herself from voting if the matter under consideration involves his/her personal or financial interest to the extent that such interest may conflict with his/her official duties or would impair independence of judgment. 
(c)  Any other public official or employee who has a financial or other private interest in legislation, and who participates in discussion with or gives an official opinion to the council, shall disclose on the records of the common council and the board of ethics the nature and extent of such interest.

(b)  The court shall inform the defendant that he/she may plead guilty, not guilty or no contest or may request a continuance; of the effect of a plea of no contest; and of the right to a jury trial. 
(c)  The defendant shall plead to the charges and the municipal judge shall enter the plea in the court docket. If the defendant refuses to plead, the municipal judge shall enter a plea of not guilty. 
(d)  If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court shall convict the defendant of the offense charged and render judgment. 
(e)  If the defendant charged with violation of Wis. Stats. § 346.63(1) or (5) pleads not guilty and within ten days after entry of the plea requests a jury trial and pays the required fees, the municipal judge shall promptly transmit all papers and fees in the cause to the clerk of circuit court for a jury trial under Wis. Stats. § 345.43. The plea of not guilty and request for jury trial may be made by mail. In cases not governed by Wis. Stats. §§ 345.20 to 345.53, the amount of deposit set out in the citation shall accompany the mailed request. Upon receipt of the request, the circuit court will set a time for trial. Any deposit made personally or by mail is forfeited upon nonappearance at the time set for trial. The required fee for a jury is as set forth in Wis. Stats. § 814.61(4).

If trial is not held immediately, the municipal judge shall then set a date for trial or advise the defendant that he/she will later be notified of the date set for trial. 
(g)  If the court accepts a plea of no contest or judgment is entered against a defendant by default, the defendant may move within six months after the date set for the appearance to withdraw the plea of no contest, reopen the judgment and enter a plea of not guilty upon a showing to the satisfaction of the court that the failure to appear was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect. If on reopening the defendant is found not guilty, the court shall in traffic cases under Wis. Stats. §§ 345.20 to 345.53 immediately notify the department of transportation to delete the record of conviction based on the original proceeding and shall order the defendant's deposit returned.

Stats. § 345.26(2)(a) or under Wis. Stats. § 23.66. For other violations, the municipal judge shall establish a forfeiture/bond/ deposit as bail in an amount not to exceed the maximum penalty for the offense, including any penalty assessment which would be applicable under Wis. Stats. § 757.05 or on failure of the defendant to make a forfeiture/bond/deposit as bail under this section, he/she shall be committed to jail pending trial while the default continues.

Stats. § 757.05 plus costs, not exceeding the amount of the deposit. The court may either accept the plea of no contest and enter judgment accordingly, or reject the plea and issue a summons. If the defendant fails to appear in response to the summons, the court shall issue a warrant under Wis. Stats. § 968.09. If the defendant has made a deposit but does appear, the court shall allow the defendant to withdraw the plea of no contest.

(1)  If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court shall convict the defendant of the offense charged and render judgment. 
(2)  If the person arrested and released fails to appear personally or by an attorney at the time fixed for hearing of the case, the defendant may be deemed to have entered a plea of no contest and the money deposited, if any, or such portion thereof as the court determines to be an adequate penalty, plus the penalty assessment and costs, may be declared forfeited by the court or may be ordered applied upon the payment of any penalty which may be imposed, together with the penalty assessment and costs. In either event, any remaining money shall be refunded to the person who made the deposit.

Sec. 22-357. - Design review. 
Uses identified as conditional uses in the B-P, B-H and RD districts receive normal design review as do permitted uses in these districts. Conditional uses receive additional review on the question of whether the use proposed is appropriate to the site, at the time that it is proposed for development and in the manner proposed. In conducting this review, the plan commission shall give specific attention to the scale of proposed operations in relation to the scale of prevailing or expected nearby uses, the likelihood of problems arising through hours of operation, peaking of usages, stability of the operation, service demands upon the city, impacts on the neighborhood, roads or service systems. Approvals may be conditioned, as necessary, to ensure that the public interest will be served.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 22-592. - PD Planned Development District. 
(a)  The PD Planned Development District, pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(b), provides a regulatory framework to encourage improved environmental design by allowing flexibility in the development of land while ensuring compliance with the basic intent of the zoning ordinance and with the city comprehensive plan. The planned development district has no set standards and specifications. Developers can propose uses or combination of uses and configurations of intensity and density of development. Through a process of plan commission review, public hearing and common council review and approval, accompanied by discussions with developers and, as appropriate, with other interested parties, individualized zoning standards shall be created. These standards have the same legal force and effect as do standard zoning requirements. 
(b)  To achieve the community benefits of the PD zoning district, the project size shall be large enough to allow clustering and to establish a coherence of design. The land area shall be at least 100,000 square feet. 
(c)  The objective of the planned development district is not simply to allow exceptions to otherwise applicable regulations. It is instead to encourage a higher level of design and amenity than is possible to achieve under other zoning districts. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.82, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-593. - Procedure for general implementation plan (GIP). 
The procedure for rezoning to a planned development district shall be as required for any other zoning district change under this chapter, except that, in addition thereto, the following information describing a general implementation plan shall be filed by the applicant with the plan commission staff: 
(1)  A map of the project area including its relationship to surrounding properties and topography and other key features, such as, but not limited to, woodlots, heritage or specimen trees, streams, wetlands, floodplains, environmental corridors, rock outcroppings, and existing buildings or improvements. Specific wetland, woods or tree inventories, impact analysis, or other studies relative to key features may be required by planning staff or the plan commission. 
(2)  A statement of rationale as to why the planned development district zoning is proposed. The proposal shall detail in text, graphic, and statistical forms the lack of other available chapter 22 zoning districts to provide the development intended. The statement shall identify barriers that the developer perceives in other chapter 22 zoning districts and opportunities for community betterment the developer suggests are available through the proposed planned development district zoning. 
(3)  An analysis of social and economic impacts on the community of the project. 
(4)  An analysis of how the proposal is consistent with, and will advance the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan. 
(5)  A detailed analysis discussing the intended specific environmental design, the amenities to be gained by the planned development district zoning proposal, and, specifically, a statement as to why such benefits and amenities would not be realized under any other chapter 22 zoning district. 
(6)  A general development plan of the proposed project showing at least the following information in sufficient detail to make possible evaluation against criteria for approval: 
a.  Public and private roads, driveways and parking facilities; bicycle and pedestrian facilities, bus shelters, and any other multi-modal forms of transportation and their related facilities. 
b.  Land uses and size, arrangement and location of lots and proposed buildings or groups of buildings. 
c.  The types, size, intended uses, and location of structures. 
d.  A general utility plan, preliminary grading plan. 
e.  The location of recreational and open space areas and facilities and specifically describing those that are to be reserved or dedicated for public acquisition and use. 
f.  General landscape treatment plan. 
g.  Statistical data on size of the development, density/intensity of various parts of the development, ratio of various land uses, economic analysis of the development, expected staging, and any other plans or data required by the plan commission or common council. 
(7)  General outline of the intended organizational structure for a property owners association, if any; proposed condominium documents, if any; deed restrictions and all agreements necessary to accommodate private provision of common services, if any. 
(8)  For any project plan proposed, a schedule for completion of the public and private improvements proposed within the project plan. 
(9)  Neighborhood input. 
a.  Prior to the formal petition for rezoning, the applicant shall make a reasonable effort to meet with property owners and individuals within and near the area of the proposal. Property owners and residents within the project area and those within 300 feet of the project boundary shall be noticed at least ten days prior to a meeting in which the conceptual project will be presented. The meeting shall be fashioned to solicit input on the proposed design. More than one neighborhood meeting may be necessary to gather input, address comments received, and provide information relative to any intended application. 
b.  A statement describing the reasonable efforts made to meet with and receive input from individuals required to receive notice shall be submitted with the rezoning petition application when it is filed for review at the planning department. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.83, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-594. - Plan commission review. 
(a)  Following determination by the plan commission staff that an application is complete, the matter shall be reviewed by city staff and shall then be placed on a plan commission agenda for initial review, prior to the filing of a formal application. Initial review is a review of the project at the concept level and is not binding. The preferred procedure is for an iteration of the plan commission's initial review to occur prior to introduction of a formal petition for rezoning. The purpose of this meeting, or meetings, is to allow a discussion of the plan commission regarding the possible planned development zoning application, need for planned development district zoning, and the environmental, economic, environmental, social and other benefits of design to be obtained from the proposal, general statistics on the possible project and why not other existing zoning district will suffice. The plan commission may recommend that the project not be pursued under planned development zoning. After this meeting, or meetings, with the plan commission, the applicant may then submit a formal application for planned development district general implementation plan zoning. Whenever the required petition is introduced, the normal rezoning procedure occurs, including notice and hearing before the plan commission. The issues that are the subject of this public hearing are the rezoning request and the general implementation plan. 
(b)  Following the required public hearing before the plan commission, the plan commission shall meet to make a determination and recommendation whether to advise the common council to approve the rezoning and the general implementation plan, to approve it with modifications, or to deny it. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.84, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-595. - Criteria for approval. 
As a basis for determining the acceptability of a planned development district, the following criteria shall be applied to the general implementation plan with specific consideration as to whether or not it is consistent with the general purpose and intent of the city zoning ordinance, the city comprehensive plan, the city comprehensive park open space and recreation plan, whether it has been prepared with competent professional expertise and guidance, that it produces significant community benefits of an environmental design nature or otherwise that compensate for modifications in standards of municipal zoning. 
(1)  Character and intensity of land use. The uses proposed and their intensity and arrangement on the site shall: 
a.  Respect the physical attributes of the site with particular concern for preservation of natural features, tree growth and open space. The project shall be accomplished in such a manner as to minimize grading of the existing terrain, by working with topographic conditions. Grading and improvements on slopes of 12 percent or greater shall be limited. 
b.  Produce an attractive environment of sustained aesthetic and ecological desirability, economic stability and functional practicality compatible with the development prospects for the area. 
c.  Not adversely affect the anticipated provision of school or municipal services. 
d.  Not create traffic or parking demand incompatible with the existing or proposed facilities to serve it. 
e.  Produce a transportation network that emphasizes connectivity and reduction of motor vehicle trips. 
f.  Provide a block structure appropriate to pedestrian activity. 
g.  Ensure environmental features are protected to a greater degree than that which would otherwise be required, or occur. 
h.  Provide an environmental design, including amenities, of buildings and site improvements that are greater than that which would otherwise occur or be required. 
i.  Provide a greater level of economic, social and other benefits than would otherwise be realized. 
(2)  Economic feasibility and impact. The proponents of a planned development district shall provide evidence satisfactory to the plan commission and the common council that the project will not adversely affect the economic prosperity of the city or the values of surrounding properties. 
(3)  Engineering design standards. Streets and other ways, outdoor lighting, provision for stormwater drainage, sanitary sewer service, water supply, or other similar environmental and municipal engineering considerations of current ordinance requirements shall, at a minimum be met, but to advance environmental design will likely need to be exceeded. The plan commission and common council may require the use of higher levels of transportation and lighting improvements, stormwater management, or water conservation techniques than is required by current ordinance or other governmental guidelines. Such standards shall be appropriate to advancing environmental design objectives and the public health, safety and welfare as determined by the city. 
(4)  Preservation and maintenance of open space in a planned development district. Provision shall be made for the preservation and maintenance of open spaces either by public reservation or dedication to public entities or commitment to preservation by a private entity. PD contracts shall contain specific reference to the ownership of such open space areas and to the provision for maintenance. 
(5)  Transmittal of plan commission recommendations, report and related matters. The plan commission's reports and recommendations shall be made in a written report to the common council. A complete set of maps, plans and written documentation fully describing the proposed development as recommended by the plan commission at a general implementation plan level shall accompany the report of the plan commission. The matter shall not be considered by the council unless this documentation has a signature by the plan commission secretary over a statement that the documentation is complete and that it accurately reflects plan commission recommendations. In a situation in which the applicant disagrees with certain recommendations of the plan commission and is urging the common council to approve with modifications, the applicant shall supply documentation of those modifications to the council prior to the matter being placed on the agenda of the common council. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.85, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-596. - Owner's consent following common council approval. 
After the planned development district general implementation plan (PD-GIP) ordinance is adopted by the common council, to take effect, the owners of record and mortgage holders of all included parcels shall consent in writing and provide an original signed and notarized document to the city clerk and a signed copy to the zoning administrator within 30 days of the date of common council adoption in order for the PD-GIP rezoning ordinance. Consent shall be binding upon future owners of the parcels in question. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.86, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-597. - Effect of PD-GIP zoning. 
The approval of a general implementation plan shall not authorize issuance of building permits. The permits shall not be issued until approval by the city of the specific implementation plan. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.87, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-598. - Filing; effective date. 
When the consent signatures for lands in the parcel being rezoned are all acquired and delivered to the city clerk and zoning administrator within the 30 days as required by section 22-596, the documentation on plan commission and common council action and on the general implementation plan and the consent signatures shall be logged in and filed by the city, and the property shall be indicated as rezoned on city zoning maps. The date this occurs is the effective date of the rezoning. The map indication shall be PD-GIP. The city clerk shall record at the Dane County register of deeds office an affidavit of notice of PD zoning against all real property included in the district. This shall be done as near the effective date of the PD-GIP rezoning as is possible. The city shall require the applicant to supply necessary property descriptions, parcel numbers and to pay recording and publication fees. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.88, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-599. - Specific implementation plan (SIP). 
After the common council approval and recording of the PD-GIP ordinance, the applicant may file a specific implementation plan for review and recommendation by the plan commission and approval by the common council. For applications submitted prior to October 12, 2010, a SIP shall be filed (for all or part of the project) within one year of the date of council approval of the PD-GIP. For PD-GIP applications submitted after October 12, 2010, the specific implementation plan (for the entire PD-GIP) shall be filed within three years of the date of council approval of the PD-GIP. 
(1)  The specific implementation plan shall be a precise plan for development, containing graphic and tabular presentations at a level of detail equivalent to the level of detail of a final plat, and for multi-family and commercial buildings, include scaled drawings of building dimensions, building and site improvement placement. Accompanying text information shall describe in detail the development plans, methodologies and timetables, building and site uses for the area covered by the specific implementation plan. 
(2)  For PD-GIP ordinances approved or submitted prior to October 12, 2010, the area included in a specific implementation plan may be only a portion of the area included in a previously approved general implementation plan. For specific implementation plans for PD-GIP applications submitted after October 12, 2010, the following shall apply: 
a.  The specific implementation plan shall cover all land in the approved general implementation plan as one submittal. 
b.  The PD-SIP for the entire PD-GIP shall be submitted within three years of the common council approval of the PD-GIP ordinance. If not submitted within three years, the PD-GIP approval lapses and a new PD-GIP approval pursuant to sections 22-593 through 22-596, or a different zoning approval is required. After three years, no PD-SIP shall be approved unless the GIP has been reapproved. 
c.  A public hearing as if it were a matter of rezoning, shall be held on any specific implementation plan (PD-SIP) application or amendment (substantial alteration) to a PD-SIP. 
(3)  The specific implementation plan submission may include specific site plan and design information, allowing the plan commission to combine design review and review of the specific implementation plan. Design review may, at the choice of the applicant, be deferred until a later time when specific site and building developments will be brought forth. 
(4)  As part of submission for specific implementation plan approval, the applicant shall submit proof of financing capability pertaining to construction and maintenance and operation of public works and public improvement elements of the proposed development. 
(5)  A copy of the recorded general implementation plan and all approved and relevant documents shall be submitted with the specific implementation plan request. 
(6)  The plan commission or common council may specify other plans, documents or schedules that must be submitted prior to consideration or approval of the specific implementation plan, as such may be relevant to review procedures and standards. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.89, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2012-O-03, 4-24-2012)  
Sec. 22-600. - Plan commission review. 
(a)  When the specific implementation plan submission is deemed by plan commission staff to be complete, the matter shall be reviewed by staff and then placed upon an agenda of the plan commission for review, consideration and approval, modification or rejection. 
(b)  The specific implementation plan submission shall be reviewed by the plan commission against the current standards of this chapter, the comprehensive plan and the previously approved general implementation plan. Without limiting the plan commission's ability to deny a specific implementation plan, in order to approve a specific implementation plan, the plan commission must determine that the specific implementation plan is consistent with the general implementation plan as well as the current standards of this chapter and the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  If the plan commission recommends approval of a specific implementation plan, complete documentation describing this specific implementation plan, and any contracts that the plan commission deems necessary for the implementation of the plan, shall be prepared, reviewed by zoning administrator as complete and, when found to be complete by said zoning administrator, shall be placed on the agenda of the common council. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.90, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2012-O-03, 4-24-2012)  
Sec. 22-601. - Common council review. 
The common council shall consider and act on the specific implementation plan after reviewing the recommendations of the plan commission on same. The specific implementation plan submission shall be reviewed by the common council against the current standards of this chapter, the current comprehensive plan, and the previously approved general implementation plan. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.91, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-602. - Filing and effective date. 
Sections 22-596 through 22-598 apply to the processing, consent signatures and recording of a specific implementation plan following approval by the common council. Signatures are required by property owners and mortgage holders only in the area affected by the specific implementation plan. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.92, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-603. - Effect of SIP approval; alterations. 
The filing of an approved specific implementation plan (SIP) shall only authorize release of building and other land use permits necessary to carry out development activities consistent with that approved plan, when all conditions or requirements of the SIP and other ordinances have been met. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide proof of satisfaction of all conditions and requirements. 
(1)  If a proposed amendment to the PD-SIP is inconsistent with or alters an approved general implementation plan, the PD-SIP shall not be approved unless the PD-GIP is amended in accordance with the procedures pursuant to sections 22-593 through 22-596. 
(2)  Any subsequent change of use of any parcel or any modification of the specific implementation plan shall first be submitted for approval to the plan commission and if, in the opinion of the plan commission, such change or modification constitutes a substantial alteration of the specific implementation plan, the specific implementation plan shall be required to be amended through the same procedures used to approve, file and record the specific implementation plan. If, in the opinion of the plan commission, such changes or modification do not constitute a substantial alteration of the specific implementation plan, the change may be accomplished by approval of the plan commission. Such approved modifications shall be documented and recorded in the official file of the city on the PD district. 
(3)  For specific implementation plan zoning approved prior to October 12, 2010, a specific implementation plan approval lapses one year after its date of adoption by the common council if substantial development progress has not occurred. 
(4)  For general implementation plans approved after October 12, 2010 (including the specific implementation plan approved under that GIP), all public improvements shall be required to be installed within 12 months of the date of common council approval unless a staging plan has been approved per chapter 24 (land division). 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.93, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-604. - Design review; objectives. 
Design review is implemented under municipal authority to promote the public health, safety and welfare and under municipal zoning authority. Requirements for design review and approval apply to uses and developments regardless of the characterization of the use or development within this chapter as a permitted use or conditional use. Projects submitted under the SmartCode District shall not be subject to design review under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.98, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-605. - Developments requiring design review. 
(a)  Site and structural development of residential projects having three or more dwelling units. 
(b)  Site and structural development in business districts. 
(c)  Site and structural development in industrial districts. 
(d)  Site and structural development in planned development districts. 
(e)  Utility and governmental facilities. 
(f)  Those variance cases deemed by the zoning board of appeals to justify design review. Design review shall be advisory to the zoning board of appeals. 
(g)  Any parking area, even if not accompanying an otherwise included development, if it has five or more parking spaces. 
(h)  In addition, design review districts may be designated by ordinance adopted by the common council. Once adopted, design review standards shall apply to such districts within the terms of such designated ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.99, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-606. - Administration of design review. 
(a)  The zoning administrator shall advise applicants when they apply for zoning permits or other approvals whether design review applies. If design review applies, the applicant will be given checklists, application forms and timetables. These documents shall have prior plan commission approval as to format and content. Applicants may request and have pre-application conferences with staff. 
(b)  Completed applications and supporting materials must be reviewed by staff prior to placement on the plan commission agenda. Staff must be satisfied that a complete packet of information will be available to the plan commission prior to the commencement of the plan commission meeting at which the item is set for decision review. 
(c)  The plan commission will review applications set for design review. Following such review, discussions with applicants and agents, and discussion within the plan commission and with staff, the commission shall render a decision of approval, conditional approval or rejection. Decisions shall be in writing and shall identify those elements of the approved design which the commission intends to be mandatory. The zoning administrator shall have applicants sign acknowledgments of receipts of written plan commission design review decisions prior to issuance of a zoning/building permit. 
(d)  A project that has had design review and that has a zoning/building permit is approved for execution only in accord with the directives included in the design review approval. Construction or execution that deviates from directives may not occur within terms of this chapter without prior city approval. The zoning administrator is responsible for determining whether to give staff approval to such deviations on a finding that they are minor variations as to the plan commission's decision or whether full plan commission review and approval is needed upon a finding that the deviations are major. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.100, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-607. - Design review standards. 
(a)  Jurisdiction. Design review applies to exterior structural and design features, landscaping and site planning. 
(b)  Directives. The following specific design standards are established and are intended to be applied in the informed judgment of the plan commission: 
(1)  The land forms and landscape will be preserved in their natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing soil and tree removal that is not essential to project development and by retaining grades and contours in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas. 
(2)  Building masses and long, straight building fronts and sides (relative to the overall length of the building) that are visually accessible shall be broken up and made more variegated with staggers and offsets, with landscaping or surficial features or with accumulation of mass in the form of smaller, related units. This is a directive standard as to residential and commercial structures and those industrial structures that are visually accessible to larger volumes of traffic and a recommendatory standard to industrial buildings within the center core of industrial districts. 
(3)  Within residential properties, parking areas that are located in front or street-side yards must have landscape screening and/or screening by fencing having decorative character to soften views of parked vehicles. All design reviewed parking lots shall have decorative landscape treatment at the perimeter of the lot and, for larger lots, in island areas within the lot, to provide break-up of the expanse of paving. (See section 22-609.) 
(4)  Mechanical equipment (heating, air conditioning and ventilation) that will be readily visible when viewed from ground level from other properties or from major public ways should be softened by screening or covered in a manner that forms an integral part of the building design. 
(5)  External garbage or refuse containers shall be screened by walls, fences, berms or effective landscaping, or combinations thereof. 
(6)  Landscaping. Each project subject to design review must provide landscaping of sufficient height and density to accomplish positive visual impact within three years from the time of planting. 
(7)  All developments and occupancies subject to design review shall be planned and constructed so that surface drainage drains from structures. Impervious surface ratios shall be limited to no more than 65 percent, except where a different level has been set forth through an approved plan, land division approval, other zoning standard, or other zoning approval. The commission, in its judgment, may allow a higher ratio provided it is not contrary to an existing approval, and on-site infiltration, pervious pavement or other measures to mitigate the higher ratio are provided and maintained. 
(8)  The following principles of landscape design are stated as guides to be applied with discretion by the plan commission taking into account how visible the site is to public view, sensitivity of neighboring properties and the cost considerations: 
a.  Overhead canopy trees contribute to a pattern within the neighborhood and streetscape focus plantings (trees or shrubs) accomplish screening of less attractive elements, afford privacy, noise control and windbreak, soften transitions from vertical to horizontal features and create visual focal points. 
b.  Ground plane plantings (lawns, ground cover, etc.) provide lower level continuity, and retard soil erosion. 
c.  Terraces, trellises, walks, drives, garden walls and berms and related elements increase variety. 
d.  Plan commission preferences on species shall be made available in writing to project applicants. 
(9)  The plan commission shall, in the exercise of its judgment, prohibit or regulate outdoor storage, product display or sale of items where a plan or design goal, objective, directive or suggestion exists, or where the advancement of the public interest, welfare or safety is involved. Any outdoor storage area, display or sale area shall be clearly identified on submitted site plan. At a minimum, storage of materials, fuel, scrap, inoperative vehicles and similar objects in places that are readily visible from major public rights-of-way or parts of neighboring properties where a significant amount of viewing is expected shall be minimized and, where necessary, shall be effectively screened. Where other portions of this chapter establish more stringent standards, the other portions shall govern. 
(10)  Exterior lighting, when used, shall be established, directed and maintained so as not to be cast directly on public rights-of-way or occupied structures or neighboring properties or be lighted in intensity or colors seriously disturbing to neighboring properties. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.101, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-608. - Recommendations. 
Other features of site design and construction, building and structural design and construction and landscaping that are not listed under directives may also be addressed by plan commission advisory suggestions within the design review process upon a finding that the suggestion would be desirable to make the development a positive asset to the visual appearance of the community and positive contribution to the growth and stability of the community tax base. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.102, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-609. - Off-street parking and loading. 
(a)  Purpose. This section provides for the regulation of accessory off-street parking and loading facilities. Projects submitted under the SmartCode District shall be subject only to parking and loading regulations under chapter 23. For all other districts, these regulations are intended to: 
(1)  Increase the safety and capacity of public streets by requiring off-street loading facilities to be provided. 
(2)  Minimize adverse effects of off-street parking and loading facilities on adjoining properties. 
(3)  Lessen congestion and prevent the overtaxing of public streets by regulating the location and capacity of accessory off-street parking or off-street loading facilities. 
(b)  General regulations. 
(1)  Application to changing circumstances. 
a.  When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. 
b.  When the existing use of a building or structure is changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. 
c.  Accessory off-street parking or loading facilities in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and located on the same lot as the building or uses served shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this article. 
(2)  Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of accessory off-street parking or loading facilities to serve an existing use of land or buildings, provided that there is adherence to all regulations herein governing the location, capacity, design and operation of such facility. 
(3)  Control of off-street parking facilities. In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. Such possession shall be by deed whereby the owner of land on which the parking facilities are to be located shall be bound by a covenant filed and recorded in the county register of deeds office, requiring such owner, his/her heirs or assigns to maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served. 
(4)  Specifications of off-street parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities shall be provided in accordance with the regulations set forth herein as well as subsection (3) of this section. 
a.  Utilization. In the residence district, accessory off-street parking facilities provided for uses listed herein shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of occupants or guests and not more than one truck limited to four tons gross vehicle weight. 
b.  Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by the city results in a requirements of a fractional space, any fraction may be disregarded.

Sec. 22-611. - RC Rural Cluster District. 
(a)  The Rural Cluster (RCD) District provides a regulatory framework, as identified in Sections 22-61222-623 herein, to provide limited development by using the potential splits of one per 35 acres (see the city's Rural Residential Development Criteria , Appendix B - City of Fitchburg Comprehensive Plan ) on property outside of the urban service area and future urban development boundary, while complying with the comprehensive plan as well as maintaining compatibility with the surrounding agricultural uses. Such clustered development is intended to better harmonize rural development with surrounding agricultural activities recognizing that it is the city's primary goal to preserve and enhance farming and farmland in rural Fitchburg. This option is intended to conserve agricultural, forested and open space land, historic and natural features. Such clustered development is intended to permit the compact grouping of homes located to blend with the existing landscape and other natural features and to preserve the visual character of the landscape. 
(b)  RCD has no set standards or specifications, other than what is set forth in this section. Developers are encouraged to propose uses that preserve, complement and enhance natural features such as but not limited to topography, woodlands, wetlands, and streams. The common council shall approve the standards and specifications which shall constitute the zoning and architectural controls of the property. 
(Ord. No. 2012-O-18, § 1, 12-11-2012)  
Sec. 22-612. - RC Rural Cluster DistrictProcedures for general implementation plan (GIP). 
In addition to the procedure required for all zoning changes, the following information describing a general implementation plan shall be filed by the applicant with plan commission staff: 
(1)  A survey of the project area including its relationship to surrounding properties and uses, with topographic, soil type and other key features, such as, but not limited to, woodlots, heritage or specimen trees, streams, all drainage channels, waterways, wetlands, floodplains, environmental corridors, rock outcroppings, and existing buildings or improvements. Specific wetland, woods or tree inventories, impact analysis, or other studies relative to key features may be required by planning staff or the plan commission. 
(2)  An overview map which shall place the proposed site in the middle of an area at least one-half mile in the four directions to clearly identify adjacent land ownership and uses. 
(3)  A statement as to the rationale as to why the RC zoning is proposed. Identify the private and public benefits and liabilities of the development.

Sec. 22-613. - RC Rural Cluster DistrictPlan commission review. 
(a)  Following determination by the zoning administrator that an application is complete, the matter shall be reviewed by city staff and shall then be placed on a plan commission agenda for initial review, prior to the filing of a formal application. Initial review is a review of the project at the concept level and is not binding. The preferred procedure is for an iteration of the plan commission's initial review to occur prior to introduction of a formal petition for rezoning. The purpose of this meeting, or meetings, is to allow a discussion of the plan commission regarding the possible planned development zoning application and the environmental, economic, social and other benefits of design to be obtained from the proposal and general statistics on the possible project. 
(b)  Following the required public hearing before the plan commission, the plan commission shall meet to make a determination and recommendation whether to advise the common council to approve the rezoning and the general implementation plan, to approve it with modifications, or to deny it. 
(Ord. No. 2012-O-18, § 1, 12-11-2012)  
Sec. 22-614. - RC Rural Cluster DistrictCriteria for RC approval. 
The intent of this code is to allow for limited development outside of the future urban development boundary while preserving certain natural characteristics of the property. To this end, the plan commission shall evaluate each proposed rezoning in light of the following criteria: 
(1)  RC rezoning requests shall be located on land at least 75 percent of which has either no tillage history and/or has a soil classification of IV, V, VI, VII, or VIII for that portion to be divided to accommodate the residential development. Specific site reviews should be based on the types of agricultural uses surrounding the rural cluster. If high quality agricultural soils with large contiguous acres are present, the compatibility and blending should occur to maintain the large contiguous agricultural acres, with the cluster being located at the edge/corner. 
(2)  RC requests shall be considered on the basis of one dwelling unit per 35 acres, utilizing 1979 as the base year. Potential claims that are outside of the future urban development boundary may be transferred to another property for the intent of creating a rural cluster that is located outside of the future urban development boundary. Agreements for the purchase of claims (with signatures from the owners and mortgage holders) will need to be submitted with the GIP. As a condition of SIP approval, land (35 acres per each claim) shall have a restriction with the city recorded at the county register of deeds restricting development to approved agricultural land uses [Note: Uses to be determined]. This restriction shall follow criteria identified in subsection 22-612(10). A land owner may, at their option, also file a non-removable restriction, such as a conservation easement, with a recognized 501(c)(3) land trust or conservancy, or other acceptable means. 
(3)  Requests are to be compatible with nearby agricultural zoning uses and shall provide for only one single family detached dwelling unit per claim, and require all new residential lots to have a right to farm document recorded to protect surrounding agricultural operations. A rural cluster shall consist of at least two and no more than ten single family detached dwelling units. 
(4)  The rezoning requests shall incorporate techniques to accomplish the following: 
a.  Protection and preservation of farmland and natural features. 
b.  Preservation and enhancement of natural features, including but not limited to woodlands, wetlands, prairies, streams, ponds, lakes, and other natural features. 
c.  Preservation of wildlife and flora habitat. 
d.  Enhancement of wildlife and flora habitat, including but not limited to small game, birds, waterfowl, and other fauna. 
e.  Be consistent with or advantageous for the Fitchburg Parks and Open Space Plan. 
(5)  Aesthetic desirability and effect on rural viewscape: 
a.  Preserve scenic views by minimizing views of new development from existing roads. 
b.  Rural clusters may be visible from access and surrounding roads so long as the cluster is designed to be unobtrusive in the rural viewscape. This can be accomplished as follows: 
1.  The buildings are grouped together to appear as a single farmstead and are designed utilizing historicist architecture (See section 22-623). 
2.  The buildings are grouped together to appear to be a rural hamlet and are designed utilizing historicist architecture. 
3.  The visible buildings from access and surrounding roads of a cluster fulfill the requirements of 1. or 2. above and the balance of the buildings are not visible. 
4.  The visible buildings of the cluster are designed with organic architecture so that their visual impact is minimal, blending into the landscape. 
c.  Building groupings to permit reduced minimum lot sizes. Where practicable, each lot shall adjoin another lot. Each lot shall have frontage and driveway access to a public street. The public street to serve a rural cluster shall provide at least two separate and distinct routes of travel. 
d.  Fencing, new plantings, and other screening. 
e.  Historic restoration. 
f.  Woodland, wetland or prairie restoration, improvement or expansion, along with maintenance. 
g.  Other features of site design and construction, building and structural design and construction and landscaping that are not listed above may also be addressed by the plan commission as advisory suggestions within the design review process upon a finding that the suggestion would be desirable to make the development a positive asset to the visual appearance of the community and positive contribution to the growth and stability of the community tax base. 
(6)  Compatibility with recreational trails, bike trails - specifically the Fitchburg Heritage Circle Route and wildlife corridors noted in the Fitchburg Park and Open Space Plan. 
(7)  Engineering design standards. Streets and other ways, provision for stormwater drainage, sanitary sewer/septic service, water supply, or other similar environmental and municipal engineering considerations of current ordinance requirements shall, at a minimum be met, but advanced environmental design will likely be required. Dark sky certified outdoor lighting shall be used. The plan commission and common council may require the use of higher levels of transportation and lighting improvements, stormwater management or water conservation techniques than is required by current ordinance or other governmental guidelines. Such standards shall be appropriate to advancing environmental design objectives and the public health, safety and welfare as determined by the city. Stormwater stay on-shall be at 90100 percent of the predevelopment rate. 
(8)  Driveways. Each residential building shall be served by its own driveway from the public street and follow standards created and set forth by the public works department under section 27-399 of the Fitchburg Municipal Code. 
(9)  Preservation and maintenance of open space in a Rural Cluster District. Provision shall be made for the preservation and maintenance of any open spaces either by public reservation or dedication to public entities or commitment to preservation by a private entity. RC agreements shall contain specific reference to the ownership of such open space areas and to provision for maintenance. Rural clusters shall provide plans and documents in written and graphic form to fully describe the project and its benefits. Draft deed restrictions, easements, and preservation and maintenance of open space documents shall be submitted with the application. This section is only relevant if providing a public or private community open space within the cluster. 
(10)  Park dedication or fee in lieu and park improvement fees are part of the land division approval process and shall be determined as defined in subsections 24-2(d)(1)(3) of the city's land division code, chapter 24. 
(11)  Transmittal of plan commission recommendations, report and related matters. The plan commission's reports and recommendations shall be made in a written report to the common council. A complete set of maps, plans and written documentation fully describing the proposed development as recommended by the plan commission at a general implementation plan level shall accompany the report of the plan commission. The matter shall not be considered by the council unless this documentation has a signature by the plan commission secretary over a statement that the documentation is complete and that it accurately reflects plan commission recommendations. In a situation in which the applicant disagrees with certain recommendations of the plan commission and is urging the common council to approve with modifications, the applicant must supply documentation of those modifications to the council prior to the matter being placed on the agenda of the common council.

When the consent signatures for lands in the parcel being rezoned to RCD-GIP are all acquired and delivered to the city clerk and zoning administrator within the 30 days as required by section 22-615, the documentation on plan commission and common council action and on the general implementation plan and the consent signatures shall be logged in and filed by the city, and the property shall be indicated as rezoned on city zoning maps. The date this occurs is the effective date of the rezoning. The map indication shall be RCD-GIP. The city clerk shall record at the county register of deeds the ordinance or an affidavit of notice of RC zoning against all real property included in the district. This shall be done as near the effective date of the RCD-GIP rezoning as is possible. The city shall require the applicant to supply necessary property descriptions, parcel numbers and to pay recording and publication fees. 
(Ord. No. 2012-O-18, § 1, 12-11-2012)  
Sec. 22-618. - RC Rural Cluster DistrictSpecific implementation plan (SIP). 
After the common council approval and recording of the RCD-GIP ordinance, the applicant may file a specific implementation plan for review and recommendation by the plan commission and approval by the common council. The specific implementation plan (for the entire RCD-GIP) shall be filed within three years of the date of council approval of the RCD-GIP. 
(1)  The specific implementation plan shall be a precise plan for development and shall contain graphic and tabular presentations at a level of detail equivalent to the level of detail of a final plat. Accompanying plans and text information shall describe in detail the building development plans, methodologies and timetables for the area covered by the specific implementation plan. The specific implementation plan shall cover all land in the approved general implementation plan as one submittal. 
(2)  The RCD-SIP for the entire RCD-GIP shall be submitted within three years of the common council approval of the RCD-GIP ordinance. If the SIP request is not submitted within three years, the RCD-GIP approval lapses and a new RCD-GIP approval shall be obtained pursuant to section 22-612 through 22-614. After three years, no RCD-SIP shall be approved unless the GIP has been reapproved. 
(3)  A public hearing as if it were a matter of rezoning, shall be held on any specific implementation plan (RCD-SIP) application or amendment to a RCD-SIP. 
(4)  The specific implementation plan submission may include site plan and design information, allowing the plan commission to combine design review and review of the specific implementation plan. Design review (see section 22-623) may, at the choice of the applicant, be deferred until a later time when specific site and building plans will be brought forth. 
(5)  RC requests shall be considered on the basis of one dwelling unit per 35 acres, utilizing 1979 as the base year. Potential claims that are outside of the future urban development boundary may be transferred to another property for the intent of creating a rural cluster that is located outside of the future urban development boundary. Land (35 acres) that is tied to each potential claim shall, as a condition of SIP approval, have a restriction in accord with section 22-620 and in favor of the city limiting land use to agriculturally approved uses [Note: uses to be determined] recorded at the county register of deeds. A land owner may, at their option, also file a non-removable restriction, such as a conservation easement, with a recognized 501(c)(3) land trust or conservancy, or other acceptable means. Signed agreements regarding the use of claims from outside the property, and relevant land restriction(s) shall be submitted with the RCD-SIP application, but the recording of such agreements shall be a condition of RCD-SIP approval. 
(6)  As part of submission for specific implementation plan approval, the applicant shall submit proof of financing capability pertaining to construction and maintenance and operation of public works elements of the proposed development. 
(7)  A copy of the recorded general implementation plan and all approved and relevant documents shall be submitted with the specific implementation plan request.

(Ord. No. 2012-O-18, § 1, 12-11-2012)  
Sec. 22-623. - RC Rural Cluster DistrictDesign review. 
(a)  All new residential, agricultural or other structures visible from access and surrounding roads shall be required to obtain architectural design review approval, pursuant to sections 22-60422-606 of chapter 22, zoning ordinance and chapter 25, architectural control, before any building permits may be issued. Architectural design review applies to all exterior structural and design features including site planning, site facilities and any building done within or on the site, as outlined in the aesthetic desirability and effect on rural lands, section 22-614(5). Any structure that is not visible from access and surrounding roads does not require design review. 
(b)  Architectural standards for clusters visible from access and surrounding roads: 
(1)  Historicist architecture is building design that utilizes traditional Midwestern American forms and surface decoration. These may include Greek Revival, Queen Anne, Italianate, Second Empire, Gothic Revival, Four square or Rural Victorian Vernacular styles. The use of Builder's Modern or Ranch, Shed contemporary, Norman Scansion, Georgian Revival and other suburban styles are not Historicist. Large-scale renditions of traditional forms may not be Historicist. 
(2)  The new building, from a reasonable distance such as the access road, shall appear to be of a building type and age similar to other pre-1930 buildings currently existing on the rural landscape. Such building, if placed next to an existing rural structure constructed prior to 1930, would not clash in scale or decorative surfaces with the pre-existing structure. 
(3)  Building groupings may recapitulate farmsteads, grouped farmsteads or rural hamlets, mimicking the historic forms of pre-existing pre-1930 groupings. 
(4)  The use of fencing, landscaping, berms and other landscaping devises to obscure or hide buildings or portions of buildings when the building themselves or their grouping does not conform to (1), (2) or (3) above will be allowed as long as the viewscape goals are met. 
(5)  The restoration of an existing structure that has lost its original appearance may be used to provide a portion of a visible cluster. E.g., a "modernized" vinyl sided house with a traditional rural pre-1930s form may be restored or re-skinned to an original or Historicist appearance and other Historicist buildings clustered with the restored building. 
(6)  The restoration of significant buildings, such as pre 1980s structures, whether originally used for residential, agricultural or commercial purposes is encouraged. 
(7)  The restoration of wetlands or prairies may be required as part of the landscape and viewscape improvement of the cluster. A tall grass prairie may be used with organic or historicist architecture to "stage set" a rural cluster by providing a feeling of distance between existing roads and the cluster. The expansion and restoration of wooded areas may reduce or eliminate from the viewscape some or all buildings of a cluster that do not meet the standards for visible architecture.

(4)  When the plan commission staff has received a complete application, and the application fee, and when the staff has completed such research and staff review as the plan commission has directed be applied to such applications, the application and related file shall be transmitted to the plan commission for its review and consideration. 
(5)  The plan commission shall establish a date for public hearing before the plan commission on all proposals for conditional use approvals. Class 1 notice shall be given prior to such hearing. At least ten days' prior written notice shall be given to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any lands affected by a proposed change in zoning district boundaries. Failure to give such notice to nearby municipalities shall not invalidate the hearing or the use, if adopted. The public hearing shall be conducted by the plan commission in accordance with the notice, unless recessed and rescheduled in accordance with state law. 
(6)  At least ten days prior written notice shall be given by ordinary mail to owners of record of all lots or parcels within 300 feet or a minimum of the three closest property owners, and to other parties of interest, including alderpersons representing the district in which the request has been made. 
(7)  Following the public hearing, the plan commission may approve, disapprove or approve with modifications a conditional use application. The decision of the plan commission shall be recorded in the minutes and shall contain a written statement of reasons for the commission's determination, including reasons specifically related to the standards of this chapter or of documents related to this chapter by cross-referencing provisions, and of any conditions required to be imposed upon the use if the application is approved or approved with modifications. 
(8)  Adopted motions to approve conditional uses shall include identification of conditions. These conditions may address, without limitation because of specific enumeration: the site plan, timetable of development, operation of the proposed use, surety requirements for performance of required activities, increased yard requirements, period or hours of operation, landscaping or planting screens, deed restrictions, parking areas and signs, types of construction, erosion control, preservation of significant natural or historic features or other considerations relevant to applicable standards and all conditions referenced in section 22-717(b). All conditions imposed shall be recorded in the minutes and correspondence sent to the applicant and other parties registering an interest and may, at the discretion of the commission, be recorded, at the expense of the applicant, in legal documentation filed in relation to the property at the county register of deeds. All such conditions shall be fully binding upon the property as if they were specific terms of this article. 
(9)  A decision of the plan commission granting or denying a conditional use may be appealed to the common council. Applications for such appeal shall be signed by the applicant or by persons who would have protest petition rights under Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7) were the matter one of rezoning, or by any member of the common council. Such application for appeal shall be filed within ten days of the date of the plan commission action. Upon filing of the appeal application, the entire plan commission file shall be submitted by commission staff to the city clerk for transmittal to the common council and all plan commission minutes on the matter shall be reproduced and sent to members on the common council. The appeal shall be placed on the agenda of the common council. Before rendering its decision on the appeal, the common council shall hold a public hearing. The common council may either affirm, reverse or modify the action of the plan commission. In making its determination the common council shall be guided and controlled by subsection (a) of this section. 
(10)  Where an approved conditional use contemplates construction of buildings and structures, the failure to commence such construction within one year after approval of the conditional use shall render the approval void. In addition, the failure to complete such construction within two years after approval shall render the approval void unless the applicant has demonstrated good cause to the plan commission and the plan commission has affirmatively voted to provide such an extension. In no case shall the plan commission grant an extension longer than one year nor shall the plan commission grant more than one extension for a single approved conditional use. 
(11)  If a use allowed by a conditional use permit is established but ceases for a period of 24 or more consecutive months, the conditional use permit for the area shall expire. 
(c)  General standards. No conditional use shall be approved by the plan commission unless the commission shall find: 
(1)  That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 
(2)  That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood. 
(3)  That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. 
(4)  That adequate utilities, access road, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been or are being provided. 
(5)  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. 
(6)  That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(d)  Conditions. Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing, planting screens, operational control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, increased yards, or parking requirements, may be required by the plan commission upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.115, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2012-O-03, 4-24-2012)  
Sec. 22-641. - Conditions on rezonings. 
(a)  Statement of purpose. Conditional re-zonings are authorized as provided herein to enable adaptation of zoning to unique circumstances regarding particular sites, uses or neighborhoods when the city has not had sufficient experience with the type of use in question to lead to treatment of the use as conditional use. 
(b)  The plan commission may recommend and the common council may adopt an ordinance effecting an amendment of the zoning district map containing the condition that the change in the map will take effect on such date occurring within three months of the date of common council approval of the amendment when the first on-site inspection for building location is made and approved for the project sought to be established, and in the event such approved inspection has not occurred by the three-month time period, the possibility of making effective the re-zoning will then be terminated. 
(c)  The plan commission may recommend and the common council may adopt an ordinance effecting an amendment of the zoning district map containing the condition that the change in map will take effect on such date occurring with within three months of date of common council approval of the amendment when a restrictive covenant has been recorded binding the property to conditions specified in the amending ordinance, and in the event such covenant is not recorded by the end of the three-month period, the possibility of making effective the re-zoning will then be terminated. Conditions specified to be in such required covenants shall be related to the purposes of the ordinance. They may include, as specific cases warrant, limits of permissible uses to less than the full range of uses otherwise allowable in the district into which the land is being placed. Enforcement rights over such covenant controls shall be afforded to the city and owners of property within 300 feet of the site. The covenant controls shall be amendable or repealable upon petition of the owner of the lands subject to the controls, and approval of the common council after a hearing similar to a re-zoning hearing. A re-zoning of the lands to a different zoning district shall also act to repeal the covenant controls. Except as provided above, the covenants shall run with the land. 
(d)  Other similar controls appropriate to handling by covenant provisions may also be imposed. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.116, 10-12-2010)

Stats. ch. 985 to be published and shall give due notice of the hearing to all parties in interest. For appeals or variances in overlay districts written notice shall be given to the southern district office of the department at least ten days prior to hearings on proposed variances and appeals for map or text interpretation. 
(d)  Any party may appear in person or by agent at such hearing. The chair may administer oaths to parties testifying and may compel attendance of witnesses. All testimony before the board by persons other than board members and all documentary evidence or material pertaining to matters before the board shall be received at hearings conducted by the board, provided that the content of relevant ordinance or statutory materials shall be deemed to be before the board in all cases and need not be entered into the record. All parties in interest shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to comment on all materials or information so received. Board members who are in possession of facts that may have a bearing on the matter before the board shall enter same into the record of the hearing and opportunity shall be allowed for comment on such entries. 
(e)  Deliberations and decisions. The board shall deliberate on matters before it. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to approve any appeal, variance or other decision matter before the board. The vote of each matter decided by the board shall be recorded in the minutes. If a member is absent or if a member fails to vote, such facts shall similarly be recorded. The minutes of the board shall show the board's decisions and the votes of members thereon. Each decision of the board shall be accompanied by written reasons in support of the decision. All decisions shall be made in strict accordance with the standards of the ordinance and the board shall decide all matters before it within a reasonable time.

(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.117, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2012-O-03, 4-24-2012)  
Sec. 22-643. - Appeals board functionsAppeals of interpretations of the zoning administrator. 
(a)  Appealable matters. Decisions by the zoning administrator that consist of interpretations of the terms of the city zoning ordinance and that are made in the course of determining whether a permit or approval will be issued by the administrator are appealable to the zoning board of appeals as administrative appeals. Decisions by the zoning administrator to issue an enforcement demand or to commence other enforcement activities, where the administrator has determined that a violation of the ordinance exists, are appealable to the board of appeals as an administrative appeal. 
(b)  Procedures for initiating an administrative appeal. 
(1)  Eligible appellants. Administrative appeals may be initiated by any person aggrieved by the decision or interpretation being appealed, or by any officer, department, board or committee of the city government. 
(2)  Time for appeals. An appeal shall be commenced within 30 days after decision or interpretation was made. 
(3)  Initiating an appeal. An appeal may be commenced by filing with the zoning administrator a notice of appeal identifying the decision being appealed, the grounds for the requested relief and payment of applicable fees. Upon receipt of such a notice, the zoning administrator shall notify the board of appeals and shall transmit to the board all papers and files which constitute the record of the decision being appealed. 
(4)  Stays. An appeal of a decision to issue a permit or approval or to issue an enforcement demand or to commence other enforcement proceedings shall cause the permit or approval action to be suspended or shall stay further enforcement prosecution unless the zoning administrator or city attorney files with the board of appeals a certificate, supported by a statement of facts, alleging that suspension or stay will cause imminent peril to life or property. If such a certificate is filed, proceedings shall not be stayed except upon a restraining order issued by a court. 
(5)  Decisions of the zoning board of appeals. Following the procedures specified in section 22-642(c) through (e), the board shall decide the matter based upon whether the decision, determination or interpretation being appealed was in error. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from, or may make such decision as ought to have been made, and to that end shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. Decisions by the board on administrative appeals shall be based upon the terms of the ordinance and evidence as to legislative intent. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.119, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-644. - SameVariances. 
(a)  Initiating a request for variance. Applications for variances in zoning regulations may be filed by any party having a property interest in the property in question, along with payment of the applicable fee. The zoning administrator shall transmit the application to the board. 
(b)  Review and decision. Following a public hearing and other investigations, including review of plan commission recommendations, if available, the board shall decide the matter based upon the following standards: 
(1)  No variance may be granted that would have the effect of allowing a use of land or property that would violate state law or administrative rules. 
(2)  To grant a variance, the board must find that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special and peculiar conditions, applicable only to the specific property in question, a literal enforcement will result in exceptional practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public health, safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
a.  Exceptional practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship shall be construed as a whole, with no distinction made. 
b.  When considering a dimensional standard variance that will not involve significant change in the character of the neighborhood, the hardship/difficulty test is whether compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions on lot area, setbacks, frontage, height, lot area coverage or occupancy or density would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for an allowed purpose or would render conformity unnecessarily burdensome. 
c.  When considering a dimensional variance that would, if approved, cause significant change in the character of the neighborhood, the hardship/difficulty test is whether, in absence of approval, no feasible use can be made of the property. 
d.  Use variances (variances allowing a use not specified for that district by this article) should be considered only when the use in question is new or is one not provided for anywhere in the ordinance. The board may consider such variances only when the use is very similar in its inherent characteristics and impact characteristics to uses within the district in question. 
(3)  The board may grant a variance to extend a zoning district boundary for a distance not to exceed 25 feet, but only where the boundary of a district divides a lot in a single ownership. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.120, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-645. - Zoning administrator. 
(a)  Position designated. A zoning administrator shall be designated through city personnel procedures. 
(b)  Duties, responsibilities and authority. 
(1)  Records. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for keeping all records of applications received, committee, board or office actions on such applications, permits issued, inspections made, enforcement actions undertaken and similar activities, as well as general correspondence pertaining to the functions of the office and program. 
(2)  Inspections. Zoning administration shall make such inspections of premises as are required, to determine compliance of land use activities with the terms of this chapter. Except in cases of emergency, such inspections shall be made only at reasonable hours, with reasonable notice to property owners and/or occupants and with consent, unless made pursuant to an inspection warrant issued pursuant to state law. 
(3)  Determinations and interpretations. The zoning administrator shall make those administrative decisions and determinations required for administration of this chapter. 
(4)  Permits, approvals, fees or certificates of occupancy. The zoning administrator shall receive applications under this chapter and shall process the applications and collect and dispose of fees in accordance with city ordinance and administrative procedures. Permits or approvals issued by the zoning administrator shall be issued on the basis of plans and applications as submitted and authorize only the uses, arrangements and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or construction. Use, arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. Permits shall lapse and become void if operations described in the permit are not commenced within one year of issuance of the permit, unless otherwise specified in this chapter or by specific approval of an extension or variation. 
(5)  Advice and recommendations. The zoning administrator shall, upon general or specific request of the plan commission or board of appeals or other body or officer of the city, issue reports, and make recommendations on matters that come before such commission, board or officer. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.125, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-646. - Permits. 
(a)  Certain development activities and occupancies shall require application for and issuance of a permit in order for them to be legally established. The plan commission is hereby delegated the authority to promulgate permit requirements, to establish forms for permit applications and permit forms themselves. 
(b)  Failure to obtain a required permit is a violation of this article. 
(c)  Issuance of a permit authorizes only the development of occupancy set forth in approved plans submitted as part of a permit application and no other development or occupancy. Issuance of a permit creates no liability on the part of the city or its issuing officers and does not limit the right of the city to change ordinance requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.127, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-647. - Park fee requirements. 
The following fees shall be required as a condition for any rezoning, conditional use permit or design review for any residential unit receiving such approval within the city, unless provision of fee, land or street frontage for the proposed development has been applied previously to the real estate subject to the application. This section is not applicable to the SmartCode District under chapter 23. 
(1)  Fee in lieu of dedication. 
a.  Chapter 24, land division, requires a park land dedication of 2,900 square feet per dwelling unit. Where the park commission, in its sole discretion, determines that there is no suitable land for a park, or parks, within the proposed development, the dedication of land is not feasible, or the dedication would not be compatible with the comprehensive plan, or the park commission determines that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the parks commission shall then require a fee in lieu of making a land dedication. 
b.  The fee to be imposed under subsection (1)a of this section shall be a per dwelling unit fee as set forth in the annual budget appendix fee schedule. In calculating the fee, the typical cost of land sold for residential subdivisions or development shall be considered. This fee shall be collected and paid in lump sum, prior to any land division being executed by the city, or prior to any zoning permit or building permit being issued if a land division is not required. 
c.  The park commission may, in its sole discretion, permit the developer to satisfy the requirement of subsection (1)a of this section by combining a land dedication with a fee payment. 
d.  The city shall place any fee collected pursuant to the provisions of this section in a separate account to be used for land acquisition and development of adequate park, playground, recreation and open space to meet the needs created by the proposed development. 
(2)  Park improvement fee. The developer shall pay, prior to issuance of a zoning permit or building permit a per dwelling unit park improvement fee (a separate fee for single-family units, two-family units and multifamily units) as set forth in the annual budget appendix fee schedule. The collected fees shall be utilized to construct park facilities for the plat, survey or development. The park commission shall give priority to establishing the proper neighborhood park facilities according to the plan for parks and open spaces and the generally accepted standards prior to expenditure for facilities in area or community parks. The collected fee shall go into special segregated funds. The fee, per unit, relates to the cost of improvements for a neighborhood park. 
(3)  Reserved. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.128, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2018-O-38, § 4, 11-27-2018)

(2)  Any such party who violates or aids or abets in a violation shall be liable to prosecution or remedial action. 
(3)  This chapter applies fully to all public governmental and quasi-public and quasi-governmental lands, developments and activities unless specifically exempted by state or federal law. 
(c)  Investigation of compliance; notice of violations. 
(1)  The zoning administrator is responsible for inspecting and investigating compliance of land use activities with the terms of this chapter. 
(2)  If, upon such inspection or investigation, the zoning administrator becomes aware of a condition which he/she concludes is or likely to become unlawful, the administrator shall immediately notify the parties to the situation whom he/she deems to be responsible and potentially liable. Such notice shall include: 
a.  A demand that the condition that is alleged to constitute the present or potential violation be halted, prevented from occurring or remedied; or 
b.  A statement that a complaint on the condition and request for prosecution has been or will be transmitted to the city attorney and/or to enforcement officials, state agencies, or both. 
(3)  If an enforcement demand is issued and is not complied with, the zoning administrator may file a request for prosecution with the city attorney, unless an administrative appeal has been commenced and a stay order has been issued. 
(d)  Enforcement and penalties. 
(1)  Any building or structure hereafter erected, moved or structurally altered or any use hereafter established in violation of any provision of this Code shall be deemed an unlawful building, structure or use. The zoning administrator shall promptly report all such violations to the city attorney who shall cause an action to be brought to enjoin the erection, moving or structural alteration of such building or the establishment of such use or to cause such building, structure or use to be vacated, or removed. 
(2)  Any person who violates any provision of this Code or disobeys or refuses to comply with the enforcement of any provision of this Code shall also be subject to a forfeiture of $100.00 per day. 
(e)  Other enforcement provisions. 
(1)  Where a conditional use, variance, planned development or design review has been approved subject to specified conditions, and where such conditions are not complied with, the body which last approved such conditions may conduct a hearing pursuant to this section upon a petition submitted by any interested party or by the zoning administrator to revoke the approval. A finding of noncompliance with the conditions imposed shall be grounds for revocation. 
(2)  Relationship to nuisance actions. No provision of this chapter shall be construed to bar an action to enjoin or abate the use or occupancy of any land or structure as a nuisance upon the laws of the state. 
(3)  Conditions placed on rezonings, approvals or permits may include requirement of bonds or similar surety arrangements to ensure performance of required obligations. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.130, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-649. - Interpretation and definitions. 
(a)  Relationship of zoning to plan documents. City comprehensive plan documents or plans for components of city development shall, unless otherwise specified herein, be guides to interpretation of this chapter. Wherever possible, interpretation decisions rendered under this chapter shall harmonize zoning regulation decisions with plans and with other plan implementation regulations. 
(b)  General intent. The intent of this chapter is to contribute to the betterment of the community for the benefit of persons who reside in the community. The chapter intends to promote the public health, safety and welfare, to promote orderly development in all sectors, and to maintain and improve the quality of the community. 
(c)  Rules of language construction. The language set forth in the text of this chapter shall be interpreted in accordance with the following rules of construction: 
(1)  The singular number includes the plural and the plural is singular. 
(2)  The present tense includes the past and future tenses and the future the present. 
(3)  The word "shall" is mandatory and the word "may" is permissive. 
(4)  The masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter genders. 
(5)  Whenever a word or term defined hereinafter appears in the text of this chapter, its meaning shall be construed as set forth in such definition thereof. 
(d)  Liberal interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. 
(e)  Conflicting regulations. Where the standards of this chapter are either more restrictive or less restrictive than standards imposed by any other laws, ordinances, statutes, resolutions, or regulations, the regulation that is more restrictive or that imposes higher standards or requirements shall prevail. The SmartCode, chapter 23, shall prevail over the terms of this chapter. 
(f)  Classification of uses. In each zoning district, there are uses which are permitted uses and uses which are conditional uses. 
(1)  Permitted uses for each district may be undertaken in that district upon issuance of a zoning permit for those permitted uses that require a permit, and upon compliance of the use with other applicable laws and ordinances. 
(2)  Uses listed in each zoning district as conditional uses may be undertaken in that district only upon approval of a conditional use application pursuant to this chapter and upon compliance of the use with other applicable laws and ordinances. 
(3)  A term "allowable uses" in this chapter refers to both permitted and conditional uses. 
(g)  Uses not classified. When a use is not specifically provided for in this chapter, the plan commission or a property owner may request a study by the plan commission to determine whether the proposed use is compatible with the land use plan, what zoning district would be appropriate and a determination as to conditions and standards relating to such use; the common council may, upon receipt of the study, initiate an amendment to this chapter to provide for the particular use under consideration or find that the use is not compatible in the particular location. 
(h)  Separability. It is hereby declared to be the intent of the common council that the several provisions of this chapter are separable. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of this chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provision of this chapter not specifically included in said judgment. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the application of any provision of this chapter to particular property, building or structure, such judgment shall not affect application of said provision to any other properties, buildings or structures not specifically included in said judgment. 
(i)  SIC reference. Use listings in the business and industrial districts generally employ terminology of the Standard Industrial Classification SIC Manual published by the US Printing Office and interpretive decisions shall be guided by reference to that publication. 
(j)  General provisions for use. Any use not listed as a permitted use in a district is prohibited in that district and except as otherwise expressly provided, any use listed as a permitted use in any other district shall be construed as a prohibited use in any other district. 
(k)  "Land use plan" and "master plan" defined. The terms "land use plan" and "master plan" shall mean the city comprehensive plan, adopted March 24, 2009, as subsequently amended. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.135, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 22-650. - Standards for lots and setbacks. 
(a)  Each lot newly created shall provide appropriate size, shape and configuration for the uses that predominate or typify the zoning district in which the lot is established. 
(b)  Each structure or occupancy for which a minimum lot size and lot dimensions are specified in this chapter shall have a lot prescribed for it, either a traditional legal land parcel or a zoning lot. A zoning lot is a lot equivalent, exclusively identified for the particular structure or occupancy to allow determination of lot standards. The structure or occupancy need not have exclusive legal possession of the zoning lot, but no two zoning lots shall overlap. The zoning administrator or plan commission may establish rules so that zoning lots function in a manner equivalent to traditional lots, but condominium forms of ownership shall not be discriminated against in the administration of this chapter. 
(c)  No required yard shall be reduced in area or dimension so as to make such yard or other open space less than the minimum required by this chapter. 
(d)  Setbacks are established within the various use districts. No structure to accommodate a principal use may be established or maintained within a setback. Section 22-55 governs other structural development or occupancies within setbacks. 
(e)  The provisions of this section shall not be applied to projects permitted under the SmartCode District, chapter 23.

(2)  Protect life, health and property; 
(3)  Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
(4)  Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other fish and aquatic habitat; 
(5)  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the wetland area; 
(6)  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities; 
(7)  Minimize expenditures of public monies for costly flood control projects; 
(8)  Reduce rescue and relief efforts, generally undertaken at the expense of the tax paying public; 
(9)  Prevent business interruptions which usually result in the loss of local incomes; 
(10)  Reduce damage to public facilities such as utilities, municipal buildings, streets and bridges which may be located in the floodplains; 
(11)  Prevent the occurrence of future flood blight areas on floodplains; 
(12)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers; and 
(13)  Prevent increases in regional flood heights which could increase damage during floods and which may result in conflicts or litigation between property owners.

Sec. 22-746. - Groundwater protection overlay districts. 
(a)  Restricted zone. The primary portion of the Fitchburg wells recharge areas to be protected is an area of land having a radius of 1,200 feet, whose center is offset 600 feet south of each municipal well. If any portion of a parcel falls within the above defined radius the whole parcel shall be considered within the restricted zone. The restricted zones for each well shall more specifically be defined as the areas outlined in the maps attached hereto as exhibits A through H and incorporated herein as if fully set forth. Any parcel that is outlined in exhibits A through H that is later divided by a certified survey map or plat will be considered removed from the restricted zone if the new parcel limits fall outside the above defined radius. These lands are subject to land use and development restrictions because of their close proximity to the well fields and the corresponding threat of contamination. 
(b)  Management zone. Lands outside the restricted zone but within the corporate limits of the city shall be considered in the "management zone." The city reserves the right to require applications for approval in this zone, in accordance with section 22-750, for uses considered restricted in the restricted zone and to require additional environmental monitoring/structures. All underground gasoline and fuel oil storage tanks in this zone shall be approved and installed in accordance with section 22-752.

ARTICLE X. - FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY ZONING  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 22-783. - Statutory authorization. 
This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 61.35 and 62.23, and the requirements in Wis. Stats. § 87.30. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.401, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2014-O-31, § 1, 8-26-2014)  
Sec. 22-784. - Findings of fact. 
The uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains, rivers and streams, and the pollution of navigable waters of the city would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and the tax base. The state legislature has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; and preserve shore cover and natural beauty. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.402, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2014-O-31, § 1, 8-26-2014)  
Sec. 22-785. - Purpose. 
This subchapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
(1)  Protect life, health and property; 
(2)  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize rescue and relief efforts, undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
(4)  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplains; 
(6)  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas on floodplains; 
(7)  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflict or litigation between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.403, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2014-O-31, § 1, 8-26-2014)  
Sec. 22-786. - Title. 
This article shall be known as the Floodplain Overlay Zoning for the City of Fitchburg, Wisconsin. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.404, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2014-O-31, § 1, 8-26-2014)  
Sec. 22-787. - Areas to be regulated. 
This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.411, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2014-O-31, § 1, 8-26-2014)  
Sec. 22-788. - Official maps and revisions. 
(a)  The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the WIDNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see § 22-851, Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the WIDNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the city planning department.

Sec. 22-789. - Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. 
The regional floodplain areas are divided into four districts as follows: 
(1)  The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE zones as shown on the FIRM. 
(2)  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE zones on the FIRM. 
(3)  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
(4)  The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 22.413, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2014-O-31, § 1, 8-26-2014)  
Sec. 22-790. - Locating floodplain boundaries. 
(a)  Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in this section. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to section 22-851. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and the applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to the board of appeals as discussed in sections 22-844 and 22-845 and the criteria in this section. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to section 22-851. 
(1)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(2)  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale.

a.  Development in flood storage district shall not cause an increase equal or greater than 0.00 of a foot in the height of the regional flood. 
b.  No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the pre-development ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost, (compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage. 
c.  If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the entire area zoned as flood storage district, on this waterway, is rezoned to the floodfringe district. This must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without floodplain storage, as per section 22-851, Amendments, of this article. 
d.  No area may be removed from the flood storage district unless it can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection elevation and is contiguous to other lands lying outside of the floodplain.

Maintenance is not considered a modification; this includes painting, decorating, paneling and other nonstructural components; and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems, or connections to public utilities. Any costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure are not considered maintenance. 
The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure. 
(2)  If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this article. 
(3)  The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structure, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value of those modifications present. 
(4)  No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would equal or exceed 50 percent of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this article. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with section 22-802(c). The costs of elevating the lowest floor of a nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded from the 50 percent provisions of this subsection. 
(5)  No maintenance to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, the cost of which would equal or exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this article. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with section 22-802(c)(1). 
(6)  If on a per event basis the total value of the work being done under (4) and (5) above equals or exceeds 50 percent of the present equalized assessed value the work shall not be permitted unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this article. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with section 22-802(c)(1). 
(7)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(8) of this section, if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially damaged it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and structure meet the provisions of this article. For the purpose of this subsection, a structure is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the structure to its pre-damaged condition equals or exceeds 50 percent of the structure's present equalized assessed value. 
(8)  For nonconforming buildings that are substantially damaged or destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such nonconforming building shall be permitted in order to restore it to the size and use in effect prior to the damage event, provided that the minimum federal code requirements below are met and all required permits have been granted prior to the start of construction.

The study contractor shall be responsible for the technical adequacy of the study. All studies shall be reviewed and approved by the department. 
(1)  Zone A floodplains. 
a.  Hydrology. The appropriate methods shall be based on the standards in ch. NR 116.07(3), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydrologic analysis: Determination of regional flood discharge. 
b.  Hydraulic modeling. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic analysis: Determination of regional flood elevation, and the following: 
1.  Determination of the required limits of the hydraulic model shall be based on detailed study information for downstream structures (dam, bridge, culvert) to determine adequate starting WSEL for the study. 
2.  Channel sections must be surveyed. 
3.  Minimum four-foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used for the development of cross section overbank and floodplain mapping. 
4.  A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel at each location. 
5.  The most current version of HEC RAS shall be used. 
6.  A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required at each structure. 
7.  Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet. 
8.  Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high water marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted engineering practices. 
9.  The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet. 
c.  Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided, showing all cross section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed development and whether the proposed development is located in the floodway. 
1.  If the proposed development is located outside of the floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood elevation. 
2.  If any part of the proposed development is in the floodway, it must be added to the base model to show the difference between existing and proposed conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients remain the same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based on standard accepted engineering practices is provided.

b.  Hydraulic model. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Admin. Code, Hydraulic analysis: Determination of regional flood elevation, and the following: 
1.  Duplicate effective model. The effective model shall be reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available, models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations shown in the floodway data table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot. 
2.  Corrected effective model. The corrected effective model shall not include any man-made physical changes since the effective model date, but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for department review. 
3.  Existing (pre-project conditions) model. The existing model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the project associated with the revised (post-project) model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model. 
4.  Revised (post-project conditions) model. The revised (post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This model shall reflect proposed conditions. 
5.  All changes to the duplicate effective model and subsequent models must be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes. 
6.  Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the effective model and result in water surface elevations and topwidths computed by the revised models matching those in the effective model upstream and downstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall not be truncated. 
c.  Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the department for review which meet the following conditions:

2.  Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour interval, and a planimetric map showing the applicable items. If a digital version of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM may be more easily revised. 
3.  Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised one percent and two-tenths percent annual chance floodplains and floodway boundaries. 
4.  If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping data (GIS or CADD) are used then all supporting documentation or metadata must be included with the data submission along with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and state plan coordinate system in accordance with FEMA mapping specifications. 
5.  The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the effective floodplain boundaries. 
6.  All cross sections from the effective model shall be labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross section lookup table shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme. 
7.  Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown on the map. 
8.  The stream centerline, or profile baseline used to measure stream distances in the model shall be visible on the map. 
(d)  Expiration. All permits issued under the authority of this article shall expire no more than 180 days after issuance. The permit may be extended for a maximum of 180 days for good and sufficient cause.

Sec. 24-1. - Introduction. 
(a)  Authority. These regulations are adopted under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. §§ 62.11(5), 62.23(6) and (7) and 236.45. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and control the division and development of land within the corporate limits of the city in order to promote the public health, safety, morals, prosperity, aesthetics and general welfare of the community; to lessen congestion in the streets and highways; to further the orderly layout and appropriate use of land; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, playgrounds, and other public requirements; to facilitate the division of larger tracts into smaller parcels of land; to ensure adequate legal description and proper survey monumentation of subdivided land; to provide for the administration and enforcement of this chapter; and to provide penalties for its violation. 
(c)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to laws. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall govern. 
(d)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. 
(e)  Common council. The authority to approve or object to preliminary plats, final plats and certified surveys is, to the extent necessary to implement the provisions of this chapter, vested in the common council upon recommendation from the plan commission. 
(f)  Severability. The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any provision of the chapter is invalid, or if its application to any person or circumstance is invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application. 
(g)  Title. This chapter shall be known as, referred to, and cited as the "land division ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 15.01, 10-12-2010)  
Sec. 24-2. - General provisions. 
(a)  Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction of these regulations shall include all lands within the city. The provisions of this chapter as it applies to divisions of tracts of land into less than five parcels shall not apply to: 
(1)  Transfers of interests in land by will or pursuant to court order; 
(2)  Leases for a term not to exceed ten years, mortgages or easements; 
(3)  The sale or exchange of parcels of land between owners of adjoining property if additional lots are not thereby created and the lots resulting are not reduced below the minimum sizes required by Wis. Stats. ch. 236 or any other applicable laws or ordinances. 
(b)  Compliance. No person shall divide any land located within the city which results in a land division, subdivision, or a replat as defined herein; no such land division, subdivision, or replat shall be entitled to record; and no street shall be laid out or improvements made to land without compliance with all requirements of this chapter and with: 
(1)  The provisions of Wis. Stats. ch. 236; 
(2)  The rules of the state department of health and social services regulating lot size and lot elevation and of chapter 46 of the Dane County Code of Ordinances regulating lot size, lot elevation, soil permeability, etc., for private sewage systems where the land to be subdivided is not served by a public sewer and provisions for such service have not been made; 
(3)  The rules of the state department of transportation relating to safety of access and the preservation of the public interest and investment in the highway system if the land owned or controlled by the subdivider abuts on a state trunk highway or connecting street; 
(4)  The city comprehensive plan and any applicable ordinances, official maps and regulations; 
(5)  The rules of the state department of natural resources relating to wetlands, floodplains and erosion control. 
(c)  Contract and security for improvements. 
(1)  Contract. Before any final plat, certified survey map, comprehensive development plan, or replat in conjunction with a staging plan pursuant to subsection (j) of this section is inscribed by the clerk, the subdivider shall enter a contract with the city wherein the subdivider agrees to make and to install all required improvements within 18 months or, where staging is permitted, within four years of the date that the plat, or certified survey map is recorded. The plan commission may permit construction to be staged provided a staging plan pursuant to subsection (j) of this section has been approved. Where staging is permitted, the common council will accept the public improvements within designated parts of the subdivision, land division, or comprehensive development when they have been completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and have passed the necessary inspections, even though the particular improvements may not have been completed within the remainder of the subdivision, land division, or comprehensive development. 
(2)  Security for performance required. 
a.  At the time the contract is entered, the subdivider shall furnish a bond, certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or certified check to the city in an amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost of all required improvements as determined by the city engineer, plus a 15 percent contingency (total 115 percent). Where staging is permitted, the amount of the security and the time it is furnished shall be determined in accordance with subsection (c)(2)b of this section. 
b.  Where staging is permitted, the subdivider shall deposit a bond, certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or certified check with the city at the time the contract is entered and upon completion of the first and each successive stage of construction. The security deposit shall be an amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost of improvements next required by the installation and construction schedule as determined by the city engineer plus a 15 percent contingency. Improvements constructed during the first stage and each successive stage of construction shall not be accepted nor shall any building permit be issued for construction within the completed area of the subdivision or comprehensive development until the security required for the next stage of construction has been posted with the city. 
c.  The security posted shall be in such form as is acceptable to the city attorney. When a certificate of deposit or certified check is posted as security, the instrument must be negotiable by the city. When a letter of credit is posted as security the city must be the beneficiary. 
d.  The security posted shall guarantee that all required improvements will be made and installed according to city specifications by the subdivider or its contractors not later than 18 months from the date that the plat is recorded or, where staging is permitted, that each stage will be completed by the date specified in the installation and completion schedule, and shall be used, applied, or released pursuant to section 24-12. 
(3)  Letter of agreement. Governmental units to which these bond and contract provisions apply may file, in lieu of said contract and bond, a letter from officers authorized to act on their behalf agreeing to comply with the provisions of this section. 
(d)  Dedication and reservation of land. 
(1)  Dedication of public ways. Whenever a tract of land being divided or subdivided embraces all or any part of street, drainageway or other public way which has been designated in the comprehensive plan, comprehensive park, open space, and recreation plan, or the official city map, said public way shall be made a part of the plat or survey map and dedicated by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on said plan or map. 
(2)  Dedication of parks, playgrounds, recreation and open spaces. 
a.  The subdivider/developer shall dedicate sufficient land area to provide adequate park, playground, recreation and open space to meet the needs to be created by and to be provided for the land development, land division or subdivision. At least 2,900 square feet of land shall be dedicated for each proposed residential dwelling unit within the land development, division, subdivision or comprehensive development. Where a definite commitment is made to the city of the subdivider/developer with respect to the number of dwelling units to be constructed on any parcel of land which has a zoning classification that permits multifamily use, the dedication shall be based on that number. Where no such commitment exists, the dedication shall be based upon the maximum number of dwelling units which the zoning classification of the parcel will permit. Park dedication requirements for land development, land division or subdivision, developments or projects using the SmartCode zoning district in chapter 23, shall provide the following required park dedication requirements: T-3 designated and special district lands: 2,900 square feet of land per dwelling unit; T-4 designated land shall be calculated taking the total net lot area within T-4 at six dwelling units per acre multiplied by 1,900 square feet per dwelling unit; T-5 designated land shall be calculated taking the total net lot area within T-5 at 12 dwelling units per acre multiplied by 1,000 square feet per dwelling unit. 
b.  Where, in the sole discretion of the park commission, there is no land suitable for parks within the proposed development area, land division or subdivision, the dedication of land required by subsection (d)(2)a of this section is not feasible, the dedication of land would not be compatible with the city comprehensive plan, or the park commission determines that a cash contribution will better serve the public interest, the park commission may require the subdivider/developer to pay a fee-in-lieu of making the required land dedication. 
c.  The city at its sole discretion may, acting upon a recommendation by the parks commission, identify lands outside of the development which it would accept as part of the parkland dedication requirements replacing all or part of the total dedication or fee-in-lieu of land dedication requirement. The city and subdivider may, by mutual consent, agree to an acre-to-acre or other equivalent basis. 
d.  Land zoned SmartCode under chapter 23 shall provide civic spaces as required through that chapter, and additional park land dedication as may be required by the parks commission as allowed under chapter 23. Where the total dedicated park acreage is less than that required in subsection (d)(2)a of this section, a fee-in-lieu of dedication for the difference shall be required pursuant to the city's adopted fee schedule. 
e.  The amount of any fee imposed pursuant to this subsection (d)(2) shall be a per-dwelling-unit fee as set forth in the annual budget appendix fee schedule. A fee shall be provided as noted in the annual budget appendix fee schedule for areas zoned SmartCode under chapter 23. 
f.  The park commission may, in its sole discretion, permit the subdivider/developer to satisfy the requirement of subsection (d)(2)a of this section by combining a land dedication with a fee payment. 
g.  The city shall place any fee collected pursuant to the provisions of this section in a separate account to be used for land acquisition and development of adequate park, playground, recreation and open space to meet the needs created by the land development, land division or subdivision. 
h.  Payment of land dedication fees shall be in a lump sum prior to the recording of a final plat or certified survey map or prior to the issuance of any building permit for a development where no plat or certified survey map is involved. Where no land division is involved the park commission may permit the developer to substitute land dedication for fees. However, where land outside the development is anticipated under section 24-2(d)(2)c, the subdivider may be allowed up to two years from the date of council action on the approving resolution to dedicate the land, provided that an acceptable security is posted to cover the estimated fee-in-lieu of dedication payment for the parkland deficit to be covered by land dedication outside of the development. If the land outside development is not or only partially provided, a fee-in-lieu of dedication payment shall be made at the level in effect for the year payment is made. 
(3)  Reservation of public sites and open spaces. In designing a land division, subdivision or comprehensive development, due consideration shall be given to the reservation of suitable sites of adequate area for future schools, parks, playgrounds, drainageways, and other public purposes. In the location of such, consideration shall be given to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands for fine trees, marshes, lakes and ponds, watercourses, watersheds, and ravines. The subdivider may be required to reserve such school, park, recreation and public use areas for a period not to exceed five years for acquisition by the city, or in the case of school areas by the school district, at undeveloped land costs. 
(e)  Survey monuments. Before final approval of any plat or certified survey map, the subdivider shall install survey monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15 and as may be required by the city engineer. The common council may waive the placing of monuments, required under Wis. Stats. § 236.15(1)(b), (c) and (d), for a reasonable time on condition that the subdivider execute a surety bond to ensure the placing of such monuments within the time required. 
(f)  Land suitability. No land shall be divided which the plan commission determines to be unsuitable for use by reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the future residents of the proposed land division or of the community. The plan commission, in applying the provisions of this section, shall recite in writing the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for the proposed use and shall afford the subdivider an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence regarding such unsuitability. Therefore the plan commission may affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability. 
(g)  Outlots. No outlot in a subdivision or land division may be used as a building site, unless it is dedicated to the public for a specified public purpose, and it is in compliance with all restrictions imposed by Wis. Stats. ch. 236 and the provisions of this chapter. An outlot may be conveyed whether or not it may be used as a building site. When an outlot is created for a public purpose, the outlot shall be dedicated for that purpose. In certain situations, some outlots, such as, but not limited to, stormwater management facilities, a private transportation corridor (such as alleys) may be required by the public works director, due to their serving a part of a land division, subdivision, or land development, to be owned in common by the benefitting lots with maintenance and other agreements acceptable to the city engineer, city planner, and city attorney put in place. 
(h)  Violations. It shall be unlawful to build upon, divide, convey, record or monument any land in violation of this chapter or of state law; and no person, partnership, corporation, or legal entity of any sort shall be issued a building permit by the city authorizing the building on, or improvement of, any land division, subdivision, or replat within the jurisdiction of this chapter not of record as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived until the provisions and requirements of this chapter have been fully met. The city may institute appropriate action or proceedings to enjoin violations of this chapter or applicable state law. 
(i)  Penalties. See forfeitures schedule in chapter 70 for penalties for any person who fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(j)  Staging. Where public improvements will not be completed within 18 months the subdivider shall prepare a staging plan, for approval by the plan commission, for any land division, subdivision, or land development. The phasing plan shall clearly delineate in map, tabular and text form the following: 
(1)  The number of phases. 
(2)  Specific public improvements, lots, outlots or other land to be improved or affected by each phase. 
(3)  For each phase, expected start of construction (month and year), duration (number of months), with a schedule of public improvement installation detailing grading, underground work, street work, and related amenities such as, but not limited to sidewalks, street lighting, and street trees. 
(4)  A review of other land division improvement areas currently active within the city with a discussion of how this project will be phased, in light of the other projects to meet the requirements of the comprehensive plan. 
(5)  Portions of a land division or subdivision that are not scheduled for public improvement installation within four years shall be platted as outlots. These outlots may be replatted at a later date. The initial preliminary plat, however, shall indicate all lots appropriate to intended uses, and indicate what areas are to be an outlot(s) for staging. The final plat shall provide the outlot(s) for staging. Except for land zoned SmartCode, under chapter 23, an approved preliminary plat shall be required prior to a final plat, to replat any outlot. 
(6)  Existing structures on outlots for future development shall be considered existing nonconforming. 
(7)  Parkland dedication and fees shall not be required for outlots created for staging purposes, but shall be required upon replat, zoning or development. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 15.02, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2012-O-06, § 1, 6-12-2012)  
Sec. 24-3. - Procedure. 
(a)  Preapplication. Prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat, or certified survey, the subdivider shall consult with the plan commission to obtain their advice and assistance, to be informed of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, consistency with the comprehensive plan, zoning to be used, and of any plan implementation devices, and to be otherwise assisted in planning the subdivision or land division. 
(b)  Preliminary plat review. 
(1)  Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and a written application for approval, and shall file ten copies and one electronic copy in a format acceptable to the planning department of the plat and the application with the city clerk at four weeks prior to the meeting of the plan commission at which action is desired. The subdivider shall also forward a copy to the local electric and telephone utilities. When the subdivider expects the city to act as the transmitting authority in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 236.12, the application shall state that the transmittal responsibility lies with the city, shall contain a list of the other authorities to which the plat must be submitted, and shall be accompanied by such additional fees and copies of the plat as are necessary to be transmitted to such authorities. If a comprehensive development plan is required under subsection (f) of this section such plan shall have been approved by the common council prior to the filing of a preliminary plat. 
(2)  The preliminary plat shall cover the entire area owned or controlled by the subdivider even though only a small portion thereof is proposed for development at the time, and shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter. 
(3)  The clerk shall forward two copies of the preliminary plat to the plan commission which shall examine it for conformity with the requirements of this chapter and with the requirements of any other ordinances, statutes or administrative rules and regulations, and for compliance with the comprehensive plan. 
(4)  The plan commission shall recommend approval or conditional approval of the plat to the common council or shall reject the plat. If approval or conditional approval is recommended, the preliminary plat shall be referred to the common council for consideration. The common council shall then approve, conditionally approve, or reject the preliminary plat. One copy of the plat shall be returned to the subdivider, his/her surveyor, or engineer with the date and action endorsed thereon; and if approved conditionally or rejected, the conditions of approval or reasons for rejection shall be endorsed thereon or attached thereto. Unless the time is extended by written agreement between the subdivider and the common council, failure to complete the action herein required within 90 days of filing of the preliminary plat shall constitute an approval of the preliminary plat. 
(5)  Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall entitle the final plat to approval provided the final plat conforms substantially to the preliminary, including any conditions of that approval, conforms to any applicable local plans and ordinances, and is submitted within six months of the last required approval of the preliminary plat. 
(c)  Final plat review. 
(1)  The subdivider shall prepare and file ten copies and one electronic copy in a format acceptable to the planning department of the final plat together with a written application for approval with the city clerk within 36 months of the last required approval of the preliminary plat and at least four weeks prior to the meeting of the plan commission at which action is desired. When the subdivider expects the city to act as the transmitting authority in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 236.12, the application shall state that transmittal responsibilities lie with the city, shall contain a list of the other authorities to which the plat must be submitted, and shall be accompanied by such additional fees and copies of the plat as are necessary to be transmitted to such authorities. 
(2)  The clerk shall forward two copies of the plat to the plan commission. The plan commission shall examine it for conformity with the preliminary plat, with the requirements of this chapter, and with the requirements of any other ordinances, statutes or administrative rules and regulations which may be applicable to it. 
(3)  The plan commission shall recommend approval of the final plat to the common council or shall reject the plat. If approval is recommended, the final plat shall be referred to the common council for consideration. The common council shall then approve or reject the final plat. One copy of the plat shall then be returned to the subdivider, his/her surveyor, or engineer with the date and action endorsed thereon, and if approved conditionally or rejected, the conditions for approval or reasons for rejection shall be endorsed thereon or attached thereto. Unless the time is extended by written agreement between the subdivider and the plan commission or common council, failure to complete the action required herein within 60 days of filing the final plat shall constitute an approval of the final plat. 
(4)  The final plat shall be entitled to approval provided it conforms substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, including any conditions of that approval, and conforms with any applicable city plans and ordinances. If the final plat is not submitted within six months of the last required approval of the preliminary plat, the plan commission shall reject the final plat regardless of the prior action taken on the preliminary plat. 
(5)  The subdivider shall file a certified copy of the final plat with the clerk within ten days after it has been recorded. 
(d)  Replats. 
(1)  When it is proposed to replat a recorded subdivision, or part thereof, so as to change its boundaries or any part thereof, the person wishing to replat shall vacate or alter the recorded plat as provided in Wis. Stats. §§ 236.40 through 236.44 and shall then proceed as specified in sections 24-3 through 24-7. 
(2)  Whenever a preliminary plat of a replat is filed, the plan commission shall schedule and hold a public hearing before it acts on the plat. Notices of the proposed replat and public hearing shall be mailed, at the subdivider's expense, to the owners of all properties within the limits of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat and to the owners of all properties adjacent to the proposed replat. 
(3)  Replats conducted in areas zoned SmartCode, under chapter 23, shall not require a preliminary plat. 
(e)  Land divisions by certified survey. 
(1)  A certified survey map application may be filed with the city clerk four weeks prior to the desired plan commission meeting. Such certified survey map shall meet all of the requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.34 and of this chapter, and may be utilized to create not more than four parcels or building sites. The plan commission may require a preliminary plat to be filed by a subdivider who is seeking approval of a certified survey map. When required, the preliminary plat must include the entire parcel of land owned or controlled by the subdivider. When a preliminary plat is not required, the certified survey map shall include the entire parcel owned by the subdivider/land divider. The subdivider/land divider shall comply with the requirements of sections 24-9 and 24-10 when a certified survey map is used unless a waiver to the requirements of section 24-9 has been granted pursuant to section 24-9(g). Upon approval by the common council a certification of the approval of the certified survey map by the common council shall be inscribed legibly on the face of the map. All outstanding special assessments shall be paid prior to approval unless determined otherwise by the common council. 
(2)  The applicant for a land division shall file ten copies and one electronic copy in a format acceptable to the planning department of a certified survey map and a written application for approval with the clerk. 
(3)  The clerk shall transmit copies of the map to the city engineer, the building inspector, and, when public sanitary sewers are not available, to the city or county health officer who shall review it for conformance with the provisions of this chapter, and any applicable master plans, ordinances, statutes, rules or regulations and submit their report and recommendations to the plan commission within 21 days from the date of transmission. 
(4)  The plan commission shall recommend approval of the map to the common council or shall reject the map. If approval is recommended, the map shall be referred to the common council for consideration. The common council shall then approve or reject the map. One copy of the map shall be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon; and if approved conditionally or rejected, the conditions of approval or reasons for rejection shall be endorsed thereon or attached thereto. Unless the time is extended by written agreement between the subdivider and the common council, failure to complete the action required herein within 90 days of the filing of the map shall constitute an approval of the map. 
(5)  The subdivider shall record the certified survey map with the register of deeds for the county after it has been approved, and shall file a certified copy of the recorded map with the clerk within ten days after the map is recorded. 
(6)  No building permits shall be issued and no improvements may be made until the approved certified survey map is recorded and agreement for subdivision improvements is signed and recorded. 
(7)  Where land outside the urban service area is subject to a land division, the common council, upon recommendation of the plan commission may waive the necessity of identifying land under the control of the subdivider that is on the opposite side of a road or railroad right-of-way from the area where the new lot is to be created, and provided that it is at least 35 acres not divided by a road or railroad right-of-way. The waiver shall be requested in writing, and made with the land division application. 
(f)  Comprehensive development plans. 
(1)  A comprehensive development plan shall be required upon any of the following: 
a.  The subdivider has a contiguous parcel of 35 acres or more of land under his/her control. The land may be in one or more parcels, including parcels only separated by roads, streets, highways or railroad rights-of-way, except where the road, street, highway, or railroad right-of-way has fragmented, at the edge of the parcel, creating an individual parcel that is less than eight acres in size. 
b.  When a rural cluster land development is proposed, a comprehensive development plan of the full rural land holdings shall be provided. 
c.  Where a land division or subdivision is 35 acres or less, but it is estimated that installation of public improvements will take more than four years. 
d.  The plan commission may require a comprehensive development plan for a project if it involves land less than 35 acres if the proposed land division, land development or subdivision is in a future urban growth area as identified in the comprehensive plan that has not been added to the urban service area. Projects proposed in a future urban growth area shall have preliminary review by the plan commission prior to submittal of any land division or preliminary plat to ascertain the commission intent. 
e.  A comprehensive development plan is not required for areas using SmartCode zoning under chapter 23. 
f.  A comprehensive development plan is not required for areas developed following the rural residential development criteria contained within the comprehensive plan, unless required by the plan commission.

One copy of the CDP shall be returned to the subdivider with the date and action endorsed thereon and if approved conditionally or rejected, the conditions of approval or reasons for rejection shall be endorsed thereon or attached thereto. Unless the time is extended by written agreement between the subdivider and the city, failure to complete the action required herein within 120 days of the filing of the CDP shall constitute an approval of CDP. 
(5)  The subdivider shall record the CDP, together with the exhibits, within three months after it has been approved by the common council and shall file a certified copy of the CDP with the clerk after it has been recorded. Unless recorded within the required time, the CDP approval shall be deemed withdrawn.

(1)  Arterial streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready access to centers of employment, centers of governmental activity, community shopping areas, community recreation, and points beyond the boundaries of the community. They shall also be properly integrated with and related to the existing and proposed system of major streets and highways and shall be, insofar as practicable, continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets with which they are to connect. 
(2)  Collector streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of traffic from residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway system and shall be properly related to the mass transportation system, to special traffic generators such as schools, churches, shopping centers and other concentrations of population, and to the major streets into which they feed. 
(3)  Local streets shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. 
(4)  Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the plan commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. Temporary turnarounds may be required where the street ends at the boundary of the subdivision. 
(5)  Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a major street or highway, adequate protection of residential properties, limitation of access and separation of through and local traffic shall be provided by reversed frontage, with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, or by the use of frontage streets. 
(6)  Stream or lake shores shall have 60 feet of public access platted to the low water mark at intervals of not more than one-half mile as required Wis. Stats. § 236.16(3). The city shall not be required to improve any lands provided for public access pursuant to this subsection.

(1)  Street names and building numbers shall be assigned in accordance with the numbering sequence in use by the city. 
(2)  Duplication of existing street names in the Madison Metropolitan area by similar word, spelling, or sound shall not be permitted. 
(3)  Where a street maintains the same general direction except for curvilinear changes for short distances, the same name shall continue for the entire length of the street. House numbering difficulties shall be considered the determining factor in considering whether a change of name is necessary due to curvilinear changes. 
(4)  A street name shall be changed when required to conform to the proposed or existing house numbering base. 
(5)  A name which is assigned to a street which is not presently a through street, due to intervening land over which the street extension is planned, shall be continued for the separate portions of the planned through street. 
(6)  The following designations shall be used only in the situations indicated: 
a.  Boulevard: A street with a divided pavement either existing or planned. If the divided pavement ends, but the street continues, the same street name and suffix shall continue. 
b.  Lane: A street, one block long, not ending in a cul-de-sac. 
c.  Circle: A cul-de-sac of nine lots or more. 
d.  Court: A cul-de-sac of eight lots or less. 
e.  Parkway: A street abutting a park or greenway or creek. 
f.  Way: A private street. 
(7)  The maximum number of street names at one intersection shall be three. 
(8)  Street names shall be assigned so that no two intersections have the same exact street names, except for loop streets approved as part of a land division. 
(9)  The name of any projection of a street shall remain unchanged even if the projection terminates in a cul-de-sac. 
(10)  The changing of a street name that does not duplicate an existing street name shall only be approved where such change will eliminate conflicts with other provisions of this section. 
(11)  Service roads and highways served by them shall have the same street name and designation. 
(12)  Approval of street names on a preliminary plat will not reserve the names nor shall the city be required to accept such names at the time of final platting. 
(13)  A minimum number of letters is desirable in a street name. The maximum number of letters, not including the prefix or suffix shall not exceed 12. 
(c)  Limited access highways and railroad rights-of-way. Unless the area is subject to SmartCode zoning of chapter 23, whenever the proposed subdivision, land division, or comprehensive development plan contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, the design shall provide the following treatment: 
(1)  In residential districts a buffer strip at least 30 feet in depth, in addition to the normal lot depth required, shall be provided adjacent to a railroad right-of-way or a limited access arterial street. The lot depth required, including such buffer strip, shall not be less than 150 feet. The strip shall be a part of the platted lots, but shall have the following restrictions lettered on the face of the plat: 
"This strip reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owner; the building of structures hereon is prohibited, and the rear 30 feet of the strip shall not be counted as any required yard. Maintenance of this strip is a responsibility of the lot owner." 
(2)  Commercial and industrial districts shall have, on each side of the limited access highway or railroad, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway or railroad for the appropriate use of the land between such streets and highway or railroad, but not less than 150 feet. 
(3)  Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way shall, when intersecting a major street and highway or collector street which crosses said railroad or highway, be located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
(4)  The location of local streets immediately adjacent and parallel to railroad rights-of-way, and in residential areas immediately adjacent to arterial streets and highways and to railroad rights-of-way shall be avoided. 
(d)  Street design standards. 
(1)  Minimum right-of-way. The minimum right-of-way of all proposed streets and alleys shall be of the width specified by either the comprehensive plan or official map or if not so specified shall follow the provisions noted below.

(7)  Lots shall follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross them whenever practicable. 
(8)  Corner lots shall have sufficient width to permit adequate building setbacks from side streets. 
(9)  Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided and a proportion of 2 to 1 shall be considered as a desirable ratio under normal conditions. This provision shall not apply to areas zoned SmartCode under chapter 23. 
(10)  Lot drainage patterns shall be indicated on the plat and shall take into account flow conditions from off-site as well as outflow on to downstream properties. Any drainage system shall be constructed and designed to handle the volume and velocity of the off-site stormwater. Downstream drainage easements shall be provided as required to properly handle the flow. 
(11)  Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. 
(12)  Whenever a tract is subdivided into large parcels, such parcels shall be arranged and dimensioned as to allow the future division of any such parcel into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(13)  Lands lying between the meander line and the water's edge and any otherwise unplattable lands which lie between a proposed subdivision and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots, outlots or public dedications in any plat abutting a lake or stream.

The purpose of this restriction shall be to notify initial and future lot owners of the underground facilities at the time of purchase and to establish responsibility in the event of damage to such facilities or to the need to alter such facilities. When the utility company uses a service application, said application should also notify the initial and subsequent lot owners of their responsibility regarding such underground facilities. 
(5)  Drainage easement. Where a land division, subdivision or comprehensive development plan is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway. channel or stream, an adequate drainageway or easement shall be provided as required by the plan commission. The location, width, alignment and improvement of such drainageway or easement shall be subject to the approval of the plan commission and parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. Wherever possible, the stormwater drainage shall be maintained by landscaped open channels of adequate size and grade to hydraulically accommodate maximum potential volumes of flow, these sizes and design details to be subject to review and approval by the city engineer and plan commission. Where feasible, drainage easements should substantially maintain existing water flow patterns onto neighboring lands. If outflow is different than existing patterns the developer/subdivider shall provide all necessary easements and facilities to transport the water. 
(j)  Electromagnetic radiation fields. Consideration shall be given to the layout of the land division such that no residential structure or place of employment shall be located within 50 yards of a 69,000-volt or greater transmission line.

(b)  Sanitary sewers and water mains. 
(1)  Within urban service area. Where the development is within an urban service area and public utilities are available, sanitary sewers and water mains and all required appurtenances, including, when required by the board of public works, interceptors, force mains, lift stations, booster pumps, wells, and water main loops, shall be installed in all subdivisions and, where required, in any land division, in accordance with the plans approved and permit issued by the board of public works. Where the development is within the urban service area and public utilities are not available, sanitary sewers, water mains and all appurtenances necessary to extend and provide effective, efficient, safe and portable public water and sewer service to the development, as determined by the city engineer and approved by board of public works, shall be installed at the cost of the subdivider or developer. Costs of extensions of water and sewer services through undeveloped lands shall be recorded as special assessments against the benefitted properties and collected from developers or customers upon attachment to the system within 20 years of completion of construction of the improvements. 
(2)  Outside urban service area. Except for Rural Cluster zoning, no subdivision or multifamily development shall be approved for lands outside of an urban service area. 
(c)  Water supply system. 
(1)  Where a municipal water supply is not available, a closed loop water supply and distribution system capable of serving the entire subdivision designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 111, which regulations and any subsequent amendments thereto are incorporated herein and adopted by reference, shall be installed in all subdivisions notwithstanding the fact that the number of service connections may be less than 15. 
(2)  Prior to commencing construction of a water supply system, the subdivider shall obtain a permit from the board of public works and submit the proposed plans, specifications, construction schedule, and contract to the city engineer for review and approval. 
(d)  Storm sewers and stormwater drainage facilities. 
(1)  Storm sewers and all necessary stormwater transportation, detention or retention facilities to serve the plat as determined by the city engineer, shall be constructed or caused to be constructed, within or without the plat, by the subdivider/developer.

c.  Where ditches are utilized, concrete curb and gutter shall not be required and streets shall be constructed as indicated in figure 3. The thickness of the pavement shall be determined and prescribed by the city Engineer in accordance with the functional classification of the proposed street and soil subgrade data available. Any soil subgrade data required by the city engineer shall be obtained by the developer's soils engineer and furnished to the city engineer without cost. 
(3)  At the time of submittal to the plan commission of the comprehensive development plan, preliminary plat or plans for any condominium, group housing project or other development, the developer/subdivider shall submit a study of the drainage basin or sub-basin in which the plat or project is located showing the proposed design and routing of storm sewer and stormwater management facilities, such as detention ponds, retention ponds, greenways and/or other green infrastructure facilities necessary to provide adequate drainage, infiltration, evapotranspiration, or collection of stormwater to and from the plat or development if such a study has not already been previously prepared by the city engineer. If such study or any previous study or studies as approved by the city engineer determine that it is necessary to increase the capacity of stormwater facilities which are to be constructed within the plat or project to enable them to serve the entire basin or sub-basin of which the plat or development is a part, the developer or subdivider shall construct such facilities in accordance with a plan and specifications approved by the city engineer. The city engineer shall determine the incremental portion of the estimated cost of constructing the required storm sewers and stormwater management facilities which is attributable to future development in the basis or sub-basin on lands not owned or controlled by the subdivider/developer. The developer or subdivider shall be entitled to recover any portion of the costs of stormwater facilities attributable to future development as future developments occur from area changes levied by the city against developers and subdividers. Area changes shall be subject to adjustment based upon the Engineering News-Record construction price index using the year that the area charges for the drainage basin or sub-basin were established as the base year. A copy of the construction price index shall be kept on file at the office of the city engineer and made available to the public for inspection and copying upon request. 
(4)  The developer/subdivider shall pay any outstanding area charges levied pursuant to subsection (d)(3) or (5) of this section before the final plat is inscribed by the city clerk or before any building permit is issued. 
(5)  Where a study completed under subsection (d)(3) of this section determines that it is not necessary to increase the capacity of the facilities to be constructed in the plat or project to enable them to serve the entire basin or subbasin but that the stormwater generated from the plat or project will necessitate future stormwater improvements to lands outside of the plat or project, the city engineer shall determine what portion of the estimated cost of constructing the required storm sewers and stormwater drainage facilities outside the plat or project is attributable to the plat or project and the developer shall pay a stormwater charge in such amount prior to inscribing of the final plat by the city clerk. 
(e)  Improvements to boundary lines. All required street, sidewalk, sanitary sewer, water main, and storm sewer improvements shall be installed to the boundary line of the subdivision or land division unless the topography or other physical conditions make it impossible to do so. 
(f)  Partition fences. When the land included in the plat or certified survey map abuts upon or is adjacent to land used for farming or grazing purposes, the subdivider may be required to erect, keep and maintain partition fences, satisfying the requirements of the state law for a legal and sufficient fence, between such land and the adjacent land. When partition fences are required, a covenant binding the subdivider, its grantees, heirs, successors, and assigns to erect and maintain such fences, without cost to the adjoining property owners, so long as the land is used for farming or grazing purposes shall be included upon the face of the final plat or certified survey map. 
(g)  Waiver to section requirements. 
(1)  Where, in the judgment of the common council, it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of this section to a land division outside the urban service area because exceptional or undue hardship would result, the common council on recommendation of the plan commission may, subject to the following provisions, waive or modify the requirements of this section to the extent deemed just and proper. 
(2)  Such relief will be granted only where it will not be detrimental to the public good, impair the intent and purpose of this chapter, or impair the desirable general development of the community in accordance with the comprehensive plan. An affirmative vote of six members of the common council shall be required to grant any waiver or modification. 
(3)  Any waiver which is granted pursuant to this section shall be made in writing, shall state the reasons which justified it, and shall be filed with the records relating to the land division. 
(4)  The waiver allowed by this subsection may not be granted to subdivisions. 
(h)  Sidewalks. 
(1)  Sidewalks shall be installed to city specifications on all streets within the land division, except for: 
a.  Cul-de-sacs where such cul-de-sac has no dedicated land or easement for a recreation path or walkway. 
b.  Certified survey maps where the upgrading or installation of the streets within such certified survey map are not required to meet full city standards (e.g., curb and gutter) by the common council at the time of approval, or where there is no existing sidewalk system. 
(2)  For cul-de-sacs and for certified survey maps located in the urban service area, all driveways, unless exempted by the common council, shall contain a sidewalk cross-section and have all terraces graded to city specifications. 
(3)  For all lots not required by subsection (h)(1)a and (1)b of this section to have sidewalk, the land divider shall file with the city clerk, prior to recording of the plat or certified survey map, signed waivers of notice, hearing and right to contest future assessments for sidewalks under Wis. Stats. § 66.60 or 66.615 and this Code for such affected lots. Such waivers shall be recorded at the expense of the land divider. 
(4)  As used in subsection (i) of this section, street frontage shall include any and all improvements placed in the public right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the street, curb and gutter and sidewalk improvements. 
(5)  Areas zoned to the SmartCode District under chapter 23 shall not be subject to this section, but instead shall provide sidewalks in accordance with the SmartCode District, chapter 23. 
(i)  Street frontage for dedicated parkland. 
(1)  Street frontage for dedicated parklands shall be provided and paid for by the developer or subdivider in the amount of 150 lineal feet of frontage or in accord with the following, whichever is greater. 
a.  For development projects or land divisions of less than 80 dwelling units, the developer or subdivider shall provide frontage in accord with the following table: 
Single-family residential 	6.0 lineal feet per dwelling unit 
Two-family residential 	3.0 lineal feet per dwelling unit 
Multifamily 	0.75 lineal feet per dwelling unit 
 
b.  For development projects or land divisions of 80 or more dwelling units, lineal street frontage shall be provided in accord with the following: 
Single-family 	Square root of the square footage required to be dedicated 
Two-family 	Square root of the square footage required to be dedicated with this factor multiplied by 0.50 
Multifamily 	Square root of the square footage required to be dedicated with this factor then multiplied by 0.13 
 
(2)  The council, upon receiving a recommendation from the parks commission and plan commission, shall have the authority to allow alternative dimensions for frontages and the park if it can be found that the objectives of access and visibility can be fulfilled. 
(3)  In calculating the required frontage for multifamily residential projects the maximum number of two bedroom units allowed under the zoning ordinance shall be used unless a different number is committed to by agreement with the city or by city approved deed restriction. 
(4)  Areas zoned to the SmartCode District, and which meet the minimum acreage for the specific community unit type in chapter 23 shall not be subject to this section, but instead shall provide and install street frontage as required for all civic or open space lands through the approved regulating plan. For situations where the community unit type is less than the required minimum size in chapter 23, the above regulations of this subsection (i) shall apply. 
(j)  Street trees. 
(1)  The subdivider/developer of any land division requiring public street improvements shall, prior to installation of any public improvements, prepare a street tree planting plan to be approved by the city engineer. The tree planting plan shall, at a minimum, provide one street tree for every lot, or for every 80 feet of street frontage (whichever produces the greater number of trees), with the trees being a minimum of two-inch caliper. 
(2)  The subdivider/developer shall notice the existence of the planting plan to lot owners by deed restriction and through other measures the developer may deem appropriate. 
(3)  Upon substantial installation and completion of homes and yards within any phase of the improvements for the plat or certified survey map (CSM), the developer in consultation with the city engineer shall cause the installation of the street trees. The final tree location and species, which shall be approved by the city engineer, shall recognize existing trees, driveways, utility facilities, streetlights, signs and other similar features. The trees shall be guaranteed by the developer for at least one year from the date of planting. If less than 50 percent of the original canopy survives, the city engineer may recommend replacement. 
(4)  Upon acceptance of the last phase of subdivision improvements (or where no phasing, the acceptance of the improvements), the developer shall post a letter of credit, or other acceptable measures of security equal to the estimated cost of the remaining street trees to be installed as a guarantee to the city that the developer will undertake such improvements. 
(5)  Where the upgrading or installation of a street under a CSM or plat is not required to meet full city standards by the common council at the time of approval, the street trees need not be installed. However, the developer/subdivider shall, prior to signing the CSM or plat, provide signed waivers of notice, hearing, and right to contest future assessments for street trees under Wis. Stats. § 66.60 or 66.615 and this Code for all such affected lots. Such waivers shall be recorded. 
(6)  In regard to section 24-16, it is the intent to require street trees along public or private streets at a minimum level or number noted in subsection (j)(1) of this section. However, such trees may be located in a more varied and nonlinear manner that would complement the proposed development. The planting locations and species are to be determined at the time of city approvals for the specific implementation plan (under PDD zoning) or the conditional use. Agreements or conditions shall provide for proper installation of the street trees. 
(7)  Subdivider/developer shall reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city to institute these street tree requirements, including any consulting costs incurred in review of the tree plan. 
(8)  Areas zoned to the SmartCode District shall not be subject to this section, but instead shall provide street trees as required by the SmartCode District, chapter 23. 
(Ord. No. 2010-O-09, § 15.09, 10-12-2010; Ord. No. 2012-O-18, § 3, 12-11-2012; Ord. No. 2014-O-06, § 1, 3-25-2014; Ord. No. 2018-O-38, § 1, 11-27-2018)  
Sec. 24-10. - Required improvements procedure. 
(a)  Plans and construction specifications. Prior to commencing construction of any required improvement, the subdivider shall prepare construction plans and specifications and submit them to the city engineer for review and approval. The city engineer may require the submission of the following plans and accompanying construction specifications before authorizing construction or installation of the improvements: 
(1)  Street plans and profiles showing existing and proposed grades, elevations and cross sections of required improvements. 
(2)  Sanitary sewer plans and profiles showing the locations, grades, sizes, elevations and materials of required facilities.

(8)  Such additional special plans or information as may be required by the city engineer. 
(b)  Private contracts. The developer shall engage one general contractor whose qualifications have been approved by the city engineer for each major phase of construction (grading, utilities, streets) or one general contractor for a contract which includes more than one phase of construction. No private contract shall be awarded until all bids have been reviewed by the city engineer. 
(c)  Scheduling. The construction schedule for all required improvements shall be approved by the city engineer. Construction cannot be commenced on any phase of construction until all approvals and conditional requirements are satisfied and a copy of the private contract has been filed with and approved by the council. In addition, a preconstruction meeting shall be held prior to commencement of any work. 
(d)  Street grading. 
(1)  The developer shall furnish standard drawings which indicate the existing and proposed grades of streets shown on the plat, and after review of design engineering work on the streets and approval of street grades by the city engineer, the subdivider shall grade or cause to be graded the full width of the right-of-way of the streets proposed to be dedicated, including the vision clearance triangle on corner lots. In those cases where existing street right-of-way is made a part of the subdivider's plat or abuts the plat, he/she shall grade or cause to be graded that portion of the right-of-way between the existing pavement and the property line. The bed for the roadways in the street right-of-way shall be graded to subgrade elevation. The city engineer shall approve all grading within rights-of-way and said grading shall extend for a sufficient distance beyond the right-of-way to ensure that the established grade will be preserved. The grading of rights-of-way for principal and primary arterials shall only be required where necessary to provide access to the streets or lots in the plat. Lots which abut principal and primary arterials shall be graded to proposed street grade or to a grade approved by the city engineer prior to the sale of affected properties. 
(2)  The developer shall engage a registered engineer to set sub-base grade in accordance with approved centerline grade and cross section; and to set grades necessary to comply with other grading requirements, including vision clearance on corner lots, centerline and lot line grades for greenways, terrace grading for abutting streets and other required grades. The grading program shall consist of the following elements: 
a.  The stripping and removal of all topsoil, debris and vegetation within the road bed. 
b.  Grading of full street rights-of-way to a tolerance of zero to 0.5 feet below proposed centerline grade. Fill sections shall be constructed of approved materials, which do not include topsoil, debris, or vegetation. 
c.  Grading beyond right-of-way to ensure that the established grade will be preserved. Slopes shall be 1:1 for cut sections and 2:1 or less for fill sections. 
d.  Grading of vision clearance triangle on corner lots (maximum embankment of three feet above curb elevation within a triangle formed by two intersection street lines or their projections and a line joining points on such street lines located 25 feet from the street intersection). 
e.  Where a public greenway is included in the land division or subdivision, the subdivider shall provide for an acceptable continuous drainageway in the greenway as determined by the city engineer. 
f.  All additional plat grading, where applicable, lot abutting greenways, terraces of streets abutting plat, public easements for sanitary sewer and sidewalk, and other requirements of ordinances and special conditions of plat approval. 
g.  Compliance with chapter 30, article II, erosion control and stormwater management. 
(e)  Utilities and underground facilities. 
(1)  Upon approval of the subgrading and erection of barricades, the developer shall install the water mains, storm and sanitary sewers, and other utilities. Prior to commencing construction of any required utilities, the subdivider shall submit the construction schedule, plans, and specifications therefor, to the city engineer for review and approval and shall furnish proof that such arrangements as may be required under applicable rates and rules filed with the state public service commission have been made with the owner or owners of the utility lines or services for placing their respective facilities underground. 
(2)  All new electric distribution lines (excluding lines of 12,000 volts or more), all new telephone lines from which lots are individually served, all new telegraph lines, television cables and services, installed within a newly platted area shall be underground unless the plan commission shall specifically find after study that: 
a.  Location, topography, soil, water table, solid rock, boulders, stands of trees, hedges or other physical conditions would make underground installation unreasonable or impracticable; or 
b.  The lots to be served by said facilities can be served directly from existing overhead facilities. 
(3)  Associated equipment and facilities which are appurtenant to underground electric and communications systems, such as but not limited to, substations, pad-mounted transformers, pad-mounted sectionalizing switches and above-grade pedestal-mounted terminal boxes may be located above ground. 
(4)  Temporary overhead facilities may be installed to serve a construction site or where necessary because of severe weather conditions. In the latter case, within a reasonable time after weather conditions have moderated or upon completion of installation of permanent underground facilities, such temporary facilities shall be replaced by underground facilities and the temporary facilities removed unless an exception is granted by the plan commission. 
(5)  Where the electric and communications facilities are to be installed underground, the utility easements shall be graded to within six inches of final grade by the subdivider, prior to the installation of such facilities, and earth fill, piles or mounds of dirt shall not be stored on such easement areas. Utility facilities when installed on utility easements whether overhead or underground shall not disturb any monumentation in the plat. 
(6)  Mechanical compaction of all underground utility ditches or trenches situated within the street right-of-way is required. 
(7)  Ornamental streetlights as prescribed by the city engineer shall be installed at locations identified in the subdivision contract. SmartCode zoned areas shall provide streetlights as allowed and approved under chapter 23. 
(f)  Greenways. Where greenways are included within the land division or subdivision: 
(1)  The subdivider shall be responsible for an acceptable continuous drainageway through the proposed plat as determined by the city engineer. The subdivider shall furnish the city engineer with a plan outlining the greenway boundaries and location of existing drainageways, if any. In addition, the subdivider shall furnish to the city engineer a set of cross sections (on 50-foot stations) of the greenway oriented upon a base line as prescribed by the city engineer. Where a natural drainageway exists which has acceptable hydraulic capacities including alignment and grade as determined by the city engineer, construction will not be required and the existing natural growth shall be preserved. Where such natural growth is not preserved by action of the subdivider or subdivider's agent, he or she shall be responsible for repairing the disturbed areas by sodding. However, in certain locations, as determined by the city engineer, where the hydraulic capacities including alignment and grade are not acceptable, such alignment, grade and slopes shall be improved by the subdivider to the interim minimum requirements of a ten-foot wide ditch bottom with four to one side slopes, all to be sodded. 
(2)  The subdivider shall install permanent pipes or culverts at a grade designated by the city engineer under all streets crossing a greenway or drainageway. Said installation shall be in accordance with the standard specifications for road and bridge construction of the state department of transportation. All costs of the installation shall be the responsibility of the subdivider. The permanent pipe or culvert shall not be installed previous to the installation of the sanitary sewer on a street crossing a greenway unless done pursuant to written agreement between the city and the subdivider. Culverts required across intersections for temporary street drainage, shall be furnished and installed by the developer at his or her expense. All temporary culverts installed by the developer shall be completely removed when the streets are constructed to standards and the area restored to as near to original condition as possible as determined by the city engineer. 
(3)  All ditching and culvert installation shall be done in strict accordance with grades approved by the city engineer. The subdivider's engineer shall be responsible for setting the required grades in the field for construction purposes. 
(4)  In order to ensure proper drainage, the ground elevation along any lot line common with the boundary of a greenway shall not be less than four feet above the flowline of the greenway, or where designated to an elevation established by the city engineer, prior to the sale of affected properties. The flowline grade shall be established by the city engineer. All lot grading and building elevations shall provide for positive drainage. Grading or filling within the greenway limit is prohibited except as authorized by the city engineer. 
(g)  Street construction. 
(1)  Generally. After completion of the underground utilities and approval thereof, the streets shall be constructed. 
(2)  Standard street improvements. 
a.  Standard street improvements shall include concrete curb and gutter, bituminous base course and bituminous surface course; and when required by the plan commission ornamental streetlights, pedestrian walkways, and curb ramping as required by Wis. Stats. § 66.616 for all streets in the plat and all connector and feeder streets and intersections serving the plat. 
b.  The construction of standard street improvements can begin only when the construction of underground utilities, including mechanical compaction and compaction tests, has been approved by the city engineer. 
c.  The developer/subdivider's engineer shall determine and prescribe the thickness of the pavement in accordance with the functional classification of the proposed street and soil subgrade data subject to the approval of the city engineer. In no case shall the thickness of asphalt be less than four inches on 12 inches of stone. The first 2¼ inches of asphalt shall be applied in the initial construction phase, with the final 1¾ inches applied approximately one year after the completion of the initial 2¼-inch paving. 
d.  Upon written approval by the city engineer, the developer may proceed with the construction of the standard street improvements. Standard street improvements shall be installed to the boundary line of the subdivision unless the street culminates in a cul-de-sac, the topography or other physical conditions make it impossible to do so. Streets, roadways, and alleys constructed in areas zoned SmartCode, under chapter 23 shall follow the prescribed street type in the approved regulating plan. 
1.  Streets shall be constructed in accordance with the city standard specifications for public works construction, latest edition on file with the city engineer's office. Local streets shall be constructed to a width of 32 feet between face of curb and face of curb. However, a greater width may be required by the city engineer where necessary to ensure uniformity to an existing street due to or based on anticipated traffic or land use (e.g., 36-foot-wide streets for duplex or multifamily lots). A lesser road width may be approved but only where necessary to ensure uniformity of street width connection to an existing street. 
2.  The roadway width for collector and arterial streets shall be as prescribed by the city engineer based upon anticipated land use, traffic volume, and any applicable federal, state or county requirements. 
e.  Driveways. 
1.  Driveway regulations as identified in chapter 27, article IV, driveways and street access, shall be complied with.

Drainage structures should not be located between a curb ramp and the corner of a street or immediately downgrade from a curb ramp. 
3.  Lighting. Lighting along walkways shall vary from one-half to five footcandles, depending on the intensity of pedestrian use, hazards present, and relative need for personal safety. 
4.  Ramps. Steps and stepped ramps shall be avoided if possible in order to facilitate servicing with wheeled vehicles. To facilitate movement over low barriers, a ramp should be installed. Surfaces should be nonslip but not corrugated. 
5.  Wheel stops. Wheel stops shall be installed where wheeled vehicles may roll into a hazardous area. They should be two inches to three inches high, six feet wide, and should have breaks in them every five feet to ten feet to allow for water drainage off of the walk. 
(h)  Erosion control. Erosion control measures shall comply with chapter 30, article II, erosion control and stormwater management. 
(i)  Inspection. Prior to commencing any work within the subdivision, the subdivider shall make arrangements with the city engineer to provide for adequate inspection. The city engineer shall inspect and approve all completed work prior to the city's acceptance of the improvements or any release of the security deposited pursuant to section 24-2(c).

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 27-148. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  In the exercise of governmental functions, the city has priority over all uses of the public rights-of-way. The city desires to anticipate and minimize the number of obstructions and excavations taking place therein and to regulate the placement of facilities in the rights-of-way to ensure that the rights-of-way remain available for public services and safe for public use. The taxpayers of the city bear the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way and a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is the frequent use of such rights-of-way. 
(b)  The city finds increased use of the public rights-of-way and increased costs to the taxpayers of the city and that these costs are likely to continue into the foreseeable future. 
(c)  The city finds that occupancy and excavation of its rights-of-way causes costs to be borne by the city and its taxpayers, including but not limited to: 
(1)  Administrative costs associated with public right-of-way projects, such as registration, permitting, inspection and supervision, supplies and materials. 
(2)  Management costs associated with ongoing management activities necessitated by public right-of-way users. 
(3)  Repair or restoration costs to the roadway associated with the actual excavation into the public right-of-way. 
(4)  Degradation costs defined as depreciation caused to the roadway in terms of decreased useful life, due to excavations into the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  In response to the foregoing facts, the city hereby enacts this article relating to the administration of and permits to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public rights-of-way. This article imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. This article also imposes reasonable restrictions on the placement of obstructions or other use of rights-of-way. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. 
(e)  The purpose of this article is to provide the city with a legal framework within which to regulate and manage the public rights-of-way and to provide for the recovery of the costs incurred in doing so. This article provides for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city as they use the rights-of-way of the city, as well as ensuring the structural integrity of the public rights-of-way.

Sec. 29-99. - Standards from grant or denial. 
In determining whether to grant approval of any application for alteration, construction or removal, the commission shall consider the following standards: 
(1)  Interiors. In general, the commission shall not regulate or find cause to deny an application for a certificate of appropriateness if the alternation or construction proposed for the interior of a structure does not affect the exterior of the structure. 
(2)  Height. All additions shall be no higher than the existing or original building. 
(3)  Second exit platforms. Second exit platforms shall not be applied to the front or side of a building, unless they are not visible from the street. 
(4)  Solar apparatus. Passive and active solar apparatus will be allowed only if such devices do not detract from the architectural integrity of the building and are as unobtrusive as possible. Solar apparatus will not be permitted if such devices hide from street view significant architectural features of the building or neighboring building, if their installation requires the loss of significant architectural features, or if they are of such a large scale that they become a major feature of the design. 
(5)  Repairs. Repairs in materials that exactly duplicate the original in composition, texture and appearance are encouraged. Repairs in new materials that duplicate the original in texture and appearance are also permitted. Repairs in materials that do not duplicate the original in appearance will be permitted on an individual basis if the repairs are compatible with the character and materials of the existing structure and if repairs that duplicate the original in appearance are prohibitively expensive. 
(6)  Restoration. Projects that will return the appearance of the building to an earlier appearance are encouraged and will be permitted if such projects are documented by photographs, architectural or archaeological research or other suitable evidence. 
(7)  Residing with aluminum or vinyl. Residing with aluminum or vinyl that replaces clapboards or nonoriginal siding on buildings originally sided with clapboards will be permitted only of the new siding imitates the width of the original siding within one inch, provided that all architectural details (such as window trim, wood cornices, and ornament) either remain uncovered or are duplicated exactly in appearance. Siding that imitates wood graining may be permitted. If more than one layer of siding exists on the building, all layers except the first must be removed before new siding is applied. If insulation is applied under the new siding, all trim must be built up so that it projects from the siding as in the original. 
(8)  Storms, screens and storm doors. The repair and retention of original storms, screens and storm doors, or the replacement of same with new units that duplicate the original in materials and appearance is encouraged. Replacements with nonoriginal materials, such as combination metal components, may also be permitted. If metal components are used, owners are encouraged to use metal components which have been factory enameled. Painting of raw aluminum storms after a year of weathering of the finish is encouraged. Storm doors that imitate a specific style shall be permitted only if the style matches the style of the building. 
(9)  Addition and alterations. 
a.  The appearance of street facades of a building shall not be altered unless the design is sensitive to the historic character of the building. Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, materials, and character of the structure or site. 
b.  Whenever possible, new additions or alterations shall be done in such a manner that, if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
c.  Roof alterations, resulting in an increased building volume, to provide additional windows, headroom, or area are not permitted, unless such alterations return the structure to an original documented condition.

Sec. 30-21. - Legislative findings and intent. 
(a)  The city finds that construction site erosion and uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land disturbing and land development activities have significant adverse impacts upon regional water resources and the health, safety, property and general welfare of the community, and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, soil erosion and stormwater runoff can: 
(1)  Carry sediment, nutrients, pathogens, organic matter, heavy metals, toxins and other pollutants to regional lakes, streams and wetlands; 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses and a natural diversity of plant and animal life; 
(3)  Clog existing drainage systems, increasing maintenance problems and costs; 
(4)  Cause bank and channel erosion; 
(5)  Increase downstream flooding; 
(6)  Reduce groundwater recharge, which may diminish stream base flows and lower water levels in regional lakes, ponds and wetlands; 
(7)  Contaminate drinking water supplies; 
(8)  Increase risk of property damage and personal injury; and 
(9)  Cause damage to agricultural fields and crops. 
(b)  The city also finds that effective sediment and stormwater management depends on proper planning, design, and timely installation of conservation and management practices and their continuing maintenance. 
(c)  The purpose of this article is to set forth the minimum requirements for construction site erosion control and stormwater management that will diminish threats to public health, safety, public and private property and natural resources of the city. 
(d)  This article is intended to regulate construction site erosion and stormwater runoff, to accomplish the following objectives: 
(1)  Promote regional stormwater management by watershed; 
(2)  Minimize sedimentation, water pollution from nutrients, heavy metals, chemical and petroleum products and other contaminants, flooding and thermal impacts to the water resources of the city; 
(3)  Promote infiltration and groundwater recharge; 
(4)  Protect functional values of natural watercourses and wetlands; 
(5)  Provide a set of performance standards that are consistent with the standards set forth by the county; 
(6)  Achieve an appropriate reduction in sediment load rates to downstream waters compared to no controls for all new development, redevelopment, and street reconstruction; 
(7)  Ensure no increase in temperature of stormwater post-construction in order to protect cold water communities; 
(8)  Ensure no increase in the rate of surface water drainage from sites during or after construction; and 
(9)  Protect public and private property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion.

(b)  Stormwater management performance standards. Proposed design, suggested location and phased implementation of effective, practicable stormwater management measures for plans shall be designed, engineered and implemented to achieve the following results: 
(1)  Sediment control. 
a.  For new development, by design, one of the following methods shall be used: 
i.  Reduce total suspended solids load leaving the site by 80 percent, based on the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. This method requires the use of a continuous model such as SLAMM, P8 or equivalent, and the use of approved grain size distribution curves and rainfall data. These files are managed and maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and are available on its website. No person shall be required to exceed an 80 percent total suspended solids reduction, for the site as a whole, to meet the requirements of this subdivision. This analysis shall use approved procedures and shall assume no re-suspension of particles. 
ii.  Retain soil particles greater than five microns on the site, as measured during a one-year 24-hour storm event. This analysis shall use approved procedures and shall assume no re-suspension of particles. 
b.  For redevelopment, by design, one of the following methods shall be used: 
i.  Reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, total suspended solids load leaving the redeveloped site by 80 percent, based on the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. This method requires the use of a continuous model such as SLAMM, P8 or equivalent, and the use of approved grain size distribution curves and rainfall data. These files are managed and maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and are available on its website. No person shall be required to exceed a sixty (60) percent total suspended solids reduction, as compared to no controls, for new parking areas to meet the requirements of this section. This analysis shall use approved procedures and shall assume no re-suspension of particles. 
ii.  Retain soil particles greater than five microns on the site, as measured during a one-year 24-hour storm event. This analysis shall use approved procedures and shall assume no re-suspension of particles. 
(2)  Oil and grease control. For all stormwater plans for commercial or industrial developments and all other uses where the potential for pollution by oil or grease, or both, exists, the first 0.5 inches of runoff will be treated using the best oil and grease removal technology available. This requirement may be waived by the plan reviewer only when the applicant can demonstrate that installation of such practices is not necessary. 
(3)  Runoff rate control; hydrologic calculations. All runoff calculations shall be according to the methodology described in the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Technical Release 55, "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds" (commonly known as TR-55), or other methodology approved by the county conservationist. The maximum pre-development runoff curve number and minimum post-development runoff curve numbers that may be used in the calculations are shown in section 30-35. The post-development soil permeability class for heavily disturbed sites shall be lowered one permeability class unless deep tilling or similar practices have been implemented to restore soil structure to pre-developed conditions. Lightly disturbed areas require no permeability class modification. 
(4)  Runoff rate control; design standards. Except for redevelopment, all stormwater facilities shall be designed, installed and maintained to effectively accomplish the following: 
a.  Maintain pre-development peak runoff rates for the one-year, 24-hour storm event (2.5 inches over 24-hour duration). 
b.  Maintain pre-development peak runoff rates for the two-year, 24-hour storm event (2.9 inches over 24-hour duration). 
c.  Maintain pre-development peak runoff rates for the ten-year, 24-hour storm event (4.2 inches over 24-hour duration). 
d.  Maintain pre-development peak runoff rates for the 100-year, 24-hour storm event (6.0 inches over 24-hour duration). 
e.  Safely pass storm events in excess of the 100-year, 24-hour storm event (6.0 inches over 24 hours duration). 
(5)  Outlets. Discharges from new construction sites must have a stable outlet capable of carrying designed flow as required in subsection (b)(4) of this section, at a non-erosive velocity. Outlet design must consider flow capacity and flow duration. This requirement applies to both the site outlet and the ultimate outlet to stormwater conveyance or water body. 
(6)  Infiltration. The stormwater management plan shall include the following provisions and practices to increase the infiltration of runoff at sites outside of groundwater protection areas: 
a.  Residential development. For both residential and non-residential developments, design practices to infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that post-development infiltration volume shall be at least ninety percent (90%) of the pre-development infiltration volume, based upon average annual rainfall. If when designing appropriate infiltration systems, more than two percent (2%) of the site is required to be used as effective infiltration area, the applicant may alternately design infiltration systems and pervious surfaces to meet or exceed the estimated average annual recharge rate. The annual pre-development recharge rate shall be determined from the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey's 2012 report, Groundwater Recharge in Dane County, Estimated by a GIS-Based Water-Balanced Model or subsequent updates to this report, or by a site specific analysis using other appropriate techniques. If this alternative design approach is taken, at least two percent (2%) of the site must be used for infiltration. 
b.  Internally Drained Watersheds. For both residential and non-residential sites located wholly or in part within an internally drained watershed, practices shall be designed to infiltrate one hundred percent (100%) of the average annual pre-development infiltration volume, regardless of the effective area of the infiltration system. 
c.  Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial, industrial and institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality. Pretreatment design shall be performed in accordance with the technical standards and specifications referenced in section 30-30. 
d.  Deep tilling or similar practices. Deep tilling or similar practices shall be implemented to restore soil structure to pre-developed conditions. The depth of tilling shall be at least two inches below the hardpan layer or compacted zone, as determined by a soil probe or soil penetrometer, up to a maximum depth of 36 inches. The maximum spacing of the cuts is five feet. 
e.  Prohibitions. Notwithstanding subsections (b)(6)a through d of this section, infiltration systems may not be installed in any of the following areas: 
1.  Areas associated with tier 1 industrial facilities identified in Wis. Admin. Code § NR 216.21(2)(a) including storage, loading, rooftop and parking. 
2.  Storage and loading areas of tier 2 industrial facilities identified in Wis. Admin. Code § NR 216.21(2)(b). 
3.  Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. 
4.  Areas within 1,000 feet up gradient or within 100 feet down gradient of direct conduits to groundwater. 
5.  Areas without proper separation distance from bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock. Infiltration practices shall be located so that the characteristics of the soil and the separation distances between the bottom of the infiltration system and the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock are in accordance with Table 1. below: 
Table 1. Separation Distances and Soil Characteristics 
Source Area 	Separation Distance 	Soil Characteristics 
Industrial, Commercial, Institutional, Parking Lots and Roads 	5 Feet or More 	Filtering Layer 
Residential Arterial Roads 	5 Feet or More 	Filtering Layer 
Roofs Draining to Subsurface Infiltration Practices 	1 Foot or More 	Native or Engineered Soil with Particles Finer than Coarse Sand 
Roofs Draining to Surface Infiltration Practices 	Not Applicable 	
All Other Impervious Source Areas 	3 Feet or More 	Filtering Layer 
 
6.  Areas with runoff from industrial, commercial and institutional parking lots and roads and residential arterial roads with less than five feet separation distance from the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock. 
7.  Areas within 400 feet of a community water system well as specified in Wis. Admin. Code § NR 811.16(4) for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices for residential development. 
8.  Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in Wis. Admin. Code § NR 720.03(2) are present in the soil through which infiltration will occur. 
f.  Alternate use of runoff. Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation, such alternate use shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this section. 
g.  Minimizing groundwater pollution. According to Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 151, infiltration systems designed in accordance with this section shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 140. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with the preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration system may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
(7)  Thermal control reduction. The stormwater management plan shall include provisions and practices to reduce the temperature of runoff for sites located within the watershed of a river or stream identified by the state department of natural resources as: 
a.  A cold water community as identified through Wis. Admin. Code § NR 102.04(3)(a), Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 104, and Class I, Class II, and Class III Trout Streams identified in "Wisconsin Trout Streams," DNR publication PUB-FH-806-2002 or its successor. 
b.  Rivers or streams proposed by the state department of natural resources as cold water communities and class I, II, and III trout streams. 
(8)  Thermal control continued. The stormwater management plan does not have to meet the requirement in subsection (b)(7) of this section if the applicant can justify by use of a model approved by the city engineer and the county conservationist that practices are not necessary because the temperature increase of runoff from the site post-development will be zero. 
(9)  Thermal control affected watersheds. A current list and maps of affected watersheds shall be available for reference at the office of the city engineer.

When additional customers are connected to the extended main within ten years of the date of completion, contributions in aid of construction will be collected equal to the amount which would have been assessed under subsection (a)(1) of this section for the abutting property being served. This amount will be refunded to the original contributor. 
(3)  In no case will the contributions received from additional customers exceed the proportionate amount which would have been required under subsection (a)(1) of this section nor will it exceed the total assessable cost of the original extension. 
(4)  When refunds have reduced the original contribution of any contributor to the applicable assessment amount, no further refund will be made to that individual.

(b)  Findings and purpose. The city finds that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond the city is a matter that affects the health, safety, and welfare of the city, its citizens and businesses, and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the city by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten residences and businesses with water damage, and create environmental damage to the streams and other water bodies within and adjacent to the city. The cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing the necessary repairs, replacements, improvements, and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the impact on and services received from the system. In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the city hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish the rates for stormwater management services. 
(c)  Applicability. This article applies to all parcels within the incorporated boundaries of the city. 
(d)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easement, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations, ordinances or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However, wherever this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall govern. 
(e)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by state law.

ARTICLE III. - RECYCLING STANDARDS AND PROCEDURE  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 41-49. - Findings. 
(a)  The common council of the city hereby finds and determines that: 
(1)  There is an increasing necessity to conserve natural resources, and to reduce the need for landfill space for the citizens of the city; 
(2)  Newspapers, glass, motor oil, aluminum and tin cans, white goods, plastics, mixed paper, office paper, containerboard, brush, and yard waste comprise a substantial portion of residential and business solid waste material; 
(3)  In an age of shortage, conservation of recyclable materials is an important public concern; 
(4)  Newspapers, glass, aluminum and tin cans, oil, white goods, plastic, mixed paper, office paper, containerboard, yard material, waste tires and lead-acid batteries are items which can be separated from other solid waste materials and recycled without imposing an undue burden upon residents and businesses of the city; and 
(5)  Residents, taxpayers and businesses of the city benefit from the reduction of the volume of solid waste materials collected by the city and transported and deposited in available, authorized landfill sites. 
(b)  The common council further finds and ordains that: 
(1)  Improper disposal of household sharp medical waste, such as hypodermic needles, poses a significant health risk to workers in the waste disposal industry; 
(2)  Safe disposal of household sharp medical waste is possible through inexpensive, easily obtained means, without posing an undue burden on users of household sharp medical waste; and 
(3)  Removal of household sharp medical waste from the city's waste stream is beneficial to residents of the city as well as the city's waste hauler and users of the county landfill.

ARTICLE III. - GUIDELINES FOR DENIAL, NONRENEWAL, SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 60-152. - Intent. 
(a)  As it is the responsibility of the public safety and human services committee ("the committee") of the common council to screen applications for alcohol beverage licenses within the city under the licensing authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 125 and this chapter, the common council adopts the following guidelines in order to specify the reasons for denial, nonrenewal, suspension or revocation an alcohol beverage license. If a decision is made to deny, revoke, suspend or nonrenew a license, the committee is required to provide that person with a written reason for the denial. These guidelines are adopted to meet that requirement. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, broad discretion is retained on behalf of the committee to consider each case on an individual basis. Deviation from the guidelines may be allowed if mitigating circumstances exist, which may include, but are not limited to, the particular circumstances documented or the length of time that has expired since the offense.  
Sec. 60-153. - Applicability of state law and city code; conflicting provisions. 
(a)  To the extent Wis. Stats. ch. 125 or this Code provide additional grounds for denial, suspension, revocation or nonrenewal, the committee may rely on such provisions in addition to grounds provided in these guidelines. 
(b)  Any conflict between Wis. Stats. ch. 125, this Code and the policy set forth in this article shall be decided on the order of precedence which shall be the order listed in this sentence.  
Sec. 60-154. - Notices provided by the commission and by the police department. 
(a)  If the police department recommends denial, revocation, suspension, or nonrenewal of a license, both that person and the employer are notified in writing of the recommendation and are provided the opportunity to meet with the public safety and human services committee to discuss the denial. If the public safety and human services committee denies, revokes, suspends or does not renew a license, both that person and the employer will be notified, in writing, of the denial and the guideline that was used as reason for denial. 
(b)  Since alcohol beverage license holders must act in cooperation with law enforcement to enforce the alcohol beverage laws, drunk driving laws, and assist with minimizing disturbances of the peace and maintaining the safety of the community, individuals with a past history of negative or uncooperative contacts with police agencies should be scrutinized; provided, however, that the committee shall not discriminate against such applicants based on a prior arrest or conviction record, pursuant to Wis. Stats. §§ 111.321, 111.322, 111.335 and 125.12(l)(b), unless said arrest or conviction record substantially relates to the circumstances of the particular licensed activity. It is with these goals in mind, as well, that these guidelines are adopted.  
Sec. 60-155. - Copy of article to be provided to applicants. 
A copy of this article shall be provided to each person who applies for a license under this chapter.  
Sec. 60-156. - Grounds generally. 
In addition to all other provisions of this article and pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 125.12, any license under this chapter may be denied, refused renewal, suspended or revoked if the applicant or licenseholder: 
(1)  Does not possess the qualifications for licensure under this chapter or state law; 
(2)  Has committed any of the offenses enumerated in division 2 of this article; 
(3)  Keeps or maintains a disorderly or riotous, indecent or improper house; or 
(4)  Sells or gives away, or has sold or given away, alcohol beverages to known habitual drunkards.  
Sec. 60-157. - Effect of falsification of application for license. 
Any person who materially falsifies an application for an alcohol beverage license will not be eligible to reapply for an alcohol beverage license for a period of six months from the date of denial of such application. The committee may waive the provisions of this section, allow the applicant to submit a corrected application, with the appropriate fee, and grant an alcohol beverage license to the person, if it appears to the committee that any falsifications on the application were the result of inadvertence, excusable neglect, or mistake.

DIVISION 2. - OFFENSES 
 
Sec. 60-183. - Relevance of offenses; discrimination prohibited. 
Since alcohol beverage license holders must act in cooperation with law enforcement to enforce the alcohol beverage laws, drunk driving laws and assist with minimizing disturbances of the peace and maintaining the safety of the community, individuals with a past history of negative or uncooperative contacts with police agencies should be scrutinized; provided, however, that the committee shall not discriminate against such applicants based on a prior arrest or conviction record, pursuant to Wis. Stats. §§ 111.321, 111.322, 111.335 and 125.12(1)(b), unless said arrest or conviction record substantially relates to the circumstances of the particular licensed activity.  
Sec. 60-184. - Type of relevant offense; relevant time period. 
The committee will only deny renewal of, suspend or revoke a current alcohol beverage license under these guidelines, or other justification provided by law, if the person committed an offense substantially related to the licensed activity within the license year period immediately preceding the year for which the person is seeking renewal or within the license year period in which suspension or revocation is sought, unless the police chief demonstrates that previous offenses were not considered in the approval of the current license. In the event the person is considered for nonrenewal, suspension or revocation as the result of such an offense, the committee shall consider all offenses, regardless of when they occurred, to determine application of these guidelines.  
Sec. 60-185. - Applicants other than natural persons.

Sec. 62-21. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  It is a lawful purpose of the common council of the city to enact regulatory ordinances protecting and promoting the general welfare, peace, security, health and safety of its citizens and good order of the city and its neighborhoods. 
(b)  The city is empowered to enact such ordinances pursuant to Wis. Const. art. XI, § 3 and Wis. Stats. §§ 62.11(5), 62.23, 66.0101, 66.0107, and other home rule, police power and applicable provisions of the state statutes, all as from time to time amended or renumbered, for the public health, welfare, peace, tranquility, good order and public benefit. 
(c)  It is the purpose of this article to regulate public nudity and sexually oriented activities to protect and promote the general welfare, peace, security, health and safety of its citizens, and good order of the city and its neighborhoods; to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city; to reasonably license such activities to facilitate the public welfare; and to limit the negative, adverse and undesirable secondary effects flowing from such establishments. 
(d)  The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials, or adult entertainment; nor is it the intent or effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or adult sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, nor to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment in their intended market; nor is it the intent or effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

(1)  Adult oriented entertainment establishments and public nudity in such establishments by performers, employees and patrons, can and do contribute to the impairment of the character and quality of surrounding residential neighborhoods; 
(2)  Contribute to the decline and the value of surrounding properties; 
(3)  Contribute to physical deterioration and blight of neighborhoods; 
(4)  Have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses around them and surrounding residential areas, including increased transiency, increased levels of criminal activities including prostitution, promotion of prostitution, rape, sexual, assaults, or other assaults, other sex related crimes; robbery; dissemination of obscenity; sale, distribution or display of harmful material to a minor; sexual performance by a child; possession or distribution of child pornography; public lewdness; indecent exposure; indecency with a child; sexual molestation; molestation of a child; disorderly conduct; disturbances of the peace; drinking in public; littering; and other violations of the law;

(6)  Harm the economic welfare of the communities; 
(7)  Negatively and adversely affect the quality of life in the communities; 
(8)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to unhealthy activities that are generally uncontrolled by owners and operators without regulations and that there is presently no mechanism without this article to effectively make the owners and operations of such establishments responsible for the activities that occur upon the premises; 
(9)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located; 
(10)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing files, videos, or live sex shows. See, e.g., California vs. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 93 S.Ct. 390, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972). See also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377; 
(11)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77; 
(12)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara vs. Cloud Books, Inc. , 478 U.S. 697, 106 S.Ct. 3172, 92 L.Ed.2d 568 (1986). See also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77; 
(13)  Many adult entertainment establishments provide live entertainment in which physical contact between performers and customers, often sexual in nature, occurs and can occur, thus facilitating the transmission of various diseases, including AIDS; 
(14)  In Milwaukee and Kenosha Counties, Wisconsin; the city of Waukesha, Wisconsin; the city of Janesville, Wisconsin; the Village of Somerset, Wisconsin; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Newport New, Virginia; and Marion County, Indiana; to name a few locales, it has been found that the viewing booths in adult-oriented establishments have been and are being used by patrons of said establishments for engaging in sexual acts, particularly between males, including, but not limited to, intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation and masturbation, resulting in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in said booths; 
(15)  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a sexually transmitted disease which destroys the body's immune system, is fatal, and has no known cure; 
(16)  The viral agents responsible for AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases have all been isolated at one time or another from semen; 
(17)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, genital chlamydia trachomatis, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Myers, Florida; 
(18)  As of December 2002, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 886,575. See, e.g., statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.; 
(19)  In 2004, statistics from the state had indicated that as of December 31, 2003, 8,328 cases of AIDS were reported in the state including 3,301 that resulted in death; 
(20)  As of January 1, 1995, the state department of health and family services AIDS/HIV program reported that between 1998 and 2003, 372 new cases of HIV infection were diagnosed on average each year, and the county's annual average rate of infection is surpassed in the state only by Milwaukee County; 
(21)  The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 2002 was 834,555, according to the Centers for Disease Control. However, under-reporting is substantial and it is estimated that 2,800,000 people become infected each year. See, e.g., statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.; see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77); 
(22)  In 2002, there were over 32,000 reported cases of syphilis in the United States, of which 6,862 cases were of primary and secondary syphilis, an increase of 12.4 percent from 2001. The rate of infection for males is 3.5 times that in women. See, e.g., statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.; 
(23)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with an estimated 700,000 infections occurring each year. See, e.g., statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.; 
(24)  The Center for Disease Control in July 1999 advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn; 
(25)  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g., statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov.; 
(26)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377; 
(27)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult-oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377; 
(28)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g., Barnes vs. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); 
(29)  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. vs. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986); 
(30)  Sexually oriented businesses have operation characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns; 
(31)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place an incentive for operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein; 
(32)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments; 
(33)  The disclosure of certain information by those ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity; 
(34)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct prohibited in this article and a sex-related crime is substantially related to the licensed activity of operating, owning or controlling a sexually oriented business. 
(f)  The United States Supreme Court and various federal and state courts have held that a local unit of government, such as the city, may rely upon and incorporate by reference such findings and experiences into its own findings and legitimate concerns about the adverse and undesirable secondary effects arising from and pertaining to adult-oriented entertainment establishments, public nudity therein, crime, prostitution, gambling, littering, and other adverse secondary impacts described in this article, and jointly and severally use such findings and determinations of the United States Supreme Court in previous rulings, as well, including, but not limited to, City of Erie vs. Pap's A.M., 539 U.S. 277, 146 L. Ed. 2d 265, 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes vs. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504; City of Renton vs. Playtime Theatres, Inc. , 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986); Arcara vs. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 106 S.Ct. 3172, 92 L.Ed.2d 568 (1986); City of Newport, Ky vs. Iacobucci , 479 U.S. 92, 107 S.Ct. 383, 93 L.Ed.2d 334 (1986); Young vs. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976); California vs. Larue , 409 U.S. 109, 93 S.Ct. 390, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972); United States vs. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); Ben's Bar, Inc. vs. Village of Somerset , 316 F.3d 702 (7th Cir. 2003); DLS, Inc. vs. City of Chattanooga , 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Key, Inc. vs. Kitsap County , 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. vs. City of Arlington , 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995); South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. vs. City of Miami , 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984); and N.W. Enterprises vs. City of Houston, 27 F. Supp. 2d 754 (S.D. Tex. 1998), as the basis for content neutral regulation of such establishments and the behavior therein without affecting the substance of verbal or nonverbal speech, with the legitimate intent and goal of reducing or eliminating such negative secondary effects to as great a degree as possible. 
(g)  The common council of the city believes that the experiences, evidence and studies from the other cities and communities cited, set forth herein, and/or considered by the common council in whole, part or summary, are relevant and important in understanding and addressing the secondary effects adult entertainment oriented establishments can and do have upon neighborhoods, persons, economies, the areas surrounding such establishments and the city. 
(h)  The common council of the city relies upon the findings, studies, evidence and experiences of such other cities and communities, and previous applicable United States Supreme Court and other federal and state court holdings, and hereby adopt and incorporate such findings, studies, evidence, experiences and court rulings and holdings herein by reference as if fully set forth verbatim as part of their findings and basis for this article and its regulations. 
(i)  Adult-oriented establishments in proximity to residential areas, places of worship, parks, day care centers and schools may and do often lead to an increase in criminal activities in the surrounding areas and the city desires to protect the youth of the community from the deleterious effects such businesses can have on adjacent areas by restricting their close proximity to certain public and private uses and protect its citizens and residents from increased crime as well as increased ordinance violations such as, but not limited to, disorderly conduct, drinking in public, possession of intoxicants by underage persons, public disturbances of the peace, littering, illegal drug use and sales, prostitution and gambling. 
(j)  Among these secondary effects described in greater detail above are: 
(1)  The potential increase in prostitution and other sex-related offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses; 
(2)  The potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist; 
(3)  Health risks associated with the widespread of sexually transmitted diseases; and 
(4)  The potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct. 
(k)  The common council of the city recognizes they lack authority to regulate obscenity in light of Wis. Stats. § 66.0107(3) and do not intend by adopting this article to regulate obscenity, since nudity in and of itself is not obscene, and declare their intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing in bars, taverns and other adult-oriented establishments. 
(l)  The common council of the city recognizes that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the First Amendment, and the common council further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights, and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights. 
(m)  The common council of the city desires to minimize, prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby: 
(1)  Protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city; 
(2)  Protect the citizens from increased crime; 
(3)  Preserve the equality of life; 
(4)  Preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; 
(5)  Deter the spread of urban blight; and 
(6)  Ensure and facilitate health, welfare, peace, tranquility and good order of the city and its residents and neighborhoods. 
(n)  The common council of the city has determined that enactment of this article legitimately promotes the valid goals and intent of minimizing, preventing and controlling the negative and adverse secondary effects associated with such activities, and does so in a content neutral manner while preserving numerous other means of free expression while regulating only certain behavior in a uniform yet limited manner. 
(o)  The United States Supreme Court in the case of City of Renton vs. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S. Ct., 925, 89 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1986) and Young vs. American Mini Theaters , 427 U.S. 50, 96 S. Ct. 2440, 49 L. Ed. 2d 310 (1976) have approved efforts by local governments to regulate the location of adult-oriented establishments through land use plans. 
(p)  A reasonable regulation of the location of adult entertainment establishments will provide for the protection of the image of the community and its property values and protect the residents of the community from the adverse secondary effects of an adult-oriented establishment, while providing to those who desire to patronize adult-oriented establishments, such an opportunity in areas within the city which are appropriate for a location of adult-oriented establishments, while reasonably regulating the disorderly effects of public nudity as herein defined. 
(q)  Whereas, pursuant to the city's authority, and in furtherance of the legitimate and reasonable health, welfare, peace, tranquility, safety, good order police power interest intent, goals and content neutral objections of the common council as set forth in this article and related ordinances, that find it is the intent of the common council to adopt by ordinance reasonable regulations, including the licensing and restricting the location of adult-oriented establishments, as defined herein, to promote the city's interest to protect and to preserve the quality of its neighborhoods, commercial and industrial districts, and quality of urban life through effective land-use planning, as well as the other legitimate governmental goals and objectives articulated and enumerated elsewhere in this article, all of such regulations are found the least intrusive. 
(r)  Although the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, the common council deems it to be in the interests of the city to provide for licensing, regulation and zoning of adult-oriented establishments including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult mini-motion picture establishments, adult motion picture theaters and adult cabarets to combat and curb the adverse, undesirable and harmful secondary effects of such establishments. 
(s)  The public safety and human services committee, plan commission and common council each separately conducted a public hearing in conjunction with and prior to the consideration and adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, with the plan commission recommending the adoption of the zoning code provisions of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and the zoning code provisions in Ordinance No. 2004-O-36, as amendments to chapter 22, the city's existing zoning code. 
(t)  The proposed licensing, regulation and zoning ordinances jointly and severally serve and directly promote substantial and legitimate government interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication. Based upon the above findings and recitals, the common council of the city hereby adopts this article and its various reasonable, content-neutral and legitimate governmental interest components, provisions, re-creations, regulations and amendments.

ARTICLE III. - TRAFFIC RULES AND REGULATIONS  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 68-135. - Traffic and pedestrian safety. 
(a)  Purpose. Pedestrians are increasingly using highways in ways for which the roads were not designed. These uses include approaching vehicles when in use or staying upon medians for purposes other than crossing the highway. These activities create safety hazards for pedestrians and distract drivers, making automobile crashes more likely. This section is designed to decrease the safety hazards by restricting such activity. These safety concerns are most acute on the busiest streets within the city, identified as arterial and collector streets or highways, and some streets intersecting with those arterial streets. This section applies to those "covered highways" identified in subsection (g) herein. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section: 
(1)  Covered highway is defined in subsection (g) herein. 
(2)  In operation. A vehicle is "in operation" when it has an operator, as defined in Wis. Stat. § 340.01(41). 
(3)  Median. A "median" is a paved or unpaved area dividing a street or highway that separates lanes of traffic traveling in opposite directions, or in the case of left or right hand turn lanes, vehicles traveling in the same direction. 
(c)  No person, other than a person in or on a vehicle, shall be on a covered highway listed in subsection (g) and approach any vehicle in operation, except a vehicle that is legally parked at the curb or the shoulder. 
(d)  No person shall be upon a median of a covered highway listed in subsection (g) unless that person is in the process of crossing the highway in a safety zone or crosswalk. It is prima facie evidence of a violation of this section if a person stays on the median through two consecutive opportunities to cross the highway in a legal manner under this chapter and the state traffic laws adopted herein. This may include a change in the traffic control signal or lack of traffic, as applicable. After such two consecutive opportunities, such person shall not be considered to be "using the safety zone or crosswalk to cross the highway" for purposes of the exception in subsection (f)(2). 
(e)  No operator of a vehicle shall park, stop or leave standing a vehicle on a covered highway listed in subsection (g) where prohibited or suddenly decrease the speed of said vehicle or deviate from a traffic lane for the purpose of responding to persons violating subsection (c) or (d). 
(f)  Exceptions. This section does not apply to: 
(1)  Persons on the sidewalk; 
(2)  Persons using the safety zone or crosswalk to cross the highway; 
(3)  Persons engaged in law enforcement or rescue activities, including providing assistance to an injured or disabled vehicle or person; 
(4)  Persons entering a vehicle as an invited passenger where it is lawful to do so, including activity permitted under Wis. Stat. § 346.29(1) (taxis); 
(5)  Persons engaged in repair or maintenance activities on the highway under the direction or authority of the city or the state; or 
(6)  Streets or portions thereof that have been closed pursuant to a street use permit or other express authorization from the city. 
(g)  Covered highways. This section applies only to covered highways, which are those highways or portions of highways listed in subsection (1) and (2) below: 
(1)  The following highways are designated as arterial and collector streets, the streets and highways within the city that have the most traffic, and are covered highways under this section: 
Cheryl Dr 	Kapec Rd (between King James Way and McKee Rd) 	Rothmore Ln 
Crescent Rd 	King James Way 	S. Seminole Hwy 
CTH B 	Lacy Rd 	S. Syene Rd (between McCoy Rd and Irish Ln) 
CTH D/Fish Hatchery Rd 	Leopold Way 	Seminole Hwy 
CTH M 	Longford Terrace 	Sentinel Pass (between Crescent Rd and Seminole Hwy) 
CTH MM/Rimrock Rd 	McCoy Rd 	Syene Rd 
CTH PD/McKee Rd 	Nesbitt Rd 	USH 14 
E. Cheryl Pkwy 	Osmundsen Rd (between Verde View Rd and Lacy Rd) 	USH 18/151/Verona Rd 
Fitchrona Rd 	Pembroke Dr 	Verde View Rd 
Greenway Cross (between Fish Hatchery Rd and Index Rd) 	Post Rd 	Whalen Rd (between Fitchrona Rd and Fish Hatchery Rd) 
Haight Farm Rd 	Raymond Rd 	Williamsburg Way 
Irish Ln 	Richardson St 	
 
(2)  In addition to the arterial highways designated above, this section applies to any highway containing a median that intersects with any of the arterial highways, but only for the first 200 feet of the intersecting highway from the arterial highway, as measured along the center line of the intersecting highway from the point the intersecting highway touches the right of way of the arterial highway. 
(h)  Any person violating this section may be required to forfeit not less than $25.00 nor more than $300.00.

(2)  Operate a motor vehicle so as to cause unreasonable and excessive noise levels whether by excessive acceleration or braking causing the tires to squeal, by excessive horn blowing, by excessive racing of the motor, by having a modified or inadequately maintained exhaust or braking system or by any other means. 
(b)  This section does not apply to any of the following: 
(1)  The operator of an authorized emergency vehicle, when responding to an emergency call or when in the pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law or when responding to but not upon returning from a fire alarm.

Sec. 68-208. - Vehicle abandonment prohibited; removal. 
(a)  Whenever any vehicle has been left unattended on any public highway, public property or private property without the permission of the property owner, for more than 48 hours the vehicle is deemed abandoned within the meaning of Wis. Stats. § 342.40, adopted in this chapter, and constitutes a public nuisance. 
(b)  In addition to the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 342.40, adopted in this chapter, relating to abandoned vehicle removal, whenever any traffic officer finds a vehicle standing upon a highway in violation of a prohibition, limitation or restriction on stopping, standing or parking, he/she is authorized to move such vehicle to a place of safekeeping by towing at the owner's expense or to require the operator in charge thereof to move such vehicle to a position where such stopping, standing, or parking is not prohibited. Such removal shall not relieve the owner or operator of such vehicle from any penalty incurred because of such violation.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 72-1. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Affected applicant. In rent abatement categories where the percentage of rent abatement is expressed as a certain percentage or a certain dollar amount "per affected applicant," the abatement applies only to those dwelling units/lodging rooms affected by the violation and only if a tenant therein has applied for rent abatement. 
Affected dwelling unit or lodging room means a dwelling unit or lodging room in which a rent impairing violation exists or a dwelling unit or lodging room in a residential building where a common area violation exists. 
Applicant encompasses the total number of eligible tenants residing in a dwelling unit or lodging room where an eligible tenant has applied for rent abatement and not an individual eligible tenant within the unit or room. 
Authorized agent means a person empowered by landlords, tenants, or tenant unions to represent them. The agent need not be a member of the authorizing group. 
Common area violation means a condition constituting a rent impairing violation which exists in any part of a residential building or lot not contained within a dwelling unit or lodging room. 
Earnest money deposit means the total of any payments or deposits, however denominated or described, given by a prospective tenant to a landlord in return for the option of entering into a rental agreement in the future, or for having a rental application considered by the landlord. 
Eligible tenant means any current or former tenant of a landlord of residential premises where the landlord fails to comply with an order of the building department to correct a rent impairing violation by the original due date in the orders unless that date is found unreasonable by the rent abatement committee, provided that the tenant has lived in an affected dwelling unit for some portion of the time period from the date of the initial inspection by the building inspector to the close of the 15-day period during which a request for abatement hearing may be filed. 
Form provision means a written rule, regulation, or rental or contract provision that has not been specifically and separately negotiated and agreed to by the tenant in writing. Any provision appearing as part of a preprinted form is rebuttably presumed to be a form provision. 
Grievance means any dispute between tenant and landlord over rents or other conditions of tenancy. 
Guest means any person present on the leased premises, with the consent of the current tenant, who is not listed in the lease. 
Landlord means a person or authorized agent, who has the right to exclusive possession of the premises and who, for consideration under a rental agreement, agrees to relinquish that right to another temporarily, retaining a right of reversion in the premises upon the termination of such agreement. 
Only facility means the only appliance of its kind in the dwelling unit or lodging room. 
Owner means one or more persons, jointly or severally vested with all or part of the beneficial ownership and right to present use and enjoyment of the premises. The term "owner" includes a mortgagee in possession. 
Per fixture means per affected appliance regardless of how many separate rent impairing violations may affect that appliance. 
Provider agency means any governmental agency or private social services agency which by contract provides rental assistance on behalf of low-income tenants where such assistance payments are paid directly to the landlord. 
Rent impairing violation means a condition in a dwelling unit, lodging room or other area of a residential building or lot which constitutes or, if not promptly corrected, will constitute a fire hazard or a threat to the health or safety of occupants thereof. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, those which involve deficiencies in security, heating, electricity and/or plumbing. 
Rental agreement means a written or oral agreement embodying and fixing the terms and conditions for the transfer of possession and the use and occupancy of premises whether or not for a definite period of time. 
Residential property means any premises which is used for any residential purpose under the terms of a rental agreement. 
Security deposit means the total of all payments given by a tenant to the landlord as rent in excess of one month's prepaid rent unless the tenant voluntarily prepays the rent. 
Successor tenant means any individual who becomes a tenant in a dwelling unit or lodging room where a prior tenant was authorized or is in the process of being authorized to abate rent pursuant to article III of this chapter and where, at the time the tenancy of the successor tenant commences, there exists an uncorrected rent impairing violation which was determined or is in the process of being determined by a hearing examiner to be abatable. Anyone who succeeds a successor tenant is also a successor tenant, provided that at the time his/her tenancy commences there exists an uncorrected rent impairing violation for which abatement was authorized. 
Tenant means a person, excluding any authorized agent of landlord, entitled to exclusive possession and occupancy of either a mobile home or a dwelling unit and the right to the use of the appropriate appurtenances as provided in a rental agreement, and any other person 18 years of age or over who shares such a unit with the knowledge and consent of the landlord. The term "tenant" applies to persons holding over after termination of tenancy until removed by sheriff's execution of a judicial writ of restitution issued under Wis. Stats. § 799.44. The term "tenant" also applies to person entitled to the return of a security deposit or an accounting for the security deposit. 
Voluntary prepaid rent means rent paid at the tenant's option in advance of the date required by the rental agreement.

(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(1))  
Sec. 72-218. - Other remedies of tenant. 
The right of a tenant to abate a portion of the rent as provided in this article shall not preclude or affect in any way the tenant's right to abate under Wis. Stats. ch. 704; nor shall it preclude or affect in any way the tenant's or landlord's right to any of the remedies provided by the laws of the state and this Code pertaining to the relationship of landlord and tenant.

Stats. ch. 704. 
(b)  In addition, no tenant shall be evicted for nonpayment of rent where the tenant continues to abate rent pursuant to a lawful order of a hearing examiner pending judicial review of the order after a stay of the hearing examiner's decision has been ordered by the reviewing court, if written notice of the request for judicial review was not given to the tenant in accordance with section 72-373. 
(c)  Furthermore, no tenant who has been authorized to abate a portion of his/her rental payment shall be evicted for failure to pay rent as a result of underpayment of rent due to a computation error, so long as the tenant remedies the underpayment within five days after notice thereof by the landlord. 
(d)  No person or tenant shall be evicted or retaliated against for complaining of violations of chapters 22, 35, 37 or this chapter or for complying with this section, and it shall be presumed that any attempt to terminate the tenancy of such tenant or to evict such tenant or to raise such tenant's rental payments or to otherwise harass or retaliate against such tenant during the period from the first complaint to the building inspection department to six months after the certification by the building inspection department of the city that all violations have been corrected is done in retaliation for the tenant's complaint to the building inspection department of a violation of chapters 22, 35, 37 or this chapter or for his/her compliance with this section.

(1)  A copy of any official notice of outstanding violation of this Code that the landlord or person has actual notice and which affects the subject rental building regardless of the location of the violations or defects therein and a copy of any hearing examiner decision and order which affects the subject rental unit or any common areas of the subject rental building. The failure by a landlord to comply with the provisions of this subsection regarding written notice of a successor tenant's right to abate rent shall not be subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-21. 
(2)  In addition, prior to the time a rental agreement is entered into, the landlord shall advise the prospective tenant in writing of a successor tenant's right to abate rent pursuant to the order aforementioned until authorization to abate ceases as provided in section 72-346. In cases where the rent abatement request is pending at the time the rental agreement is entered into, the landlord shall provide the successor tenant written notification of a successor tenant's rights when the case has been decided and shall exhibit a copy of the decision and order to the successor tenant upon receipt thereof. 
(3)  At the time occupancy commences the landlord shall exhibit to the tenant (formerly, a prospective tenant) a copy of all additional official notices referred to in subsection (1) of this section and a copy of all decisions and orders referred to in subsection (2) of this section, if any have been issued since the signing of the rental agreement.

(b)  Any such order of the building inspection department shall specifically state that uncorrected violations may be eligible for abatement in addition to any other penalties provided by law. A tenant's eligibility to abate rent shall apply only to the eligible tenant or successor tenant upon whose rented premises the uncorrected rent impairing violation exists or to any eligible tenant or successor tenant in a building with an uncorrected rent impairing violation in a common area.

(b)  Where an award is made and rent has been paid by both a tenant and a provider agency, the tenant's portion of the award shall be up to but not greater than the amount of rent the tenant has paid. Where the award amount is less than or equal to the amount of rent the tenant paid, the tenant shall receive all of the award. 
(c)  No rent may be abated pursuant to this article until abatement is ordered by the rent abatement hearing examiner or authorized by written agreement between the parties.

(b)  In order to be deemed a successor tenant under this article an otherwise eligible individual must advise the landlord in writing with a copy to the building inspection department of his/her intent no later than 15 calendar days after receipt of written notification by the landlord which conforms to the requirements of section 72-280 regardless of whether said written notification is given within the times prescribed therein. If said written notification is given at or prior to the time the rental agreement is entered into, the successor tenant's notice of intent must be given no later than 15 calendar days after the commencement of the successor tenancy. 
(c)  Failure to provide the landlord with a timely written notice of intent to become a successor tenant forfeits a tenant's right to proceed to abate rent as a successor tenant under this chapter, except where the landlord has failed to provide the written notification of the tenant's right to abate rent pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. In cases where the landlord fails to provide written notice as required, an otherwise eligible tenant may assert the rights of a successor tenant at any time during the tenancy or in any action relating to or arising out of the tenancy.

(NOTE: Any violation cited under the state codes or the National Electrical Code (NEC) would in an existing rental property also be a violation this chapter. 
 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(3)(d))  
Sec. 72-346. - Duration of abatement. 
(a)  Authorization to abate a portion of the rent pursuant to this article for failure of a landlord to correct a rent impairing violation ceases upon certification by the building inspection department that said violation has been satisfactorily corrected, except that a tenant, a provider agency or successor tenant shall not be required to reimburse any appropriately abated portion of the rent to a landlord where correction of the rent impairing violation was made after payment of the balance of the rental payment had been tendered to the landlord. Where more than one rent impairing violation has been authorized for rent abatement and partial correction has been certified, authorization to abate continues for the uncorrected rent impairing violations, until such time as their satisfactory correction has been verified. 
(b)  If abatement is authorized, the landlord must promptly repay any rent previously paid by the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant and apportioned to rent impairing violations from the date of the original inspection by the building inspection department at which said violations were discovered. 
(c)  If the landlord fails to promptly reimburse the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant as required in subsection (b) of this section, the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant may enforce the order requiring reimbursement as follows: 
(1)  The tenant, provider agency or successor tenant may deduct the amount previously paid and subsequently determined to be apportioned to rent impairing violations from future rental payments. 
(2)  If the total of future rental payments payable for the balance of the tenancy is less than the reimbursement required in subsection (b) of this section or if the tenant or successor tenant no longer resides at the premises in question, the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant shall recover from the landlord double the amount not reimbursed in accordance with the order of the hearing examiner plus costs of collection including reasonable attorney fees. 
(d)  The failure of a landlord to promptly reimburse the tenant, provider agency or successor tenant as required in subsection (b) of this section and the failure of either a landlord, a tenant or a provider agency after a decision by the reviewing court on judicial review, to return monies wrongfully not reimbursed or wrongfully abated shall be deemed a violation of this article and shall be punishable pursuant to section 72-223. 
(e)  Rent abatement awarded in a decision and order of a rent abatement hearing examiner shall accrue during the period when either a tenant or a successor tenant is entitled to the exclusive possession and occupancy of an affected dwelling unit. Under no circumstances shall there be recovery by both a tenant and a successor tenant for the same period of time. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(5))  
Secs. 72-34772-365. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 6. - PROCEDURE 
 
Sec. 72-366. - Application for authorization for rent abatement; request for hearing; fees. 
(a)  An eligible tenant who may be entitled to abate a portion of his/her rental payment under this article shall have 30 calendar days from publication of the notice of possible eligibility by the building inspection department of the city to file a request for a hearing on authorization for rent abatement. The request shall be in writing on a form approved by the rent abatement oversight committee, shall state with specificity the name and address of the landlord and the alleged rent impairing violation and shall be filed with the building inspection department. 
(b)  The application shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount provided in the city fee schedule made payable to the city treasurer, which fee shall be recovered from the landlord if abatement is ordered. If the applicant qualifies for waiver of the filing fees, however, the application shall be accompanied by an affidavit of economic hardship signed by the applicant. 
(c)  Within ten calendar days of the filing of the request, the building inspection department staff shall select a hearing examiner from the rent abatement hearing examiner panel, set a time and place for the hearing and give the landlord and the tenant written notice thereof. The hearing shall be held as soon as possible, but not prior to the end of the 30-calendar-day filing period. 
(d)  Notice of the hearing including a statement of the time, place and nature of the hearing shall be mailed to the landlord and tenant at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(3)(e)(1))  
Sec. 72-367. - Hearing examiner authority. 
(a)  The rent abatement hearing examiner shall have the authority to conduct hearings on requests for authorization for rent abatement and to determine the exact amount of rent, if any, which may be abated pursuant to this article. 
(b)  The rent abatement hearing examiner shall have the authority to administer oaths and to issue subpoenas pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 885.01 at the request of the parties and shall be responsible for the fair, orderly and impartial conduct of the rent abatement hearing and the preservation of the exhibits and the record therein. 
(c)  In any matter set for hearing the rent abatement hearing examiner may hold a conference between the parties to attempt to clarify or simplify the issues. In addition, prior to the hearing, upon request of the parties the hearing examiner may function as a mediator to encourage voluntary settlement. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(3)(e)(2))  
Sec. 72-368. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  The rent abatement hearing examiner shall conduct the hearing on the request for authorization for rent abatement, shall administer oaths to all witnesses and may issue subpoenas upon request of the parties. The landlord and the tenant may be represented by counsel or other representatives, may call and examine witnesses and cross examine witnesses of the other party. 
(b)  All proceedings and testimony shall be recorded on tape. If a review is sought of the hearing examiner's decision, a written transcript shall be prepared at a cost to the requesting parties determined by the hourly staff rate plus a reasonable fee for copies. For all purposes, a copy of the tape recordings shall be supplied to anyone requesting the same at the requester's expense. If either party requests a stenographic recording and transcription, the building inspection department shall make the necessary arrangements, but the expense shall be borne by the requesting party. 
(c)  In the hearing, the tenant shall have the burden of proving to a reasonable certainty by the greater weight of the credible evidence, (i.e., by the preponderance of the evidence,) that the landlord failed to correct rent impairing violations by the due date in an order of the building inspection department. 
(d)  It is the landlord's burden to show by the preponderance of the evidence that any rent impairing violations were negligently or willfully caused by the tenant or the tenant's guests or that the tenant's refusal to allow entry prevented the landlord from making the corrections in a timely manner. Thereafter, the tenant has the burden to show that any such refusal was reasonable under the circumstances. 
(e)  Either party may present additional evidence on the nature, extent and seriousness of violations, the length of time conditions existed and the extent to which the tenant was deprived of the full use of the rented premises, to assist in determining the percent of abatement which should be allowed. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(3)(e)(3))  
Sec. 72-369. - Decision. 
(a)  In favor of tenant. 
(1)  If, on the evidence at the hearing, the rent abatement hearing examiner finds that the landlord failed to comply with an order of the building inspection department to correct by the original due date a rent impairing violation as that term is defined in section 72-1, the hearing examiner shall order that rent be abated retroactive to the date of the initial inspection in order to effectuate the purpose of this article and to provide fair and equitable compensation to the tenant for the diminished value of the rented premises due to the landlord's continued violation of the city's building/housing codes. 
(2)  Any such abatement shall be established in accordance with the schedule of rent impairing violations in section 72-345. In setting the exact percentage of abatement the hearing examiner shall consider the nature, extent and seriousness of the particular conditions, the total number of rent impairing violations at issue, the length of time the conditions existed and the extent to which the conditions deprive the tenant of full use of the rented premises. 
(3)  If the hearing examiner finds that the landlord's failure to comply with the order of the building inspection department by the due date was caused by factors wholly outside the landlord's control and if the hearing examiner further finds that the landlord has taken affirmative steps to minimize the impact of the uncorrected rent-impairing conditions on the tenant, any sums reasonably expended by the landlord in that regard should be considered in setting the percentage of abatement and may operate to reduce the final abatement percentage below the minimum percentage listed for the items in the schedule of rent impairing violations in section 72-345. 
(4)  The hearing examiner shall not authorize rent abatement for any conditions found to be caused either negligently or willfully by the tenant or his/her guests, nor shall abatement be ordered for any period of time after the tenant has unreasonably refused entry to the landlord for the purpose of correcting the conditions giving rise to the violations. 
(b)  In favor of landlord. 
(1)  If, after hearing, the hearing examiner finds that the landlord did not fail to comply with an order of the building inspection department to correct a rent impairing violation by the due date or that the rent impairing violations were caused by the tenant or the tenant's guests or that the tenant unreasonably refused entry for the purpose of correcting a rent impairing violation, the hearing examiner shall enter an order denying the request for authorization to abate rent for any items negligently or willfully caused by the tenant or guests of the tenant or for any items which remained uncorrected due to the tenant's unreasonable refusal to allow entry for repair purposes. 
(2)  Where the landlord has received a list of code violations requiring correction within 72 hours or less, a refusal by the tenant to allow entry after reasonable notice of less than 24 hours may be deemed an unreasonable refusal solely for the purpose of determining whether rent abatement shall be awarded for the violation which was the subject of the official notice. 
(c)  Time for service of written findings; effect of failure to comply. The decision and order of the hearing examiner shall contain written findings and shall be mailed to the parties within seven calendar days of completion of the hearing or as soon thereafter as possible. The failure to issue and mail a decision within seven calendar days shall neither deprive the hearing examiner of jurisdiction to render a final decision in the matter nor affect the validity thereof. 
(d)  Persons upon whom decision is binding. Except as provided in section 72-313 relating to the rights of successor tenants, the holder of the landlord's interest in the premises at the time the decision and order of the hearing examiner is issued and the holder of the landlord's interest during the period of time that the right to continuing abatement remains in effect are bound by the order and by the applicable provisions of this chapter relating to rent abatement. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(3)(e)(4))  
Sec. 72-370. - Petition for reconsideration. 
(a)  Within ten calendar days after service by mail of the decision of the hearing examiner, either party may file with the building inspection department a written petition for reconsideration specifying in detail the grounds for the relief sought. In addition, a hearing examiner may, on his/her own motion, reconsider the decision or order a hearing on reconsideration. Reconsideration will be granted only on the basis of: 
(1)  A material error of fact or law or an error in the calculation of an award amount; or 
(2)  Where the landlord's or tenant's failure to appear at the hearing was due solely to extraordinary, justifiable and unforeseeable circumstances beyond his/her control, which circumstances prevented attendance at the hearing. Petitions for reconsideration based on a tenant's or landlord's failure to appear must contain a sworn, notarized statement describing factually and in detail those extraordinary circumstances which caused the petitioner's non-appearance. In addition, said petition must be received by the building inspection department by 4:30 p.m. on the first business day following the hearing date or be deemed untimely. 
(b)  Copies of the petition shall be served by first class mail by the petitioner on all parties, who may file replies within seven calendar days after service by mail of the petition. 
(c)  Within 21 calendar days of the filing of the petition, the hearing examiner shall enter an order denying reconsideration or an order granting reconsideration disposing of the petition without a hearing or shall order a rehearing, which shall be held within 20 calendar days. The failure to issue a decision within the specified time period shall not deprive the hearing examiner of jurisdiction to render a decision on reconsideration or affect the validity thereof. If no order is entered within 21 calendar days of the filing of the petition, the petition shall be deemed denied. 
(d)  Upon rehearing, if any, proceedings shall conform as nearly as may be to sections 72-366 through 72-369, relating to an original hearing. 
(e)  The filing of a petition for rehearing shall not suspend or delay the effective date of the original decision and order, and the order shall take effect on the date fixed by the hearing examiner and shall continue in effect unless the petition is granted or until the order is superseded, modified, or set aside as provided by law. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(3)(f))  
Sec. 72-371. - Request for modification. 
If, subsequent to a decision by a hearing examiner ordering rent abatement, substantial further deterioration or substantial improvement occurs in any rent impairing conditions which were the subject of the original order, the applicant, landlord or any successor tenant may request modification of the rent abatement amount. Only one such request for modification may be made by each eligible individual, which request shall follow the procedures in sections 72-366 through 72-369, relating to the original application. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(3)(g))  
Sec. 72-372. - Enforcement. 
Whenever, in the judgment of the rent abatement oversight committee, the judicial enforcement of this article is necessary, the committee shall in writing request the city attorney to enforce this article in the name of the city. 
(Comp. Ords. 2009, § 28.04(3)(h))  
Sec. 72-373. - Appeal. 
(a)  All orders of the rent abatement hearing examiner shall be final administrative determinations and shall be subject to review in court as by law may be provided. Any party to the proceeding may seek review thereof within 30 calendar days of service by mail of the final determination of the hearing examiner. In addition, written notice of any request for judicial review shall be given by the party seeking review to all parties who appeared at the proceeding before the hearing examiner, with said notice to be sent by first class mail to each party's last known address. 
(b)  The institution of the proceeding for judicial review shall not stay the decision and order of the hearing examiner; however, the reviewing court may order a stay upon such terms as it deems proper.

Such premises, as further described in section 74-53, are deemed chronic nuisance premises and are public nuisances. This article is enacted to encourage property owners to recognize their responsibility to ensure that activities occurring on their property conform to the law and do not unduly burden the city's resources and to provide a mechanism for the city to take action against property owners who fail to ensure premises they own do not require a disproportionate devotion of resources to such premises.
