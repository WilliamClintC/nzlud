PREFACE
The Jackson Municipal Code contains all laws governing the Town for the purpose of
public safety, health and welfare, and pertaining to any inspections and investigations required.
In essence, the Code is the legal authority under State Statute, which enables the Mayor and
Town Council to govern the Town of Jackson. The Code serves to memorialize legislative
decisions, provides a historical framework and is the reference source for all laws governing the
Town.
The Municipal Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor
decimal numbering system that is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the
numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of
the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 5.04.010 is Section .010 located in Chapter 5.04 of
Title 5. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.) leaving nine
vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly,
chapters are designated as titles and are numbered to provide for internal expansion.
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific
sources for the provisions of that section. The Code has been kept current by regular
supplementation.
Copies of the Town of Jackson Municipal Code are available for inspection at the Town
Hall, the Teton County Public Library and also can be viewed on our website:
www.townofjackson.com.
This book has been updated to include Ordinance 1255 and Resolution 20-17, as of the
July 15, 2020 Town Council meeting.

before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall,
by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume

and the quality of the facilities are important parts of the tourist experience in Jackson, and
thus this ordinance seeks to ensure those facilities are of the highest quality.
B. The intent and purpose of this ordinance is to establish procedures and standards by which
residential short-term rentals can be provided to tourists seeking them in a manner that
protects both the quality of their experience and the community of Jackson. It is the Town
of Jackson’s intent to establish residential short-term rental regulations that promote a mix
of lodging options to support Jackson’s tourist base and local economy, while
simultaneously upholding the health, safety and welfare of the public and preserving the
long-term residential neighborhoods within the Town.

ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS
Sections:
5.70.010 Intent, Rationale and Purpose.
5.70.020 Legislative Findings.
5.70.030 Definitions.
5.70.040 Operation Standards.
5.70.050 Penalty.
5.70.010 Intent, Rationale and Purpose.
A. Adult entertainment businesses require special supervision from the public safety agencies
of the Town in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of
such businesses as well as the citizens of the Town.
B. The Town Council finds that adult entertainment businesses, as a category of
establishments, are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution.
C. There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment businesses, as a
category of establishments, have deleterious secondary effects and are often associated
with crime and the downgrading of property values.
D. The Town Council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and
thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect citizens from crime;
preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding
neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight.
E. The Town Council recognizes its constitutional duty to interpret, construe, and amend its
ordinances to comply with constitutional requirements as they are announced.
F. With the passage of this ordinance, the Town Council accepts as binding the applicability
of general principles of criminal and civil law and procedure and the rights and obligations
under the United States and Wyoming Constitutions, the Wyoming State Statutes, and the
Wyoming Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure.
G. It is not the intent of this ordinance to suppress any speech activities protected by the
United States Constitution or the Wyoming Constitution, but to enact an ordinance to
further content-neutral governmental interests of the Town, to wit, the controlling of
secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses.
H. It is the purpose of this section to regulate the standards of Adult Entertainment Businesses
to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Jackson, Wyoming, and
to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to address the adverse secondary effects of
Adult Entertainment Businesses within the Town. The provisions of this ordinance have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction of the content of any
communication material, including sexually-explicit materials. Similarly, it is not the intent
or effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-explicit materials

Page 60 of 64
protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Articles 1 & 20 of
the Wyoming Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexuallyexplicit
entertainment to their intended market. It is not the intent or effect of this ordinance
to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material as defined by Wyoming
Statute 6.4.301(iii).

A. The Town of Jackson ("Town") is composed of and welcomes diverse individuals, groups,
and communities;
B. The Town values this diversity and encourages all residents and visitors to contribute to the
commercial life and activities of Jackson, and to the cultural and social life of the Town;
C. Discrimination and discriminatory practices based on sexual orientation or gender identity
or expression inhibit and restrict the economic growth and opportunities of Jackson and its
citizens and visitors, as well as the cultural, social and commercial activities and life of the
Town;
D. Discrimination disturbs or jeopardizes the public health, safety and welfare of the Town;
E. While the vast majority of employers, housing providers, and places of public
accommodation within the Town do not discriminate on the basis of actual or perceived
sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, the Town has received public
testimony and written complaints reporting instances of discrimination.
F. Although state and federal laws have been enacted to eliminate discrimination in
employment, housing, and public accommodations the Town finds that existing state and
federal laws do not adequately address all discriminatory acts reported by the Town’s
diverse residents, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals that have
not attained equal opportunity in housing, public accommodations, and employment. A
barrier to the advancement of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals in their
personal and professional lives within the Town is the potential discriminatory practices of
employers and providers of public accommodations and housing on the basis of actual or
perceived sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, and thus the Town deems it
necessary to adopt local regulations adapted to the needs of its citizens.
G. Discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity or
expression impacts all citizens who may be lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans gender, because
it limits the ability to fully and freely identify themselves as they seek employment,
housing and the services and products provided by public accommodations;
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 9 – Public Peace, Morals and Welfare
Page 10 of 34
H. Discrimination in employment prevents the gainful employment of Town residents, may
create breaches of the peace, add burdens upon the public for relief and welfare, and cause
citizens, including youth, to seek employment elsewhere;
I. Discrimination in housing makes it difficult for persons addressed in this article to find
housing in close proximity to urban services, educational facilities, in price ranges that are
within their earning ability, and may cause citizens to seek housing outside the Town;
J. Discrimination in places of public accommodation is economically harmful to a prosperous
community and is otherwise detrimental to the welfare and economic growth of the Town
and may cause citizens to seek public accommodations outside the Town.
K. Discrimination must be prohibited in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
Town and to ensure the basic human rights of members of groups that have historically
been subject to discrimination, including the right of such group members to live in peace
where they wish;
L. Prohibition of discrimination will attract new residents and businesses to the Town, will
encourage visitors and tourists to the Town, and is necessary to raise and maximize revenue
for the Town;
M. The Town wishes to exercise its powers to the fullest extent allowed by the Constitution and
statutes of the State of Wyoming and United States to prohibit and regulate discrimination.
(Ord. 1200 § 1, 2018)
9.26.020 Declaration of policy, purpose and intent.
A. It is declared to be among the civil rights of the people of the Town of Jackson, Wyoming
to be free from discrimination in housing, public accommodations and employment, and
for it to be contrary to the policy of the Town and unlawful to discriminate against any
person because of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression in places of housing,
public accommodation and employment. It is also declared to be unlawful to retaliate
against any person for making a complaint or assisting in an investigation or proceeding as
set forth in this Chapter.
B. Consistent with the findings of the Town Council, it is the intent of the Town of Jackson
that no person shall be denied his or her civil rights or discriminated against based upon his
or her actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, as more
specifically set out in this Chapter.
C. Consistent with the findings of the Town Council, and incorporating those findings, this
Chapter is enacted to exercise, to the fullest extent allowed by Wyoming statutes and the
Wyoming Constitution, the powers of the Town of Jackson to prohibit such discrimination
in order to, without limitation, encourage the economic growth of the Town, raise revenue
for the Town for the benefit of its residents, prevent activities that disturb or jeopardize the
public health, safety, peace or morality of the Town, provide for the health, safety and
welfare of the Town, and to generally encourage the growth and economic expansion of the
Town, and the ability of its residents to fully participate in the cultural, social and economic
life of the Town.

Jackson Municipal Code
Title 12 – Streets and Other Public Places
Page 9 of 44
closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by him if in his opinion it is

permittee shall construct and maintain adequate and safe crossings over excavations and across
highways under improvement to accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all street
intersections. Vehicular crossings shall be constructed and maintained of plank, timbers, and
blocking or steel plates of adequate size and thickness to accommodate vehicular traffic safely.

Title 12 – Streets and Other Public Places
Page 10 of 44
owned utilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with
the person owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all
pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the

12.08.130 Protection of adjoining property
The permittee shall at all times and at his or its own expense preserve and protect from
injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures
suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon
private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall
obtain a license from the owner of such private property for such purpose and if he cannot obtain
a license from such owner the town public works director may authorize him to enter the private
premises solely for the purpose of making the property safe. The permittee shall, at its own
expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged
during the progress of the encroachment work and shall be responsible for all damage to public
or private property or highways resulting from its failure properly to protect and carry out said
work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod
shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as required in
this chapter. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to
leave the lawn area clean of debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed
before such work began. The permittee shall not remove even temporarily any trees or shrubs
which exist in parking strip areas or easements across private property without first having
notified and obtained the consent of the property owner, or in the case of public property the
appropriate town department of town official having control of such property.
(Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.140 Sidewalk excavations
Any excavation made in any sidewalk or under a sidewalk shall be provided with a
substantial and adequate footbridge over the excavation on the line of the sidewalk, which bridge
shall be at least three feet wide and securely railed on each side so that foot passengers can pass
over safely at all times. (Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.150 Protective measures

work as shall prevent danger to persons using the town street or sidewalks, and such protective
barriers shall be maintained until the work shall be completed or the danger removed. At twilight
there shall be placed upon such place of encroachment and upon any excavated materials or
structures or other obstructions to streets suitable and sufficient lights which shall be kept
burning throughout the night during the maintenance of such obstructions. Whenever through
traffic on a street is cut off by virtue of the encroachment, the permittee shall erect detour signs
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 12 – Streets and Other Public Places
Page 11 of 44
at each intersection on either side of the encroachment. It is unlawful for anyone to remove or
tear down the fence, railing, protective barriers, lights, or detour signs provided at or near the
encroachment for the protection of the public. (Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.160 Attractive nuisance
It is unlawful for the permittee to suffer or permit to remain unguarded at the place of
encroachment any machinery, equipment or other device having the characteristics of an
attractive nuisance likely to attract children and hazardous to their safety or health.
(Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.170 Care of excavated material
All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall
be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the trench,
pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to
those using streets and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are
too narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as might be the case
in a narrow alley, the town public works director shall have the authority to require that the
permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the
time of backfilling. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites.
(Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.180 Damage to existing improvements
All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the encroachment work
shall be repaired by the permittee. Materials for such repair shall conform with the requirements
of any applicable code or ordinance. If upon being ordered the permittee fails to furnish the
necessary labor and materials for such repairs, the town public works director shall have the
authority to cause the necessary labor and materials to be furnished by the town and the cost
shall be charged against the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof
under the surety bond provided hereunder.
(Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.190 Tracked construction vehicles
Except by special permission of the public works director, no tracked construction
vehicle shall travel over the streets of the town except on a trailer. (Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.200 Property lines and easements

expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the public works director.
From time to time as may be ordered by the town public works director and in any event
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 12 – Streets and Other Public Places
Page 12 of 44
immediately after completion of the work, the permittee shall at his or its own expense clean up
and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from the work and upon failure
to do so within twenty-four hours after having been notified to do so by the town public works
director the work may be done by the town and the cost thereof charged to the permittee, and the
permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder.
(Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.220 Protection of watercourses
The permittee shall provide for the flow of all watercourses, sewers or drains intercepted
during the excavation work and shall replace the same in as good condition as it found them or
shall make such provisions for them as the town public works director may direct. The permittee
shall not obstruct the gutter of any street but shall use all proper measures to provide for the free
passage of surface water. The permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water,
muck, silt, slickings or other run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing or other
operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its failure to so provide.
(Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.230 Breaking through pavement
Whenever it is necessary to break through existing pavement for encroachment purposes,
the pavement shall be removed to at least twelve inches beyond the outer limits of the subgrade
that is to be disturbed in order to prevent settlement, and a twelve-inch shoulder of undisturbed
material shall be provided in each side of the excavated trench. The face of the remaining
pavement shall be approximately vertical. A power driven concrete saw shall be used so as to
permit complete breakage of concrete pavement or base without ragged edges. Asphalt paving
shall be scored or otherwise cut in a straight line. No pile driver or jackhammer may be used in
breaking up the pavement.
Whenever it is necessary to break through existing concrete curb and gutter for
encroachment purposes, a power-driven concrete saw shall be used, and the curb and gutter shall
be cut at the interface with the asphalt street surface and at full curb and gutter section lines and
shall be replaced to those full section lines. (Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.240 Tunnels
Tunnels under pavement shall not be permitted except by permission of the town public
works director and if permitted shall be adequately supported by timbering and backfilling under
the direction of the town public works director. (Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.250 Backfilling
Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an encroachment permit issued
hereunder shall be carried out in conformance with the adopted street and alley excavation and
backfill standard of the town. (Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)
12.08.260 Restoration of surface
A. The permittee shall restore the surface of all streets, broken into or damaged as a result of
the encroachment work in accordance with the adopted street and alley excavation and
backfill standard of the town and any additional requirements imposed by the town public
works director. The permittee may be required to place a temporary surface over openings
made in paved traffic lanes. Except when the pavement is to be replaced before the opening
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 12 – Streets and Other Public Places
Page 13 of 44
of the cut to traffic, the fill above the bottom of the paving slab shall be made with suitable
material well tamped into place and this fill shall be topped with a minimum of at least one
inch of bituminous mixture which is suitable to maintain the opening in good condition
until permanent restoration can be made. The crown of the temporary restoration shall not
exceed one inch above the adjoining pavement. The permittee shall exercise special care in
making such temporary restorations and must maintain such restoration in safe traveling
condition until such time as permanent restorations are made. The asphalt which is used
shall be in accordance with the specifications of the town public works director. If in the
judgment of the town public works director it is not expedient to replace the pavement over
any cut or excavation made in the street upon completion of the work allowed under such
permit by reason of the looseness of the earth or weather conditions he may direct the
permittee to lay a temporary pavement of wood or other suitable material designated by

During said five year period no excavation permit shall be issued to open, cut, or excavate

discretion, allow a requested opening, cut, or excavation to take place, provided that as a
condition of issuance of the encroachment permit the permittee is obligated to install a one

which the opening, cut, or excavation takes place.
C. Every town department or official charged with responsibility for any work that may
necessitate any opening, cut or excavation in the street is directed to take appropriate
measures to perform such excavation work in a timely manner so as to avoid the necessity
for making any openings, cuts or excavations in the new pavement in the town street during
said five year period. (Ord 571 § 1, 1996.)

been found necessary on a water supply line entering a water user's premises, then any
and all water supply lines from the Town’s mains entering such premises, buildings, or
structures shall be protected by an approved backflow prevention assembly. The type of
assembly to be installed will be in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 756 § 2, 2004)
4. Where Protection is Required.
a. Each service connection from the Town water system for supplying water to premises
having an auxiliary water supply shall be protected against backflow of water from
the premises into the public water system unless the auxiliary water supply is an
approved water supply.
b. Each service connection from the Town water system for supplying water to premises
on which any substance is handled in such fashion as may allow its entry into the
water system shall be protected against backflow of the water from the premises into
the public system. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters
originating from the Town water system which have been subjected to deterioration
on sanitary quality. Backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed on the service
connection to any premises having (i) internal cross-connections that cannot be
permanently corrected and controlled to the satisfaction of the Town, or (ii) intricate
plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is
not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible
to ascertain whether or not cross-connections exist.
5. Type of Protection Required. The type of protection that shall be provided to prevent
backflow into the approved water supply shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard
that exists on the water user's premises. The type of protective assembly that shall be
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 13 – Utilities
Page 6 of 35
required (listing in an increasing level of protection) includes: double check valve assembly
(DC), reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly (RP), and an air-gap
separation (AG). The water user may choose a higher level of protection than required by the
Town. The minimum types of backflow protection required to protect the approved water
supply, at the user's water connection are given in Chapter 12, Section 14 of the Wyoming
Water Quality Rules and Regulations. Situations that are not covered in those Regulations
shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the appropriate backflow protection shall be
determined by the Town. When two (2) or more services supply water from different street
mains to the same building, structure, or premises through which an inter-street main flow
may occur, each water service shall have at least a standard check valve to be located
adjacent to and on the property side of the respective meters. Such check valve shall not be
considered adequate if backflow protection is deemed necessary to protect the mains from
pollution or contamination; in such cases the installation of approved backflow assemblies at
such service connections shall be required.
6. Backflow Prevention Assemblies.
a. Only backflow prevention assemblies, which have been approved by the Town, shall be
acceptable for installation by a water user connected to the Town’s potable water system.
The Town will provide upon request, to any affected user, a list of approved backflow
prevention assemblies.
b. Backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed in a manner prescribed in Standard
Details for Public Work Construction, as adopted by the Town. Location of the
assemblies shall be as close as practical to the user's service connection. The Town shall
have the final authority in determining the required location of a backflow prevention
assembly.
c. Air-Gap Separation (AG). The air-gap separation shall be located on the user's side of
and as close to the service connection as is practical. All piping from the service
connection to the receiving tank shall be above grade and be entirely visible. NO water
use shall be provided from any point between the service connection and the air-gap
separation. The water inlet piping shall terminate a distance of at least two pie diameters
of the supply inlet, but in no case less than one inch above the overflow rim of the
receiving tank.
d. Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP). The approved reduced
pressure principle assembly shall be installed on the user's side of and as close to the
service connection as is practical. The assembly shall be installed a minimum of twelve
inches above grade and not more than thirty-six inches above grade, measured from the
bottom of the assembly, and with a minimum of twelve inches side clearance. The
assembly shall be installed so that it is readily accessible for maintenance and testing.
Water supplied from any point between the service connection and the RP assembly shall
be protected in a manner approved by the town.
e. Double Check Valve Assembly (DC). The approved double check valve assembly shall
be installed on the user's side of and as close to the service connection as is practical. The
DC shall be installed above grade, if possible, and in a manner where it is readily
accessible for testing and maintenance. If a double check valve assembly is put below
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 13 – Utilities
Page 7 of 35
grade it must be installed in a vault such that there is a minimum of six inches between
the bottom of the vault and the bottom of the assembly, so that the top of the assembly is
a maximum of eight inches below grade, so there is a minimum of twenty-four inches of
clearance between the side of the assembly with the test cocks and the side of the vault,
and so there is a minimum of twelve inches clearance between the other side of the
assembly and the side of the vault. Special consideration must be given to double check
valve assemblies of the "Y" type. These assemblies must be installed on their "side" with
the test cocks in a vertical position so that either check valve may be removed for service
without removing the assembly. Vaults that do not have an integrated bottom must be
placed on a three-inch layer of gravel.
f. Backflow Prevention Assembly Testing and Maintenance. The owner of any premises on
which, or on account of which, backflow prevention assemblies are installed, shall have
the assemblies tested by a person who has demonstrated their competency in testing of
these assemblies to the Town. Backflow prevention assemblies must be tested at least
annually and immediately after installation, relocation or repair. The Town may require a
more frequent testing schedule if it is determined to be necessary. NO assembly shall be
placed back in service unless it is functioning as required. A report in a form acceptable
to the Town must be filed with the Town each time an assembly is tested, relocated, or
repaired. These assemblies shall be serviced, overhauled, or replaced whenever they are
found to be defective and all costs of testing, repair, and maintenance shall be borne by
the water user. The Town will supply affected water users with a list of persons
acceptable to the Town to test backflow prevention assemblies. The Town will notify
affected customers by mail when periodic testing of an assembly is required and also
supply users with the necessary forms, which must be filled out each time an assembly is
tested or repaired. Backflow Prevention Assembly Removals. Approval must be obtained
from the Town before a backflow prevention assembly is removed, relocated, or
replaced. The use of an assembly may be discontinued and the assembly removed from
service upon presentation of sufficient evidence to the Town to verify that a hazard no
longer exists or is not likely to be created in the future.
g. Relocation. An assembly may be relocated following confirmation by the Town that the
relocation will continue to provide the required protection and satisfy installation
requirements. A retest will be required following the relocation of the assembly.
h. Repair. An assembly may be removed for repair, provided the water use is either
discontinued until repair is completed and the assembly is tested and returned to service,
or the service connection is equipped with other backflow protection approved by the
Town. A retest will be required following the repair of the assembly.
i. Replacement. An assembly may be removed and replaced provided the water use is
discontinued until the replacement assembly is installed and tested. All replacement
assemblies must be approved by the Town and must be commensurate with the degree of
hazard involved. A retest will be required following the replacement of the assembly.
7. Administrative Procedures.
a.Water System Survey. The Town shall review all requests for new services to
determine if backflow protection is needed. Plans and specifications must be
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 13 – Utilities
Page 8 of 35
submitted to the Town upon request for review of possible cross-connection hazards
as a condition of service for new service connections. If it is determined that a
backflow prevention assembly is necessary to protect the public water system, the
required assembly must be installed before service will be granted. The Town may
require an on-site inspection to evaluate cross-connection hazards. The Town will
transmit a written notice requesting an inspection appointment to each affected water
user. Any water user who cannot or will not allow an on-premises inspection of
premises piping systems shall be required to install the backflow prevention assembly
or air-gap the Town considers necessary. The Town may, at its discretion, require a
re-inspection for cross-connection hazards of any premises to which it serves water.
The Town will transmit a written notice requesting an inspection appointment to each
affected water user. Any water user who cannot or will not allow an on-premises
inspection of premises piping systems shall be required to install the backflow
prevention assembly or air-gap the Town considers necessary.
b.Customer Notification - Assembly Installation. The Town will notify the water user of
the survey findings, listing the corrective actions to be taken if any are required. A
period of sixty days will be given to complete all corrective actions required,
including installation and testing of approved backflow prevention assemblies or airgap,
unless a written extension is granted. A second notice will be sent to each water
user who does not take the required corrective actions prescribed in the first notice,
within the sixty-day period allowed. The second notice will give the water user a twoweek
period to take the required corrective action. If no action is taken within the
two-week period, the Town may terminate water service to the affected water user
until the required corrective actions are taken.
c.Customer Notification - Testing and Maintenance. The Town will notify each affected
water user when it is time for the backflow prevention assembly, installed on their
service connection, to be tested, or the air-gap to be inspected. This written notice
shall give the water user thirty days to have the assembly tested or air-gap inspected,
and supply the water user with the necessary form to be completed and resubmitted to
the Town. A second notice shall be sent to each water user who does not have the
backflow prevention assembly tested or air-gap inspected as prescribed in the first
notice within the thirty-day period allowed. The second notice will give the water
user a two-week period to have the backflow prevention assembly tested or the airgap
inspected. If no action is taken within the two-week period, the Town may
terminate water service to the affected water user until the subject assembly is tested,
or air-gap inspected.
d.Water Service Termination.
i. General. When the Town encounters water users that represent a clear and
immediate hazard to the water supply that cannot be immediately abated, the
Town shall institute the procedure for discontinuing the Town’s water service.
Conditions or water uses that create a basis for water service termination shall
include, but are not limited to, the following items: (1) refusal to install a
required backflow prevention assembly or air-gap separation; (2) refusal to test a
backflow prevention assembly or inspect an air-gap separation; (3) refusal to

Administrator may authorize a recalculation of water usage. The amount of the bill will be
calculated by utilizing an average of the previous three (3) years water usage for the same month
to determine normal billing. If three (3) years of information is not available, three (3) years of
available and comparable data will be used. The reduction may be granted for amounts of usage
over the determined normal billing. In extreme circumstances, the Town Administrator may
grant this reduction for the same location for not more than three (3) consecutive months.

13.08.003 Control of sewer system.
The wastewater collection and treatment system of the Town shall be under the exclusive control
of the Mayor and Town Council who may from time to time direct any construction of such
works, and placing of mains, as the necessity of the Town may require. The base charge, flow
rates, biochemical oxygen demand charges, and total suspended solids charges may be changed
from time to time by ordinance of the Town Council. (Ord. 1070 § 1, 2014; Ord. 745 § 2, 2003)
13.08.010 Purpose.
The purpose of the following sections shall be to generate sufficient revenue to pay all costs for
the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater system. The cost shall be distributed
to all users of the wastewater system in proportion to each user's contribution to the total loading
of the treatment works. Factors such as strength (BOD and SS), volume, and delivery flow rate
characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user's contribution to insure a
proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to each user (or user class).
(Ord. 745 § 2, 2003; Ord. 259 § 2 (part), 1979.)
13.08.011 Determining the total annual cost of operation and maintenance.
The Town shall determine the total annual costs of operation and maintenance of the wastewater
system, which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of
the treatment works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost
of operation and maintenance shall include but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment
replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests, and a
reserve fund. (Ord. 745 § 2, 2003; Ord. 259 § 2 (part), 1979.)
13.08.012 Determining each user's wastewater contribution percentage.
A. The Town shall determine each user's volume of wastewater, which has been discharged to
the wastewater system, by the water metering system. Each user shall be charged a base
charge and a volume rate, in accordance with Section 13.08.013, per thousand gallons by the
reading on their water meter.
B. For single-family residential users, the Town will calculate an average monthly winter water
usage, by using the water meter readings for the months of January, February, and March, to
be used for billing wastewater volume charges for the entire year. The lower of this average
water use or the actual water use will be applied to the volume rate schedule in Section
13.08.013 beginning every May 1 and ending every April 30, when a new average monthly
winter water usage will be calculated. Multi-family residential users will not be eligible for
the average monthly winter water usage method. Multi-family residential is defined as four
or more residential units being served by one water meter. Single-family residence shall be
defined as a residential dwelling unit where the dwelling unit is individually owned and the
occupants are permanent in nature. (Ord.894 § 1, 2008; Ord. 745 § 2, 2003).
C. When calculating the average monthly winter water use, the least amount of monthly water
usage allowed in the calculation is 3,000 gallons per month. Appeals of the average monthly

D. Any commercial user who can show increased usage for the purpose of lawn/landscape
watering will have their volume usage charge reduced based upon the square footage of area
covered by watering. The Parks and Recreation department usage on a square footage basis
on its parks shall be used as the amount of water used per square foot. In no case will the
commercial user have their volume usage reduced below their average monthly winter water
usage as calculated by using the water meter readings for the most recent months of January,
February, and March. (Ord. 745 § 2, 2003.)
13.08.013 Wastewater rates.
A. Charges for wastewater system service shall include four components: a base charge and
volume rates for flow, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids
(TSS).
Base Charges:
Monthly fixed charge based on meter size

choose one during which to run the sampling and testing. Re-classifications will only be
allowed during peak seasons and must run for the seven consecutive days specified.
Tests for BOD and TSS shall be run for each of the seven days.
6) The applicant contacts the Town to initiate installation inspection of re-classification
equipment and the laboratory contacts the town to request authorization for reclassification.
7) Laboratory verifies compliance with sampling, metering, and analytical requirements.
8) The Town randomly inspects re-classification set-ups.
9) The applicant submits complete data to the Town within thirty days for calculation of
surcharge values (regardless of whether or not the new surcharge values will result in a
reduction).
10) The Town verifies final results of re-classification, notifies the applicant of effective
dates for new surcharge values, and activates new billing values.
There will be no retroactive adjustments based on a re-classification. All billing changes will be
made on a prospective basis only. (Ord. 745 § 2, 2003)

water consumption has significantly increased due to other catastrophic events, the Town
Administrator may authorize a recalculation of water usage for determining sewer fees. The
amount of the bill will be calculated by utilizing an average of the previous three (3) years water
usage for the same month to determine normal billing. If three (3) years of information is not
available, three (3) years of available and comparable data will be used. The reduction may be
granted for amounts of usage over the determined normal billing. In extreme circumstances, the

Upon receipt of written verification from a licensed medical doctor indicating that a patient
under his or her care is in need of life sustaining treatment, or treatment that will improve the
quality of life of a chronically or terminally ill person, and involves the use of unusually large
amounts of water at the patient’s residence, upon written approval of the Town Administrator,
the user may receive a waiver of fees for all sewer use attributable to such treatment. The waived
portion of the fees shall be calculated as the difference between the historical metered
consumption at the residence by the user, and the metered consumption measured after the
medical treatment is begun. In the event the patient is a new water user, or there is no historical
metered consumption at the residence, a representative average of use by residences in the
immediate vicinity shall be used as the base rate to be subtracted from the metered consumption
measured after the medical treatment is begun. (Ord. 747 § 2, 2003; Ord. 616 § I, 1999)

15.30.160 Specific standards.
15.30.170 Floodways.
15.30.010 Findings of fact.
A. The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic inundation which results in threats
to loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special
flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored,
damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from damage also contribute to the flood loss.
15.30.020 Statement of purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to accomplish the following:
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of
special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas:
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 15 – Buildings and Construction
Page 34 of 62
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;
and
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for
their actions.
15.30.030 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish the purposes of this chapter, methods and provisions for
accomplishing the following shall be adopted:
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to
water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights
or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood
damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
15.30.040 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted
so as to give them the meaning they have in common use and to give this chapter its most
reasonable application.
• “Alluvial fan flooding” means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar
landform, which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active

B. Conditions for Variances.
1. Generally, Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements
to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to a and surrounded by
lots with existing structures constructed below the base level, providing paragraphs a
through k of subdivision 4 of subsection A of this section have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justifications required for
issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places
without regard to the procedures set forth in the rest of this section.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the Variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon the following:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. A determination that failure to grant the Variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
c. A determination that the granting of a Variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subdivision 4
of subsection A of this section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
6. Any applicant to whom a Variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor below the base flood elevation
and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
7. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure and the Variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

15.30.170 Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.30.060 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.30.150.

B. Summary of Housing Programs.
The general goal of all housing programs covered by the Housing Department Rules and
Regulations is to provide and maintain housing affordable to persons and families who make a
living primarily from employment located in Teton County, Wyoming. The housing programs
addressed in the Housing Department Rules and Regulations are: Affordable Ownership,
Affordable Rental, Workforce Ownership, and Workforce Rental. Legacy programs (including
Accessory Residential Units, Attainable units, Employee units, and Employment-based units) are
referenced in some properties’ restrictions, so these Housing Department Rules and Regulations
also contain the rules that pertain to these programs.
Descriptions of Applicable Programs:
1. Accessory Residential Units (ARU) – Units created through this program are developed
as part of nonresidential developments that are exempt from the housing requirements set
by the LDRs. These units are rented to workers employed in Teton County, and they
must remain as rental property (i.e., they cannot be converted to condominiums).
Accessory Residential Units developed after June 4, 2018 will be part of the “Workforce
Rental” program. To qualify to rent these units, at least one person in the household must
be employed at a local business for a minimum of 1,560 hours per year. They may not
own residential real estate within 150 miles of Teton County. A minimum of 75% of the
household’s income must be earned from a local business(es) The tenants must physically
occupy the unit a minimum of 80% of their lease term. Tenants will be required to
requalify annually or upon lease renewal. The units are not allowed to remain vacant in
excess of 60 days. Rents are set by the owner.
2. Affordable – These are units created through the mandatory affordable housing
mitigation requirements included in the Town and County Land Development
Regulations (LDRs). The Affordable housing program is divided into “Affordable
Ownership” and “Affordable Rental,” and each has restricted pricing based on applicable
affordability ranges. To qualify to purchase these units, household income and assets
must be within the relative income range for the unit. At least one person in the
household must work a minimum of 1,560 hours per year. No ownership of other
residential real estate within 150 miles of Teton County is allowed. The owners must
physically occupy the units a minimum of 10 months each year. Tenants must physically
occupy the units a minimum of 80% of their lease term. Tenants will be required to
requalify annually. Owners will be required to provide proof of continued local
employment, occupancy, and non-ownership of residential real estate. Maximum rents
and sales prices are based on median family income as published by HUD. Ownership
units appreciate based on the Consumer Price Index.
3. Attainable – These units were built before housing standards were codified in the LDRs.
No more Attainable housing units will be constructed, but the Housing Department Rules
and Regulations still apply through the management of existing units. Specific
requirements for these units are recorded as covenants on the property deed, and the
Housing Department Rules and Regulations are referenced through these covenants. To
qualify to purchase these units, household income and assets must be within the relative
income range for the unit. At least one person in the household must work a minimum of
1,560 hours per year. No ownership of other residential real estate within 150 miles of
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 3 of 78
Teton County is allowed at time of purchase. The owners must physically occupy the
units a minimum of 10 months each year. No requalification or future documentation will
be required after purchase of the unit.
4. Employee – These rental housing units are built to comply with the housing mitigation
requirements for new nonresidential development set out in the Town and County LDRs.
Initially, these units were intended to provide housing to seasonal workers, but they are
not restricted to occupancy by seasonal workers. These Housing Department Rules and
Regulations have been updated to reflect the Town and County’s policy direction in
2017, which aligns with the Comprehensive Plan’s goal of housing the local year-round
workforce. The owner of the Employee housing units ultimately makes the decision
about unit tenancy so long as the household qualifies. These units can be converted to
condominiums for workforce employers. Employee units developed after June 4, 2018
will be part of the “Affordable Rental” program. To qualify to rent these units, household
income must be within the relative income range for the unit. At least one person in the
household must work a minimum of 1,560 hours per year. No ownership of other
residential real estate within 150 miles of Teton County is allowed. Tenants will be
required to requalify annually. The units are not allowed to remain vacant in excess of 60
days.
5. Employment-Based – This is a program that the Town of Jackson initiated to create
restricted ownership units for sale to households that are employed in Teton County, but
do not fit within the affordability ranges set out in the LDRs. These units are not
developed under a mandatory requirement set out in the Town’s LDRs. Employment-
Based units developed after June 4, 2018 will be part of the “Workforce Ownership”
program. To qualify to purchase these units, at least one person in the household must be
employed at a local business for a minimum of 1,560 hours per year. They may not own
residential real estate within 150 miles of Teton County. A minimum of 75% of the
household’s income must be earned from a local business(es). Owners must physically
occupy the units for a minimum of 10 months of each year. Owners will be required to
re-qualify annually.
6. Workforce Housing Programs – This program is divided into “Workforce Rental” units
and “Workforce Ownership” units. They are provided through incentives in the LDRs.
Households who purchase or rent Workforce units are required to earn a minimum of
75% of their income from a local business. They may not own other residential real estate
within 150 miles of Teton County, and at least one person in the household must earn
1,560 hours annually from a local business. There is no cap on the original purchase
price. Once a unit is sold or rented, the maximum resale price or rental rate is restricted
to an appreciation cap on the unit as indicated in the Special Restrictions recorded on the
property. The owners of Workforce Rental Units set the rental rates. There is no cap on
rental rates. Owners and tenants will be required to re-qualify annually.
16.10.100 Purpose and General Goals.
A. Purpose – The Jackson/Teton County Affordable Housing Department (“Housing
Department”) was created by Teton County, Wyoming and the Town of Jackson,
Wyoming on March 14, 2016 Town Resolution 16-04 and County Resolution 16-008.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 4 of 78
The purpose of these Housing Department Rules and Regulations (“Housing Rules”) is to
provide comprehensive and consistent provisions that apply to housing units created
through the Town or County established housing programs and/or administered by the
joint Town of Jackson/Teton County Housing Department (hereafter “Housing
Department”).
The Housing Department Rules and Regulations were formerly known as the
“Guidelines.” When the Housing Guidelines are referenced in documents promulgated
prior to the adoption of the 2018 Housing Department Rules and Regulations, the
reference of guidelines refers to these Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
1. Applicability.
a. Subject to Provisions that are Unique to Specific Program - Each housing
program covered in these Housing Department Rules and Regulations is
subject to provisions that are unique to that program as indicated in these
Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
b. Subject to Provisions of the Restrictions Recorded on the Property - Restricted
housing units are subject to individual deed restrictions, special restrictions, or
ground leases, (collectively “restrictions”) which may have additional
requirements or provisions. If the Housing Department Rules and Regulations
and the restrictions conflict, then the language, requirement, and/or provision
of the Restrictions shall be applied and followed, not the Housing Department
Rules and Regulations. The Restrictions recorded on the property supersede
any inconsistency in these Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
c. Subject to Federal Fair Housing Law (The Fair Housing Amendments Act of
1988) - The Housing Department recognizes that the Office of Fair Housing
and Equal Opportunity administers and enforces federal laws and establishes
policies that ensure that all Americans have equal access to the housing of
their choice. The Housing Department does business in accordance with the
Federal Fair Housing Law (The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988).
i. Discrimination - It is Illegal to discriminate against any person because of
race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin in the
sale or rental of housing, in the financing of housing, in the provision of
real estate brokerage services, or in the appraisal of housing.
a) Filing a Complaint - Anyone who feels he or she has been
discriminated against may file a complaint of housing discrimination
to the HUD Housing Discrimination Hotline, 1-800-669-9777 (Toll
Free), or the TDD line for the hearing impaired, 1-800-927-9275.
ii. Blockbusting - Blockbusting is also prohibited. Blockbusting is the
practice of illegally frightening homeowners by telling them that people
who are members of a particular race, religion, or national origin are
moving into their neighborhood and that they should expect a decline in
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 5 of 78
the value of their property. The purpose of this scheme is to get the
homeowners to sell at a deflated price.
d. Disclaimer - The Jackson/Teton County Affordable Housing Department
(“Housing Department”) expressly disclaims any and all warranties, express
or implied, including without limitation fitness for a particular purpose with
respect to the provision of restricted housing units. The Housing Department
does not represent, warrant, or promise to construct, finance, or otherwise
produce, in whole or in part, any restricted housing units pursuant to these
Housing Department Rules and Regulations or under any other programs. No
applicant may rely upon any promise implied or expressed that restricted
housing units shall be constructed, financed, or otherwise produced, in whole
or in part, by the Housing Department. In no event shall the Housing
Department be liable to any applicant for any direct, indirect, incidental,
punitive, or consequential damage of any kind whatsoever, including without
limitation lost profits, lost sales, lost business, lost opportunity, lost
information, lost or wasted time. None of the information contained in these
Housing Department Rules and Regulations constitutes an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy a restricted housing unit.
B. General Policy Goals – The general goal of all housing programs covered by these
Housing Department Rules and Regulations is to provide and maintain housing
affordable to persons and families who make a living primarily from employment located
in Teton County, Wyoming, which includes the Affordable, Attainable, Employee,
Employment-Based, Accessory Residential Unit, and Workforce housing programs. This
is accomplished by regulating the occupancy, use, sale and/or rental of the restricted
housing units covered by the Housing Department Rules and Regulations to qualified
households as defined herein.
1. Promoting Economic and Social Diversity - Certain housing programs also limit
initial eligibility of qualified households based on financial means criteria, which
may include both household income and household net assets. Such financial
qualifying factors promote economic and social diversity within the Jackson Hole
community.
2. Ensuring Long-Term Affordability - Many of the restricted housing units covered
by these Housing Department Rules and Regulations are subject to price
limitations for sale, resale and/or rental. These limitations are intended to ensure
affordability for both the current household occupying the restricted housing unit
and to ensure the long-term affordability of the restricted housing unit.
3. Providing Housing for the Local Workforce - Minimum occupancy requirements
apply to all restricted housing units to ensure that the unit meets the community’s
goals of providing housing for the local workforce by maximizing the space and
filling the bedrooms, and to ensure that the restricted housing unit does not serve
as a second home.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 6 of 78
4. Providing Fair and Consistent Administration - These Housing Department Rules
and Regulations are intended to provide clear, fair, and consistent administration
of the housing programs to which they apply. It is recognized that there are
individual households or restricted housing units that may not fit clearly into the
specific provisions of the Housing Department Rules and Regulations, but still
meet these general policy goals. For these cases, exception, appeal, and grievance
processes have been included in Section 16.10.007 Compliance and Exception,
Appeal, and Grievance Standards and Procedures.
C. Relationship to Land Development Regulations – The Town of Jackson and Teton
County Land Development Regulations (LDRs) set out standards for the development
and use of land within each jurisdiction. The LDRs include requirements for certain
developments to provide affordable housing or fees to offset the additional housing need
that the developments create. Specific programs address different types of development.
The Planning Department of each jurisdiction reviews development applications to check
for compliance with the LDRs.
These Housing Department Rules and Regulations impose additional requirements on the
developers of any type of restricted housing units. The Housing Department reviews
compliance with these Housing Department Rules and Regulations, both prior to
development and during occupancy and use.
1. Standards Applicable Under LDRs versus Housing Department Rules and
Regulations - Generally, the LDRs address any provisions that must be met
during the development approval phase, while the Housing Department Rules and
Regulations address provisions that ensure proper use and maintenance of the
restricted housing units throughout their lifetime.

16.10.200 Housing Development Standards and Procedures.
A. Purpose - The Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan lists three common
community values, one of which is quality of life. One of the ways called out to achieve
quality of life is through local workforce housing. With regards to workforce housing, the
Comprehensive Plan includes the four following principles:
1. Maintain a diverse population by providing workforce housing
2. Strategically locate a variety of housing types
3. Reduce the shortage of housing that is affordable to the workforce
4. Use a balanced set of tools to meet our housing goal
The Town of Jackson and Teton County have several tools to increase the amount of
housing that is affordable to the workforce. One of these tools is the requirement and/or
incentive in the LDRs for residential and non-residential development to provide
permanently restricted workforce housing. This housing represents a substantial and
long-term public investment. As such, it is imperative the restricted housing produced be
livable and of good quality.
This section, Housing Development Standards and Procedures, is meant to provide
guidance to the prospective developers of restricted housing units. Subsection B lays out
the requirements of the Housing Mitigation Plan, which is reviewed by both the Planning
Department and the Housing Department. Subsection C sets out the Livability Standards,
which are under the Housing Department’s purview.
1. Applicability - This Section applies to all developments subject to Division 6.3 of the
County LDRs and Division 6.3 of the Town LDRs. It also applies to any restricted
housing units not required through the LDRs that are presented to the Board of
County Commissioners or Town Council in development applications.
2. General Policy Goals.
a. Inform Developers of Standards and Procedures - These Housing Development
Standards and Procedures inform prospective developers of the standards and
guidelines for construction and sale of restricted housing units, as required by the
LDRs and the Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
b. Provide Fair and Consistent Implementation of Standards and Procedures - These
Housing Development Standards and Procedures help the Housing Department
implement policies of the LDRs and the Housing Department Rules and
Regulations in a fair and consistent manner.
B. Housing Mitigation Plan - A Housing Mitigation Plan for each project shall be
submitted according to the provisions of the Teton County and Town of Jackson LDRs
[See Teton County Land Development Regulations: Divisions 6.3 and 7.4 or Town of
Jackson Land Development Regulations: Divisions 6.3 and 7.4]. A packet with a
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 8 of 78
checklist for a Housing Mitigation Plan can be obtained through the Housing Department
or the Town or County Planning Departments.
1. Procedures.
a. Consultation with Applicant (Optional) - Applicants may meet with Housing
Department staff prior to submitting a Housing Mitigation Plan. Although this
step is not required, it is often helpful for the applicant and the Housing
Department staff to discuss the development proposal and how it meets the LDRs
and Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
b. Review - Applications for development that have been submitted to the Town or
County Planning and/or Building Departments are reviewed by the Housing
Department for compliance with these Housing Department Rules and
Regulations.
c. Streamlined Applications - Applications that have housing units required that are
allowed to go directly to building permit are required to get their units approved
by the Housing Department prior to submitting for building permit.
2. Content - The Housing Mitigation Plan contains some provisions that fall under the
purview of the Planning Department, while others fall under the purview of the
Housing Department. Specifically, the Housing Department oversees the Livability
Standards. Developers should refer to the LDRs for requirements such as the
mitigation methods, the mix of units by number of bedrooms and the mix of units by
affordability ranges.
a. Mitigation Method - See Teton County Land Development Regulations: Division
6.3 or Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations: Division 6.3.
b. Requirement Calculation - See Teton County Land Development Regulations:
Division 6.3 or Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations: Division 6.3.
c. Fee Calculations - If the developer proposes Fees In-Lieu as the preferred form of
mitigation, the developer shall submit the proposed amount with a Final
Development Plan.
The Planning Department shall update the fees in-lieu for the restricted housing
units on an annual basis. Fees in-lieu figures are available at the Planning
Department.
d. Unit Descriptions.
i. Unit Size - There is no minimum or maximum unit size based on square
footage. Size by bedroom mix is located in the LDRs.
ii. Rental/Sale Mix - As part of the Housing Mitigation Plan, the developer shall
state which units are intended as rentals and which are intended as ownership
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 9 of 78
in accordance with the LDRs (See Teton County Land Development
Regulations: Division 6.3 or Town of Jackson Land Development
Regulations: Division 6.3).
iii. Mix of Units by Number of Bedrooms - The intent of the restricted housing
programs is to provide a variety of unit types to meet the housing needs of
our diverse workforce. The Town and County LDRS set out the specific
occupational requirements for housing units. The mix of units by number of
bedrooms in each unit is also determined by the Town and County LDRs.
iv. Distribution of Income Ranges- See Teton County Land Development
Regulations: Division 6.3 or Town of Jackson Land Development
Regulations: Division 6.3.
e. Special Restriction Form and Process - A Special Restriction is a contract
between the Board of County Commissioners/Town of Jackson and the owner of
real property developed or designated to satisfy the Town or County LDRs. It
also applies to other restricted housing units that will be administered by the
Housing Department. Special Restrictions shall keep the restricted housing units
affordable in perpetuity and provide proper notification of this obligation to
subsequent buyers or other interested parties. (See Teton County Land
Development Regulations: Division 6.3 or Town of Jackson Land Development
Regulations: Division 6.3).
i. Requirement - The developer shall record Special Restrictions in the
public land records for the subject property prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy by the County or Town.
ii. Process - The Housing Department shall prepare special restrictions
according to the process below. Restrictive covenant templates are
available from the Housing Department or the Housing Department
website.
a) Special Restriction Information Sheet - The developer shall complete
the “Special Restriction Information Sheet” and submit to the Housing
Department. This form is found at the Housing Department website, or
at the Housing Department offices. There are four types of restrictions,
Workforce Ownership, Workforce Rental, Affordable Ownership, and
Affordable Rental.
b) Preparation of Special Restriction - The Housing Department will
prepare the special restriction and provide the document to the
developer for review via email or other delivery method.
c) Review - Once reviewed by the developer for accuracy, the Housing
Department and the developer (“declarant”) will sign the special
restriction and deliver to the County or Town for the required
signature.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 10 of 78
d) Developer Responsibilities - The developer is responsible for signing
the special restriction, recording the special restriction with the Teton
County Clerk, and paying for the recording fees. The original
restriction will be returned to the Jackson/Teton County Housing
Department office. The Housing Department shall witness the
recording.
e) Modification/Amendment - The developer shall not make
modifications to the special restrictions with the exception that when
an alternate housing program is approved by the Town Council or
County Commissioners. Modifications or amendments to the restricted
covenant must beapproved by the Town Council or Teton County
Commissioners. The developer or owner may be responsible for any
legal costs to amend a restrictive covenant.
C. Livability Standards - To meet the community’s goals of providing working families a
viable choice of housing, to protect social diversity, and to contribute to economic
stability, the LDRs and the Housing Department Rules and Regulations require that
restricted housing units are designed to provide adequate size, building and site design,
and finishings to serve future tenants. These are all criteria in the Housing Department’s
decisions as to whether a development meets the goals of the LDRs and the Housing
Department Rules and Regulations. For additional construction standards, see Teton
County Land Development Regulations: Division 6.3 or Town of Jackson Land
Development Regulations: Division 6.3.
1. Process - These Livability Standards are associated with interior components of the
units, functionality, light, and outdoor space. Review by the Housing Department will
be completed during the planning process and at time of building permit. It is
encouraged that applicants review restricted housing unit designs with the Housing
Department early in the design process.
Restricted housing units will also be subject to Planning Department review, as some
livability standards are requirements of the LDRs (See Teton County Land
Development Regulations: Division 6.3 or Town of Jackson Land Development
Regulations: Division 6.3).
2. Intent - The livability standards in the LDRs do not include minimum size
requirements for units. To ensure functionality of units regardless of size, these
Livability Standards have been adopted. The Housing Department may consider
flexibility within these standards as long as the intent of functionality is being met.
All building, plumbing, electrical, and fire code requirements are still required to be
met. These standards do not supersede other requirements.
Restricted housing units are expected to be designed with logical and functional room
layout. This includes adequate space for normal living based on two (2) persons per
one-bedroom unit, three (3) persons per two-bedroom unit, and four (4) persons per
three-bedroom unit and adequate circulation pathways through the unit based on a
reasonable furniture configuration.

The request must include a detailed explanation of why the applicant wishes to
diverge from these Livability Standards, and how the proposed difference is
meeting the intent of these Livability Standards. Detailed drawings of what is
being proposed shall also be submitted (See Section 7-3)
3. Acceptance of Restricted Housing Units - Proposed floor plans will be reviewed by
the Housing Department at time of Sketch Plan submittal, Final Development Plan
submittal and/or other permit submittal. Proposed unit designs and components must
be approved by the Housing Department prior to submittal for building permit. The
Housing Department will inspect all restricted units before certificate of occupancy to
ensure that the unit is built according to the approved designs.

C. Eligibility - Households may be required to meet one or all of the following eligibility
criteria to be eligible to purchase, rent and / or occupy a housing unit. The restriction on
the housing unit and / or the specific housing program will determine if additional
eligibility requirements apply.
1. Household Income - Eligibility Criteria differs between units that are targeted to
different affordability ranges. The “Household Income and Asset Chart” that sets
income and asset requirements is updated annually and published on the Housing
Department website. It can also be obtained from the Housing Department.
a. Affordability Ranges - Below are the affordability ranges based on percentage of
Median Family Income (MFI) as calculated by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD). Legacy units restricted prior to 2018 adoption of
Housing Mitigation Standards in the LDRs used different “income categories.”
These income categories will still apply to legacy units that set out these income
categories in the unit’s restrictive covenants.

Legacy Units developed prior to 2018 adoption of Housing Mitigation
Standards. Households are eligible for these Employee housing units if they
make up to 120% MFI. If this is inconsistent with the deed restriction
recorded on the particular Employee Housing Unit, the deed restriction shall
supersede these Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
iv. Employment-Based - There is no income eligibility for Employment-Based
units. However, at least 75% of the household’s combined income must be
earned from a business or organization located in Teton County continuously
during ownership. If one (1) person in the household is at the age the Social
Security Administration allows a person to begin receiving Social Security,
their income will no longer be used to calculate the 75% of household income
from a local business.
v. Workforce Housing Program - There is no income eligibility for Workforce
housing units. However, at least 75% of the household’s combined income
must be earned from a business or organization located in Teton County

Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 21 of 78
Security, their income will no longer be used to calculate the 75% of
household income from a local business.
vi. Other Restricted Housing Units - Income eligibility for other restricted
housing units may be set out in restrictive covenants that apply to the
particular restricted housing unit.
b. Calculation of Income -Household income is based on the current income earned
by all intended adult occupants of the restricted housing unit at estimated closing
date and is calculated by the Housing Department using the current household
income to estimate an annual (12 month) income basis. W-2 earners who have
inconsistent incomes and have the same jobs as prior years will have their income
averaged over three (3) years or less if less than three (3) years were worked.
Households must use their current income and may not make changes or
adjustments to earnings in order to fit into a category. Any changes to income
must be given to the Housing Department prior to the initiation of a weighted
drawing process in order to be eligible to enter the weighted drawing.
i. College-Aged Children - The income of adult children who are members of
the household and who are attending college will not be counted.
ii. Business Income - Gross income is used minus cash expenses.
a. Businesses that do not have 2 full prior years of income:
i. Tax returns are used to get gross income earned in the first year
of business minus cash expenses (if taxes have not been paid,
the Profit and Loss will be used for that year to get gross
income minus cash expenses).The gross income will be divided
by the number of months the business was operating during
that year. That number will be multiplied by 12 to get one year
of income for the first year.
ii. If the business has a full year of income in the second year of
operation, the tax returns will be used to get gross income
minus cash expenses. This will be the income for the second
year.
iii. If there is no income for the current year. The first and second
years will be averaged.
iv. If there is income for the current year, the Year to Date (YTD)
Profit and Loss will be used to get gross income minus cash
expenses. The gross income will be divided by the number of
months to date in the current year. That number will be
multiplied by 12 to get one year of income for the current year.
v. The current year will then be averaged with the past year(s).
vi. If there is only the current year, the current year number will be
used.
b. Businesses that have 2 full prior years of income:
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 22 of 78
i. Tax returns will be used for each of the 2 prior years.
ii. The gross income minus cash expenses for each year will be
used.
iii. For the current year, the YTD Profit and Loss will be used. The
gross income minus cash expenses divided by the number of
months to date in the current year to get average monthly
income. The average monthly income will be multiplied by 12
to get one year of income for the current year.
iv. The current year will be averaged with the 2 prior years.
v. If there is no income for the current year, Step 1 will be used to
calculate for 3 prior years and the 3 prior years will be
averaged.
vi. If the third prior year is the first year the business was
operating, tax returns will be used to get gross income minus
cash expenses. The gross income will be divided by the
number of months the business was operating in that year to
get average monthly income. Average monthly income will be
multiplied by 12 to get one full year for the first year in
business.
c. Seasonal Businesses:
i. 1. The steps above will be used to get average monthly
income. The average monthly income will be multiplied by 12
to get one full year of income.
iii. Household Members - All individuals who are intending to occupy the unit
must be included on the application. All adults not attending college and/or
age 25 or older must include income and assets on the application. For
Affordable units, adults not listed on the application may not reside in the
home within the first year and without prior approval from the Housing
Department. For Workforce units, additional adults may reside in the home at
any time, but the household must qualify and have approval from the Housing
Department. No approval will be given to either Affordable or Workforce
owners without all adult occupantssigning an Occupancy Agreement. For
Affordable units, divorces must be finalized prior to closing on the home. For
Workforce units divorces are not required to be finalized, and applicants are
allowed to apply without their spouse, and the spouse’s income/assets, etc.
will not be counted.
2. Household Net Assets - Eligibility for some restricted housing units is also based on a
qualifying household’s net assets.
a. Calculation of Net Assets - Household net assets include the value of all assets
over $500 in value including, but not limit too, bank accounts, investment
accounts, life insurance, furniture, automobiles, jewelry, computer equipment,
real estate, and recreational equipment; less any debt the household has. Net
assets do not include retirement accounts, unless money will be withdrawn to be
used as a down payment or closing costs. Business assets are limited to liquid
assets.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 23 of 78
Total household net assets shall not exceed two times the four-person household
Income requirement for the income category of the housing unit. All household
members’ shares of liquid business assets shall be included in determination of
total household net assets. Net assets of all household members shall be combined
in determination of total household net assets. See the “Household Income and
Asset Chart” for net asset thresholds, which is updated annually and published on
the Housing Department website. A copy may be obtained from the Housing
Department.
Rental units do not have asset limits.
b. Ownership of Real Property.
i. Ownership at Time of Application - At the time of application, a Household
may own other undeveloped or developed residential or commercial property.
The fair market value of such property will be taken into consideration when
determining household net assets. A price opinion using a market analysis will
be obtained by the Housing Department through a local real estate firm within
thirty (30) days from the date of submittal of an application for a restricted
housing unit to determine fair market value of the other undeveloped or
developed property. The owner of the property will be solely responsible to
pay for the price opinion in conjunction with submittal of the Housing
Department Application.
a) Ownership of Commercial Property - A household will be able to maintain
ownership of commercial property.
b) Designation of Mobile Homes - Mobile homes situated in a mobile home
park or on other land with hook-ups to water/sewer and electricity will be
considered residential property, and thus, will be required to be sold as
with other residential property. If the mobile home is not situated in a
mobile home park or other land with hook-ups to water/sewer and
electricity, it will only be considered an asset.
c) Rental Income and Rental Assets - Rental income from any residential real
estate will be counted toward household income and the asset will be
counted toward net assets.
c. Required Sale of Residential Property - Once under contract for a restricted
housing unit, the qualifying Household must list residential property (developed
or undeveloped), located within 150 miles driving distance from the Town of
Jackson, for sale at a price commensurate with the price opinion. If the property
has not sold or is not under contract after one year from the listing date, within 30
days of the year expiring, another price opinion will be obtained. If the price
opinion is lower than the listed price, the owner will have 30 days from the date
of the price opinion to lower the asking price to that of the price opinion. If after
24 months from the date first listed, the property still has not sold or gone under
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 24 of 78
contract, the Housing Manager of the Housing Department will issue an analysis
of the property with a determination of the salability of the restricted housing unit
along with the next steps required. A copy of the analysis will be provided to the
owner, and the owner will have the opportunity to appeal the determination of the
Housing Authority Board. The owner may be required to sell their restricted
housing unit if the residential property has not sold.
d. Disposition of Assets - Any member of a household who has assigned, conveyed,
transferred or otherwise disposed of property or other assets within the last two
(2) years in order to meet the net asset limitation or the property ownership
limitation shall be ineligible to purchase a restricted housing unit.
3. Readiness to Purchase - Individuals purchasing a restricted housing unit must
demonstrate readiness to purchase by showing the following:
a. Contingencies - Contingencies on lender’s qualification must be approved by the
Housing Department prior to entering a weighted drawing. Such contingencies
include but are not limited to requirement to sell property, requirement to prove
down payment via account statement, gift letter or other, and requirement to pay
off debt. Examples of proof of down payment are a letter from a family member
who may be providing a gift or a bank statement showing funds available.
b. Age - At least one individual in the household must be at least 18 years of age.
c. Execution of Legally Binding Contract - Individuals must be capable to legally
enter into a contract.
4. Homebuyer Education - Completion of the Homebuyer Education course is be
required to meet eligibility criteria to enter a weighted drawing for a restricted
housing unit and/or purchase a restricted housing unit. The required course is offered
by Wyoming Housing Network or another Housing Department approved
organization.
5. Online Intake Form - The Online Intake Form must be completed prior to entering a
weighted drawing for a home. Completion of this form will put a household on the
Housing Department’s email list, and the household will begin receiving emails with
information about homes when they are available. All advertising of homes available
will be done through email to those who have completed the Online Intake Form and
on the Housing Department website. The online Intake Form can be found on the
Housing Department’s website: jhaffordablehousing.org. This form must be
completed in its entirety and updated at least annually. It cannot be completed or
updated during a weighted drawing process that the household wishes to enter. The
Online Intake Form does not enter a household into a weighted drawing. The
weighted drawing is a separate process. See Section 16.10.004.C.5.
16.10.400 Weighted Drawing.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 25 of 78
The Affordable and Workforce Housing requirements may utilize the weighted drawing
process to select a qualified household using the procedures listed below. The weighted drawing
will be advertised on the Housing Department website, jhaffordablehousing.org, and via email to
all households that have completed the Online Intake Form. See Section 3-3e: Online Intake
Form.
A. Minimum Occupancy Requirement - In order to ensure that the units meet the intended
goals of housing the Teton County workforce and are consistent with mitigation
requirements, the following occupancy requirements for units in the Affordable Program
are:
Studio: One (1) or two (2) people
One-bedroom: One (1) or more people
Two-bedroom: Two (2) more people
Three-bedroom: One (1) or two (2) adults with two (2) or more dependents
For rental units; 3 or more people
Four-bedroom: One (1) or two (2) adults with three (3) or more dependents
For rental units; 4 or more people
For purposes of counting household size, children or adult dependents must live with the
household and be claimed as a dependent on Federal Income tax returns. Any deviation
from the minimum occupancy requirements must be approved prior to the drawing
through the exception process. There are no Minimum Occupancy Requirements for units
in the Workforce Housing Program. However, if a household enters a drawing for a
Workforce Housing unit and meets the occupancy requirements as listed above for the
Affordable Program, the household will receive an extra point (entry) in the drawing.
B. Weighted Drawing Points - Eligible households receive points that will determine the
number of entries the household will receive in the weighted drawing. One point equals
one entry in the weighted drawing. One point is assigned for each full year of consecutive
full-time employment at a local business immediately prior to entering a weighted
drawing, with a maximum of ten (10) points. One point is assigned for each qualified
critical services provider with a maximum of two (2) points. In a weighted drawing for a
Workforce unit, a household that meets the minimum occupancy requirements for the
Affordable program will receive one (1) point. The total maximum points a household
can receive is twelve (12). Households are not eligible to enter a weighted drawing until
they have one (1) full year of full-time employment in Teton County for a local business
or one (1) point.
Points are given based on one person in the household. Years working in Teton County
cannot be doubled up and must be verifiable. For example, a two-person household, one
of which has been employed in Teton County for two years and the other for four years,
would be assigned four (4) points.
To enter a drawing for an Affordable unit, the intake form must be completed prior to the
opening of a drawing and information cannot be changed during the drawing entry
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 26 of 78
period. You may not have more than one intake form. For the Workforce Program, an
intake form must be completed prior to entering a drawing. Households may only have
one (1) intake form.
1. Employment - At least one member of a household must be employed full-time in
Teton County at a local business. Full-time employment is defined as at least one
thousand five hundred sixty (1,560) hours per year or an average of at least thirty (30)
hours per week. Employment exemptions found in Section 16.10.300.B.
Qualifications apply.
a. Interruption of Employment - Interruption of employment will be allowed in
special circumstances if other employment criteria are met in Teton County,
Wyoming at least two (2) years immediately prior to the interruption of
employment. Interruption of employment will only be allowed for a maximum
period of two (2) years. Points will not be given for the time period during the
interruption of employment. Points will be given for years employed full-time at a
local business immediately prior to the interruption of employment. To obtain
points for prior employment, a household must have reestablished full-time
employment at a local business within one (1) month upon termination of the
reason for the interruption of employment. Reasons for allowed interruption of
employment include: caring for a sick or disabled immediate family member,
attending secondary school, and hospitalization. Verification documentation of
the reason for interruption of employment will be required to obtain points for
prior employment.
2. Additional Points.
a. Critical Services Provider - Qualified critical services providers, as defined in
Section 16.10.900 Definitions, may be eligible for a maximum of two (2)
additional points. Any household may not receive more than two (2) points.
However, if a household has one (1) person who qualifies as a critical services
provider for two (2) organizations, they will receive two (2) points.
The following conditions must be met to receive the critical services provider
designation and priority:
i. Critical Services Provider Designation - Organizations who believe their
employees or volunteers meet the definition of critical services provider can
apply to the Housing Department to become an approved critical services
provider organization and have certain job positions deemed ‘qualified.” The
Teton County Board of County Commissioners and the Jackson Town
Council will approve or deny critical services provider organization
applications.
a) Required Documentation - Employees who work in these “qualified”
positions for approved critical services provider organizations can enter a
weighted drawing and receive additional points. These individuals must
submit a “Critical Services Provider Supervisor Questionnaire” along with
their weighted drawing entry documents. These will be held on file for a
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 27 of 78
period of six months before needing to be updated. The Housing
Department will contact the CSP’s supervisor to update the Supervisor’s
Questionnaire.
ii. One Year of Full-Time Employment - A qualified critical services provider
must earn one (1) point for one (1) year of full-time employment in Teton
County at a local business prior to receiving points as a critical services
provider.
iii. Approval Process - Applications received by the Housing Department for
approval as Critical Services Provider Organizations will be processed by
staff. The Housing Manager will make a recommendation to the
Jackson/Teton County Housing Authority Board who will approve or deny the
application.
3. Accessible Units - Priority will be given to households with member(s) who are
mobility impaired. If more than one weighted drawing entry is received for
Accessible units, a weighted drawing will be held. If no households with members
who have mobility impairments apply, the weighted drawing will be held with all
other applicants.
4. No Qualified Entries - After a weighted drawing where no qualified entries exist, the
unit will be offered again in a weighted drawing. It will be open to households in the
next tier of the minimum occupancy requirements. If there are still no qualified
entries, the home will be offered first come, first served. The first qualified household
to submit a complete application will have the opportunity to purchase.
5. Drawing Results - Drawing results are kept on file with the Housing Department and
may be requested by the public.
16.10.500 Purchase and Sale Standards and Procedures.
A. Sale and Resale Standards.
1. Applicability - Each restricted housing program dictates both the initial sales price
and the maximum resale price. The restrictions for each unit should be consulted for
exact details.
a. Affordable Housing Program - For the Affordable housing program, these
Housing Department Rules and Regulations set out how to determine both the
initial sales price and the maximum resale price.
b. Employment-Based Housing Program - The initial sales prices and maximum
resale prices for Employment-Based housing units are determined by these
Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
c. Workforce Housing Program - The initial sales prices for Workforce housing
units are negotiated between the owner and the buyer. After the initial sale, the
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 28 of 78
value will appreciate according to the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood CPI with a
maximum of 3%. If the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood CPI no longer exists, another
similar index will be used.
d. Attainable Housing Program – The Attainable housing program does not place
limits on sale or resale prices, but buyers still must meet the qualification and
eligibility rules laid out in Section 16.10.300. Qualification and Eligibility.
e. Other Programs – For other restricted housing units, the property’s restrictions
clarify how the sale and resale prices are configured.
f. Rental Rates - For information on maximum rental rates permitted by the rental
housing programs, see Section 16.10.500.B. Tenancy and Rental Standards and
Procedures.
2. Maximum Sales Price.
The Housing Department updates the maximum sales prices for Affordable housing
units obligated by the LDRs on April 1st of each year. The maximum sales prices are
available on the Housing Department’s website or at the Housing Department. The
methodology listed below shall determine the maximum sales prices. The intent of
the maximum sales prices is to ensure initial and long-term affordability.
a. Median Family Income - Each year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) releases Median Family Income figures for Teton County,
Wyoming. The Housing Department uses this data to determine household
incomes for the applicable restricted housing units based on number of bedrooms
and persons per bedroom.
b. Household Size - The Household Size for determining maximum sales price is
based on number of persons per bedroom in the applicable restricted housing unit.
c. Affordability Range - The household income for the applicable restricted housing
unit is set at the middle of the affordability range to ensure affordability. For
example: the income range for affordability range 3 is 81% - 120% MFI;
therefore, an income of 100% MFI would be used in calculating the maximum
sales price.
d. Percentage of Income - The national standard for household affordability is that a
household does not pay more than 30% of its gross income toward housing costs.
Therefore, monthly payments (including principle, interest, taxes, insurance and
HOA dues) cannot exceed 30% of the Median Family Income for each
affordability range.
e. Maximum Sales Price Calculation - The maximum sales price for a restricted
housing unit is determined by calculating 30% of a qualifying household’s
income, using the following assumptions:
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 29 of 78
i. 22% of household income covers principal and interest,
ii. 8% of household income covers HOA dues, taxes, and insurance,
iii. Assumptions for the mortgage include: 30-year mortgage, 5% down payment,
20-year rolling average interest rate for a qualifying household earning the
median of the applicable income category.
f. Potential Variability of Maximum Sales Price.
i. The maximum sales prices will be lower if the unit is below grade, or if there
is no garage.
ii. If an owner is determined to be in default of their restrictions, the Housing
Department will have the option to purchase the property for a purchase price
equal to the maximum resale price or the appraised value, whichever is less,
subject to the Housing Department’s ability to limit appreciation and/or
reduce proceeds, and on such other terms as are provided in the restrictions.
iii. If an owner is found to be in default of their restrictions, the Housing
Department may cease the appreciation of the property when determining the
maximum resale value beginning on the known date the owner began being in
default.
3. Maximum Resale Price.
a. The intent of the maximum resale price is to ensure long-term affordability of the
restricted housing units at resale. The maximum resale price (MRP) shall be the
original purchase price (OPP) with the following adjustments:
Appreciation 3% or Denver-Boulder-Greeley CPI - Appreciation of the value of
the restricted housing unit is based on the Denver-Boulder-Greeley CPI each year
capped at 3%. The latest published numbers for Quarter 2 and Quarter 4 of each
year will be used unless the deed restrictions or ground lease specifically
reference an alternative appreciation method or no measured appreciation.
The following standards apply:
1) Date of purchase is defined as seller’s original closing date (date seller
purchased the restricted housing unit). If the closing date is on or after
the 15th of the month, the month is not counted for prorating the value.
If the closing date is before the 15th of the month, the entire month is
counted.
2) Three (3) months will be added to the date that the “Letter of Intent to
Sell” is received and will be considered the estimated closing date.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 30 of 78
3) If the Letter of Intent to Sell is received on or before the 15th of the
month, the entire month is counted. If the “Letter of Intent to Sell” is
received after the 15th of the month, the month will not be counted.
4) Each eligible whole month will be prorated.
i. Denver-Boulder-Greeley CPI - The CPI used to calculate maximum resale
prices in some restrictions is the Denver Boulder Greeley CPI. New figures
are published by the Colorado Department of Labor and Statistics twice a
year, normally in March and August. In calculating the allowed maximum
appreciation of a home, the latest reported figure will be averaged with the
other reported figure for the year and used up to the date new figures are
released. Once a Facilitation Agreement has been signed, new figures will not
affect the maximum resale price. If the Denver Boulder Greeley Colorado CPI
ceases to exist, a comparable index will be used.
ii. Northwest Wyoming Cost of Living Index - The NWCLI figure used to
calculate maximum resale prices in some ground leases is obtained from the
Wyoming State Division of Economic Analysis and is calculated with All
Items minus Housing. It is updated quarterly and released generally in June
for the First (1) Quarter, October for the Second (2nd) Quarter, December for
the Third (3rd) Quarter and March for the Fourth (4th) Quarter. The latest
reported figure will be averaged with the other reported Quarters of the year
and will be used up to the date the new figures are released. Once a
Facilitation Agreement has been signed, new figures will not affect the
maximum resale price. If the NWCLI ceases to exist, a comparable index will
be used.
iii. Flat Appreciation Rate of 2.5 Percent - The flat appreciation rate of 2.5%
found in some restrictions is not based on an index. Rather, it is based on an
analysis of incomes over 20 years, where it was found that incomes rose on
average by 2.5% per year.
b. Cost of Actual Capital Improvements - Restricted housing units that have deed
restrictions or ground leases allowing for improvement credits can add the value
of these improvements to the appreciated value to calculate the MRP based on the
following.
Credit for capital improvement expenditures on the restricted housing unit given
at resale will be no more than 10% of the OPP of the home except where the
Housing Department has determined otherwise. All capital improvements must be
pre-approved by the Housing Department and properly permitted and inspected
by the Town of Jackson or Teton County Building Official. Approval/disapproval
must be determined prior to actual construction to be considered at time of sale.
Improvements done without prior approval will not be considered for capital
improvement credit. It is the owner’s responsibility to secure any approval
necessary from the restricted housing unit’s Homeowners Association and obtain
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 31 of 78
any necessary permits prior to undertaking any Capital Improvement. Please
consult Section 16.10.50.A.5 for more details.
c. Depreciated Costs of Capital Improvements - The depreciated costs of Capital
Improvements can be added to the appreciated value to calculate the MRP, so
long as they do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the OPP or as determined by the
Housing Department on a project-specific basis. All capital improvements will be
depreciated as applicable according to the Marshall and Swift Residential Cost
Handbook or a similar resource.
d. Maintenance Adjustment - Households are required to keep restricted housing
units in a properly maintained state. Housing Department staff and/or a third-party
inspector hired by the Housing Department will inspect the property after
receiving the “Letter of Intent to Sell” from the owner. The inspector will provide
an inspection report to the Housing Department. The Housing Department may
require the owner to repair or replace items on the inspection report. The buyer
also has the opportunity to inspect the property and provide the Housing
Department with a list of items. If required repairs, replacement, or cleaning are
not made by the owner prior to the Housing Department’s final walkthrough two
(2) business days before closing, the Housing Department will estimate the costs
at its sole discretion, and an adjustment may be made to the seller’s proceeds or to
the maximum resale price. These funds will either be given to the buyer to make
the repairs or held by the Housing Department at the Housing Department’s sole
discretion. If funds are given to the buyer, the buyer will be expected to make the
repairs on their own. If the repairs are not made, the buyer will be charged when
they sell the home. If the Housing Department holds the funds, the buyer will be
reimbursed based on receipts received from the buyer. If any funds remain after
the repairs are completed, they will be released to the seller.
e. Other Costs - Any additional costs allowed by the Housing Department pursuant
to the policies in effect on the date of the restricted household’s “Letter of Intent
to Sell.”
4. Selling Procedures - All restricted housing units shall be sold in accordance with
applicable restrictions and/or these Housing Department Rules and Regulations as
determined by the Housing Department, Town and/or County, which may vary
depending on the specific housing program under which the restricted housing units
were created.
a. Letter of Intent to Sell - The seller shall submit a completed Letter of Intent to sell
form to the Housing Department to begin the selling process. The form can be
found on the Housing Department’s website or can be obtained from the Housing
Department. The Housing Department staff will set up a meeting with the seller to
review the selling process and the seller documents. The Letter of Intent must be
submitted and the meeting with the seller must occur the week prior to the
beginning of the weighted drawing entry period. See section 4. The seller shall be
given the option to choose the Title Company. If the seller has no preference, the
Housing Department will choose the Title Company. If the seller decides not to
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 32 of 78
sell the unit after submitting the Letter of Intent to sell, the seller must reimburse
the Housing Department for any costs the Housing Department has incurred.
Once the contract has been signed by buyer and seller, both parties are legally
bound by the contract.
b. Facilitation of Sale - The Housing Department facilitates the sales of restricted
housing units to accomplish the sale according the the instructions in the Grund
Lease/Deed Restriction and to provide a transfer to a Qualified Household.
Specifically, the Housing Department facilitates sales of Affordable housing
units, Employment-Based units, Workforce housine units, and Accessory
Residential Units. Sellers will be required to enter into a Facilitaton Agreement
with the Housing Department to sell their home. The Facilitiation Agreement
must be executed prior to advertising the home for sale through a weighted
drawing process.
c. Maximum Resale Letter - The resale price of the restricted housing unit shall be
calculated according to its restriction and stated in the “Maximum Resale Letter.”
Maximum resale prices will be rounded to the nearest dollar. An official copy will
be mailed, or hand delivered. A copy can be requested from the Housing
Department by email or fax. The Maximum Resale Price shall be the only
exchange of value between parties to any sale of the restricted housing unit. Any
exchange of value outside the allowed sale price shall invalidate the sale.
d. Facilitation Fee (2%) - At the closing of the sale, the seller will pay to the
Housing Department a fee equal to two percent (2%) of the sales price, unless
otherwise instructed in the deed restriction, for facilitation services. The Housing
Department may instruct the Title Company to pay such fees out of the funds held
for the seller at closing. The Housing Department may also waive the fee, or a
portion thereof, in its sole discretion.
e. Cost of Declining Inititiated Sale - If the seller decides not to sell the restricted
housing kunit at any point before closing, the seller will be responsible for all
advertising and/or other costs associated with listing the unit for sale.
f. Viewing of Unit - Once the weighted drawing is completed, the first household
drawn will be contacted by the Housing Department and a time set up to view the
unit. This viewing shall occur within five (5) business days of the household
being notified that they were selected first in the drawing. The household will
have two (2) business days to respond to the Housing Department’s efforts to
contact them to notify them that they were selected. A phone call and an email
will be sent to the household. If there is no response, the Housing Department will
move on to the next household drawn. The seller is required to make the restricted
housing unit available with reasonable notice on a minimum of two (2) occasions
to show the property to the selected household prior to going under contract.
g. Inspection - The Housing Department will order a third-party inspection to be
done on the home by a qualified home inspector. The inspection
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 33 of 78
information/report is for the use of the Housing Department and will not be
released to any buyer. Buyers shall have the option to order their own inspection
to be done on the home. It is the Housing Manager’s sole discretion as to whether
items found by an inspector will be required to be repaired. A list of items
required to be repaired will be given to the seller by the Housing Department. The
seller is expected to have the items completed no later than three (3) business days
prior to the closing date.
h. Complete Application - The household shall have five (5) business days from the
day they are notified that they were selected first in the drawing to submit a
complete application to the Housing Department. The Checklist for Complete
Application and Application form can be obtained from the Housing
Department’s website or from the Housing Department. The Housing Department
reserves the right to request additional documentation when verifying a
Household’s eligibility and qualification. If for any reason the buyer cannot close
within three (3) weeks of the seller’s timeline, the seller may choose to move on
to the next household drawn.
i. Qualification - The Housing Department shall review the application and
supporting documents and calculate income, assets, and hours worked to verify
eligibility and qualification. This process normally is complete within five (5)
business days of receiving the application. However, it may take longer in unique
circumstances. Once the Housing Department completes the review and
verification of eligibility and qualification, the applicant is notified of approval or
denial. If the applicant does not qualify, the next household drawn in the weighted
drawing will be notified and the process will start over.
j. Qualified Household Meeting - When the Housing Department has identified a
qualified household who wishes to move forward with the purchase of the home,
the qualified household will have five (5) business days to attend a meeting to
review the purchase process and purchase documents, which include the Contract
for Purchase and Sale of Residential Real Estate or Residential Improvements in
the case of a Ground Lease and the buyer’s Facilitation Agreement. The applicant
has five (5) business days from the meeting day to review and execute the
purchase documents and return them to the Housing Department with earnest
money as called for in the Contract. If the contract is not signed and returned
within five (5) business days, the next household selected in the drawing will be
notified and given the option to purchase the home if qualified. The seller shall
be notified immediately upon receipt of the signed contract and earnest money to
execute the contract. The seller shall have two (2) business days to return the
signed contract or the closing may be delayed. A copy of the contract and the
earnest money are then delivered by the Housing Department to the Title
Company.
k. Final Walk Through - A final walk through will occur generally two (2) business
days prior to the closing date. If the Housing Department finds maintenance or
repair items that have not been completed, the Housing Department will estimate
the costs of the maintenance/repair items and withhold funds from the seller’s
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 34 of 78
proceeds. The funds are then given to the buyer and the buyer is responsible for
completing the maintenance/repair items.
l. Closing - The closing will be held on or before fifty (50) days from complete
execution of the Contract. The Buyer will take possession of the unit on closing
day.
5. Capital Improvement Standards.
a. Approval Required - Owners must receive written approval from the Housing
Department prior to beginning the work in order to receive credit for the capital
improvement. To obtain approval, the “Request for Capital Improvement” form
must be submitted along with estimated costs and drawings and/or plans and a
narrative of the work to be done. Once the improvement is complete, copies of all
receipts for materials and labor must be given to the Housing Department. No
credit will be given for sweat equity.
b. Workmanlike Manner - All improvements whether approved Capital Improvents
or other must be built in a workmanlike manner, and according to Town of
Jackson or Teton County building codes. All required permits and completion
releases must be obtained from the Town or County. Any owner that does capital
improvements without obtaining the proper permits or if it is determined at the
Housing Department’s sole discretion that the improvements have not been done
in a workmanlike manner may be required to make repairs or remove the
improvements and return the home to its original condition.
c. Approved Capital Improvements - A Capital Improvement is an improvement
done to the home for which the homeowner can receive credit. The capital
improvement requires an expenditure that either increases the value of the
property or extends its life expectancy but is not a luxury item. The term
“approved capital improvement” shall only include the following:
i. Fixtures erected, installed or attached as permanent, functional, nondecorative
improvements to real property, excluding repair, replacement
and/or maintenance improvements;
ii. For the benefit of seniors and/or handicapped persons;
iii. Health and safety protection devices (including radon);
iv. Adding and/or finishing of permanent/fixed storage space;
v. Finishing of unfinished space;

necessary to such sale conveyance or transfer.
b) A nonqualified transferee shall comply with the restrictions, the Housing

Acknowledgement” form will be provided to the buyer for review prior to
closing.
c. Title Company - The Housing Department advises sellers to use a title company

their expertise with the Housing Department’s restricted housing programs and
their unique and technical closing documents. The seller and buyer shall authorize
the Housing Department to review the “Settlement Statement” prior to closing.
Sellers can select a title company and escrow agent of their choice. If no title
company is indicated, the Housing Department will select one.

lending institutions licensed to engage in mortgage lending practices in the
State of Wyoming:
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 38 of 78
a) An “institutional lender” such as, but not limited to, a federal, state, or
local housing finance agency, a bank (including savings and loan
association or insured credit union), an insurance company, or any
combination of the foregoing, the policies and procedures of which
Institutional Lender are subject to direct governmental supervision; or
b) A “community loan fund”, or similar non-profit lender to housing projects
for income-eligible persons (e.g. is not given to or acquired by any
individual person); or
c) A non-affiliated, legitimate, “finance company.” In no event shall such
finance company be an individual or any company that is affiliated with or
has any affiliation with the owner or any family member of the owner.
ii. Required Down Payment and Loan to Value Ratio - The Housing Department
requires that all buyers have at least 3.5% down payment on a purchase, and
no refinance or second mortgage obtained after the original purchase is
allowed to be higher than 95% loan to value.
iii. Debt to Income Ratio - The total debt to income ratio for a household may not
exceed 45%.
iv. Qualified Mortgage - Lenders may submit a “Qualifying Mortgage” form to
the Housing Department to have the mortgage deemed a “qualifying
mortgage.” When submitting a qualified mortgage request, a copy of the title
commitment and the Transmittal Summary (HUD Form 1008), or other
documentation containing the same information, is required to be attached.
The “Qualifying Mortgage” form can be obtained from the Housing
Department or from the Housing Department’s website.
For homes that do not have a measured appreciation, such as Attainable
homes, an appraisal recognizing the restriction on the property is required.
The Housing Department reserves the right to require additional information
before approving a mortgage as a “qualifying mortgage”.
e. Total Debt - Owners shall not incur debt, liens or other obligations secured by the
restricted housing unit that exceed 95% of the Original Purchase Price of the unit

Tenancy-In-Common must be approved by the Housing Department. All adults
occupying the unit, with the exception of children attending college, must be on
the title of the restricted housing unit or sign an Occupancy Agreement.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 39 of 78
g. Co-Signors - Co-signors are guarantors for payment of mortgage. If an exception
to the “no co-signors” rule is granted, co-signors shall not occupy the unit. Cosignors
are not co-owners, so they are not allowed on the title. No lien or security
can be placed on the property besides the mortgage itself.
h. Homeowners Associations - The restricted housing unit may be subject to a
Homeowners Association (HOA). All owners of restricted housing units are
required to pay HOA dues, and potential special assessments and fees if
applicable, unless otherwise exempted. HOA dues may be substantial and are
factored into the maximum sales price. Homeowners Associations frequently have
interests and regulations, other than the Restriction, that affects the restricted
housing unit. It is the owner’s responsibility to be aware of these interests and
regulations. Failure of an owner to comply with the HOA Rules and Regulations
or CC&Rs constitutes default of the Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
i. Homeowners’ Hazard Insurance - Owners are required to keep hazard insurance
on their homes for 100% replacement cost. Since the homes are subsidized, this
amount could be more than the price of the home. Often times Homeowners
Associations provide insurance. Depending on how much coverage the HOA
provides, the owner may be required to provide additional insurance to guarantee
complete replacement of the home. Ground lease properties are required to name
the Jackson/Teton County Housing Authority as additionally insured.
B. Tenancy and Rental Standards and Procedures - To maintain the character of
neighborhoods and respect the nature of the community, restricted ownership units are
not allowed to be rented without prior approval from the Housing Department. This

their primary residence.
a. Occupancy Requirement - Households shall occupy their home full-time at least
10 months out of each calendar year.

shall not permit any adult guests over the age of 18 for periods in excess of thirty
(30) cumulative days per calendar year.

short-term leaves of absence for education or training purposes, or other exigent
circumstances with the advance written approval of the Housing Department.

approve rental of space within owner-occupied Affordable, Employment-Based, and
Workforce units when pressing circumstances exist. The owner must continue to
occupy the unit, and the Housing Department must certify that the renter meets the

Eligibility. A fee will be charged along with the request as set forth in the Annual
Schedule of Fees.
a. Requests to Rent during Leave of absence - Approvals for “Requests to Rent” are

restricted housing unit homeowner will require documentation using the
“Housing Department Medical Emergency Leave” form to substantiate the

for a request to rent as set forth in the Annual Schedule of Fees updated
annually and published by the Housing Department.
d. Requests to Rent a Room - Approvals to rent a room in a restricted unit are at the
sole discretion of the Housing Manager and are only allowed in pressing
circumstances. The following process will be followed:

the housing costs of the owner.
C. Purchase Procedures.
1. Selection of Qualified Household - A unique process applies for selecting each
qualified household within each housing program. The following sections provide
specific details regarding each housing program. The restrictive covenant should be
consulted for exact details.
a. Weighted Drawing - In the event that the Housing Department receives one or
more weighted drawing entry sheets at the maximum resale price from qualified
households during the weighted drawing entry period, the buyer will be selected
according to preferences set for that particular Housing Program. In the event no
weighted drawing entry sheets are received during the weighted drawing entry
period, the selection process would be determined either by a bid process or a
“first come first served” process. The restrictions on the property clarify which
selection procedure to use.
i. Errors - Every effort is made by the Housing Department to ensure fair and
equitable lotteries. Lotteries are not drawn by the Housing Department.
Housing Department staff compiles weighted drawing entry sheets with all
eligible households included. The weighted drawing is drawn by outside
counsel. On the rare occasion that an error is made in compiling or drawing of
a weighted drawing, the error will be corrected and the weighted drawing will
be re-drawn.
a. Bid Process - If the restrictions require it, the qualified household submitting the
highest bid price (not to exceed the maximum resale price) during the Bid Period
shall have the first right to purchase the unit. The owner of the unit shall have the
right to accept or reject the bid.
b. No Qualified Weighted Drawing Entries – Refer to Section 16.10.004(B)(4) .
c. Other Sale/Resale Procedure.
i. Owner Selection - If the restriction permits, the owner of the restricted
housing unit may be allowed to select the qualified household. Other than
verifying that the qualified household meets the qualification and eligibility
requirements for the restricted housing unit, the Housing Department shall not
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 43 of 78
have any authority to choose the buyer of the restricted housing unit unless
authorized by the owner.
ii. Attainable Housing Program Sale Procedures.
a) When an owner wishes to sell an Attainable housing unit, they can either
list the home with a realtor or for sale by owner.
b) The owner of the Attainable housing unit is required to submit a “Letter of
Intent to Sell” to the Housing Department before listing or advertising the
unit for sale.
c) The owners will be responsible for advertising their Attainable housing
unit for sale with the exception that the Housing Department will advertise
the unit on their website at no cost to the owner.
d) There is not a maximum resale price for Attainable housing units. The
owner will set the price with the understanding that the household who
buys the unit will need to qualify under income, asset, and employment
criteria. The price may be negotiated before entering into an agreement to
purchase.
e) The buyer will be responsible for providing the “Purchase and Sale
Agreement” at the time of making an offer to purchase an Attainable
housing unit. The seller may make a counteroffer that includes changes to
the “Purchase and Sale Agreement.” The Attainable housing unit is under
contract when an offer and/or a counteroffer is accepted and both the
buyer and seller have signed it. The “Purchase and Sale Agreement” must
contain a contingency that the Housing Department must verify that the
buyer is “qualified” to purchase the Attainable housing unit. The Housing
Department will not deem a buyer “qualified” until a contract has been
executed by the seller and the potential buyer.
f) A full copy of the fully executed Purchase and Sale Agreement shall be
provided to the Housing Department. All financial information shall
remain confidential except as noted in Section 16.10.500.D.7.a. Privy to
Purchase and Sales Agreement.
g) In addition to the items listed in Section 16.10.500.D.3.a. Materials
Included with Application, applicants must also include a complete copy
of the fully executed “Purchase and Sale Agreement.”
1) Time of Submittal: The Attainable housing unit must be under contract
before the buyer provides an application to the Housing Department.
2) Time to Process: If the application is complete and thorough, the
Housing Department will have a determination of qualification within
five (5) business days of receiving the application. It may take longer
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 44 of 78
if the Housing Department has to request further information from the
applicant.
3) Qualified Buyer Letter: Once the household is deemed to be
“Qualified” to purchase the Attainable housing unit, the Housing
Department will provide a “Qualified Buyer Letter” to the applicant.
This letter will be used to verify to the seller and the title company that
the household is qualified to purchase the unit.
4) Lenders: See Section 16.10.500.A.7.d. Lenders.
5) Closing: The closing date and time is set between the sellers, buyers,
financial institution, the title company, and the Housing Department.
The buyers will be required to sign a “Buyer’s Acknowledgement” at
the time of closing. This document will certify that the buyers
acknowledge receiving a copy of the restrictions as well as agreeing to
allow the Housing Department to release the sales price of the home,
and also agreeing to the Housing Department’s right of first option to
purchase the unit in case of default by signing a Power of Attorney in
Case of Default.
2. Viewing of Restricted Housing Unit - The seller of the restricted housing unit will
allow the potential buyer to view the unit to see that it meets their household’s needs.
If the household decides to purchase the restricted housing unit, they will have the
opportunity to inspect the unit further once it is under contract.

documentation submitted with the complete application for the purchase of a
home is the documentation that will be used to qualify a buyer. Documents
will not be allowed to be changed once they are submitted (e.g. taxes
submitted will be those used to qualify. Applicants will not be allowed to reJackson

file taxes). The Housing Department will review the application before
accepting it to ensure it is complete. The Housing Department may ask for
additional documentation.
a) Weighted Drawing Entry Form - A “Weighted Drawing Entry” form must
be completed and signed and submitted when entering a weighted drawing
according to Housing Department processes. “Weighted Drawing Entry”
forms may be submitted online, in person, or by USPS.

means that every blank must contain information, “N/A,” or a
strikethrough so that the Housing Department knows that it was not
overlooked.
The Housing Department is not responsible for receiving Weighted
Drawing Entry Forms. It is the responsibility of the household to confirm
that the Weighted Drawing Entry Form was received and the household is
entered in the weighted drawing.
b) Intake Form - All households are required to complete the “Online Intake
Form.” This form must be completed in its entirety before entering a

Worksheet” (within one year of the date the weighted drawing begins) is
required to be completed by a lending institution. The “Lender’s Qualification
Worksheet” must be submitted to enter a weighted drawing. “Lender’s
Qualification Worksheets” may not be faxed; they can either be emailed or
submitted in person or mailed by USPS. The worksheet must reflect a loan
amount and down payment amount that is equal to or greater than the sale
price of the home.
iv. Credit Report - A three bureau credit report including credit scores (not more
than one year old) is required to help Housing Department Staff determine if
the Household is financially healthy and able to make payments on a
mortgage. The credit report also helps determine debt to income ratios.
v. Verification of Down Payment - An account statement or signed and notarized
letter from someone supplying a gift, or other verification of funds for a down
payment is required.
vi. Verification of Hours and Years Worked - “Affidavits of Employment,”

changes occur.
vii. Federal Tax Returns - Signed federal income tax returns and all attachments
(including W-2s and 1099s) and schedules for the last two (2) years for all
adult household members are required. If there is self-employment, three (3)
years of business and personal tax returns, along with a current “Profit and
Loss Statement” and balance sheet, are required. The Housing Department
uses tax returns to verify several different aspects of qualification such as but
not limited to income, assets, residential homeownership, and sources of
income.
viii. Power of Attorney in Case of Default - Buyers may be required to sign a
“Power of Attorney in Case of Default” form appointing the Housing
Manager of the Housing Department Attorney in Fact in the case of default
and forced sale. The Housing Department may use other methods for
remedying a default such as a mortgage against the property or a Quit Claim
Deed held in Escrow, which would be agreed to at time of purchase.

application will be required including at least the following certifications:
a) That the facts contained in the application are true and correct to the best
of the applicant’s knowledge;

packet by Housing Department Staff; and
c) That the applicant, on the basis of the application presented, believes the
Household qualifies to occupy the restricted housing unit in question
according to the restriction, these Housing Department Rules and
Regulations, and all other applicable procedures.
This “Certification and Oath” is required to be signed by all applicants and
notarized. There are public notaries available at the Housing Department.

c) Verification of Completion of Homebuyer Education Course - At least one
adult per household must complete the “Homebuyer Education Course.”
The required course is offered by the Wyoming Housing Network or if not
available, another course approved by the Housing Department. This
applies to all households regardless of whether they have owned a home or
not. This certification only needs to be completed once; however, if a
household changes size and the adult who completed the certification is no
longer a part of the household, it will need to be taken by an adult who is a
part of the household. The Housing Department will keep a record of the
certificate. It is encouraged that households keep a copy as well. The
applicant must provide evidence of attendance of an approved
“Homebuyer Education Course” prior to purchase. This is required to be
submitted at time of weighted drawing.

added to the household. An “Occupancy Agreement” will be required to
be signed by buyers at or before closing. Any adult that is added to a
household will be required tosign an Occupancy Agreement along with the

this process. The Housing Department strives to complete verification within two (2)
weeks of application submittal. Any material misstatement of fact or deliberate fraud
by the household in connection with any information supplied to the Housing
Department shall be cause for immediate expulsion from the application process
and/or forced sale of the restricted housing unit.
5. Verification of Qualified Household - The Housing Department verifies that each

Title 16 – Housing
Page 49 of 78
a. Earnest Money - At time of signing the “Purchase and Sale Agreement,” one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in earnest money will be required. The check is

property. The Closing Date will be agreed upon between the buyer and the seller
and will be included in the “Purchase and Sale Agreement.” The closing date will
be the date the buyer takes possession of the restricted housing unit.
c. Inspections - The buyer may perform inspections on the restricted housing unit
commencing on the effective date of the contract until closing. However, the
buyer will have 30 days from the effective date of the contract to notify the
Housing Department of any objections to items found during inspections. Sellers
shall make the restricted housing unit available for inspections. If the seller

ii. Terminating the “Purchase and Sale Agreement.”
d. Facilitation -Pursuant to Wyoming Statute 33-28-101 through 124, the “Real
Estate License Act of 1971”, the Housing Department is participating in the
transaction as a facilitator without a Wyoming real estate license and in the
performance of official duties.
e. Buyer’s Acknowledgement - The buyers will be required to sign a “Buyer’s
Acknowledgement” at closing. This document will certify that the buyers

unit in case of default.
D. Business Option - The “Business Option” is a mechanism specific to a developer’s
Housing Mitigation Plan that must be approved by elected officials on a case-by-case
basis. It only applies to exempt units, meaning restricted housing units that are not
required by the LDRs. The “Business Option” allows a business to identify a proposed
purchaser from their employees or someone who has a material nexus to the business or
organization, which would allow the household to have the first option to purchase the
restricted housing unit.
1. Purpose and Program Goals - The intent of the “Business Option” program is to help
qualified businesses house their employees by providing the employees first option to
purchase. This program furthers the Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan’s
goal of housing 65% of the workforce locally and its transportation goals.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 50 of 78
2. Applicability - This section applies to restricted housing units that have been
approved by the Board of County Commissioners or Town Council for the “Business

charitable foundation, or for-profit business which meets the definition of a qualified
business according to the special restrictions on the property and/or the Housing
Department Rules and Regulations.
a. Qualified Business Application - The business completes a “Qualified Business
Application,” which can be obtained from the declarant or from the Housing
Department and submits it to the Housing Department. If the business has

criteria of a qualified business with the following documentation. The Housing
Department may ask for additional documentation.
i. Option Agreement - The Housing Department verifies that the business is a

Agreement”; or
b) If the business is not deemed to be a qualified business, the Housing
Department will inform the business with a written letter and copy the

option if it is not approved as qualified by the Housing Department.
iii. Cause for Expulsion - Any material misstatement of fact or deliberate fraud
by a business in connection with any information supplied to the Housing
Department shall be cause for immediate expulsion from the application
process and/or for obtaining or keeping an option.
4. Option Procedures.
a. Obtaining an Option - Options are available from a declarant or from another
option holder. A declarant can choose to provide an option if the business is a
qualified business and does so by recording an “Option Agreement” signed by the

property.
ii. Housing Department’s exercise of its default option as set forth in the special
restrictions.
iii. The occurrence of a default and forced sale as set forth in the special
restrictions.
This notice triggers the timeframe the optionor has to identify a proposed
purchaser as outlined in the “Option Agreement.”
c. Exercise of Option - An optionor shall have a timeframe as outlined in the
“Option Agreement” to exercise the option. The timeframe will begin upon
receipt of the “Option Notice.” To exercise the option, an optionor must notify the
Housing Department on or before the expiration of the timeframe that they have
identified a proposed purchaser for the home. Additionally, the proposed
purchaser must submit a complete application, as outlined in Section
16.10.500.E.3.a. Qualified Business Application, on or before the expiration of
the timeframe. The Housing Department will take approximately five (5) business
days to determine whether the proposed purchaser is:
i. Qualified under “Option Agreement.”
ii. Qualified under terms of the Housing Department’s special restrictions.
The Housing Department will verify that the business continues to be a qualified
business each time the option is exercised (See Section 16.10.500.E.3.b.
Verification).
d. Waiver of Option - If the Optionor does not wish to exercise the option, they can
sign the “Affidavit of Waiver” indicating they are waiving the option. This
affidavit will be recorded with the Teton County Clerk’s Office.
In the case where an option is waived, the Housing Department will find a buyer
using the process outlined in Section 16.10.500.C. Sales and Resale Procedures of
these Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
i. Failure to Identify Purchaser during Required Timeframe - If the optionor
does not identify a proposed purchaser on or before the expiration of the
timeframe, the optionor will automatically have waived their option.
Jackson Municipal Code
Title 16 – Housing
Page 52 of 78

any time the business holding the option ceases to be a qualified business, they
must assign the option. This is done using the following process:
i. Written Notice - The optionor provides the Housing Department with written
notice that they wish to assign their option.
ii. Application - The business that is being assigned the option submits an
application to the Housing Department to become a qualified business (see
Section 16.10.500.E.3.a. Qualified Business Application).
iii. Housing Department Approval - If the business qualifies, the Housing
Department will provide a “Qualified Business Letter” to the business and
sign the “Option Agreement.”
iv. Consideration - The assignment may not have any consideration except for
consideration required to make the assignment legal.
5. Qualified Purchaser - The Housing Department will determine whether a household is
qualified to purchase based on the following criteria:
a. Letter of Certification - The purchaser will be qualified by the Housing
Department only if they have a material nexus to the optionor as approved by the
Housing Department. A “Letter of Certification” form demonstrating the material
nexus the proposed purchaser has with the Optionor must be completed by the
optionor. The “Letter of Certification” form is available from the Housing
Department. The optionor must deliver documentation satisfactory to the Housing
Department that verifies (1) that the proposed buyer is a full-time employee of
optionor; or (2) that the identified purchaser otherwise has a material nexus to
optionor.
b. Qualified Household - A Household will be qualified by the Housing Department
using the Application and Verification process outlined in Section 16.10.500.D.
Purchase Procedures of the Housing Department Rules and Regulations.
If the identified purchaser does not qualify because of not meeting the Housing
Department Rules and Regulations requirements, Housing Department special
restrictions, or “Option Agreement,” and the timeframe has not expired, the
optionor may identify another proposed purchaser.
c. Affidavit of Exercise - When the Housing Department determines the household
meets qualifying criteria of the “Option Agreement,” these Housing Department
Rules and Regulations, and Housing Department special restrictions, the Housing
Department will sign an “Affidavit of Exercise of Option Right” indicating the
household is qualified. The optionor will also sign the “Affidavit of Exercise of
Option Right” indicating they are exercising the option right. The affidavit will be
recorded with the Teton County Clerk’s land records.

Div. 1.7
1.7.1. General (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
1.7.1
The purpose of this Section is to establish the zones and overlays that regulate physical
development, use, development options, and subdivision. Zone and overlay standards
are established in order to achieve the desired future character articulated in the
Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan. The zones are grouped into Complete
Neighborhood zones, Rural Area zones, and Special Purpose zones based on the
vision of the Comprehensive Plan. Zones are further organized into character zones and
legacy zones. Character zones are character-based and established to implement the
Comprehensive Plan. Legacy zones are carried forward from the previous LDRs and it
is the intent that they will be phased out over time as character zones are adopted and
applied.
1.7.2. Establishment of Zones and Overlays (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
1.7.2
The Town of Jackson is divided into the minimum number of zones necessary to achieve
the vision of the Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan and the purpose and intent
of these LDRs. The zones are established in Article 2. - Article 4. Overlays address
critical issues that cross more than one zone and are established in Articles 5 and 6.
1.7.3. Official Zoning Map Incorporated by Reference (1/1/15, Ord.
1074)
1.7.3
The zones and overlays established by these LDRs are bounded and defined as
shown on the Town of Jackson Official Zoning Map (hereinafter “Official Zoning Map”).
The Official Zoning Map, and all explanatory materials contained thereon, is hereby
established and adopted as part of these LDRs, incorporated into these LDRs by
reference, and made a part hereof. The Official Zoning Map is located on the Teton
County Map Server at http://maps.greenwoodmap.com/tetonwy/mapserver/. A hard copy
of the Official Zoning Map is available for inspection in the Planning Department during
normal business hours.
1.7.4. Interpretation of Official Zoning Map Boundaries (1/1/15, Ord.
1074)
1.7.4
The following rules shall be used to determine the precise location of any zone boundary
shown on the Official Zoning Map:
A. Jurisdictional Boundaries
Boundary lines shown as following or approximately following County or Town
boundaries shall be construed as following such limits.
B. Streets or Alleys
Boundary lines shown as following or approximately following streets or alleys shall
be construed as following the centerline of such streets or alleys.

C. Street Vacations
Whenever any street is lawfully vacated, and the lands within the boundaries of the
vacated land attach to and become a part of lands adjoining such street, the lands
formerly within the vacated street shall be subject to the same zone classification
that is applicable to lands to which the vacated land attaches.
D. Section Lines, Platted Lot Lines, Park or Forest Service Boundaries
Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, current or past,
section lines, platted lot lines, park or forest service boundaries, or other property
lines shall be construed as following such lines.
E. Streams or Rivers
Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, the centerline of
streams, or rivers, or other continuously flowing watercourses shall be construed as
following the thread of the channel of such watercourses. In the event of a natural
change in the location of such streams, rivers, or other watercourses, the zone
boundary shall be construed as moving with the thread. In any instance where the
thread extends beyond a Town boundary, the boundary shall become coterminous
with the Town boundary.
F. Ridgelines
Boundaries following or approximately following ridgelines shall be construed as
following such lines.
G. Bench Lines or Levees
Boundaries shown as following or approximately following bench lines shall be
construed as following the top of the bench. Boundaries shown as following or
approximately following levees shall be construed as following the upland toe of the
levee where the slope sharply increases.
H. Vegetation Lines
Boundaries shown as following or approximately following vegetation lines shall
be deemed to follow the vegetation line that existed on June 13, 1993, on Horizon
aerials, which are incorporated into these LDRs by reference, or the current
vegetation line, whichever results in the largest area in the most restrictive zone.
Copies of the Horizon aerials are available in the County Planning Department.
I. Parallel Boundaries
Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any
of the features identified above, shall be construed to be parallel to such features
and at such distances as shown on the Official Zoning Map.

subject to the current LDRs.
2. A pre-application conference, zoning compliance verification, environmental
analysis, neighborhood meeting, or other review or action completed prior to
submittal of an application shall not constitute an approval that may be carried
out in exception to Sec. 1.8.1.
B. Nonconformities
A lawfully established physical development, use, development option or subdivision
that does not comply with these LDRs is nonconforming and subject to the
provisions of Div. 1.9.
C. PUDs and Other Special Projects
The following projects shall remain valid and shall not be considered nonconforming
regardless of their compliance with these LDRs; however, references to previous

Div. 1.9. Nonconformities
Div. 1.9
1.9.1. General Applicability (1/4/17, Ord. 1158)
1.9.1
A. Purpose
There exist physical developments, uses, development options, subdivisions, and
signs that were lawfully established before these LDRs were adopted or amended,
which now do not conform to these LDRs. It is the intent of these LDRs to allow these
nonconformities to continue until they are discontinued, but not to encourage their
expansion except under the standards established in this Division. The purpose
of this Division is to establish standards to allow the continued existence of those
nonconforming physical developments, uses, development options and subdivision,
and signs.
B. Applicability
This Division applies to nonconformities. A nonconformity is a lawfully established
physical development, use, development option, subdivision, or sign that does
not comply with these LDRs. A physical development, use, development option,
subdivision, or sign that has been granted relief pursuant to Div. 8.8. is not
nonconforming.
C. Authority to Continue
Nonconformities are allowed to continue in accordance with the requirements of this
Division.
D. Determination of Nonconformity Status
The burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be the
responsibility of the landowner. The landowner shall provide to the Planning Director
photos, permits, licenses, records, or other documentation that establishes the
date the nonconformity was established and the continuous existence of the
nonconformity since establishment.
E. Nonconformity Runs With the Land
A nonconformity shall run with the land. No change of ownership or right to
possession of land shall prevent the continuance of a nonconformity. Nor shall a
nonconformity be relocated unless the relocation results in compliance with these
LDRs.
F. Increase in Nonconformity
Except as authorized by this Division, no person shall engage in activity that
increases a nonconformity. Where authorized, the cumulative total of an expansion is
the sum of all expansions from the date the physical development, use, development
option, or subdivision became nonconforming, including all expansions under prior
LDRs if the nonconformity began under prior LDRs and remains nonconforming.

1.9.2. Nonconforming Physical Development (7/18/18, Ord. 1199)
G. Multiple Nonconformities
On a site with multiple nonconformities, the standards of this Division shall apply to
each nonconformity separately, unless stated otherwise.
EXAMPLE: In the case of a nonconforming use within a nonconforming physical
development the nonconforming use shall be subject to the standards of Sec.
1.9.3. and the nonconforming physical development shall be subject to the
standards of Sec. 1.9.2.
H. Life Safety
Life safety modifications to existing structures or sites which are required by local,
state, or federal government shall be exempt from the requirements in this Division.
I. Occupancy Prohibited
If a structure or site, or portion thereof, becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due
to lack of repairs, maintenance, payment of taxes, or other reason and the Town
declares occupancy of the structure or site to be prohibited, it shall be removed,
rebuilt, redeveloped, reused, or repaired in conformance with these LDRs.
J. Government Acquisition
If a conforming physical development, use, or lot of record becomes out of
compliance with these LDRs due to governmental acquisition of a portion of the lot of
record for a public purpose, the physical development, use, or lot of record shall be
considered conforming and future physical development, use, development options
and subdivision of that lot of record shall comply with these LDRs to the maximum
extent practicable.
1.9.2. Nonconforming Physical Development (7/18/18, Ord. 1199)
1.9.2
A. Applicability
Nonconforming physical development is declared generally incompatible with the
character of the zone or overlay in which it is located. This Section shall apply to
lawful physical development (other than signs) that does not meet the physical
development standards applicable to the zone or overlay. Physical development
standards applicable to all zones are found in Article 5. Physical development
standards applicable to specific zones are found in Subsection B of the zonespecific
sections found in Article 2.-Article 4.

B. Maintenance, Alteration, Expansion, and Replacement
Maintenance, alteration, replacement, or expansion of a nonconforming physical
development shall only be permitted if all 6 of the following standards are met.
1. No Increase in Nonconformity. Maintenance, alteration, replacement, or
expansion shall not increase the nonconformity and shall otherwise comply with
all applicable standards of these LDRs, except that maintenance, alteration, or
expansion of a nonconforming Detached Single-Family Unit shall not be subject
this limitation (e.g., an addition to a house that is nonconforming as to height
may be the same height as the existing nonconforming house).
EXAMPLE: An addition must meet all setbacks, floor area limits, and other
standards even if a portion of the structure being added to does not meet
a setback, except that a Single-Family Unit may be expanded to the same
nonconforming setback.
2. Maintenance and Alteration. A nonconforming physical development may be
maintained or altered.
3. Expansion. A nonconforming physical development shall be brought into
compliance with all applicable standards of these LDRs upon cumulative
expansion of greater than 20% of its floor area or site area. Cumulative
expansion is the sum of all expansions from the date the physical development
became nonconforming, including all expansions under prior LDRs if the
physical development became nonconforming under prior LDRs and remains
nonconforming. The following exceptions shall apply to this limit on expansion.
a. Detached Single-Family Unit. This standard shall not limit the expansion of a
Detached Single-Family Unit.
b. Historic Buildings. This standard shall not limit expansion of a building
included on the Teton County Historical Preservation Board (TCHPB) list of
historically significant properties, or that is otherwise deemed in writing by
the TCHPB to be historically significant.
c. Workforce Housing Incentive. Floor area added using the Deed Restricted
Housing Exemption (Sec. 7.8.3.) or Workforce Housing Floor Area Bonus
(Sec. 7.8.4.) shall not be included in the calculation of expansion.
d. Nonconforming Bulk and Form Standards. This standards shall not limit
expansion of a building that is nonconforming with one or more of the
following standards.
i. Minimum stories in a street setback
ii. Building stepback
iii. Pedestrian frontage
iv. Building frontage

e. Nonconforming Building Facade Width
i. Additions. Expansion of an existing
building that is unable to meet the
building facade width requirement must
comply with the following provisions.
Primary Street
Front: Addition
Any addition to the front must be placed in the
street setback range. The addition does not have
to meet the required building facade width for the
lot.
Primary Street
Rear: Addition
Rear additions are allowed because the extension
does not increase the degree of the nonconformity.
Primary Street
Side: Addition
Side additions are not allowed because the
extension increases the width of the building not
located in the street setback range.
ii. New Buildings. Where a new building is
being constructed on a lot with an existing
building that doesn’t meet the building
facade width requirement, the following
provisions apply.
Primary Street
Front: New Building
All new buildings must be placed in the street
setback range until the required building facade
width for the lot has been met.
Primary Street
Rear: New Building
New buildings located outside of the street setback
range are not allowed until the required building
facade width for the lot has been met.
Primary Street
Side: New Building
New buildings located outside of the street setback
range are not allowed until the required building
facade width for the lot has been met.

Article 1. General Provisions | Div. 1.9. Nonconformities
1.9.2. Nonconforming Physical Development (7/18/18, Ord. 1199)
4. Replacement. A nonconforming physical development shall be brought into
compliance with all applicable standards of these LDRs upon willful demolition
of any structural support for the portion of the physical development that
is nonconforming. Except that this subsection shall not prohibit any of the
following.
a. Detached Single-Family Unit. This standard shall not limit the expansion of a
Detached Single-Family Unit.
b. Replacement After Damage by Natural Disaster. A nonconforming physical
development that is demolished or destroyed by a natural disaster or
through any manner not willfully accomplished by the owner, regardless
of the extent of the demolition or destruction, may be replaced to the
nonconforming condition that existed prior to the damage.
c. Interior Remodel. Interior remodel of a nonconforming building.
EXAMPLE: A site has an existing 2,000 sf home that is partially located
in a creek setback. Any interior remodel is allowed without resolving the
nonconformity. Any nonstructural modification to the exterior of the building
(i.e. re-siding, re-roofing, replacing windows) is allowed without resolving the
nonconformity. An expansion of up to 400 sf is allowed without remedying
the nonconformity. But, if the portion of the building in the setback is
demolished it cannot be built back, and an expansion of greater than 400 sf
would require demolition of the nonconforming portion of the building.
5. Required Compliance for Non-Building Nonconformities. In addition to the above
standards, a nonconforming physical development that is not a building shall
be brought into compliance with all applicable standards of these LDRs upon
cumulative expansion of greater than 20% of the total floor area or use on a site.
Except that, a non-building physical development that is nonconforming with an
LDR that protects a public right-of-way shall be brought into compliance will all
applicable standards of these LDRs upon cumulative expansion of greater than
5% of the floor area or use on a site.
EXAMPLE: A site has an existing 2,000 sf home that does not meet
setbacks and more site development than is permitted. Construction of a
500 sf detached garage on the site would require that the site development
be brought into compliance with these LDRs, but the existing home would
not have to be relocated.
6. Complete Within 18 Months. Maintenance, alteration, replacement, or expansion
of an existing nonconforming physical development pursuant to this Section
shall be completed, or an application to complete shall be sufficient, within 18
months of the date of commencement or destruction.

LDRs. Nonconforming use of a nonconforming physical development shall be
subject to Sec. 1.9.3..
2. A nonconforming building shall not be subdivided into condominiums or
townhomes, unless the subdivision brings the physical development into
compliance with these LDRs.
3. A boundary adjustment pursuant to Sec. 8.5.5. of a site that includes
nonconforming physical development shall not increase the nonconformity of
the physical development.
4. A subdivision or development option on a site with nonconforming physical
development shall require all physical development on the site, except existing
buildings, comply with these LDRs.
1.9.3. Nonconforming Uses (7/18/18, Ord. 1199)
1.9.3
A. Applicability
A nonconforming use is declared generally incompatible with the character of the
zone or overlay in which it is located. This Section shall apply to:
1. A lawfully established use that is not allowed in the zone or overlay;
2. A lawfully established conditional or special use that does not have an approved
Conditional Use Permit or Special Use Permit; and
3. A lawfully established use that does not comply with the use standards
applicable to the zone or overlay. Use standards applicable to all zones are
found in Article 6. Use standards applicable to specific zones are found in
Subsection C of the zone-specific sections found in Article 2.-Article 4.
B. Expansion
1. A nonconforming use may only be expanded a cumulative total of 20% in
the floor area and site area occupied and/or the daily and annual duration of
operation, except that a nonconforming Detached Single-Family use shall not be
subject to this limitation.
2. An expansion of a nonconforming use shall not create or increase nonconformity
with use-based standards such as parking and affordable workforce housing.
3. An expansion of a nonconforming use shall comply with all physical
development, development option, and subdivision standards of these LDRs.
4. An expansion of a use that is nonconforming because it does not have an
approved CUP or SUP requires approval of a CUP or SUP upon 20% cumulative
total expansion in the floor area and site area occupied and/or the daily and
annual duration of operation.

C. Change in Use
A nonconforming use, except a Detached Single-Family Unit, may be changed to
another nonconforming use provided all 3 of the following standards are met.
1. The new use is a materially less intense nonconforming use. The determination
of the level of intensity shall include, but is not limited to, consideration of traffic
generated (amounts and type), impacts on access, parking demand, proposed
level of activity, operational characteristics, and other potentially adverse
impacts on neighboring lands.
2. The new use shall not create or increase nonconformities with use-based
standards such as parking and affordable workforce housing.
3. The new use shall obtain a Conditional Use Permit pursuant to Sec. 8.4.2.
D. Discontinuance
1. If a nonconforming use is operationally discontinued for a period of more than
one year, whether or not the equipment or furniture is removed, the use shall not
be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use of the site shall conform
to these LDRs, except that a nonconforming Detached Single-Family use that
is torn down or has structural support willfully removed or replaced shall not be
rebuilt.
2. When government action other than those described in 1.9.1.I., a natural
disaster, or any other action not considered a willful act of the owner or occupant
can be documented as the reason for discontinuance, the nonconforming
use may be discontinued for longer than one year provided an application to
reconstruct or reestablish the use is submitted to the Planning Director within
one year from cessation of the use, and reconstruction or reestablishment is
completed within the time period established in the permit approved for the
reconstruction or reestablishment.
3. Once a nonconforming principal use is discontinued, all associated accessory
uses shall discontinue within 31 days or a sufficient application to permit each
accessory use in association with another principal use shall be submitted

nonconforming use shall constitute discontinuance of the nonconforming use.
1.9.4. Nonconforming Development Options and Subdivisions
(5/4/16, Ord. 1115) 1.9.4
A. Applicability
A nonconforming development option or subdivision is declared generally
incompatible with the character of the zone or overlay in which it is located. This
Section shall apply to:
1. Lawfully created developments or subdivisions that do not have the required
development permits; and
2. Lawfully created lots of record that were intended to be buildable but do not
meet the development option or subdivision standards applicable to the zone or
overlay. Development option and subdivision standards applicable to all zones
are found in Article 7. Development option and subdivision standards applicable
to specific zones are found in Subsection D of the zone-specific sections found
in Article 2.-Article 4.
B. Use and Physical Development of a Nonconforming Lot of Record
1. Use and physical development of a nonconforming lot of record is permitted
if the nonconforming lot of record was intended to be buildable and the use or
physical development does not increase the nonconformity; except that, use or
physical development of a nonconforming lot of record created through Exempt
Land Division pursuant to Sec. 8.5.4. shall require that the lot of record comply
with all standards of these LDRs except the standards of Div. 7.2..
EXAMPLE: A parcel is subdivided to sell a portion of the parcel to an
Improvement Service District. When an application for a building permit is
submitted on the new parcel, road and utility standards must be met.

with all applicable standards of these LDRs.
C. Change of Nonconforming Lot of Record
The boundaries of a nonconforming lot of record may be modified if the adjustment
results in no increase in the nonconformity; except that, with regard to minimum lot
size one nonconforming lot of record can be made more nonconforming in order to
make another nonconforming lot of record less nonconforming if:
1. The benefit of the increased compliance of one lot of record outweighs the
detriment of the increased noncompliance of the other lot of record, resulting in
a greater overall compliance with the intent and/or standards of these LDRs;

C. Pedestrian Frontages
Pedestrian frontages are the spaces that occur on public
or private property between the curb and the building, and
are required along all primary and secondary streets. Good
pedestrian frontages are essential for fostering mixed-use,
walkable, and pedestrian-oriented development. Specific
rules for each pedestrian frontage are listed below.
A pedestrian frontage is composed of three parts:
• Furnishing/Planting Area. The furnishing/planting area
is the area between the back of curb and the clear
sidewalk. This area provides for columns, required
plantings, accessible ramps, signs, fire hydrants, snow
storage, parked vehicle overhang or door swing, etc.
• Clear Sidewalk. The clear sidewalk is the primary
pedestrian travelway and shall be clear of any
obstacles or protruding objects.
• Building Transition Area. The remaining space between
the clear sidewalk and building facade is a semi-public/
private, building transition area that provides room for
front door swings, planter boxes, window shopping,
outdoor cafe seating, street furniture, public art, etc.
Where private property is used for a furnishing/planting
area or a clear sidewalk, an easement may be permanently
dedicated to the Town.
See Sec. 2.2.10. through Sec. 2.2.14. to determine which
pedestrian frontages may be allowed in each zone.
The Planning Director will determine the appropriate
pedestrian frontage from the options for a zone based on
the established pedestrian frontage and desired pedestrian
frontage described in the Community Streets Plan.
The Planning Director may establish lesser standards
in any pedestrian frontage pursuant to the procedure of
Sec. 8.8.1.. in order to achieve consistency between the
established pedestrian frontage and the desired pedestrian
frontage described in the Community Streets Plan.
1. Covered Walkway
Description
A covered walkway provides visual interest along the
street edge, reduces the perceived mass of the building
facade, and provides shelter from the rain, snow, and sun
throughout the year. A covered walkway also reduces
winter maintenance and improves pedestrian safety. A
covered walkway is supported by posts or columns, or
cantilevered from the building facade.

D. Building Frontages
Building frontages set standards for building facades
that face streets, and are required along all primary and
secondary streets. Building frontages help to ensure that
buildings address each street appropriately. They play
an important role in shaping the built environment and
enhancing the pedestrian experience. Specific rules
for each building frontage are listed below. See Sec.
2.2.10.through Sec. 2.2.14. to determine which options
are allowed in each zone. The rules of measurement for a
building frontage are in Div. 9.4..
Any use allowed in the applicable zoning district is allowed
in any building frontage type, provided the use meets all
other zoning and building code requirements. The applicant
may use multiple building frontages along the same street
frontage, provided that each frontage type is allowed in the
applicable zoning district.
Institutional and transportation/Infrastructure uses may be
allowed to comply with the building frontages on an ‘as
practicable’ basis with Planning Director approval.

(7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
2.2.2
A. Intent
1. General Intent: The intent of the Neighborhood
Low Density-1 (NL-1) zone is to provide for places
with enough open space and sufficient lot size to
provide a predominance of landscape and yards
over buildings. Buildings and development should
be oriented to respect steep slopes, preserve open
space, and provide for wildlife movement through
the property. This zone is intended for Stable
neighborhoods where increased residential density
is not intended.
2. Buildings: Buildings can be up to 2 stories in
height. Multiple buildings on a site is common.
Incentives are provided to encourage variety in roof
pitch and design.
3. Parking: Parking is provided primarily on-site in
garages or with surface spaces. Parking is typically
accessed from a primary street, often including
longer driveways.
4. Land Use: Single-family detached homes,
accessory structures, and ARUs are the primary
land uses.
5. Comprehensive Plan: Based primarily on Subarea
6.2 in the Comprehensive Plan.
B. Physical Development

A. Intent
1. General Intent: The intent of the Neighborhood
Low Density-2 (NL-2) zone is to provide for places
with enough open space and sufficient lot size to
provide a predominance of landscape and yards
over buildings. Buildings and development should
be oriented to respect steep slopes, preserve open
space, and provide for wildlife movement through
the property. This zone is intended for Stable
neighborhoods where increased residential density
is not intended.
2. Buildings: Buildings can be up to 2 stories in
height. Multiple buildings on a site is common.
Incentives are provided to encourage variety in roof
pitch and design.
3. Parking: Parking is provided primarily on-site in
garages or with surface spaces. Parking is typically
accessed from a primary street, often including
longer driveways.
4. Land Use: Single-family detached homes,
accessory structures, and ARUs are the primary
land uses.
5. Comprehensive Plan: Based primarily on Subarea
6.2 in the Comprehensive Plan.
B. Physical Development
Standards applicable to physical development are
provided in this Section. Where a cross-reference
is listed, see the referenced division or section for
additional standards. Standards in Article 5 apply
unless stated otherwise.

(7/18/18, Ord. 1197) 2.2.6
A. Intent
1. General Intent: The intent of the Neighborhood Low
Density-5 (NL-5) zone is to enhance the character
and cohesiveness of residential neighborhoods
while allowing for a flexible range of residential
types, including single-family detached units,
duplex units, and triplex units. A maximum of three
detached or attached units per lot is permitted.
This flexibility is intended to create opportunities
for workforce housing because all apartment
units are required to be rented to members of the
local workforce. This zone is intended for Stable
neighborhoods where increased residential density
is not intended.
2. Buildings: Buildings can be up to 2 stories in
height. Multiple detached buildings or multiple
attached units on a site is common. Incentives are
provided to encourage variety in roof pitch and
design.
3. Parking: Parking is provided primarily on-site in
garages or with surface spaces. Parking is typically
accessed from an alley where present or a primary
street where no alley exists.
4. Land Use: Single-family detached homes, duplex,
and triplex units, with additional apartments as
allowed to not exceed three units per lot maximum
density.
5. Comprehensive Plan: Based primarily on Subarea
3.1 in the Comprehensive Plan.
B. Physical Development
Standards applicable to physical development are
provided in this Section. Where a cross-reference
is listed, see the referenced division or section for

A. Intent
1. General Intent: The intent of the Neighborhood
Medium Density 1 (NM-1) zone is to recognize
existing residential neighborhood character
while allowing flexibility in design and ownership
for single-family detached, duplex homes, and
Accessory Residential Units (ARUs) on smaller
lots when feasible. This zone is intended for Stable
neighborhoods where increased residential density
is not intended.
2. Buildings: Buildings can be up to 2 stories in
height. Multiple buildings on a site is common.
Incentives are provided to encourage variety in roof
pitch and design.
3. Parking: Parking is provided primarily on-site
in garages or with surface spaces. Parking is
typically accessed from a primary street or alley
when present.
4. Land Use: Single-family detached and attached
homes, accessory structures, and ARUs are the
primary land uses. Lots are typically either minimum 7,500 or
3,750 square feet but may also be any size within
this range.
B. Physical Development
Standards applicable to physical development are
provided in this Section. Where a cross-reference

A. Intent
1. General Intent: The intent of the Neighborhood
Medium Density-2 (NM-2) zone is to provide for
medium to higher density residential development
and to promote workforce housing types using
a broad range of detached and attached
residential types in a pedestrian-oriented
environment. The size of individual buildings
will be limited in order to respect and enhance
the character and cohesiveness of existing
residential neighborhoods. This zone is intended
for Transitional neighborhoods where increased
residential density and workforce housing are
intended.
2. Buildings: Buildings can be up to 3 stories in
height. Multiple detached buildings or multiple
attached units on a site is common. No more than 8
units will be permitted within an individual building.
Incentives are provided to encourage variety in roof
pitch and design.
3. Parking: Parking is provided primarily on-site in
garages or with surface spaces. Parking is typically
accessed from a primary street or alley if present.
4. Land Use: The full spectrum from a single-family
detached home to an 8-unit apartment/condo
building is allowed.
5. Comprehensive Plan: Based primarily on Subarea
3.2 in the Comprehensive Plan
B. Physical Development
Standards applicable to physical development are
provided in this Section. Where a cross-reference
is listed, see the referenced division or section for
additional standards. Standards in Article 5 apply
unless stated otherwise.

A. Intent
1. General Intent: The intent of the Neighborhood
High Density 1 (NH-1) zone is to provide for high
density residential development and to promote
workforce housing types using a broad range of
attached residential types in a pedestrian-oriented
environment. The size of individual buildings will be
limited by the application of required dimensional
standards, such as FAR, setbacks, and parking,
and not by a prescribed standard. Care will be
given to ensure that new development respects
and enhances the character and cohesiveness
of existing residential neighborhoods. This zone
is intended for Transitional neighborhoods where
increased residential density and workforce
housing are intended.
2. Buildings: Buildings can be up to 3 stories in
height. Single or multiple detached buildings, each
building with multiple units, on a site is common.
Incentives are provided to encourage variety in roof
pitch and design.
3. Parking: Parking is provided primarily on-site in
surface or underground garages or with surface
parking. Parking is typically accessed from a
primary street or alley if present.
4. Land Use: The full spectrum from a Single-family
home to whatever size building can fit the site
based on the minimum required density (17.4 units/
acre) and the dimensional limitations, such as FAR,
setbacks, and parking. Apartments take the place
of ARUs because they provide greater flexibility.
5. Comprehensive Plan: Based primarily on Subarea
3.2 in the Comprehensive Plan.

height. Massing, articulation, openings, and step
backs are used to reduce bulk and mass. Buildings
are located close to the sidewalk, creating an
attractive street edge. Large storefront windows
invite and encourage pedestrian activity.
3. Parking. Parking is primarily provided off-site
on public lots and on-street. Parking provided
on-site is underground or screened from view by
buildings.

A. Intent
1. General Intent. The intent of the Commercial
Residential-1 (CR-1) zone is to provide for mixeduse
development consisting primarily of offices,
retail and residential development. Lodging uses
are allowed within the Lodging Overlay. This
zone will often be located on secondary corridors
and may serve as a transition zone between
higher intensity commercial areas and residential
neighborhoods.
2. Buildings. Buildings can be up to 3 stories in
height. Buildings are pulled up to the street,
awnings, galleries, porches, stoops, and windows
and doors work in concert to provide an attractive
pedestrian environment that complements and
serves the surrounding neighborhood.
3. Parking. Parking is primarily provided on-site, to
the rear or side of buildings and screened from
view.
4. Land Use. Ground-level uses add vitality and
street life at a scale consistent with neighboring
residential structures and uses. Upper floors
primarily accommodate residential, office and
lodging uses, but these uses are allowed on the
ground floor as well.
5. Comprehensive Plan. Based primarily on sub area
2.2 of the Comprehensive Plan.

A. Intent
1. General Intent. The intent of the Commercial
Residential-2 (CR-2) zone is to provide for a vibrant
mixed-use zone consisting primarily of retail,
office, lodging and residential uses. This zone will
often be located on the periphery of the core of
Downtown and helps to serve as a transition to
lower density residential areas.
2. Buildings. Buildings can be up to 3 stories in
height. Massing, articulation, openings, and step
backs are used to reduce bulk and mass. Front
setbacks are varied, with some buildings pulled up
to the street and others set back with landscaping
in front, creating an attractive and green street
edge.
3. Parking. Parking is primarily provided on-site, to
the rear or side of buildings and screened from
view.
4. Land Use. Active uses, such as retail and service,
are encouraged on the ground level, often with
lodging, residential, or office on the upper floors.
Buildings of all residential uses are encouraged.
5. Comprehensive Plan. Based primarily on sub areas
2.3 and 2.5 of the Comprehensive Plan.

A. Intent
1. General Intent. The intent of the Commercial
Residential-3 (CR-3) zone is to provide for a vibrant
mixed-use zone consisting primarily of retail, office
and residential uses. This zone is located on both
sides of Highway 89/191 from High School Road
to Flat Creek bridge at the entrance to downtown
Jackson.
2. Buildings. Buildings can be up to 3 or 4 stories in
height. Massing, articulation, openings, and step
backs are used to reduce bulk and mass. Front
setbacks are varied, with some buildings pulled up
to the street and others set back with landscaping
in front, creating an attractive and green street
edge.
3. Parking. Parking is primarily provided on-site, to
the rear or side of buildings and screened from
view with a screen-wall.
4. Land Use. Active uses, such as retail and service,
are encouraged on the ground level, often with
residential or office on the upper floors. Buildings
of all residential uses are encouraged.
5. Comprehensive Plan. Based primarily on sub areas
4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 and 5.3 of the Comprehensive
Plan.

Div. 3.1. All Rural Area Zones (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
Div. 3.1
Rural area zones are intended to preserve wildlife habitat, habitat connections, scenic
vistas, and undeveloped open spaces to the extent possible, given existing development
patterns. There are 2 types of rural area zones:
1. Character zones, established in Div. 3.2., are character-based and established
to implement the Comprehensive Plan;
2. Legacy zones, established in Div. 3.3., are carried forward from the previous
LDRs, and it is the intent that they will be phased out over time as character
zones are adopted and applied.

Div. 4.1. All Special Purpose Zones (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
Div. 4.1
Special purpose zones are intended to provide for development and uses that are
desired by the community, but not easily incorporated into the complete neighborhood
and rural area zones. There are 3 types of special purpose zones:
1. Civic zones, established in Div. 4.2., accommodate public and semi-public uses
that are necessary to the community and require flexibility from the standards of
the complete neighborhood and rural area zones.
2. Planned Resort zones, established in Div. 4.3., provide for and guide the
creation or continuation of planned development configured around a major
recreational activity.
3. Planned Unit Development (PUD) zones, established in Div. 4.4., permit variation
from the strict application of the zones in order to achieve specific community
goals that enhance the community’s implementation of the Jackson/Teton
County Comprehensive Plan.
Div. 4.2. Civic Zones
Div. 4.2
Civic zones accommodate public and semi-public uses that are necessary to the
community and require flexibility from the standards of the complete neighborhood and
rural area zones.

4.2.1
A. Intent
The purpose of the Public/Semi Public - Town (P/SP-ToJ) zone is to provide locations for new and existing uses and
facilities of a public or semi-public nature. In particular, the P/SP-ToJ zone is intended to allow flexibility for public and
semi-public uses and facilities that often have unique functional needs, such as for height, floor area, setbacks, and
impervious surface, that cannot be accommodated in other zoning districts. Land in the P/SP-ToJ zone and/or facilities
operated therein may be under the control of federal, state, or local governments, or other governmental entities such
as a school district or hospital district. It is not the intent of these LDRs that property in the P/SP-ToJ zone retain that
designation after the property is divested by the public entity. At the time P/SP-ToJ designated land is transferred, or is
proposed to be transferred, into private ownership, the property shall be reclassified to an appropriate zoning district to
allow private use pursuant to the Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan.
B. Physical Development
Standards applicable to physical development in the P/SP-ToJ zone are provided or referenced below. Where a cross
reference is provided, please see the referenced division or section for additional standards applicable in the P/SP-ToJ
zone. This Subsection is intended to indicate all of the physical development standards applicable in the P/SP-ToJ zone,
however, all standards in Article 5. are applicable in the P/SP-ToJ zone, unless stated otherwise.

4.3.1
A. Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the Planned Resort Zone is to provide for a mix of recreational, retail,
and service-oriented activities which have a high degree of self-containment and
provides economic and other benefits to the community. The Planned Resort Zone is
intended to guide the creation or continuation of a planned development configured
around a major recreational activity. The intent of this development type is to:
1. encourage recreational activities that rely on indigenous natural attributes of the
area, contribute to the community’s character and economy and have had a
long-standing, beneficial role in the community;
2. provide flexibility for planning and developing recreational resort facilities in
a creative, efficient and coordinated manner in order to provide quality visitor
experiences;
3. create a process in which Teton County and the Town of Jackson collaborate
with landowners in planning and designing resort master plans that meet
community goals and respond to the unique circumstances of the resort area;
4. permit resort development that contributes to expanding the winter and shoulder
economic seasons;
5. ensure that resort plans incorporate a mix of land uses, promote alternative
modes of transportation, and provide a pedestrian-oriented community in order
to alleviate traffic-related impacts;
6. ensure resort plans are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, and therefore,
are beneficial to the community;
7. enable long-range planning for infrastructure, capital facilities, and community
land use patterns by establishing a level of predictability in the maximum
potential size and character of each resort area;
8. ensure a balance is maintained between tourism and community that promotes
social diversity but does not cause undesired shifts away from rural, western
community character; and
9. produce resort plans that make significant contributions toward protecting
attributes of the community that are considered critical to the community’s longterm
health, welfare, and well being.

1. Collaboration. This procedure is intended to promote collaboration among
landowners, Teton County, and the Town of Jackson in designing land
development standards specific for each resort area. While one or more
landowners may propose a Planned Resort master plan, and maintain the role
of the applicant as identified herein, all landowners within a resort area are
encouraged to participate in the design of the master plan. Participation of all
landowners within a proposed Planned Resort Zone, however, is not required for
the Town Council to adopt a Planned Resort Zone.
2. Purpose and Intent of Master Plan. The purpose of a Planned Resort master
plan is to establish the development standards and serve as a guide to all future
development within the Planned Resort. The Planned Resort master plan is
intended to be of sufficient detail to describe the amount, type, size, location,
and impact of the proposed resort, but technical specifications of the proposed
development, such as fully engineered plans or fully detailed architectural
drawings, are not required.
3. Submittal Components. A Planned Resort master plan application shall include
all lands in a given resort area, as listed in 4.3.1.B. The minimum requirements
for a master plan application shall be established by the Planning Director and
shall include, but not be limited to:

a. Purpose. The purpose of the County’s and Town’s review of any Planned
Resort in the other jurisdiction is to recognize the impact of resorts on
neighboring jurisdictions and to provide an opportunity for cooperation in
planning and mitigation of potential impacts.
b. Intent. The intent of review is for the County Planning Commission and
Board of County Commissioners to have an opportunity for review and
comment of a Planned Resort. The County’s role is advisory only and does
not include a voting participation in review of the Planned Resort master
plan.
5. Recordation. Upon approval, the Planned Resort Master Plan shall be prepared
and recorded pursuant to the procedures outlined in the 8.7.3.D.
6. Amendment to Official Zoning District Map. Approval of a Planned Resort
master plan also shall constitute an amendment to the Official Zoning District
Map to establish the Planned Resort Zone. The public hearing notice for the
Planned Resort master plan shall be accomplished so as to comply with the
requirements set forth in Sec. 8.7.2.
7. Effect of Approval. After approval of a Planned Resort master plan, Physical
Development and Use Permit approvals are required prior to commencement
of any construction or operation of any new land use within the Planned Resort.
Procedural standards for Physical Development and Use Permits are outlined
in Div. 8.3. and Div. 8.4. No Physical Development or Use Permits shall be
approved, unless the proposal is consistent with the Planned Resort master
plan. Physical Development and Use Permits may encompass only an increment
of the total resort development in accordance with an approved phasing plan.
8. Standing of Planned Resort Master Plan. An approved Planned Resort master
plan, as amended, shall specify the development standards for the Planned
Resort Zone. Once approved, a Planned Resort master plan shall be subject to
the following standards:
a. Amendment of Master Plan. Any landowner within a Planned Resort
District may apply for amendment to the Planned Resort master plan. The
amendment shall be reviewed and acted upon pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Sec. 8.2.13. Minor deviations from a Planned Resort master plan
may be approved by the Planning Director, pursuant to Sec. 8.2.13.
b. Expiration

ii. Effect. Upon expiration, approval of a Planned Resort master plan shall
become null and void, and all rights that are established by the master
plan shall expire.
c. Extension. A Planned Resort master plan approval may be extended by the
Town Council provided a written request for extension is received at least 30
days prior to expiration of the Planned Resort master plan.
i. Procedure. The request for extension shall be reviewed by the Town
Council at a regularly scheduled meeting, by which time a public
hearing notice shall be advertised and any necessary information
pertinent to the extension request can be made available. The Planned
Resort master plan shall be deemed extended until the Town Council
acts upon the request for extension.
ii. Grounds for Extension. The grounds for extending a Planned Resort
master plan approval shall be specified by the Town Council and shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
a). No Change in Conditions. Conditions in the community have not
substantially changed since the original Planned Resort master
plan approval. No extension shall be granted if the Town Council
finds that changes in the community result in the resort plan being
inconsistent with the community’s land use patterns, these LDRs,
or the community’s ability to provide infrastructure and services to
accommodate the resort.
b). Good Faith Efforts. Activities and investments on the part of
landowners within the Planned Resort demonstrate good faith
efforts in pursuing the development permitted by the Planned
Resort master plan.
d. Reconsideration. If development within a Planned Resort fails to proceed in
general accordance with the approved phasing plan, the Town Council may
require reconsideration of the Planned Resort master plan and either amend
the phasing plan or revoke the master plan, as appropriate.
i. Amendment. Amendment of the phasing plan shall be appropriate if
either an acceptable alternative phasing plan that meets the standards
of this Section or a development schedule acceptable to the Town
Council for regaining compliance with the original phasing plan is
presented.
ii. Revocation. Revocation of the master plan shall have the effect of
forfeiting all rights within the Planned Resort to any further development
according to the Planned Resort master plan and shall be appropriate
if:
a). no material progress has been made in development of the resort
for 10 consecutive years, or

Article 4. Special Purpose Zones | Div. 4.3. Planned Resort Zones
4.3.1. All Planned Resort Zones (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
b). there is substantial noncompliance with the performance
objectives specified in the conditions of approval, or the
monitoring program, and no agreement can be reached between
representatives of the landowners within the Planned Resort or
applicant of record and the Town Council for bringing the resort
development into compliance with the standards of this Section.
iii. Procedure. The Town Council shall hold a public hearing, in accordance
with Sec. 8.2.10., for the purpose of examining the development
that has occurred within the Planned Resort and its consistency
with the Planned Resort master plan. The Town Council shall issue a
determination as to whether amendment or revocation of the master
plan is appropriate, in accordance with the above specified standards.
Revocation of the master plan shall be accomplished by amending
the resort area on the Official Zoning District Map from Planned Resort
Zone to the zoning district that existed prior to approval of the Planned
Resort master plan.
F. Standards Applying to All Planned Resorts
1. Consistency with Comprehensive Plan. Planned Resort master plans shall
be consistent with the goals and objectives of the Jackson/Teton County
Comprehensive Plan.
2. Compliance with LDRs. A Planned Resort master plan shall comply with the
standards of these LDRs. Notwithstanding, the applicant for a Planned Resort
master plan may propose, and the Town Council may approve, alternative
standards for development that are consistent with the purpose and intent of
this Section. It is fully consistent with this Section that Planned Resorts may have
dimensional, design, and other development standards different from those
described in other sections of these LDRs due to the unique circumstances of,
and community objectives for, resort development. All standards and regulations
of the prior zoning district not altered pursuant to an approved Planned Resort
master plan shall apply.
3. Statement of Purpose. The Planned Resort master plan shall have a Statement of
Purpose which describes the applicant’s rationale for resort expansion and the
design theme of the resort development. The Statement also shall describe how
the resort master plan fulfills the intents of this Section, as specified in 4.3.1.A.
4. Master Site Plan. The Planned Resort master plan shall have a Master Site Plan
that clearly illustrates the proposed development and the site to the satisfaction
of the Planning Director.
5. Dimensional Limitation Plan. The Planned Resort master plan shall have a
Dimensional Limitation Plan, which specifies dimensional limitations necessary
to achieve the design theme identified by the applicant. The plan shall include
floor areas and floor area ratios, densities, landscape ratios, height, setbacks,
building envelopes, etcetera, or other lines delineating areas on which
restrictions of development are to be imposed and areas in square feet for each
lot or building.

Article 4. Special Purpose Zones | Div. 4.3. Planned Resort Zones
4.3.1. All Planned Resort Zones (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
6. Housing Element. The Planned Resort master plan shall have a housing element
to ensure a supply of affordable workforce housing that is commensurate to the
demand for housing created by development within the Planned Resort.
a. Affordable workforce housing shall be provided pursuant to Div. 6.3.
i. Housing Calculations. Since development of a Planned Resort may
span time periods over which numbers of employees and their salaries
may fluctuate, the calculations performed in developing a Housing
Mitigation Plan shall use data current for the most recent full year prior
to application for Planned Resort master plan.
ii. Master Plan Estimate. The amount of housing required and the
locations where it will be provided, as presented in the Planned
Resort master plan, shall be treated as an estimate/concept, and shall
be finalized by the Planning Director as Development Plans within
the Planned Resort are reviewed and acted upon. Each approved
Development Plan shall establish the actual amount and location of
required housing for that portion of the Planned Resort master plan.
7. Design Element. The Planned Resort master plan shall include design
guidelines, and a mechanism for their implementation, that establish design
parameters for both buildings and spaces in the Planned Resort. The design
theme of the resort shall be defined by the applicant and be consistent with
the standards of this Section. This Subsection establishes concepts that the
design guidelines shall address; the design guidelines shall be evaluated as
to whether or not they address these concepts, as well as character objectives
for specific resorts set forth in Sec. 4.3.2.-Sec. 4.3.7. The design guidelines
shall be prepared by an architect or landscape architect licensed in the State
of Wyoming; preparation by a person or persons of similar expertise may be
permitted by the Planning Director.
a. General. There shall be visual continuity among the resort structures and
design elements without unduly limiting variety in design. Development shall
be compatible with the surrounding built and natural environment in both
scale and character. The design theme of the Planned Resort shall have an
emphasis on outdoor recreational activities and create a sense of place. A
sense of place is created when site planning and architecture:
i. concentrate activities and human interaction into identifiable spaces,
such as a plaza or mall;
ii. assemble a built environment that connects buildings, spaces and
structures through common scale, design and materials;
iii. incorporate into the built environment the natural features and cultural
heritage of the area; and
iv. produce an identifiable image that is associated with the planned resort
and with Jackson Hole.

is completed, and
ii. neighboring structures that are not a part of the resort, and
iii. the natural environment.
d. Signs. The design guidelines shall include a sign component that sets
forth the sign theme for the Planned Resort and specifies criteria for
determining permitted sign sizes, types, and locations. The guidelines shall
contain prototypical examples of all types of signs, including wall, canopy,
freestanding, directional, and informational signs. The flexibility extended
to Planned Resorts via this Section, to propose standards for signs different
from those specified in Division 5.6, Sign Standards, is encouraged with the
purpose of having sign guidelines in keeping with the unique character and
needs of the resort.
e. Lighting. The design guides shall include an analysis of proposed project
lighting. Areas to be illuminated (parking areas, walkways, entries, etc.)
shall be identified, and general standards shall be set forth. Identification
of models and types of standards and fixtures is encouraged, but specific
illumination plans and photometric footprints are not required. Generally,
lighting shall be low-intensity, low-profile, and shielded to avoid “light
pollution” and glare to off-site areas. General illumination standards are set
forth in Sec. 5.3.1.

ii. Entrance Features. Entrances to the Planned Resort shall create a
sense of arrival. A sense of arrival is created when the entrance into the
Planned Resort is easily identifiable and is consistent with the design
theme of the resort.
iii. Natural Resources. The site design shall highlight the natural resources
within the Planned Resort and integrate them into the layout of the
resort in order to promote a connection to the natural environment.
Consequently, natural features of the site, such as significant
vegetation, rock outcroppings, water bodies, etc., shall be preserved
and incorporated into the project design to the extent practicable.
iv. Pathways and Pedestrian Facilities. Pathways and pedestrian facilities,
including access for the disabled, shall be integral components of the
site design. The site shall provide an attractive, outdoor atmosphere
that encourages use and reliance upon pathways and walkways.

transportation, except motorized wheelchairs for the disabled shall
be permitted. Bicycle racks, ski racks, etc., shall be provided at
various destination points within the resort.
v. Transportation Facilities. Site design shall integrate safe, convenient,
and direct access to transportation services and facilities (i.e.,
bus shelters, information kiosks) and shall incorporate the facilities
necessary for the proper functioning of the Transportation Demand
Management Plan (see 8.b. below.)
vi. Circulation. The layout of local streets, alleyways, and parking lots shall
be sensitive to the natural terrain and landscape. Cut and fill areas
shall be minimized, and natural features of the site such as wooded
areas, rock outcroppings, and waterbodies, shall be preserved to the
maximum extent practical.

be consistent with the overall design theme of the resort. Use of
indigenous plant materials is encouraged. Existing vegetation shall be
preserved and incorporated into the design of the project to the extent
practical, especially wooded areas and other significant vegetation
which provides shelter or habitat for wildlife.
g. Character Objectives. Sec. 4.3.2.-Sec. 4.3.7. outline character objectives
specific to each resort area that shall be incorporated into the design
guidelines.
8. Transportation Element
The Planned Resort master plan shall have a transportation element to ensure
that resort development does not produce an amount of vehicular traffic that
undermines the community’s character, and endangers the public health, safety
and welfare (i.e., noise, air quality and traffic impacts.) The Planned Resort
master plan shall provide an optimum mix of automobile, transit, and pathway
facilities within the resort, encourage coordination of all resort transportation
facilities with the County-wide transportation system, promote design and
management which encourages shifts from single-occupancy vehicle trips to
multi-occupancy trips, or other transportation modes, and provide equitable
cost sharing for facilities and services.
a. Traffic Impact Analysis. A traffic impact and access analysis is required. At a
minimum, this analysis shall contain:
i. Projections of external vehicle trips generated by the Planned Resort.
ii. Analysis of levels of service (LOS) impacts on roadway system
segments and intersections serving the Planned Resort.
iii. Specification of any improvements needed to roadway system
segments and intersections as a result of increased traffic from the
Planned Resort.
b. Transportation Demand Management Plan. The Planned Resort master
plan shall include a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Plan that
demonstrates how the travel behavior of resort visitors and employees
will be managed to minimize the number of vehicle trips on the roadway
network resulting from the resort development. The Transportation Plan will
allocate a number of vehicle trips to various roadway segments, based
upon the projected traffic demand and the planned character of the
roadway segments. A goal of the applicant’s TDM Plan shall be to manage
the transportation demands of the resort so that it is consistent with the
allocation of vehicle trips to the various roadway segments that serve the
Planned Resort. Potential mechanisms for managing travel behavior may
include, but are not limited to:
i. Increasing average vehicle occupancy
ii. Shifting vehicular trips (resident and visitor) to public transit

other nonmotorized means
iv. Reducing vehicular trips through internal capture associated with
mixed land use patterns.
c. Parking and Loading. The Planned Resort master plan shall provide parking
and loading areas of sufficient amount and type to accommodate the
resort’s projected demand including parking for visitors and lodging guests,
waiting and loading areas for transit vehicles and their passengers, and
loading areas for delivery vehicles. Parking shall be designed to encourage
nonmotorized transportation, transit and high occupancy vehicle use and
discourage single-occupancy vehicle use.
9. Capital Improvements Element. The Planned Resort master plan shall have
a capital improvements element to ensure that infrastructure and essential
services will be provided in an efficient and timely manner to accommodate
projected resort demands. Planned Resort master plans shall include a capital
improvements element that identifies service providers, analyzes impacts
and proposes a capital improvements plan for facilities and services needed
by the resort. Such facilities and services may include, but are not limited to:
transportation (including transit, parking and pathways;) potable water and
wastewater treatment services; waste management (hazardous and solid;)
utilities; stormwater management and snow storage facilities.
a. Identification and Acknowledgment of Service Providers. The applicant shall
identify the provider of all infrastructure facilities and services included
in the plan. Where services are to be provided by an entity other than the
applicant, documents from the service provider shall demonstrate the
commitment and ability to provide such service according to the Planned
Resort master plan.
b. Impact Analysis. An impact analysis shall be performed for all facilities and
services, unless waived by the Planning Director. Each impact analysis shall
identify the following:
i. The maximum daily peak capacity of existing facilities.
ii. The current daily peak demand on existing capacity.
iii. The daily peak capacity available for new development.
iv. The projected daily peak demand generated by new development in
the Planned Resort.
v. When development outside of a resort is reasonably anticipated to
utilize the same infrastructure system as the resort, the Town of Jackson
shall provide the applicant with estimated peak demand.
vi. Any planned improvements by other entities, such as the Town of
Jackson or the Teton Village Water and Sewer District, and the timing of
such improvements.

Article 4. Special Purpose Zones | Div. 4.3. Planned Resort Zones
4.3.1. All Planned Resort Zones (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
vii. Any deficits in daily peak capacity potentially resulting from
development within the Planned Resort--either from a strict demand
standpoint or from a timing standpoint--taking into account other
potential new development outside the Planned Resort.
c. Capital Improvements Program. The capital improvements plan shall be
consistent with the impact analyses and specify how any deficiencies in
infrastructure will be remedied or mitigated, including descriptions of the
infrastructure improvements, the responsibility and sources of funding for
the improvements, and the timing for completion of improvements. Concept
plans for improvements shall be included in the capital improvements
plan; engineered plans shall be provided in the final development plan
application for subsequent development.
10. Land Use Element. The Planned Resort development shall have a land use
element that identifies the land uses within a proposed Planned Resort. The
land uses shall be consistent with both the applicant’s design theme and the
character objectives for the resort, as specified in Sec. 4.3.2.-Sec. 4.3.7.
a. Permitted Uses. The type of development permitted within a Planned Resort
shall be set forth in the Planned Resort master plan and shall be consistent
with the following:
i. Residential uses shall be permitted.
ii. Uses necessary for operation of the resort’s primary recreational activity
(ski area, hot springs) shall be permitted.
iii. Nonresidential uses that provide for the basic needs of the resort’s
lodging guests, day visitors, employees and vicinity residents shall be
permitted.
iv. Regional-serving commercial uses which rely upon vehicle trips from
a community-wide market area rather than the Planned Resort vicinity
shall be prohibited, unless they are determined by the Town Council to
be resort-related amenities.
v. Commercial amusement activities that are detrimental to the outdoor,
natural resource character of Teton County shall be prohibited.
vi. Special events such as music and dance festivals, art and craft shows,
concerts, live theater, and similar events which are compatible with the
resort and its facilities shall be permitted.
b. Amount and Type of Development. The amount and type of development in
a Planned Resort master plan shall be consistent with:
i. The applicant’s rationale for resort expansion and the character
objectives for the resort area pursuant to Sec. 4.3.2.-Sec. 4.3.7.
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 4-27
Article 4. Special Purpose Zones | Div. 4.3. Planned Resort Zones
4.3.1. All Planned Resort Zones (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
ii. The overall amount of development that can be permitted while
preserving community character, as reflected in the Jackson/Teton
County Comprehensive Plan and the Town and County’s LDRs.
iii. The amount of infrastructure capacity that can be provided while
maintaining consistency with community character goals.
iv. Providing a level of self-sufficiency within the resort, such that vehicle
trips ending outside the resort are minimized.
11. Phasing Element. The Planned Resort development shall have a phasing
element to ensure that development within a Planned Resort occurs in logical
sequence within the Planned Resort, including amenities and necessary public
service expansions. Planned Resort master plans shall contain a phasing plan
that identifies the sequence of resort structures, uses and amenities, installation
of infrastructure, implementation of the Transportation Demand Management
Plan, Housing Mitigation Plan, and implementation of Planned Resort master
plan conditions of approval.
a. Description. All structures, land use activities, mitigation strategies
and infrastructure expansions proposed, including such activities and
improvements on public lands, shall be included in the phasing plan.
b. Functional Phases. Each phase shall be self-sufficient, in conjunction with
existing elements of the Planned Resort, i.e., transportation and parking
needs, as well as amenities, for each phase shall be satisfied within each
phase and shall not be dependent upon a future phase. Each phase shall
represent a logical and compact extension of infrastructure and public
services. In order to develop certain improvements in logical increments
that provide for economies of scale, the phasing plan may propose that
improvements required for an earlier phase be provided in a later phase
only if:
i. The delayed construction of the improvement does not create a
negative impact or exacerbate an existing problematic condition, and
ii. Financial assurance, in a form acceptable to the Town Council, is
provided, i.e., letter of credit, that the improvement required for the
earlier phase will be developed within a certain time-frame, even if later
phases remain undeveloped.
c. Coordinated With Public Services. Phasing shall be coordinated with the
improvements schedule or capital improvements program of public or
semipublic service providers, as identified in the Capital Improvements
Element.
d. Relationship of Phasing to Overall Resort Plan. Phasing shall implement
the stated purpose of the Planned Resort master plan, i.e., if a destination
ski area is the basis for the resort plan, the ski area facilities should not
be the last increment of development. Similarly, open space dedications,

amenities, and required performances that mitigate the impacts of the resort
shall be developed or provided in proportion to the type and amount of
development in each phase.
e. Performance Objectives. The Town shall establish performance objectives
as part of the Planned Resort master plan approval that ensure that
development within the Planned Resort achieves the required mitigation
of projected impacts on the community. The resort developers shall be
responsible for ensuring that proposed mitigation measures are effective.
For example, the resort approval may require vehicle trip reduction
techniques in order to avoid undesired vehicle trips; performance
objectives shall be identified and incorporated into a monitoring program,
described below.
f. Monitoring Program. A program for monitoring compliance with performance
objectives for each phase of development shall be designed in a
collaborative effort between the applicant(s) and the Town, and shall be set
forth in the Planned Resort master plan approval. The monitoring program
shall be implemented by the applicant, or an entity that equitably represents
all landowners within the Planned Resort, and will include monitoring of
TDM components, affordable workforce housing developments, and other
such elements as identified by the Town Council.
i. Program Contents. The monitoring program shall specify data collection
needs, responsibility for data collection, techniques to be used in
analyzing data, how the data shall be used to determine achievement
of performance objectives, and the schedule for reporting to the Town
the results of the monitoring effort.
ii. Program Results. Representatives of the landowners within the Planned
Resort shall have 3 reporting opportunities to demonstrate achievement
of performance objectives. If, by the third scheduled report, the
resort has been unable to meet any specified performance objective,
the Planned Resort master plan may be subject to reconsideration
pursuant to E.8.d.
g. Achievement of Performance Objectives. Approval of future final
development plans may be delayed until the performance objectives of
the previous phases are met or a strategy for achieving them has been
approved by the Town Council.
12. Community Services Element (Optional). Resorts function as integral parts of
the community by participating in civic initiatives and implementing the goals
of the community. The optional community services element is intended to be
a component of the Planned Resort master plan in which the benefits that the
resort area provides to the community are acknowledged. Landowners within
Planned Resorts are encouraged to continue with, and expand upon, programs
designed to retain local access to the resort’s main recreational activity and
facilities. Community service programs help to maintain a balance at the resort
between out-of-town visitors and the community, and contribute to the quality of
life in the community. Examples of community services currently provided are:

Article 4. Special Purpose Zones | Div. 4.3. Planned Resort Zones
4.3.1. All Planned Resort Zones (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
a. Hosting activities for local disabled persons
b. Hosting Parks & Recreation Department activities
c. Providing trail head access to public forest land
d. Hosting local nonprofit events, including free recreational activities and
transportation
e. Offering reduced facility rates for community events and nonprofit
organizations
f. Offering local appreciation and promotional reduction in activity fees
g. Offering activity fees that are affordable to the permanent population
13. Character Element. Each Planned Resort master plan shall have a character
element to ensure that resort development is in keeping with the community’s
character and the planned character for the vicinity in which the resort
development is located.
a. Establishment of Character. Character standards are unique to each resort
area in order to recognize the differences between the individual resorts, the
planned character of their neighborhoods, and the community’s expectation
of resort development in that vicinity. The character for each Planned Resort
Zone is established in Sec. 4.3.2.-Sec. 4.3.7.
b. General. The standards specified for each Planned Resort Zone (Sec.
4.3.2.-Sec. 4.3.7.) are the minimum required, or maximum permitted,
as indicated by a “no less than” or “no more than” statement. Minimum
requirements may be increased in order to avoid or mitigate impacts of a
specific Planned Resort master plan proposal, better achieve the character
objectives for the resort, or better implement the goals and objectives
of the Comprehensive Plan. Similarly, an applicant’s ability to achieve
the maximums permitted is dependent upon the Planned Resort master
plan’s avoidance or mitigation of negative impacts on the community, its
achievement of the character objectives for the resort, or its contribution
toward achievement of the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
c. Definitions. The following definitions shall be used when evaluating each
Planned Resort Zone:
i. Guest. A guest is a person who is accommodated in overnight lodging
facilities within the Planned Resort. The number of guests is calculated
by the “average peak occupancy” of the lodging accommodations.
ii. Average Peak Occupancy. For the purposes of this Section, the
following average peak occupancies (APOs) shall be used in
calculating the capacity of guest accommodations:

lodging unit that exists as sleeping quarters only, and does not
contain other types of living spaces such as a living room or
kitchen, shall be assigned an APO of two.
b). Dwelling Unit. A dwelling unit, used for short term rental, shall be
assigned an APO of four.
c). Other. Other lodging facilities that do not meet the definitions
above shall have an APO assigned that is the sum of the number
of bedrooms the lodging facility contains multiplied by two.
4.3.2. Snow King (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
4.3.2
A. Area Description
The Snow King Planned Resort Zone consists of those areas zoned PR-SK on the
Official Zoning Map. The Snow King Planned Resort Zone is governed by the Snow
King Resort Master Plan; however, the Snow King Master Plan does not address
public lands, including lands owned by the Town of Jackson, within the resort zone.
B. Character and Design
As indicated in the description of Character District Subarea 2.1: Snow King Resort
in the Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan, Snow King Resort will continue
its role as a unique, resort-oriented urban commercial node serving both visitors
and residents. Improvements and expansions at Snow King will solidify its role as
the main convention and conference facility in the community. Factors and resort
characteristics important in Snow King’s future development include:
1. Capitalization on the location at the terminus of Snow King Avenue.
2. Creation of a sense of arrival.
3. Creation of an active, attractive, pedestrian streetscape along the eastern end of
Snow King Avenue.
4. An attractive, safe, and direct pedestrian streetscape connection to the Town
Square.
5. A layout that blends the edges of the resort into neighboring developments,
creating a porous edge to the resort that encourages pedestrian travel into and
through the area.
6. Structure sizes and layout that draw people into the resort area.
7. A continuity of architecture and activities within the resort, creating a multi-use
sense of place.
8. Pathways throughout the resort and connections to the Jackson Hole pathways
system.
9. Continued provision of the amenities of “town hill” skiing.

area as defined by the Town’s Land Development Regulation and as defined in
the Planned Resort Master Plan for Snow King.
D. Land Use
Convention center facilities shall be provided necessary to serve a year-round
convention market, including community needs for convention space. Commercial
services provided, in addition to convention facilities, shall be essential services to
on-site guests and supplemental neighborhood services. The commercial space
shall be sized and designed for serving the needs of on-site guests of the resort and
nearby residents.
E. Landscape Surface Area
Within areas of the Planned Resort to be developed as lodging, conference,
commercial and related facilities, the minimum landscape surface ratio shall be
.25, exclusive of the already permitted residential development that exists upon the
enactment of this Division (Clark’s Knoll, Pitchfork Townhomes, Love Ridge, and
Love Ridge Addition.) Notwithstanding, the Town Council may reduce the minimum
landscape surface area to no less than 20% upon demonstration by the applicant
that the following objectives are achieved with a reduced landscape surface area.
The primary purposes of the landscaped areas within Snow King are to:
1. Create visually strong and attractive streetscapes.
2. Create a porous edge to the Planned Resort such that residents and visitors
in the surrounding areas are invited to enter the resort through attractive
pedestrian ways.

4.4.1. All Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zones (7/18/18, Ord. 1198)
4.4.1
A. Purpose
Planned Unit Development (PUD) zones permit variation from the strict application
of the zoning districts in order to achieve specific community goals that enhance the
community’s implementation of the Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan. The
intent of PUD zones is that large or complex developments under unified control be
planned as a single, continuous project with greater design flexibility.
B. Applicability
The standards of this Section apply to:
1. Existing PUDs and other special projects listed in 1.8.2.C. of these LDRs.
2. Applications for establishment of PUD zoning.
C. Content of a PUD
A PUD is the equivalent of the zone-specific standards found in Articles 2 and 3.
A PUD is not intended to have the level of detail of a physical development plan. A
PUD shall include:
1. A surveyed map of the area to which the PUD applies
2. A master plan that establishes the general configuration and relationship of
the principal elements of the proposed development and specifies terms
and conditions defining development parameters, including uses, general
building types, density/intensity, resource protection, pedestrian and vehicular
circulation, open space, public facilities, and phasing.
D. Development of a PUD
1. The development standards for each PUD are established by the approved PUD
master plan. All physical development, use, and subdivision under the PUD
shall comply with the master plan.
2. Where development standards are not addressed or established in the
approved PUD master plan, the development standards of the underlying
zoning district shall apply.
3. PUD approval does not permit actual physical development or use of a site. All
appropriate permits and approvals shall be obtained under the administrative
procedures of these LDRs prior to any physical development, use, or
subdivision of land allowed by the PUD.
E. Establishment of a New PUD
Establishment of PUD zoning shall be achieved through an application for approval
of a PUD development option established in this Division. PUD applications shall be
reviewed pursuant to Sec. 8.7.3.

5.1.1. Waterbody and Wetland Buffers (1/4/17, Ord. 1162)
Div. 5.1. General Environmental Standards
Div. 5.1
The purpose of this Division is to maintain healthy populations of native species and
preserve and enhance water and air quality. Wildlife and natural resources are an
essential component of the character of the community.
5.1.1. Waterbody and Wetland Buffers (1/4/17, Ord. 1162)
5.1.1
A. Purpose
This Section establishes the protection standards for waterbodies and wetlands. In
order to protect the community as a whole from potential negative impacts caused
by physical development and use that may affect these resources or their functions,
this Section prohibits physical development and use on and within a certain distance
of these resources.
B. Findings
Waterbodies and wetlands provide critical functions in controlling flood waters,
providing wildlife habitat, cleansing the water resources, and contributing to the
special scenic quality of the Town of Jackson.
C. Resource Definitions
1. Waterbodies. Waterbodies are natural features (i.e., rivers, streams, lakes) that
convey or contain surface water.
a. River. River means the Snake River, the Gros Ventre River, the Hoback River,
or the Buffalo River.
b. Stream. Stream means a body of running water that is neither one of the
identified rivers nor an irrigation ditch, and has one or more of the following
characteristics:
i. Flow Level. Has an average annual flow of 3 cfs. or greater including
return water from subirrigation practices.
ii. Habitat. Provides a winter habitat for trumpeter swans or serves as a
cutthroat trout spawning area.
c. Cache Creek. Cache Creek is only considered a stream south of its crossing
of Cache Creek Drive. Where it is above ground north of Cache Creek Drive
it is considered a ditch.
d. Natural Lake/Pond. A natural lake/pond means a body of standing water,
usually at least 6 feet deep, which was created by natural processes.
2. Riparian Plant Community. Riparian plant communities associated with
watercourses shall be delineated using Youngblood, A.P., Padgett, W.G. and
Winward, A.K., “Riparian Community Type Classification of Eastern Idaho-
Western Wyoming,” USDA Forest Service, Intermtn. Reg., R4-Ecol-85-01,
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 5-3
Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.1. General Environmental Standards
5.1.1. Waterbody and Wetland Buffers (1/4/17, Ord. 1162)
Ogden, UT, 1985, and the U.S. Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service
publication: “National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands: Northwest
(Region 9),” Biol. Rept. 88 (26.9), May 1988.
3. Wetlands. Wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or
ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under
normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions. Identification of wetlands shall be according
to the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual. This definition
excludes irrigation induced wetlands.
D. No Development, Setbacks/Buffers Required
Due to the risk of severe negative impacts on the community at large if waterbodies
and wetlands are wholly or partially developed, and the necessity to protect
the natural functions of these resources, physical development and use of
these resources is prohibited in most cases and a setback/buffer is required.
Demonstration of compliance with wetland standards shall be provided by a
qualified professional.
1. Development Prohibited. Physical development and use in waterbodies and
wetlands is prohibited except for essential facilities as specified below.
2. Setback/Buffer Required. All physical development and use is required to be
setback from specified resources as follows:
a. Rivers. 150 feet.
b. Streams General. Along streams not specified below, physical development
and use shall be located out of the riparian plant community, but in no case
shall the required setback be less than 50 feet or more than 150 feet.
c. Streams, Specific. Physical development and use shall be setback from
streams in the Town of Jackson as specified below:
i. Cache Creek. South of the headgate: 20 feet.
ii. Flat Creek
a). North of the westerly extension of the southern ROW line of Hansen
Avenue. 25 feet.
b). South of the westerly extension of the southern ROW line of
Hansen Avenue. 50 feet.
d. Natural Lake/Pond. Adjacent to natural lakes or ponds, physical
development and use shall be located out of the riparian plant community,
but in no case shall the required setback be less than 50 feet nor more than
150 feet.
e. Wetlands. 30 feet.

Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.1. General Environmental Standards
5.1.1. Waterbody and Wetland Buffers (1/4/17, Ord. 1162)
f. Measurement. Setbacks shall be measured from the mean high water or
top of bank, whichever is farthest from the thread of the watercourse or the
center of the waterbody.
g. Buffer. The area protected by the setback is the “buffer” and shall remain
free from physical development and use, parking, and open storage
of vehicles, refuse, or any other material. Terrain disturbance for flood
protection, wildlife habitat enhancement, or public pathways are permitted
in the buffer upon receipt of applicable permits.
h. Land Protected by a Conservation Easement. Land protected by a
conservation easement, where proposed development density is one unit
per 70 acres or less and the total acreage subject to the easement is 320
acres or more, shall be exempt from certain stream setbacks required
by this Subsection. The stream setback for land under a conservation
easement may vary based upon the wildlife, agricultural, and scenic
analyses performed as part of the design of the easement. Under no
circumstances, however, shall the setback from streams be less than 50
feet.
3. Development of Essential Facilities
a. Waterbodies. Certain water dependent uses, bona fide stream restoration
and enhancement, and essential road or utility crossings must be located in
or adjacent to waterbodies. These may be permitted provided all physical
development meet the following requirements.
i. Flood Control, Irrigation, or Essential Crossings. Only physical
development that is essential to flood control or irrigation, bona fide
stream restoration and enhancement, or essential road or utility
crossings shall be permitted.
ii. Not for Human Habitation. Structures shall not be intended or designed
for human habitation.
iii. Minimize Negative Impacts on Wildlife. All physical development and
use shall be designed to minimize negative impacts on wildlife.
b. Wetlands. Wetlands may be physically developed or used under the
following circumstances. Notwithstanding, receipt of a local permit does
not absolve an applicant from obtaining all other State or Federal permits
necessary to develop wetlands.
i. High-Intensity Use Degrades Wetland/ Wetland Agriculture-Induced.
Where the intensity of adjoining use(s) cause the retained wetlands
to become degraded habitats and the wetland area is suitable for
physical development or use due to planning, location, and other
factors, or where the wetland is induced by irrigation.

Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.1. General Environmental Standards
5.1.2. Wildlife Friendly Fencing (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
ii. Necessary to Reshape Wetland to Provide Building Site. Where, due
to the shape of the lot of record and its interaction with topography, it
is necessary to reshape the wetland boundary to provide a building
envelope, filling up to 5% of the wetland on the lot of record, not to
exceed 1 acre, is permitted.
iii. Essential Crossings When No Alternate Site. Essential utility and
road crossings shall be permitted to impact wetlands where it is
demonstrated that the proposed crossings cannot be practically
located without impacting wetlands.
iv. Wetland Impacts Require Mitigation. When wetlands that are not
irrigation induced are impacted in accordance with this Section, the
following mitigation standards shall apply.
a). All Practical Measures to Reduce Impact. It shall be demonstrated
that reasonable project modification measures have been taken to
reduce wetland loss and degradation.
b). On-Site Mitigation Wherever Practicable. On-site mitigation shall
be provided wherever practicable. Where it is demonstrated
that on-site mitigation is not practicable, off-site mitigation shall
be permitted. All mitigation shall be at a ratio of 2 acres of new
wetland for every one acre of wetland impacted. The new wetlands
shall restore lost wetland functions and values. A wetland scientist
or other professional with experience in wetland creation shall
prepare the Habitat Enhancement Plan, pursuant to 5.2.1.E.2., and
shall be responsible for implementation of the plan as approved.
c). Encroachment Into the Buffer. Encroachment into the buffer is
permitted in accordance with this Section and does not require
wetland mitigation for impacts to the buffer.
d). Wetland Replanting. The new wetland area shall be planted with
a hydric tolerant mix of seeds in suitable areas, wetland plants,
and suitable seed bank soils. A wetlands biologist, or other
professional with experience in wetland creation, shall certify the
planting plan.
e). Persistence. It shall be demonstrated that the created or restored
wetland will be at least as persistent as the impacted wetland
system it replaces.
f). Buffer. Buffers in accordance with this Section shall be provided
around wetlands that are created pursuant to this Subsection.

5.1.2. Wildlife Friendly Fencing (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
B. Applicability
Fences in the NRO shall comply with the standards of this Section.
C. Fencing Height
Fencing, for purposes other than livestock control, shall be no higher than 38 inches
above the ground. Fencing for livestock control shall be no higher than 42 inches
above the ground. For both of the above fence types, spacing between the top two
wires or top pole/rail and adjacent wire shall be at least 12 inches.
D. Materials and Design
Fencing materials and design shall comply with the following standards:
1. Wood (or similar material) top poles, and either wood rails or wire strands are
permitted as horizontal elements in fencing. The wire strands shall be smooth or
twisted wire. Barbed wires may be used in the middle strands, not including the
top and bottom strands, when necessary to control livestock.
2. The required fencing design includes a top level of a wood (or similar material)
pole rather than wire. The bottom rail or wire strand shall be at least 16 inches
above the ground.
3. The spacing of fence posts shall be on 12-foot centers unless topography
prohibits this spacing. The posts shall have extra height to allow for any
necessary lower or raising of the top rail. Spacing of the second and third wire
shall be evenly spaced. Spacing distances may vary from 7-8 inches depending
on the height of the fence.
4. Buck and rail fencing shall be avoided. When buck and rail fencing is necessary
due to rocky soil, a portion of the fence shall be laid down or constructed to a
lower height, not to exceed 38 inches, to allow wildlife movement.
5. The top level of a newly constructed fence shall be flagged immediately after
construction. The flagging shall be white and maintained for at least 1 year.
E. Special Purpose Fencing
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the Planning Director may exempt
special purpose fencing from this Section, provided the fencing meets the below
standards.
EXAMPLE: Examples of special purpose fencing include fencing for a dog
kennel, certain types of agricultural fencing (such as bull enclosure, pig pens,
sheep enclosure, fencing to secure stored livestock feed, fencing for winter
livestock feeding sites, and fencing for 4-H projects), securing a construction
site, swimming pool enclosure, screening of refuse facilities, recycling
containers, dumpsters, and small yard enclosure.

Div. 5.2
The purpose of this Division is to maintain healthy populations of native species by
protecting crucial habitats Wildlife and natural resources are an essential component of
the character of the community.
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord.
1197)
5.2.1
A. Purpose of the NRO
The purpose of the Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) is to provide protection to the
most important and sensitive natural areas throughout the Town and County that
provide critical winter habitat and migration routes that are essential for survival of
the elk, mule deer, moose, and trumpeter swans; nesting habitat that is essential to
the survival of the bald eagle and trumpeter swan; spawning areas that are essential
to the survival of the cutthroat trout; and the natural resources and bio-diversity that
support wildlife populations. This is done through the establishment of the NRO,
which protects these areas through standards, mitigation, and habitat enhancement.
B. Establishment of the NRO
There is hereby established the Natural Resources Overlay (NRO), which, in areas
where it applies, shall overlay all zones established by these LDRs.
1. Included within the NRO. Included within the NRO are:
a. the migration routes and crucial winter ranges of elk;
b. the migration routes and crucial winter ranges of mule deer;
c. the crucial winter habitat of moose;
d. the nesting areas and winter habitat of trumpeter swans;
e. the spawning areas of cutthroat trout; and
f. the nesting areas and crucial winter habitat of bald eagles.
2. Map of the NRO / Site Specific Analysis Is Required. The NRO shown on the
Official Zoning Map identifies, on a general scale, the locations of those areas
protected by the NRO. Its purpose is to place a landowner on notice that land
may be within the NRO and to assist in the general administration of this Section.
A site-specific analysis of whether land is included within the NRO is required
pursuant to Sec. 8.2.2.
3. NRO Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the NRO.

Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.2. Environmental Standards Applicable in Specific Areas
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
a. Crucial Elk Migration Routes. Crucial elk migration routes are the migration
routes used by elk 8 out of every 10 years to migrate from summer ranges
to winter ranges. Elk migration occurs over a few days or may span several
weeks, depending upon the weather and other factors.
b. Crucial Elk Winter Range. Crucial elk winter range generally consists of
xeric and mesic sagebrush-grasslands, mixed shrub, mesic and xeric
open grassland, and certain agricultural meadow types, that are used
during winter months by elk 8 out of every 10 years. Crucial winter ranges
are essential to the survival of these animals during the critical periods of
winter. Elk find food and/or cover on these sites during the most inclement
and difficult winter weather conditions because of their physiographic and
vegetative characteristics.
c. Crucial Mule Deer Migration Routes. Crucial mule deer migration routes are
used by mule deer 8 out of every 10 years to migrate from summer ranges
to winter ranges. Generally, mule deer migration routes remain constant
over a general area, if there is no significant human disturbance. Although
specific mule deer migration routes are less common than elk migration
routes, a few very important routes have been identified as crucial to Teton
County mule deer.
d. Crucial Mule Deer Winter Range. Crucial mule deer winter range generally
consists of xeric and mesic sagebrush-grasslands and mixed shrub
types which are used during the crucial winter months by the mule deer
8 out of every 10 years. This crucial winter range is limited and occurs at
low elevations where shrub scrub-grassland habitat types are located.
Crucial winter range is essential to the survival of mule deer. Mule deer find
food and/or cover on those sites during the most inclement and difficult
winter weather conditions because of their physiographic and vegetative
characteristics.
e. Crucial Moose Winter Habitat. Crucial moose winter habitat includes
primarily palustrine-shrub willow and cottonwood, palustrine-forested
cottonwood, highly mesic forest-cottonwood, and cottonwood/spruce,
upland forest-subalpine fir habitat types, and secondarily xeric and mesic
sagebrush-grasslands and mixed shrub types. These habitat types are
used by moose during winter 8 out of every 10 years. Crucial winter habitat
is essential to the survival of the moose. Moose find food and/or cover in
these areas during the most inclement and difficult weather conditions
because of their physiographic and vegetative characteristics.
f. Trumpeter Swan Nest. Trumpeter swan nest is a nest created by a trumpeter
swan for the purpose of procreation and are generally found on islands
or in extensive stands of emergent vegetation. The same nest site is often
used repeatedly by a swan pair unless disturbance or other factors cause
abandonment. A trumpeter swan nest is active when eggs have been
laid in it or when a trumpeter swan is attempting to lay eggs in it. For the
purposes of these LDRs, a known trumpeter swan nest shall be an active
trumpeter swan nest. Important attributes of trumpeter swan nesting areas
5-10 Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations
Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.2. Environmental Standards Applicable in Specific Areas
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
include: proximity to feeding areas which have early ice-off and provide
sufficient food for pre-nesting swan pairs; proximity to suitable nest building
materials; availability and dispersion of feeding areas for cygnets 1-40
days old; and juxtaposition and interspersion of emergent vegetative cover
relative to feeding areas (for concealment, escape, and as a buffer to
human disturbance).
g. Trumpeter Swan Winter Habitat. Trumpeter swan winter habitat generally
consists of water areas of palustrine-aquatic bed and unconsolidated shore
and bottoms, with soft, sub-surface substrates of greater than 2 inches
in depth, winter water depths of less than 4.3 feet, watercourse channels
of 50 feet or more, and banks with little or no shrubbery or tree cover and
gradual slopes. These habitats attract trumpeter swans 8 out of every 10
years. Trumpeter swan winter habitat is essential to their survival during
critical winter periods. Trumpeter swans find food and/or cover in these
areas during the most inclement and difficult winter weather conditions due
to their hydrologic and vegetative characteristics.
h. Cutthroat Trout Spawning Areas. Cutthroat trout spawning areas generally
occur in well-oxygenated waters within palustrine and upper perennialunconsolidated
shore and bottom habitat types. Preference is for cold,
well-oxygenated, gravel-bottomed watercourses. Cutthroat trout build redds
(gravel nests) to lay, incubate, and hatch their eggs in these areas. Redds
are generally constructed in gravel substrate and range in size from 0.5 -
2.5 inches in diameter.
i. Bald Eagle Nesting Areas. Bald eagle nesting areas generally occur in
uneven-aged, multi-storied stands of trees with old-growth attributes,
where there are trees suitable for perching. These stands of trees are
often located near waterbodies and watercourses which provide foraging
opportunities. Nests are generally in one of the largest trees in the stand
and in most instances are located so that the bald eagle is provided an
unobstructed view of the surrounding area. Bald eagles frequently construct
alternate nests within a breeding territory and may use these for nesting
during other years. In the Teton County area, bald eagles select nest sites
which provide maximum foraging opportunity. Generally, bald eagles return
annually to nest in the same area. This is the result of a unique combination
of environmental factors that make a specific nesting habitat best suited for
reproduction.
j. Bald Eagle Crucial Winter Habitat. Bald eagle crucial winter habitat consists
of the bald eagle nesting area, defined as the nest tree and its associated
buffer and bald eagle perch and roost sites along the Snake River corridor.
k. Bald Eagle Nest. A bald eagle nest is a nest created by a bald eagle for
the purpose of procreation. A pair of bald eagles may have more than one
nest within its nesting territory. There are three types of bald eagle nests.
An occupied nest is one in which evidence (such as fresh nest material,
droppings, feathers, or prey remains in or below the nest, or the birds
themselves) indicates that a pair of eagles is present. An active nest is an
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 5-11
Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.2. Environmental Standards Applicable in Specific Areas
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
occupied nest in which eggs have been laid or young eagles are present,
indicating that the mated pair are actively attempting to produce young. An
inactive nest is one which occurs within the nesting territory but shows no
evidence of occupation. For the purpose of these LDRs, a bald eagle nest
is either an occupied nest, an active nest, or an inactive nest.
C. Findings for the NRO
1. General. Teton County is internationally known for the abundant wildlife that
results from the County’s location in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and
its proximity to Grand Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and
the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Although all wildlife species are important,
premier species with significant biological, ecological, economic, educational
and aesthetic values to Teton County include elk, mule deer, moose, bald
eagles, trumpeter swans, and cutthroat trout. These species and their respective
habitats must be protected in order to assure their continued survival in Teton
County.
2. Elk
a. General. The elk, or “wapiti,” is a large ungulate and a member of the
deer family. Teton County supports one of the largest elk herds in North
America (approximately 15,000 animals) and the presence of these animals
attracts visitors from all over the world. A variety of consumptive and nonconsumptive
human activities center around the presence of elk in Teton
County.
b. Elk Migrate between Summer Range and Winter Range. Elk are known as
grazers and rely primarily on grasses and some shrubs for forage. Because
of their diet and the climate in Teton County, elk are migratory animals,
moving between summer ranges and winter habitat.
c. Summer Range. Elk summer ranges are extensive and occur primarily
within the mountains around Teton County.
d. Migration Required in Winter. When heavy snow accumulation occurs in
the mountains, food availability is reduced within the elk’s summer range,
and they are forced to migrate to low elevation winter range. Migration from
summer ranges to winter ranges occur over a few days or may span several
weeks, depending upon the weather.
e. Migration Routes Essential to Survival. Generally, elk migration routes
remain spatially constant without human disturbance and those in Teton
County that have not been significantly impacted by development or
hunting pressures continue to be used by elk. These migration routes are
essential to the elk’s survival, because without them elk cannot migrate to
their winter ranges.
f. Crucial Winter Ranges Essential to Survival. Elk winter range is classified
as either crucial or non-crucial. Crucial elk winter ranges generally consist
of xeric and mesic sagebrush-grasslands, mixed shrub, mesic and xeric
5-12 Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations
Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.2. Environmental Standards Applicable in Specific Areas
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
open grassland, and certain agricultural meadow types that are used by
the elk 8 out of every 10 years during winter months. Crucial winter ranges
are essential to the survival of these animals. During the most inclement and
difficult winter weather conditions elk find food and/or cover on these sites
because of their physiographic and vegetative characteristics.
g. National Elk Refuge State-Operated Feedgrounds Provide Some Crucial
Winter Range. A major portion of the Teton County elk herd winters on the
National Elk Refuge (NER) and state-operated feedgrounds and these
areas represent a portion of the crucial winter range available to elk.
Because of the pressures the elk population is placing on these limited land
areas, artificial feeding is necessary on all feedgrounds. Artificial feeding
programs are not a perfect solution to providing crucial winter range to the
elk; in fact, feedgrounds are believed to perpetuate the disease, brucellosis,
which reduces the reproductive potential of this species.
h. Native Crucial Winter Ranges. In addition to the NER and state-operated
feedgrounds there are native crucial elk winter ranges in Teton County.
These naturally occurring winter ranges are also vitally important in
maintaining the elk population in Teton County.
i. Essential to Protect Crucial Winter Range. In order to sustain elk populations
at current levels, it is essential that all crucial elk winter ranges be
maintained and protected; without their protection, elk could not survive the
typically harsh winters common to Teton County.
3. Mule Deer
a. General. The mule deer is another large ungulate species native to Teton
County. Teton County supports a relatively small population of mule deer
in comparison to elk, but these animals are particularly obvious during the
winter and are enjoyed by many valley residents and visitors.
b. Mule Deer Migrate between Summer and Fall Habitat to Crucial Winter
Range. Mule deer are known as browsers, and rely on a variety of shrub
and scrub trees for forage. Because of their diet, and the climate in Teton
County and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, mule deer are migratory
animals, moving from summer and fall habitat to low elevation winter range.
Mule deer winter ranges are classified as either crucial or non-crucial.
c. Summer Range. Mule deer summer range is widely distributed throughout
Teton County in both lowland and upland areas, but primarily occurs on
public lands in the mountains which surround the valley.
d. Migration to Winter Range. Heavy snow accumulation on summer ranges
reduces food availability and forces mule deer to migrate to low elevation
winter range. Non-crucial winter ranges are used first by mule deer until
environmental conditions cause deer to move to crucial winter range.
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 5-13
Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.2. Environmental Standards Applicable in Specific Areas
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
e. Migration Routes Essential to Survival. Although mule deer rely less on
traditionally used migration routes than elk, they do use the same general
route while moving to and from winter ranges and between crucial and
non-crucial winter ranges. These “movement corridors,” which allow
unencumbered access to both crucial and non-crucial winter range, are
essential to the survival of Teton County mule deer and are classified as
crucial migration routes.
f. Crucial Winter Range Essential to Survival. Crucial mule deer winter range
is limited and occurs at low elevations where shrub scrub-grassland habitat
types are located. Crucial mule deer winter range generally consists of
xeric and mesic sagebrush-grasslands and mixed shrub types that mule
deer use during the crucial winter months 8 out of every 10 years. Crucial
winter range is essential to the survival of these animals. Mule deer find
food and/or cover on these sites during the most inclement and difficult
winter weather conditions because of their physiographic and vegetative
characteristics.
g. Location of Crucial Winter Range. Primary crucial winter range for mule
deer in Teton County is generally confined to five areas: (1) the Gros Ventre
Buttes (East and West); (2) the west slopes along WY Highway 26, 89, 189
above and to the east of South Park; (3) the Hoback Canyon; (4) the Snake
River Canyon; and (5) Miller Butte and the slopes east and west of the
National Elk Refuge. In addition, some mule deer are known to irregularly
winter within the Snake River riparian zone, depending on the severity of the
winter and/or the availability of artificial foods intentionally or unintentionally
provided by humans.
h. Essential to Protect Crucial Winter Range. It is essential that crucial mule
deer winter ranges be maintained and protected, because without it, mule
deer could not survive the harsh, energy-demanding winters of Teton
County.
4. Moose
a. General. The shiras moose is an ungulate and the largest member of the
deer family. Estimates suggest that the moose population in Teton County
may number as many as 2,300 animals.
b. Widely Distributed in Teton County During Summer. Moose are known as
browsers and rely on a variety of woody plant species for forage. Since
their arrival, the moose population has inhabited Teton County on a yearround
basis. During summer months, moose are widely distributed in Teton
County and exploit a wide range of habitat types found at both low and high
elevations.
c. Winter Reduces Food Availability on High Elevation Summer Habitats. As
winter approaches, heavy snow accumulation in high elevation summer
range severely reduces food availability, forcing nearly all moose to move

Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.2. Environmental Standards Applicable in Specific Areas
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
to lower elevation winter range. During winter, the Teton County moose
population is confined primarily to riparian areas within the valley, low
elevation sub-alpine fir forests, and some shrub-land habitat types.
d. Crucial Winter Habitat Essential to Survival. Moose winter habitat is
classified as either crucial or non-crucial. The crucial winter habitat includes
primarily palustrine-shrub willow and cottonwood, palustrine-forested
cottonwood, highly mesic forest-cottonwood and cottonwood/spruce,
upland forest-subalpine fir habitat types, and secondarily xeric and mesic
sagebrush-grasslands and mixed shrub types. Moose use these crucial
winter habitats 8 out of every 10 years during winter months and these
habitats are essential to their survival. Moose find food and/or cover in these
areas during the most inclement and difficult weather conditions because of
their physiographic and vegetative characteristics.
e. Essential to Protect Crucial Winter Habitat. In order to maintain the Teton
County moose population at current levels, it is essential that crucial winter
habitat be protected; without it, moose could not survive the harsh Teton
County winters.
5. Trumpeter Swans
a. General. The trumpeter swan is the largest species of waterfowl in the
world. Its pure white coloration makes it a truly striking bird to observe
whether in flight or on the water.
b. Species Close to Extinction in Early 1900’s. The historic commercial swan
skin trade, sport hunting, and habitat loss nearly drove the trumpeter
swan to extinction in the early 1900’s. Although a few remnant populations
persisted, including one in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (of which
Teton County is a part), the large-scale slaughter of these birds resulted in
the disruption of traditional migration patterns.
c. Federal and State Recognition. Due to their low reproductive potential
and continued threats to nesting and winter habitat, trumpeter swans are
a Threatened Species under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The
Wyoming Game and Fish Department presently classifies trumpeter swans
as a “Priority 1 non-game management species,” a designation given
to species which are vulnerable to extirpation or significant population
declines in Wyoming. Recent estimates indicate that less than 10,000
trumpeter swans reside in North America.
d. Teton County Part of Largest Breeding Area in Contiguous U.S. The Greater
Yellowstone Ecosystem is home for the Tri-state subpopulation of trumpeter
swans. It is the largest breeding area for trumpeter swans in the lower 48
states. Teton County is part of this Tri-state area (which includes Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho).
e. Present Population in Teton County. The present trumpeter swan flock found
wintering in the Teton County area totals approximately 215 birds.
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 5-15
Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.2. Environmental Standards Applicable in Specific Areas
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
f. Population Breeds and Winters in Teton County. In spite of the harsh winter
conditions, trumpeter swans which breed in Teton County also winter here,
apparently because they have lost the knowledge of traditional migration
routes to more hospitable wintering areas.
g. Viable Maintenance Requires Protection of Nesting Areas and Winter
Habitat. Protection of nesting areas and winter habitat is critical to the viable
maintenance of the trumpeter swan population.
h. Breeding Territories in Teton County. Thirty-one breeding territories have
been identified in Teton County, but not all of these territories are used every
year. In fact, the Teton County breeding pairs constitute the largest number
of nesting pairs documented in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem since
detailed records were first kept in 1981.
i. Nesting Area Most Critical to Breeding. The most critical portion of the
breeding territory to the trumpeter swan is the nesting area.
j. Nesting Areas. Generally, trumpeter swans build their nests on islands or
in extensive stands of emergent vegetation. The same nest site is often
used repeatedly by a swan pair unless disturbance or other factors cause
abandonment. Important attributes of trumpeter swan nesting areas
include: proximity to feeding areas which have early ice-off and provide
sufficient food for pre-nesting swan pairs; proximity to suitable nest building
materials; availability and dispersion of feeding areas for cygnets 1-40
days old; and juxtaposition and interspersion of emergent vegetative cover
relative to feeding areas (for concealment, escape, and as a buffer to
human disturbance).
k. Essential to Protect Nest Areas. For the viable maintenance of the trumpeter
swan population, it is essential that the trumpeter swan nesting areas be
protected, because without its maintenance the trumpeter swan would not
be able to procreate and survive.
l. Winter Swan Habitat. Because the trumpeter swan does not migrate
from Teton County during winter, as waterfowl normally do, maintenance
of its winter habitat is also crucial to its survival. Trumpeter swans, like
other waterfowl species, require rooted aquatic vegetation for food. This
vegetation grows in soft sediment along shallow stream and creek bottoms
and in shallow ponds and lakes. During winter, not all aquatic features are
available to trumpeter swans due to surface freezing. This limits the amount
of winter habitat available to trumpeter swans. This, in combination with
competition for food with other swans and waterfowl species, makes winter
a very critical time for trumpeter swans.
m. Trumpeter Swan Winter Habitat. Trumpeter swan winter habitat generally
consists of water areas of palustrine-aquatic bed and unconsolidated shore
and bottoms, with soft, sub-surface substrates of greater than 2 inches in
depth, winter water depths of less than 4.3 feet, watercourse channels of
50 feet or more, banks with little or no shrubbery or tree cover and gradual
slopes, which trumpeter swans use during the crucial winter months 8 out

Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.2. Environmental Standards Applicable in Specific Areas
5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
of every 10 years. Trumpeter swan winter habitat is essential to the survival
of the animal during the critical periods of winter because the swan finds
food and/ or cover in these areas during the most inclement and difficult
winter weather conditions due to the habitat their hydrologic and vegetative
characteristics.
n. Essential to Protect Trumpeter Swan Winter Habitat. For the viable
maintenance of the trumpeter swan population, it is essential that the
trumpeter swan winter habitat be maintained and protected, because
without its maintenance the trumpeter swan would not survive the critical
periods of winter.
6. Cutthroat Trout
a. General. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout (hereinafter “cutthroat
trout”) is indigenous to Teton County. It only inhabits the upper reaches of
the Snake River in Wyoming and extreme eastern Idaho, Jackson Lake, and
the Palisades Reservoir.
b. Economic Importance. The cutthroat trout is a sport fish which attracts many
fishermen to Teton County. Without a healthy cutthroat trout population, the
County would lose significant tourist dollars.
c. Development Has Affected Trout. In earlier times, it was relatively easy to
maintain a strong and viable population of cutthroat trout because suitable
spawning and nursery habitat could be found in most of the valley’s springcreeks.
Today, however, this is not the case because of the construction and
maintenance of flood control levees along the Snake River, and concomitant
water quality impacts caused by ranching, irrigation, and other agricultural
practices have degraded this spawning habitat.
d. Cutthroat Trout Spawning Area Limited. Today, cutthroat trout spawning
in Teton County is confined to small sections of a few spring-fed creeks
flowing into the Snake River.
e. Cutthroat Trout Spawning Areas. The cutthroat trout spawning sites generally
fall within areas of palustrine-unconsolidated shore and bottoms and upper
perennial-unconsolidated shore and bottoms. Preference is for cold, welloxygenated,
gravel-bottomed watercourses. In these areas, cutthroat trout
build redds (gravel nests) to lay, incubate, and hatch their eggs. Redds are
generally constructed in gravel substrate which ranges in size from 0.5 - 2.5
inches in diameter.
f. Spawning, Hatching, and Nursery. Cutthroat trout typically enter springcreeks
between March and April with the spawning occurring between
March and June, depending upon the location. Fry emerge throughout late
spring and early summer, and reside in the creeks throughout their first year.
g. Essential Spawning Area Be Protected. It is critical that these spawning
areas be protected in order to maintain a viable population of cutthroat trout.

5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
7. Bald Eagle
a. General. The bald eagle is part of a group of “fish eagles” distributed
throughout the world. The contrasting black, white, and yellow coloration of
this raptor is visually striking. An Act of Congress in 1782 officially adopted
the bald eagle as the symbol of the United States, representing freedom,
strength, and beauty. Although individual eagles are truly powerful and
impressive birds, the species as a whole is very sensitive and susceptible
to disturbance.
b. Federal Recognition. Once listed as a federally endangered species, bald
eagle populations have rebounded from the brink of extinction. Although
populations have steadied, the federal government continues to protect
the bald eagle under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
c. Bald Eagle Population in GYE Is One of Most Important. The bald eagle
population residing in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (of which
Teton County is a part) is one of the most important bald eagle breeding
populations in the United States.
d. Survival of Bald Eagles. The survival of bald eagles depends, in part, on
the availability of suitable habitat, the abundance of food, and reproductive
success (which is closely linked to the availability of forage and the lack of
disturbance).
e. Important to Protect Bald Eagle Nesting Areas. Because bald eagles are
sensitive to human development and activity, especially during time of
breeding and nesting, it is essential to protect bald eagle nesting areas to
ensure the animal’s survival.
f. Bald Eagle Nest Area. Generally, bald eagle nesting areas occur in unevenaged,
multi-storied stands of trees with old-growth attributes, where there
are trees suitable for perching. These stands of trees are generally located
near watercourses and waterbodies which provide foraging opportunities.
Nests are generally in one of the largest trees in a given stand and, in most
instances, are located so that the bird is provided an unobstructed view of
the surrounding area. Bald eagles frequently construct alternate nests within
a breeding territory and may use these for nesting during other years. In the
Teton County area, bald eagles select nest sites which provide maximum
foraging opportunity. Generally, bald eagles return annually to nest in the
same area. This is the result of a unique combination of environmental
factors that make a specific nest area best suited for reproduction.
g. Crucial Nesting Habitat Essential to Survival. The Snake River floodplain
between Moose and Palisades Reservoir and its associated riparian zone
represents crucial nesting habitat for the bald eagle. It is crucial to the
survival of bald eagles in Teton County that this habitat be protected from
the impacts of development. The loss of this habitat would profoundly
impact and detrimentally modify the behavior patterns of bald eagles,
including their feeding, breeding, and reproductive capabilities.

5.2.1. Natural Resources Overlay (NRO) Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
h. Spring, Summer, and Fall Habitat Occurs in Riparian Areas. During spring,
summer, and fall, bald eagles forage primarily in riparian areas for fish,
waterfowl, and other prey items.
i. Winter Habitat Is Important. During winter, heavy snow accumulation and
freezing water surfaces reduces the availability of spring, summer, and fall
habitat. At these times, bald eagles forage on wild ungulate and livestock
carrion, supplemented by fish and waterfowl carcasses. Ungulate carrion
is readily available but sparsely distributed on ungulate winter ranges,
meaning that in addition to its nesting habitat, the crucial ungulate winter
ranges also become critical to the bald eagle’s survival.
j. Additional Crucial Winter Habitat Essential to Survival. It is vital that bald
eagle crucial winter habitat be protected to ensure the survival of this
species in Teton County.
D. Applicability of NRO Standards
In addition to all other standards required by these LDRs, all physical development,
use, development options and subdivision within the NRO shall comply with all
standards of this Section, unless exempted below. Demonstration of compliance with
the standards of this Section shall come from a qualified professional, even if an EA
is exempt.
1. Alterations and Additions. Structural alterations and additions to existing
structures shall be exempt from the standards of this Section.
2. Land in Conservation Easement. Land protected by a conservation easement
where proposed development density is one house per 70 acres or less and
the total acreage subject to the easement is 320 acres or more, shall be exempt
from the standards of this Section, except that F.4. and F.6., shall apply.
E. Impacting the NRO
The base site area shall not be reduced because a portion of the lot of record is
in the NRO. When conflicts exist between the NRO and SRO, the standards of this
Section shall have priority and be achieved to the maximum extent practical. The
requirements of Sec. 5.3.2. shall receive second priority. Where densities/intensities
permitted cannot be achieved by locating development outside of the NRO, then
lands protected by the NRO may be impacted pursuant to the standards of this
Subsection.
1. Minimizes Wildlife Impact. The location of the proposed development shall
minimize impacts on the areas protected (e.g., crucial migration routes, crucial
winter range, nesting areas). For the purposes of this standard, “minimize” is
defined as locating development to avoid higher quality habitats or vegetative
cover types for lesser quality habitats or vegetative cover types. Only when
avoidance is not practicable due to significant topographical constraints
related to the property, may higher quality habitats or vegetative cover types be
impacted.

5.3.2
A. Purpose
The purpose of the Scenic Resources Overlay (SRO) is to preserve and maintain
the County’s most frequently viewed scenic resources that are important to both its
character and economy. This is done through the establishment of several Scenic
Areas within the SRO, within which the location, design, and landscaping of physical
development and use is regulated to maintain and/or complement the County’s
important scenic resources.
B. Establishment of the SRO
To protect important scenic resources, which are frequently seen from State
highways, Spring Gulch Road, South Park Loop Road and Alta County Road, and
which set an image of the rural and western ranching heritage of the County the
Scenic Resources Overlay (SRO) is established.
1. Foregrounds. The Scenic Resources Overlay (SRO) includes the foreground of
the scenic areas described below. Foreground is the open area immediately
adjacent to the public road that extends back to where there is either a distinct
topographic change, such as the edge of a hillside or butte, or a drop in
elevation toward a river bottom, or where dense vegetation screens views to
areas behind the vegetation. The Foreground provides the setting for views to
distant mountain ranges and valley buttes.
2. Skylines. The Scenic Resources Overlay (SRO) includes all butte and hillside
skylines as viewed from state highways, Spring Gulch Road, South Park Loop
Road and Alta County Road. The skyline is the visual line at which the earth or
vegetation and the sky appear to meet. The skyline is typically viewed as the top
of a ridge, hillside, or butte.
3. Map of the SRO Scenic Areas. The foregrounds and skylines included in the
Scenic Resources Overlay (SRO) are generally organized into the following
Scenic Areas. These Scenic Areas are generally described below and mapped
on the Official Zoning Map. Butte and hillside skylines as viewed from state

highways, Spring Gulch Road, South Park Loop Road and Alta County Road are
still included in the SRO even if they are not mapped on the Official Zoning Map
or included in one of following Scenic Areas.
a. Moose-Wilson Road Scenic Area. The Moose-Wilson Road Scenic Area
extends along the eastern and western side of Moose-Wilson Road from
Lake Creek to Grand Teton National Park. It is an important County-wide
scenic resource because of the vistas it offers of the Teton, Gros Ventre,
and Snake River mountain ranges, and of the West Gros Ventre Butte, which
frames the area’s broad and open meadows.
b. Highway 22 Scenic Area. The Highway 22 Scenic Area consists of four
distinct areas. They are described below.
i. Trail Creek Ranch. The Trail Creek Ranch portion of the Highway 22
Scenic Area extends along the north and south sides of Highway 22,
from the lower reaches of Teton Pass to the western edge of Wilson. It
is an important County-wide scenic resource because of the panoramic
views of Teton County that it provides as well as setting the western
entry to Wilson, defining Wilson as a unique and special place.
ii. Wilson Approach. The Wilson Approach portion of the Highway 22
Scenic Area extends from the eastern edge of Wilson along the
north side of Highway 22 to Highway 390 and along the south side
of Highway 22 to Green Lane. It is an important County-wide scenic
resource because of its broad open meadows and the unobstructed
views provided to surrounding mountains, which create a dramatic
sense of arrival to Wilson.
iii. Walton Ranch/Skyline Ranch. The Walton Ranch/Skyline Ranch
portion of the Highway 22 Scenic Area extends along the northern and
southern portion of the Highway 22 Scenic Area from the Wilson Snake
River Bridge to the West Gros Ventre Butte. The Walton Ranch portion
is an important County-wide scenic resource because it provides one
of the most frequently experienced vistas of meadows and pasture
backed by the Teton mountain range. The Skyline Ranch portion is an
important County-wide scenic resource because it provides an open
space setting for views to the Snake River range.
iv. West Gros Ventre Butte/Antelope Butte. The West Gros Ventre Butte/
Antelope Butte portion of the Highway 22 Scenic Area extends along
both sides of Highway 22, and includes all of the West Gros Ventre
Butte on the north and all of Boyles Hill, the Indian Springs, Brown
and Poodle Ranches, and Antelope Butte on the south. The views
encompass imposing steep sided buttes which rise abruptly from the
foreground and long views across open meadows to the Snake River
range on the south.
c. Spring Gulch Road Scenic Area. The Spring Gulch Road Scenic Area
extends along the eastern and western sides of Spring Gulch Road from
Highway 22 to the Gros Ventre River and includes the East Gros Ventre

Butte. It is an important County-wide scenic resource because it provides a
combination of scenic quality and traditional western character in a location
proximate to the Town.
d. Highway 89 Scenic Area. The Highway 89 Scenic Area consists of three
distinct areas. They are described below.
i. Broadway and North Highway 89 Scenic Area. The Broadway and
North Highway 89 Scenic Area extends along the western boundary
of the Town of Jackson from South Park Loop road on the south to the
Grand Teton National Park boundary on the north, and includes all
of Boyles Hill and the East Gros Ventre Butte. Views from the public
roads, including Spring Gulch Road, are of the steep sided butte in
the immediate foreground which provide a backdrop to the urban
development of the Town of Jackson, the flat expanses of the Elk
Refuge, the pastures of Spring Gulch as well as glimpses of the Teton
Range in notches of the ridgelines.
ii. South Highway 89 Scenic Area. The South Highway 89 Scenic Area
extends along the western side of South Highway 89 from the State
of Wyoming Elk Feeding Area and Game Creek County Road, where
the road rises to provide an initial sense of entry into the Jackson area
to High School Road. The eastern side of South Highway 89 also is
included for a distance of 1.3 miles south from High School Road.
The northern and southern portions of the South Highway 89 Scenic
Area are split to exclude the Rafter J subdivision, and the South Park
Commercial zones. The South Highway 89 Scenic Area is an important
County-wide scenic resource because of the powerful image it projects
of the community with its exceptionally broad meadows and panoramic
views to Rendezvous Bowl and the Snake River range. The meadows
are dotted with existing development, including both ranch compounds
and residential developments at varying densities, but the meadows’
exceptional breadth and the location of the meadows below the
highway preserves the open feel of the area and the background views.
iii. Snake River Canyon Scenic Area. The Snake River Canyon Scenic
Area extends along both sides of South Highway 89 from the northern
South Park Bridge to the County line and encompasses those areas
which are at approximately the same or a higher elevation than the
highway. More specifically, this scenic area includes the western side
of South Highway 89 from the northern bridge to the US Forest Service
boundary, land east of the Highway between the Snake River and Old
Henry’s Road, and land west of Hoback Junction on both sides of the
Highway, but excluding Deer Creek and Palmer Creek subdivisions.
The Scenic Area provides views of the Snake River, the east slopes
of Munger Mountain and the Teton, Gros Ventre, Wyoming and Snake
River Mountain ranges.
e. South Park Loop Scenic Area. The South Park Loop Road Scenic Area
extends along the eastern and western sides of South Park Loop Road,
from the South Park Ranches subdivision to High School Road and includes
5-30 Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations
Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.3. Scenic Standards

Hufsmith Hill. It provides an important County-wide scenic resource
because the road corridor is framed by cottonwood trees planted along
irrigation ditches which line the road. The scenic quality of this area is
dependent upon the preservation of the cottonwood corridor, which helps to
filter views to development in the adjoining hay meadows. These meadows
provide Foreground settings to views of Rendezvous Bowl and the Snake
River range.
f. Hoback Canyon Scenic Area. The Hoback Canyon Scenic Area extends
along both sides of Highway 191 beginning at the west line of the Gilgrease
Foundation property, approximately 1 mile east of Hoback Junction, to the
County line and encompasses those areas which are at approximately the
same or a higher elevation than the highway. The scenic area provides
views of the Gros Ventre and Wyoming Mountain ranges and the Hoback
River.
g. Teton Canyon Scenic Area. The Teton Canyon Scenic Area extends along
the south side of Alta Road from Lake Nolo to the boundary with the
Targhee National Forest. It is an important County-wide scenic resource
because the broad, open meadow of its Foreground is framed by a dense
vegetative border, which provides the setting for vistas to the west side
of the Teton range. The entire Teton Canyon Scenic Area also establishes
a segment of the entry image for visitors driving or biking through Alta to
Grand Targhee Resort.
h. Buffalo Valley Scenic Area. The Buffalo Valley Scenic Area extends along
the northern and southern sides of US 26/287 from Moran to the Blackrock
ranger station. It is an important County-wide scenic resource because
it provides a classic mountain valley setting framed by the Teton range.
The Buffalo Valley Scenic Area provides monumental views of the entire
Teton range, as viewed across very broad, open meadows dotted with
small ranch buildings. These vistas foreshadow the views which are again
encountered within Grand Teton National Park, thereby integrating the
Buffalo Valley Scenic Area with the image of the National Park.
C. Findings for the SRO
An essential component of the physical environment for which Teton County is
internationally known is the scenic vistas of jagged mountains rising from broad,
open meadows, which set an image of the County’s rural and western ranching
heritage. These scenic resources are important to both the County and Town
because they serve as a cornerstone to the local economy by attracting tourists
and other visitors. The scenic resources which are instrumental in the creation of the
County’s unique character are the vistas to the Teton, Gros Ventre, Wyoming and
Snake River mountain ranges that are frequently seen by residents and travelers
across wide pastures and meadows from the major public roads that enter the Town
of Jackson, Wilson, Grand Teton National Park, Teton Village, Alta, and Teton Pass.

variance of other regulations, such as setbacks, that would enable the
proposed physical development to comply with the skyline penetration
prohibition.
b. Height. The height of physical development shall not exceed 20 feet above
original grade.
c. Mass. The mass of the physical development shall be designed so as to
be broken into distinct, smaller forms, which may involve repeating similar
forms at a more modest scale, breaking facades and roof lines into smaller
segments, or stepping the building mass into the hillside. To the maximum
extent practical, buildings shall be placed down the hill or cut into the slope
to minimize the skyline penetration.
d. Form. The form of the physical development, particularly its roof form, shall
re-create the natural form of the hillside or butte. If the natural form of a
butte top Skyline that is being penetrated is flat, the building shall have a
flat roof form. If the natural form of a hillside Skyline is rounded or jagged,
the building shall use a hipped or similar roof form.
e. Exterior of Structure. The exterior of all physical development shall be built
or painted with earth tone materials or colors.
f. Roof Materials. The color of all roofs shall be the color of surrounding
vegetation or land features. Reflective roof materials shall not be used,
unless the materials are treated to eliminate reflection.
g. Earth Moving. Physical development shall minimize the need for earth
moving or disturbance to the maximum extent practicable. Earth moving
on a slope to create a flat platform on which development is placed shall
be prohibited. Areas disturbed for earth moving shall be revegetated using
native species which are already growing on or near the site. Topsoil shall

Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.5. Landscaping Standards
5.5.3. Required Plant Units (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
E. Standard Plant Unit
This Section describes a standard landscaping element called a “plant unit.” It
serves as a basic measure of plant material.
1. Standard Plant Units. Three standard plant unit alternatives are identified in the
table below. Any one or a combination of the alternatives may be used. Some
of the alternatives, however, may be required upon review of the proposed
landscape plan.
EXAMPLE: Where year-round screening is needed, Alternative C may be
required. Plant sizes given are minimums. All plant units shall be in scale
with the development proposed, and shall be of adequate installed size
to clearly achieve the purpose of the required plant units (e.g. screening,
buffering, softening of structural mass, community character enhancement).
Standard Plant Unit Alternatives
Alternative Quantity, Size & Type of Plants Required
A
1 3” caliper canopy tree
6 6’ – 8’ large shrubs or multi-stem trees
4 #5 container shrubs
B
2 3” caliper canopy trees
2 6’ – 8’ large shrubs or multi-stem trees
3 8’ high evergreen trees
C
(preferred for yearround
screening)
3 6’ – 8’ large shrub or multi-stem trees
3 8’ high evergreen trees
2 #5 container shrubs
2. Plant Guidelines. The following plant types are provided as guidelines:
a. 3-Inch Caliper Canopy Tree - Cottonwood or Aspen.
b. 6 to 8-Foot Large Shrub or Multi-Stem Trees - Chokecherry or Amur Maple.
c. #5 Container Shrub - Dogwood or Willow.
d. 8-Foot Evergreen - Spruce.
3. Alternative to Standard Plant Units. The Planning Director may relieve an
applicant from the standard plant units pursuant to Sec. 8.8.1. if it can be
demonstrated that:
a. The design intent of the proposed project is compromised by the use of the
standard plant units; and
b. The alternative proposed meets the objectives of softening and integrating
the project into the existing landscape.

5.5.4. General Landscaping Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
4. Substitutions for Standard Plant Units. The following substitutions in plant
units may be made where it is demonstrated that the substitution achieves
the objectives of the standard plant unit for which it is being substituted; or
the objectives of the requirement are achieved but additional plant units are
required.
a. Movable Planters. Ten square feet of permanent or movable planters
containing flowers, flowering shrubs or similar vegetation may be
substituted for 4 – #5 container shrubs. Notwithstanding, moveable planters
shall not be substituted for required landscaping in parking lots.
b. Bench. One bench seating at least 2 people, or a similar seating
arrangement, may be substituted for 1 canopy tree.
c. Bike Rack. One bike rack designed to accommodate at least 6 bikes may
be substituted for one canopy tree.

5.5.4. General Landscaping Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
5.5.4
A. Vegetation Required
All landscaped areas proposed for vegetation shall be planted with lawn, pasture,
or native groundcover unless such vegetation is already fully established. Once
landscaped, landscape areas shall be maintained to support plant life.
B. Plant Materials
1. Approved Plant Material. Plant material shall not be invasive as designated
by the noxious weeds and pests list maintained by the Teton County Weed
and Pest Control District and shall not be a noxious weed that appears on the
designated list under the Wyoming Weed and Pest Control Act of 1973.
a. Wyoming Seed Law. All seed used for site revegetation or restoration must
be used in accordance with WS 11-12-101 - 125 certified as weed free
and acquired through a dealer licensed by the Wyoming Department of
Agriculture.
b. Wyoming Nursery Stock Law. All nursery stock used for site revegetation
or restoration must be used in accordance with W.S. 11-9-101 through 109
accompanied by a valid health certificate and acquired through a dealer
licensed by the Wyoming Department of Agriculture.
2. Native Vegetation. All plant material should be native vegetation, which
duplicates adjacent plant communities both in species composition and spatial
distribution patterns.
5-46 Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations
Article 5. Physical Development Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 5.5. Landscaping Standards
5.5.4. General Landscaping Standards (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
EXAMPLE: Landscaping placed on a hillside or slope should consist of
plant material that is typically found on a similar hillside or slope. Similarly,
landscaping plant material placed in a floodplain or drainageway should
be native vegetation that is generally found in a similar floodplain or
drainageway. Further, the use of native vegetation should acknowledge
the relative attractiveness of certain plant species to wildlife. Responsive
planting designs should therefore position plants, which are palatable to
wildlife in areas where browsing damage will not affect the screening or
ornamental qualities of the planting plan.
C. Removal of Existing Vegetation Prohibited
Removal of specimen trees of 3 inch caliper or greater, and removal of shrub stands
and rows with an average height of 3 feet or greater is prohibited in the DC, CR-1,
CR-2, CR-3, OR, UC, PRD, MHP-ToJ, and BP-ToJ zones except in accordance with
an approved landscape plan. Removal of dead, diseased, or damaged trees and
shrubs which are a potential hazard to life and property may be approved by the
Planning Director. In addition, vegetation may be removed to meet fuel reduction
mitigation measures required by the Fire Marshal.
D. Use of Landscaped Areas
No portion of a site required to be landscaped shall be used for the parking of
vehicles or for open storage of any kind.
E. Open Space Standards
All areas of required open space that are presently covered with natural vegetation
and are to remain undisturbed shall not be required to be landscaped. Areas of open
space that have been disturbed, except those to be used as sports fields and other
areas that are to be paved, must be restored to prior conditions, as much as feasible.
In addition, adequate ground cover shall be provided so that no landscaped ground
areas are exposed to erosion. Noxious weeds appearing on the designated list
under the Wyoming Weed and Pest Control Act of 1973 shall be controlled.
F. Landscaping in Public Rights-of-Way
In addition to required landscaping on private property, the property owner shall be
responsible for the provision and maintenance of landscaping in accordance with
the requirements of this Section for that area between the property line and the back
of curb or the edge of the traveled way of any public street, alley or other public way,
in a manner which provides consistency of landscaping and maintenance between
the public properties to be landscaped and maintained and the adjacent private
property. When such property lies within the right-of-way of a street or highway
maintained by the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT), a landscape
permit from WYDOT must be obtained.

A. Irrigation
Landscape surface areas and plant units that cannot naturally be provided with
adequate moisture for the types of plants installed shall be equipped with an
irrigation system.
B. Phasing
Landscape plans and the installation of required plant materials may be phased
consistent with the development phasing approved for a project.
C. Required Time for Completion
All landscaping shall be in place prior to occupancy. The Planning Director may
allow occupancy without required landscaping in place if the landscaping will be
in place within one year. In such cases the Planning Director may require submittal
of a bond or other financial surety pursuant to Sec. 8.2.11. for installation of the
landscaping.
D. Maintenance
All landscaping required by these LDRs shall be maintained. Maintenance shall
include control of those noxious weeds that appear on the designated list under
the Wyoming Weed and Pest Control Act of 1973. Maintenance shall be the
responsibility of the landowner, and shall be carried out regularly so that the intent
and integrity of the required landscaping is preserved. If any plant materials die or
are damaged, they shall be replaced by the landowner.

5.7.1. Purpose and Applicability (1/4/17, Ord. 1162)
5.7.1
A. Purpose
It has been determined that runoff from construction sites carries a significant
amount of sediment and other pollutants to the waters of the State of Wyoming and
the Town. Therefore, it is the purpose of this Division to preserve natural resources; to
protect the quality of the waters of the State of Wyoming and the Town; and to protect
and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the people to the extent practicable
by minimizing the amount of sediment and other pollutants carried by runoff or
discharged from construction sites to lakes, streams, and wetlands. In addition, this
Division is also intended to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
Town from geologic hazards which may result through improper grading practices.
B. Applicability
This Division shall apply to all land disturbing activity and all excavations unless
explicitly exempted. Agriculture meeting the standards for exemption in Section
6.1.3.B. is not considered a land disturbing activity, unless it disturbs natural slopes
of 25% or greater.
EXAMPLE: Examples of land disturbing activities include, but are not limited to,
grading, topsoil removal, filling, road or drive cutting, altering or enlargement of
a stream or channel, removal of streambed materials, channel clearing, ditching,
drain tile laying, dredging, lagoon construction, soil and water conservation
structures, and the extraction or placement of rock, sand, or gravel. Grading
permits shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to Sec. 8.3.4. Also refer to the
Teton Conservation District’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan Guide.
C. Varied Standards for Levee Construction and Maintenance
The standards of this Division may be varied as necessary to allow for construction
and maintenance of flood control structures, such as levees.
D. Grading Permit Required
A grading permit shall be submitted to describe the site grading, erosion controls,
and stormwater management that will be used to meet the requirements of this
Division. A grading permit is required for all land disturbing activities unless explicitly
exempted. There are 2 levels of grading permit.
1. Statement Level Grading Permit. The purpose of the statement level grading
permit is to allow the Town Engineer to review land disturbances that, while small
in area, may impact other landowners and the environment.

9. Minimizes Cut and Fill. The plan shall minimize cut and fill on a site. An
application for a grading and erosion control permit shall be denied if it is
determined that its issuance would result in excessive cutting and filling and that
the intended structure or use would be feasible with less alteration of the natural
terrain.
10. Discovery of Historic or Prehistoric Ruins and Monuments. Whenever during
excavation there are uncovered, or become apparent, any historic or prehistoric
ruins or monuments not previously accounted for in the issuance of a permit, all
work in the immediate area shall cease until the Wyoming State Archaeologist
determines what precautions shall be taken to preserve the historic or
prehistoric artifacts.
11. Maintenance and Repair Measures. All graded surfaces, sedimentation basins,
and other control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this Section
shall be maintained by the applicant, landowner, or subsequent landowner
during the period of land disturbance and land development of the site in a
satisfactory manner to ensure adequate protection from erosion and to prevent
nuisance conditions. Nuisance conditions include, but are not limited to, the
tracking of dirt and mud onto public streets, and fugitive dust. Should any
dredging or soil removal occur for the construction of temporary sedimentation
basins or other control measures, such areas shall be restored when the
temporary sedimentation basin or other control measures are removed.
B. Grading Standards
All grading activities shall meet the following technical standards.
1. Removal of Organic Materials. Fill areas shall be properly prepared by removing
organic materials, such as vegetation and rubbish, and any other material which
is detrimental to the proper compaction of the site or not otherwise conducive to
the stability of the site.
2. Site Vegetation Removal and Revegetation. The removal of existing vegetation
shall not occur more than 30 days prior to the commencement of grading,
and permanent revegetation shall be commenced as soon as practical after
the completion of grading. Site specific native seed mixtures shall be used to
revegetate all disturbed areas with the exception of lawn and landscaped areas.
Mulching shall be used in order to assure vegetation growth.
3. Topsoil, Stripping, Stockpiling, and Redistribution. The existing topsoil shall be
stripped and stockpiled on site for redistribution over the completed final grade.
4. Retaining Walls and Facings. All retaining walls or facings with a total vertical
projection in excess of 4 feet shall be designed as structural members keyed
into stable foundations capable of sustaining the design loads, and shall be
designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Wyoming.

Society of Testing Materials (ASTM D698, most recent edition), or to the
compaction level deemed necessary by a Wyoming registered professional
engineer, considering the types of soil, groundwater infiltration and percolation,
degree of slope, exposure, and other factors pertaining to slope stability.
6. Interceptor Ditches. Interceptor ditches shall be provided above all cut slopes
greater than 5 feet, with a drainage area of 13,000 square feet, unless deemed
unnecessary by the Town Engineer taking into account vegetation, soil type,
total drainage area, topography and potential rain and snow fall. Interceptor
ditches may also be required when the drainage area is less than 13,000 square
feet at the discretion of the Town Engineer in consideration of the factors listed
above. The intercepted water shall be conveyed to a stable channel or natural
drainageway with adequate capacity to carry the flow.
7. Fill Slopes near Roads. On roads, fill slopes shall not be located where the base
of the slope is within 15 feet horizontally of the top of an exterior or planned cut
slope, except at road switchbacks.
8. Cut and Fill within Site Boundaries. In the absence of a mutual grading easement
between adjacent land owners, the tops and toes of cut and fill slopes shall
be within the property lines of the proposal. Where adjacent landowners agree
to waive this requirement for all or a portion of their common boundary, an
easement for the grading activity, maintenance activity and the final grading
configuration shall be required for each lot of record affected. A copy of the
easement(s) shall be submitted for staff review as a part of the grading approval
process. The easement(s) shall be recorded by the Teton County Clerk and
recorded against the subject lots of record.
9. Borrowing for Fill Prohibited. Except for existing quarries, borrowing for fill shall
be prohibited unless the fill material is obtained from a cut authorized by the
issuance of a grading and erosion control permit obtained for some purpose
other than to produce fill material.
10. Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be graded to a slope no steeper
than 2:1, or 50%, to allow for permanent revegetation or landscaping unless
a retaining wall is used or a steeper slope is approved by the Town Engineer.
The Town Engineer may require the submission of a detailed engineering report
and analysis prepared by a registered State of Wyoming professional engineer
relative to the safety of such cuts and fills, if necessary considering soil type, soil
stability, and any proposed structures.

B. Design Criteria, Standards, and Specifications for Erosion Control Measures
The following standards shall apply to all grading activities during land disturbance.
1. Site Dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary
sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, up-slope chambers, hydrocyclones,
swirl concentrators, filter fences, or other appropriate controls as
determined by the Town Engineer. Water may not be discharged in a manner
that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels. All required State
discharge permits for discharging to surface waters or groundwaters shall be
obtained and applicable State requirements met prior to discharge.
2. Waste and Material Disposal. All waste and unused building materials (including
garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or hazardous
materials) shall be properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff
into a receiving channel, basin, or storm sewer system. No on-site burial of
construction wastes or unused materials is allowed.
3. Drain Inlet Protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected with a straw bale,
filter fabric, or equivalent barrier.
4. Site Erosion Control. The following criteria apply only to land development or
land disturbing activities that result in runoff leaving the site:
a. Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be
diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall
be protected as described in this Section. Sheet flow runoff from adjacent
areas greater than 13,000 square feet shall also be diverted around
disturbed areas unless shown to have non-scouring velocities. Diverted
runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance
and receiving channels.
b. All activities on the site shall be conducted in logical sequence to minimize
the area of bare soil exposed at any one time.
c. Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by filter
fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures placed along all side
slope and down slope sides of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated
runoff passes through the site, filter fences shall be placed along the
channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel.

shore to prevent people or objects from sliding into deep water. There
shall be a freeboard of no less than 12 inches above the high-water
elevation on all retention basins. Alternate designs for side slopes may
be considered under special circumstances where good engineering
practice is demonstrated. The below illustration presents this concept.

Div. 6.1. Allowed Uses
Div. 6.1
6.1.1. Use Schedule (7/18/18, Ord. 1198)
6.1.1
The Use Schedule establishes the principal, accessory, and temporary uses allowed in
each zone. The definitions and standards for each use are established in Sec. 6.1.2.-Sec.
6.1.12. and referenced in the table. Additional uses may be allowed in a zone as part
of an allowed development option as specified in Div. 7.1. The permit required for each
allowed use is designated using the following symbols.
A. “Y” denotes an allowed use that does not require a use permit. Physical development
permits are still required as applicable.
B. “B” denotes an allowed use that requires a Basic Use Permit to be obtained pursuant
to Sec. 8.4.1.
C. “C” denotes an allowed use that requires a Conditional Use Permit to be obtained
pursuant to Sec. 8.4.2. A conditional use is generally compatible with the character
of a zone but requires individual review of its configuration, density, and intensity in
order to mitigate effects that may be adverse to the desired character of the zone.
D. “S” denotes an allowed use that requires a Special Use Permit to be obtained
pursuant to Sec. 8.4.3. Special uses are inherently incompatible with the character
of the zone, but essential to the community; and therefore some provision must be
made for their existence and operation. Special uses require specified locations
due to common neighborhood opposition. These locations shall be determined by a
comprehensive community-wide selection process designed to identify locations that
best serve the special use while minimizing the negative impacts and obtrusiveness.
Special uses also require individual review of their configuration, density, and
intensity in order to mitigate effects that are adverse to the desired character of the
zone.
E. Permit Exemption for Emergency Response
From time to time, a use may be a necessary part of an emergency response under
the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, implemented by Teton County
Emergency Management. In such instances, the requirement for a use permit shall
be waived.
EXAMPLE: A heliport is an aviation use requiring a Conditional Use Permit.
Temporary heliports are sometimes established in proximity to a forest fire for
purposes of helicopter fire suppression. In the case of an emergency response,
the requirement for a CUP is waived.
F. Use Schedule
The use schedule is established in the following tables.

6.1.2. Classification of Uses (1/4/17, Ord. 1163)
6.1.2. Classification of Uses (1/4/17, Ord. 1163)
6.1.2
A. Definition of Use
Use means the purpose for which a site or structure is occupied or maintained.
There are three categories of uses: principal, accessory, and temporary.
B. Classification of Uses
1. Principal Use. A principal use is a use that may exist as the sole use of the
property. More than one principal use may exist on a property. A principal use
includes all incidental uses. Principal uses are organized into 8 categories:
a. Open Space Uses (Sec. 6.1.2.)
b. Residential Uses (Sec. 6.1.4.)
c. Lodging Uses (Sec. 6.1.5.)
d. Commercial Uses (Sec. 6.1.6.)
e. Amusement and Recreation Uses (Sec. 6.1.7.)
f. Institutional Uses (Sec. 6.1.8.)
g. Industrial Uses (Sec. 6.1.9.)
h. Transportation and Infrastructure Uses (Sec. 6.1.10.)
2. Incidental Use. An incidental use is a use that is commonly integrated into the
operation of a principal use, even if the incidental use would be classified as a
different use if it were separated. A use cannot be incidental if the principal use
does not exist.
EXAMPLE: A cabinet contractor may have an office to run the business
within its shop without the office being considered a separate use. As
another example, a golf course may sell golf equipment as part of its
operation without the pro shop being considered a separate retail use.
3. Accessory Use. An accessory use is a use that constitutes a minority of the use
or character of the property and is secondary and subordinate to another use of
the same property, but which is not an incidental use.
4. Primary Use. A primary use is a use to which an accessory use is accessory.
5. Temporary Use. A temporary use is a use established for a fixed period of time.
C. Multiple Uses
Each use listed as a separate row in the Use Schedule shall require a permit unless
the use is incidental to a permitted use or the use is exempt from a permit.

Article 6. Use Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 6.1. Allowed Uses
6.1.3. Open Space Uses (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
D. Use Not Listed
Any use not specifically listed in the Use Schedule is expressly prohibited unless a
similar use determination is made.
E. Similar Use Determination
A use not specifically listed in the Use Schedule may be considered an allowed use
if the Planning Director determines the proposed use is sufficiently similar to one of
the uses defined in this Division. The Planning Director’s determination shall be made
based upon the findings for a formal interpretation (Sec. 8.6.1.) but may be made
as part of the review of a use permit application. If a use is determined to be similar,
it shall be an allowed use with the same permissions and restrictions as the use to
which it was determined to be similar.
F. Change of Use
A change of use consists of changing the use from a use classified in a particular
row of the Use Schedule to a use classified in a different row of the Use Schedule.
Except as provided elsewhere in these LDRs, the proposed use shall meet all
standards of these LDRs. The required permit for the proposed use shall be obtained
pursuant to the relevant procedure.
6.1.3. Open Space Uses (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
6.1.3
A. All Open Space Uses
1. Definition. An open space use is the enjoyment or maintenance of land that
occurs predominately outside of any structure.
B. Agriculture
1. Definition. Agriculture is the farming or ranching of land.
a. Includes:
i. cultivation of the soil
ii. production of forage, crops, or timber
iii. growing of ornamental or landscaping plants
iv. greenhouses
v. rearing, feeding, and management of livestock
2. Standards
a. Purpose. The purpose of these standards is to:
i. protect and maintain the existing and potential agricultural lands for the
purpose of perpetuating agriculture;
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 6-9
Article 6. Use Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 6.1. Allowed Uses
6.1.3. Open Space Uses (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
ii. minimize conflicts between agricultural operations and neighboring
developments by encouraging protection of large, contiguous blocks of
open space; and
iii. to preserve agricultural open space which is crucial to the wildlife,
scenic and community values of Teton County, as outlined in the
Comprehensive Plan.
b. Active. Agricultural land shall be actively farmed or ranched.
c. Ancillary retail prohibited. Retail sale of agricultural products on-site is
prohibited unless permitted as a separate use.
d. Exemptions. The following exemptions apply to agricultural uses:
i. Regulation Exemptions. Agricultural uses are exempt from certain
provisions of the regulations listed below. Refer to the referenced LDR
section for specifics of the exemption.
a). Grading, Erosion Control, and Stormwater except on natural slopes
of 25% or greater (Sec. 5.7.2. - Sec. 5.7.4.)
b). Affordable Workforce Housing Requirements (Div. 6.3.)
ii. Permit Exemptions. Agricultural uses are exempt from obtaining the
following permits. However, exemption from the requirement to obtain a
permit does not grant exemption from any regulations. See subsection
6.1.3.B.2.d.i., above for applicable regulation exemptions.
a). Grading Permits except on natural slopes of 25% or greater (Sec.
5.7.1.)
C. Outdoor Recreation
1. Definition. Outdoor recreation is the use of land for passive or active recreational
or athletic purposes that requires minimal permanent physical development
relative to the open space.
a. Includes:
i. parks
ii. arboretums
iii. athletic fields not in stadiums
iv. equestrian centers
v. nordic ski trails
vi. downhill ski areas
vii. outdoor receptions (4 or more events per year, excluding non-profit
events)

Div. 6.3. Affordable Workforce Housing Standards
Div. 6.3
6.3.1. Purpose and Findings (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
66..33..11
A. Purpose
The purpose of these affordable workforce housing standards is to ensure that
affordable workforce housing is provided to the local workforce by employee
generating development proportionate with the need for affordable workforce
housing it creates.
B. Legislative Findings
In adopting this Section, the Town Council finds:
1. A local workforce is a defining feature of community character. An essential
component of the community character and social, economic, and political
fabric of Teton County and the Town of Jackson over the years is the presence
of those persons and families that work in the community, live in the community,
attend schools in the community, worship in the community, and vote in
the community. Maintenance of a local workforce is key to a balanced and
sustainable local economy and resilient level of critical service provision.
2. Supply of local workforce housing is limited by affordability. One of the primary
factors that historically allowed this special community character in Teton County
and the Town of Jackson is that, until the mid-1990s, the cost of housing was
affordable to those persons living and working in the community. Beginning
in the mid-1980s, a significant second home market emerged in Jackson
Hole. These home buyers came from different parts of the country and had
substantially higher incomes than the local workforce. They have contributed to
a dramatic increase in land and construction costs in the community, resulting
in a substantial increase in the price of housing. This increase in housing
prices, when coupled with slightly increasing or static local workforce wages
(accounting for inflation), has made market-rate housing unaffordable to most
of the local workforce, forcing many to move outside the community. Review
of state and national census and other wage and labor data demonstrate this
trend.
a. In 1986, median sales prices of homes ($90,000) in Teton County and
the Town of Jackson were on target with the affordable housing price for
a median income household ($90,667). From that point in time forward,
housing prices have increased so that they no longer align with what is
affordable to median income households.
b. By 2000, the median sales price ($565,000) was nearly 3 times the price
that was affordable to a median income household ($196,333).
c. In 2007, the median sales price ($1,075,000) was approximately 4 times the
price affordable to a median income household ($270,000).

Article 6. Use Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 6.3. Affordable Workforce Housing Standards
6.3.1. Purpose and Findings (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
d. While the Great Recession had an impact on housing prices, even during
the downturn housing was never affordable to most of the workforce. In
2012, the median sales price of housing ($853,150) was more than 2.6
times the price that is affordable to a median income household ($320,667).
e. By 2016, the affordability gap had returned to pre-Great Recession levels
with the median sales price ($1,130,000) at 3.95 times the price that is
affordable to a median income household ($286,000).
3. Local housing supply has not been added at the same rate as local jobs. In
conjunction with the decrease in affordability, there is a shortage of local
workforce housing because job growth has outpaced housing growth. Since
2000, jobs have grown at an annual rate of 2.1% while the nubmer of housing
units has only grown at an annual rate of 1.6%.
4. As a result, the percentage of the workforce living locally has declined. These
phenomena have resulted in a number of persons employed in the community
and their families being forced to move outside the community, to places like
Teton County, Idaho and Lincoln County, Wyoming. Estimates indicate that in
1986 approximately 91% of the workforce lived locally. In 1995 this number
had decreased to approximately 80%. By 2005 it was 68%. By 2015, it was
estimated only 58% of the workforce resided locally.
5. The decline in the local workforce has resulted in a deterioration of community
character. This decline in the percentage of the workforce living locally has
resulted in an impairment of the social, economic, and political fabric of the
community, along with the community’s character. Estimates indicate this
problem will continue to worsen in the future, unless additional housing is
provided within price and rental ranges that are affordable to the workforce.
More specifically:
a. A local workforce household is more likely to reinvest socially, civically, and
economically in the community. As a greater percentage of the workforce
commutes, their children no longer attend schools in the community, they
no longer worship in the community, and they no longer express their ideas
at the ballot box.
b. A local workforce results in a more balanced and sustainable local economy
and resilient provision of critical services. As the community becomes
more reliant on commuters, it also becomes more susceptible to weather
events that adversely impact the local economy and the provision of critical
community services.
c. A local workforce also results in a healthier ecosystem. A commuter
workforce generates more traffic than a local workforce, which results in
greater impact to wildlife and the environment in general.
d. The lack of local affordable workforce housing opportunities will result in
the loss of generational continuity. If there are few housing opportunities
available that are affordable to the workforce, there is little chance

Article 6. Use Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 6.3. Affordable Workforce Housing Standards
6.3.2. Applicability (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
children who grow up in the community can raise their own families in the
community, and continue to support and participate in the civic and social
life of the community which they have been a part of their entire lives.
6. As a result the community set a workforce housing goal. To address the impacts
from this loss of the local workforce, in 2012 Teton County and the Town of
Jackson set a goal in the Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan to ensure
a variety of workforce housing opportunities exist in the community so that at
least 65% of those employed locally live locally.
7. To implement this goal, development must provide mitigation for the need for
affordable workforce housing it creates. To assist in the implementation of this
goal, these standards require employee generating development to provide
affordable workforce housing proportionate to the need it creates.
8. For these reasons, these affordable workforce housing standards, are hereby
adopted by the Town Council.
C. Technical support
The technical support and analysis upon which these affordable workforce housing
standards are established is based upon The Teton County and Town of Jackson
Employee Generation Land Use Study (August 22, 2013), as amended, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
D. Authority
The Town Council of the Town of Jackson has the authority to adopt these affordable
workforce housing standards in accordance with Article 13, Section 1 of the
Wyoming Constitution, and Section 15-1-601, et. seq., Wyoming Statutes, and such
other authorities and provisions that are established in the statutory and common law
of the State of Wyoming.
6.3.2. Applicability (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
6.3.2
These affordable workforce housing standards apply to any employee generating
development, unless exempted below.
A. Employee Generating Development
Employee generating development is a new building or use not currently in
existence, as further defined below.
1. Existence. For the purpose of this standard existance shall mean a building or
use existing on December 18, 1995, or the building or use legally established
since that date with the highest affordable workforce housing requirement. The
burden of identifying the existing building or use shall be the responsibility of the
landowner. The landowner shall provide the Planning Director photos, permits,
licenses, records, or other documentation that establishes the existing building
or use.

Article 6. Use Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 6.3. Affordable Workforce Housing Standards
6.3.2. Applicability (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
EXAMPLE: On December 18, 1995 the use of a property was a restaurant/
bar. In 2000 the use of the property changed to retail. In 2010 the use of the
property changed to office. The exiting use for the purpose of this standard
is restaurant/bar because restaurant/bar use has the highest affordable
workforce housing requirement of the legal uses since December 18, 1995.
EXAMPLE: An office space built as permitted in 2004 is considered existing
for the purpose of this standard, regardless of the employee mitigation
provided in 2004.
a. This definition of existence shall not apply to an attached single-family unit
or apartment for which housing mitigation has not been provided. (It shall
apply to other residential uses.)
EXAMPLE: An existing apartment building built prior to 1995 is being
razed to build a new apartment building. Because the apartment building
being razed did not provide any affordable housing mitigation when it
was built, the new apartment building would be subject to this Division as
though the apartment building being razed did not exist.
2. Other types of development. This division only applies to new building and use.
A non-building physical development, development option, or subdivision is not
employee generating development and not subject to this Division, except that
Sec 4.3.1.F.6. requires a Planned Resort Master Plan to include an estimation of
the affordable workforce housing that will be required for the entire resort and a
housing mitigation plan for the entire resort.
EXAMPLE: This Division does not apply to an application for a single-family
subdivision. This Division will be applied to each lot in the subdivision at the
time a building permit is submitted.
B. Approved Unbuilt Development
1. Approval prior to December 18, 1995. Employee generating development
approved prior to December 18, 1995 which has not yet been developed shall
also be subject to this Division upon submittal of any required application to
complete the development.
EXAMPLE: There is no “credit” for an existing vacant lot. A subdivision
completed in 1992 approved construction of a detached single-family unit on
each of the lots in the subdivision. Upon application for a building permit to
build a unit on one of the lots in the subdivision, this Division shall apply.
EXAMPLE: A Planned Unit Development approved in 2004 allows
commercial and residential development on a site, but does not include a
specific housing mitigation plan outlining the required number of affordable
and employee housing units. Upon application for a development plan,
building permit, or use permit under that PUD this Division shall apply.

6.3.2. Applicability (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
2. Substantial amendment to prior approval. In addition, this Division shall apply to
all employee generating development not completed under an existing approval
when that existing approval is substantially amended, regardless of whether
the amendment applies to the entire uncompleted portion of the approval, and
regardless of the approved Housing Mitigation Plan (or Housing Mitigation
Agreement). A substantial amendment is any amendment that would increase
the amount of affordable workforce housing required.
EXAMPLE: A Sketch Plan was approved for a 3 building development and
included a Housing Mitigation Plan. Only 1 building has been built, and only
the required housing associated with the built building has been provided.
An amendment to the Sketch Plan is proposed to increase the size of 1 of
the unbuilt buildings. The amount of affordable workforce housing required to
approve the amendment would be equal to the current requirement for both
unbuilt buildings.
C. Exemptions
The following are exempt from the standards of this Division.
1. Housing Department Unit. A residential unit subject to a deed restriction
administered by the Housing Department.
2. Other Workforce Housing. A residential unit subject to a deed restriction
administered by the Jackson Hole Community Housing Trust or Habitat for
Humanity of the Greater Teton Area; or an apartment in the NL-5 zone.
3. Historic Building. Use of a building included on the Teton County Historical
Preservation Board (TCHPB) list of historically significant properties, or that
is otherwise deemed in writing by the TCHPB to be historically significant. In
addition, if a historic building is used in its historic location, floor area elsewhere
on the site equal to the amount of historic floor area used on-site is also exempt.
EXAMPLE: A 2,000 square foot historic cabin being converted into a
restaurant would be exempt from this Division. If the historic cabin has not
been moved and is being used as a restaurant in its historic location, another
2,000 square feet of floor area elsewhere on the site are also exempt from this
division. If the historic cabin has been relocated from another location, only
the cabin itself is exempt.
4. Agriculture. An agriculture use (6.1.3.B.).
5. Replacement after Damage by Natural Disaster. Replacement of an attached
single-family unit (6.1.4.C.) or apartment (6.1.4.D.) that is demolished or
destroyed by a natural disaster or through any manner not willfully accomplished
by the owner, regardless of the extent of the demolition or destruction. The
replacement shall be complete, or an application to complete shall be sufficient,
within 18 months of the date of destruction.
6. Mobile Home. A mobile home (6.1.4.E.) or mobile home park (Sec. 7.1.4.).

A. Requirement
Any employee generating development to which this Division applies shall provide
at least the amount of affordable workforce housing determined by the following
calculations. The calculations vary by the use being proposed and are the function
of the size of the proposal. The calculations are based on the analysis found in the
Teton County and Town of Jackson Employee Generation Land Use Study (August
22, 2013), as amended, and assume an affordable workforce housing unit houses
1.8 local employees.

6.3.3. Amount of Affordable Workforce Housing Required (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
1. Schedule and Calculator Available. A schedule of the requirement for employee
generating development of various sizes and a calculator to use in determining
the requirement are both available in the Administrative Manual. The residential
requirement is a logarithmic equation because there is an exponential
relationship between the size of a unit and the number of operations and
maintenance employees generated.
2. Use Not Listed. For uses not listed, the Planning Director shall either find a use
comparable to the proposed employee generating development and utilize the
comparable calculation, or require the applicant to conduct an independent
calculation pursuant to 6.3.3.B. to determine the requirement.
3. Expansion. In the case of an expansion to an existing building or use
(6.3.2.A.1.), the amount of affordable workforce housing required shall be
calculated based on the difference between the requirement for the proposed
and existing employee generating development.
EXAMPLE: A 5,000 sf office building proposing to add 1,500 sf would be
required to provide 0.74 affordable workforce housing units (0.000493 * 6,500
- 0.000493 * 5,000 = 0.74). A 3,000 sf detached single family home proposing
to add 500 sf would be required to provide 0.017 affordable workforce
housing units ((0.000017 * 3,500 + Exp(-15.49 + 1.59*Ln(3,500))/2.176) -
(0.000017 * 3,000 + Exp(-15.49 + 1.59*Ln(3,000))/2.176) = 0.017).
4. Change of Use. In the case of a change of use, the amount of affordable
workforce housing required shall be the difference between the requirement for
the proposed use and the requirement for the existing use (6.3.2.A.1.)
EXAMPLE: A proposal to use a 2,000 sf retail space as an office would be
required to include 0.124 affordable workforce housing units (0.000493 *
2,000 - 0.000431 * 2,000 = 0.124).
5. Unknown Use. For the development of floor area with an unknown use, the
allowed use in the zoning district with the greatest need for affordable workforce
housing shall be used, except that Restaurant/Bar use shall only be required in
association with a Restaurant/Bar use permit.
6. Sf. In the calculations “sf” is equal to the habitable floor area (in square feet),
including basement, of each residential, lodging, or nonresidential unit.
a. The calculation for a multi-unit building shall be the sum of the calculation
for each unit.
b. Common hallways, entryways, stairways, and other circulation areas in
buildings with multiple residential or nonresidential units, that are not within
any individual unit, shall not be included in the calculation.
7. Room. In the calculations “room” is equal to a single lodging room. In the case
of a conventional lodging or short-term rental with multiple bedrooms per unit,
the number of rooms used in the calculation shall be the number of bedrooms,
not the number of units.

8. Local Occupancy Restriction. The calculation for non-local occupancy shall be
applied to all residential uses. In order to utilize the local occupancy calculation,
a restriction shall be placed on the unit that requires compliance with the
occupancy qualification requirement of the Housing Department Rules and
Regulations. Placement of an affordable restriction or workforce restriction on a
unit, as defined in the Housing Department Rules and Regulations, shall exempt
the unit from any requirement pursuant to 6.3.2.C.1.. However, 6.3.2.C.1. does
not apply to an occupancy restriction placed to utilize the local occupancy
calculation.
EXAMPLE: An applicant proposing to build 3 – 1,000 square foot attached
single-family units would be required to provide 0.108 affordable workforce
housing units (3 * (0.000017 * 1,000 + Exp(-14.17 + 1.59*Ln(1,000))/2.176)
= 0.108). If a workforce restriction is placed on the units, they are exempt
from the requirements of this Section. If an occupancy restriction is placed
on the units, 0.081 affordable workforce housing units would be required (3 *
(0.000017 * 1,000 + Exp(-14.82 + 1.59*Ln(1,000))/2.176) = 0.081)..
9. Removal of a Voluntary Restriction. An affordable, workforce, or occupancy
restriction voluntarily placed on a unit may be removed. In order to remove
such a restriction, the affordable workforce housing required on the date of the
removal shall be provided. In the case of removal of an occupancy restriction
the affordable workforce housing requirement shall be calculated as a change of
use from local to non-local occupancy.
10. Update Requirement Regularly. The determination of need for affordable
workforce housing shall be evaluated and updated at least every 5 years
to account for changes in the economic and demographic trends in the
community. Updates shall be based on update to The Teton County and Town of
Jackson Employee Generation Land Use Study (August 22, 2013), as amended.
B. Independent Calculation
Where applicable, an independent calculation shall establish the amount of
affordable workforce housing required. The intent of the independent calculation is to
identify a requirement for an industry that is proportional to the demand for affordable
workforce housing that industry generates, where the general circumstances
surveyed in the Teton County and Town of Jackson Employee Generation Land Use
Study (August 22, 2013), as amended, do not represent unique circumstances of the
industry. The independent calculation is not intended to be business specific.
1. Applicability
a. Applicant option. An applicant may elect to prepare an independent
calculation of the required affordable workforce housing if the applicant
believes the nature, timing, or location of the proposed employee
generating development is likely to create less need for affordable
workforce housing than otherwise required in this Section.
b. Unspecified use. The Planning Director may require an independent
calculation of the need created for required affordable workforce housing if:

i. A calculation for the proposed use is not established in Sec. 6.3.3.A.; or
ii. A proposed use does not rely on floor area; or
iii. The proposl is a Planned Resort estimating housing need pursuant to
Sec. 4.3.1.F.6.; or
iv. The Planning Director finds the employee generating development
to be unique from the general circumstances surveyed in The Teton
County and Town of Jackson Employee Generation Land Use Study
(August 22, 2013), as amended.
2. Calculation Methodology. An independent calculation shall use the methodology
used in the Teton County and Town of Jackson Employee Generation Land
Use Study (August 22, 2013) to generate the calculations in Sec. 6.3.3.A. That
methodology is represented by the following equation:
Requirement (units per sf/room) = [A/30/X*Y] + [B/X*Y] + [C/X*Y] + [D/X*Y]
a. A = the number of construction workers needed to construct one sf or room
of the use.
b. B = the post-construction workers needed to operate one sf/room of the
use. In the case of residential development, these are the operations
and maintenance employees such as landscapers, trash collectors, and
property managers. In the case of nonresidential development, these are
the employees who work at the use.
c. C = the number of fire and emergency medical personnel needed to serve
one sf/room of the use.
d. D = the number of law enforcement personnel needed to serve one sf/room
of the use.
e. 30 = the 30 year average career of a construction worker.
f. X = the average number of workers in the household of an employee in a
specific industry.
g. Y = the percentage of workers in a specific industry that cannot afford
market housing.
3. Calculation Values. The values in the Teton County and Town of Jackson
Employee Generation Land Use Study (August 22, 2013), as amended, shall be
used in the independent calculation except pursuant to the following standards.
a. Values that may be altered. In the equation for independent calculation an
alternate value shall only be used for A, B, or the X and Y values associated
with an altered A or B.
b. Alternate values. The alternate value proposed shall be calculated using:

iii. Data that is industry specific rather than business specific; and
iv. In the case of B, the year-round (including dual seasonal), postconstruction
occupancy of the space.
EXAMPLE: A space that is leased to a raft guiding operation in the
summer and snowmobile guiding operation in the winter. For a space
that size, a raft guiding operation averages 10 employees and a
snowmobile guiding operation averages 7 employees. “B” for that

The affordable workforce housing required by this Division shall comply with the following
requirements to ensure its affordability and livability.
A. Unit types allowed.
A required affordable or workforce housing unit shall be a detached single-family unit
(6.1.4.B.), attached single-family unit (6.1.4.C.), apartment (6.1.4.D.), or accessory
residential unit (6.1.11.B.). No other residential or lodging unit type shall be required
affordable workforce housing.
B. Affordability.
1. Restriction. Each affordable or workforce housing unit shall be subject to one of
the following restrictions.
a. Less than 50% of Median Income. An affordable rental restriction, as defined
in the Housing Department Rules and Regulations, ensuring affordability for
households making 50% of family median income or less.
b. 50%-80% of Median Income. An affordable rental restriction, as defined in
the Housing Department Rules and Regulations, ensuring affordability for
households making above 50% up to 80% of family median income.
c. 80%-120% of Median Income. An affordable rental or affordable ownership
restriction, as defined in the Housing Department Rules and Regulations,
ensuring affordability for households making above 80% up to 120% of
family median income.
d. 120%-200% of Median Income. A workforce rental or workforce ownership
restriction, as defined in the Housing Department Rules and Regulations, for
households making above 120% up to 200% of family median income.
2. Allocation of restrictions. The above restrictions shall be allocated to the
required units in the following order. For requirements above 7 units, the order of
allocation shall repeat. A fractional requirement shall be the last allocated.

Article 6. Use Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 6.3. Affordable Workforce Housing Standards
6.3.5. Method for Providing Required Affordable Workforce Housing (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
1. Construction of required affordable workforce housing on the site of the
employee generating development, or off-site. Below are LDRs intened to
facilitate constrution of required affordable workfoce housing.
a. FAR exemption for affordable or workforce housing units. Applies in the DC,
CR-1, CR-2, CR-3, OR, NH-1, and NM-2 zones, see Sec. 7.8.3.
b. 25% FAR Bonus for affordable or workforce housing units. Applies in the TS,
UC, and BP zones, see the applicable zone.
c. FAR Increases for more units. Applies in the NL-5 and NM-1 zones, see the
applicable zone.
d. Shared parking between nonresidential use and affordable workforce
housing. Applies in all zones, see Sec. 6.2.2.B.1.
2. Conveyance of land for affordable workforce housing.
3. Utilization of a banked affordable or workforce housing unit.
4. Restriction of an existing residential unit as an affordable workforce housing.
5. Payment of an in-lieu fee.
C. Priority Method Impracticable
A required affordable or workforce housing unit shall be provided through the highest
priority method practicable. A lower priority method may be used upon making the
following findings for each higher priority method.
1. Less than one unit. An in-lieu fee may be paid for an affordable workforce
housing requirement of less than one unit.
a. Exception for change to short-term rental. In buildings approved under
the affordable workforce housing standards in place since July 18, 2018,
change of use of a unit from attached-single family or apartment to shortterm
rental shall be mitigated by construction of the required housing
regardless of the amount of the requirement.
2. On-site provision impractical. On-site provision of the required affordable
workforce housing:
a. Does not comply with other Town, County, State, or Federal laws; or
b. Is unreasonable due to lack of infrastructure, inappropriate soils, or other
site conditions.
3. Off-site methods not reasonably available. A good faith effort to provide
the required affordable workforce housing off-site, is unsuccessful due to
infrastructure, regulatory (either Town, County, State or Federal), or other site
constraints of the land, or due to the price at which the land was available for
sale. Conditions relevant to these constraints include but are not limited to
factors like:

C. Tenant Notification
The owner proposing a condominium or townhouse subdivision shall, in writing,
notify the current tenants of the units, provide the tenants the opportunity to purchase
their unit, and provide a grace period to relocate.
1. Notice to Tenants. The owner of a proposed condominium or townhouse
subdivision shall notify the current tenants, in writing, via certified and U.S.
mail, of the plans to convert the development to condominiums or townhouses
and provide the tenants the opportunity to purchase the unit they occupy. The
tenants shall be given a minimum of 30 days to decide if they wish to purchase
the unit they occupy. This written notice and 30 day decision period may run
concurrently with applications for approval.
2. Grace Period to Relocate . If any tenant decides to not purchase the unit they
occupy or does not respond, in writing, within 30 days to the offer to purchase
their unit, the owner of the development shall provide a written notice to the
tenant, via certified and U.S. Mail, to vacate the unit and provide a minimum of
60 days from receipt of said written notice to relocate.
D. Site Compliance
Conformity of the physical development and use of a lot of record to be subdivided
into townhouse or condominium lots will continue to be determined based on the
boundary of the site to be subdivided, not the boundaries of the resultant townhouse
lots or condominium units.
E. Townhouse Subdivision
Townhouse subdivision is the subdivision of land around the base of a unit that is
intended to separate ownership of the units in a development while still retaining the
character of a single, integrated development. A Townhouse subdivision shall be
exempt from the minimum lot size requirement if the following standards are met.
1. Common Element Interest Required. A lot of record may be subdivided into
lots of less than the minimum lot size for the zone if each resultant lot retains an
undivided interest in common elements of the lot of record.
2. Maximum Lot Size. A townhouse lot shall not exceed 125% of the area of
footprint of the approved unit.
3. Building Official Review. The building official shall review and approve the
proposed location of the townhouse lots.

A. Applicability
All residential subdivisions and re-subdivisions, including new condominiums and
townhouse projects to be developed or constructed, and the conversion of existing
dwelling units to a condominium or townhouse subdivision, which is the subject of
an approved, recorded plat shall be required to dedicate lands for school and park
development unless specifically exempted by other provisions of this Division.
Any subdivision, re-subdivision, or condominium or townhouse subdivision or
development on land subject to a recorded plat for which exactions have been fully
and properly paid pursuant to this Section shall not be subject to exactions, except
for the incremental increase in the number of dwelling units, if any, over and above
those permitted by the previous plat for which exactions were paid.
B. Intent
The Town of Jackson has established a parks and recreation program to insure an
ample supply of parks and recreation to satisfy the needs of residents and visitors.
The program is intended to ensure:
1. An adequate supply of parks and recreation facilities to satisfy the demand for
such facilities resulting from new residential development;
2. An adequate supply of open space to preserve and enhance the rural character
of the County as a critical asset contributing to a high quality of life for residents
and visitors;
3. Preservation of open space in certain areas to protect wildlife habitat, ranching,
public lands and scenic road corridors;
4. Parks and recreation facilities and open space are dedicated on a schedule
to coincide with the demand for such facilities and land generated by new
residential development;
5. Land dedicated for parks/recreation/open space will remain committed to such
uses and not be used for other purposes.
C. Exemptions
The following developments are exempt from the requirements of this Division:
1. Boundary adjustments pursuant to Sec. 8.5.5.
2. Re-subdivisions of existing legally platted lots provided all of the following
standards are met:

Article 7. Development Option and Subdivision Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 7.5. Development Exaction Standards
7.5.2. Park Exactions (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
a. The replatted lots are restricted to single-family detached residential use
only.
b. The replat consists only of reconfiguring or eliminating interior lot lines, with
no additional land or building area added to the subdivision.
c. The replat results in no additional dwelling units or lots, and therefore, has
no greater impact on park and school facilities than would the original plat.
D. Parks/Recreation/Open Space Development Exaction Standards
1. General. Teton County/Jackson Parks and Recreation development exaction
standards are based upon consideration of the Jackson/Teton County
Comprehensive Plan and Pathways Master Plan – The Town of Jackson & Teton
County, Wyoming, March 2007.
2. Standards. Prior to the recordation of a plat, a developer subdividing residential
land shall dedicate to the Town of Jackson, platted land in a location selected
by the Town Council in the ratio of 9 acres for every one 1,000 residents of a
proposed subdivision (that is, the number of residents multiplied by 0.009 of
an acre per resident). The number of residents attributable to a subdivision is
calculated according to the schedule in the table below.
Number of Persons Housed Per Unit
Unit Type Persons Housed Per Unit
Studio 1.25
One Bedroom 1.75
Two Bedroom 2.25
Three Bedroom 3.00
Four Bedroom 3.75
Five Bedroom 4.50
Each Additional Bedroom 0.50
Dormitory 1.00 per 150 s.f. of net habitable area
E. Option for Independent Calculation of Dedication Standards
An applicant seeking approval for a residential development application may submit
an independent calculation. If approved, the independent calculation will be utilized
to calculate the required dedication.
1. General. An applicant may submit an independent calculation requesting
modification to any or all of the following standards:
a. Occupants. The number of occupants to be housed by a proposed
development to be used in place of the occupant generation requirements
of the table in 7.5.2.D. above; or
b. Percent of Set Aside/In-Lieu Fee. The amount of land required to be
dedicated, and/or the in-lieu fee amount.
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 7-15
Article 7. Development Option and Subdivision Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 7.5. Development Exaction Standards
7.5.2. Park Exactions (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
2. Calculation Contents. The independent calculation shall be supported by local
data and analysis, surveys, and/or other supporting materials that provide
competent substantial evidence supporting the proposed modification(s).
3. Procedure and Standards. The independent calculation shall be reviewed by
the Jackson Town Council. If the materials and information supporting the
calculation demonstrate by competent substantial evidence that there is a
reasonable basis to modify the number of occupants to be housed, the housing
mix, or the percent set aside for in-lieu fee, whichever is relevant, because
of unique circumstances related to the proposed development, the Town
Council may approve the independent calculation and make the appropriate
modifications.
F. Cash-In-Lieu of Land Dedication
At the election of the Town Council, an applicant may satisfy his or her land
dedication requirement by making a cash payment to the Town for an amount equal
to the current market value of the land required for dedication.
1. Calculating Cash-In-Lieu Payment. The amount of the cash-in-lieu land
dedication payment is calculated by multiplying the square footage of the area
of land to be dedicated by the current market value per square foot of the land
to be subdivided.
2. Calculating Land Value. Land value shall be market value at the time of the
cash-in-lieu payment including site improvements such as streets, and utilities,
but excluding residential dwelling units. Market value may be substantiated by
a documented purchase price (of an arm’s length transaction no more than two
years old) or other mutually agreed upon recognized means, provided, however,
assessed valuation shall not be relied upon as the basis of current market value.
In the event, a developer and the Town fail to agree on market value, such value
shall be established by a qualified real estate appraiser acceptable to both
parties. The developer shall pay for the appraisal.
3. Timing of Cash-In-Lieu Payment. Payment shall be made to the Town of Jackson
prior to recordation of the Final Plat.
4. Criteria to Select Method to Satisfy the Dedication Standards. The Town Council
shall approve or deny a request from an applicant to pay cash-in-lieu of land
dedication. The Town Council shall consider the following criteria in evaluating a
request for a cash in lieu payment:
a. Whether the development itself requires on-site parks/recreation/open
space land on site; and
b. Whether the Town has identified the applicant’s proposed development site
as being appropriate for parks/recreation/open space land.
G. Fishing Easement Required
All subdivisions bordering on Flat Creek shall provide for a 10 foot fishing easement
along the creek. Public access to the easement shall be required.

A. Applicability
1. All residential subdivisions and re-subdivisions, including new condominiums
and townhouse projects to be developed or constructed, and the conversion of
existing dwelling units to a condominium or townhouse subdivision, which is the
subject of an approved, recorded plat, shall be required to dedicate lands for
school and park development unless specifically exempted by other provisions
of this Division.
2. Any subdivision, re-subdivision, or condominium or townhouse subdivision or
development on land subject to a recorded plat for which exactions have been
fully and properly paid pursuant to this Section shall not be subject to exactions,
except for the incremental increase in the number of dwelling units, if any, over
and above those permitted by the previous plat for which exactions were paid.
B. Intent
The Teton County School District requires land for necessary school functions, which
may include, but are not limited to, school buildings, support facilities, open space,
and recreation areas and housing for employees and their families. The purpose of
this Section is to ensure that as development occurs within the School District and
school enrollment grows, the current level of service provided to students can be
maintained. This is accomplished by the adoption of standards for new subdivisions
to provide land, or cash-in-lieu thereof to the Town, for use by the School District. The
standards are based on the number of students the development generates and the
School District’s current level of service standard for land area provided per student.
C. Exemptions
The following developments are exempt from the requirements of this Division:
1. Boundary adjustments pursuant to Sec. 8.5.5.
2. Re-subdivisions of existing legally platted lots provided all of the following
standards are met:
a. The replatted lots are restricted to single-family detached residential use
only.
b. The replat consists only of reconfiguring or eliminating interior lot lines, with
no additional land or building area added to the subdivision.
c. The replat results in no additional dwelling units or lots, and therefore, has
no greater impact on park and school facilities than would the original plat.
D. Teton County School District Dedications and Payments
1. General Formula. Within the Teton County School District, required land
dedications or fees-in-lieu of land dedications for school purposes shall be
based on the following formula:
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 7-17
Article 7. Development Option and Subdivision Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 7.5. Development Exaction Standards
7.5.3. School Exactions (1/4/17, Ord. 1164)
Land area required per student x students generated per dwelling unit = land
dedication standard
2. Land Area Required Per Student. In applying the general formula above, the
following requirements for land area per student shall be used.
Teton County School District Land Requirements Per Student
Reasonable
Capacity Recommended Acreage
Elementary School 650 15.5
Middle School 600 26.0
High School 800 38.0
Totals 1,950 79.5
Total Acres/Student 0.04077
Total SF/Student 1,776
3. Student Generation Rates. In applying the general formula above, the following
requirements for land area per student shall be used.
Teton County School District Student
Generation Rates
Single and Two-Family 0.49 Student/Dwelling Unit
Multi-Family 0.38 Student/Dwelling Unit
4. Land Dedication Requirements. Applying the factors listed above results in the
Teton County School District school land dedication requirements shown below.
Teton County School District Land Dedication
Requirements
Single and Two-Family 870 sf per unit or 0.020 acre
Multi-Family 675 sf per unit or 0.015 acre
5. Cash-in-Lieu of Land Dedication. At the discretion of the Town Council, a
developer of residential housing may make a cash payment in lieu of dedicating
land, or may make a cash payment in combination with a land dedication. The
formula to determine the cash-in-lieu payment is as follows:
Market value of land per acre x land dedication standard from Subsection 4
above x # of dwelling units = cash-in-lieu payment required.
E. Option for Independent Calculation Of Dedication Standards
An applicant seeking approval for a residential development application may submit
an independent calculation. If approved, the independent calculation will be utilized
to calculate the required dedication.
1. General. An applicant may submit an independent calculation requesting
modification to any or all of the following standards:

Article 7. Development Option and Subdivision Standards Applicable in All Zones | Div. 7.5. Development Exaction Standards
7.5.3. School Exactions (1/4/17, Ord. 1164)
a. Occupants. The number of occupants to be housed by a proposed
development to be used in place of the occupant generation requirements;
b. Housing Type and Mix. The type and mix of housing to be provided by the
development; or
c. Percent of Set Aside/in-Lieu Fee. The amount of land required to be
dedicated, and/or the in-lieu fee amount.
2. Calculation Contents. The independent calculation shall be supported by local
data and analysis, surveys, and/or other supporting materials that provide
competent substantial evidence supporting the proposed modification(s).
3. Procedure and Standards. The independent calculation shall be reviewed by
the Jackson Town Council. If the materials and information supporting the
calculation demonstrate by competent substantial evidence that there is a
reasonable basis to modify the number of occupants to be housed, the housing
mix, or the percent set aside for in-lieu fee, whichever is relevant, because
of unique circumstances related to the proposed development, the Town
Council may approve the independent calculation and make the appropriate
modifications.
F. Procedures for Land Dedication
1. Land Dedication. Lands to be dedicated to the Town to fulfill the standards of this
Section shall be identified on the development plan and shall be dedicated to
the Town at the time of Plat approval.
2. Acceptance. Acceptance of the lands to be dedicated shall be at the discretion
of the Town Council.
3. Criteria. Prior to acceptance, the Town Council shall consider the comments of
the School District to determine whether the lands proposed to be dedicated are
of adequate size and can be suitably developed for school purposes or whether
the lands have the capability of being sold, with the proceeds being used for
school purposes. The Town Council shall also consider the probable impacts
on neighboring properties of the development of the land for school purposes.
When the lands proposed to be dedicated are not adequate or suitable for
school purposes and cannot feasibly be sold, the Town Council shall require a
cash payment in-lieu of the land dedication.
G. Cash-In-Lieu of Land Dedication
At the election of the Town Council, an applicant may satisfy his or her land
dedication requirement by making a cash payment to the Town for an amount equal
to the current market value of the land required for dedication.
1. Calculating Cash-in-Lieu Payment. The amount of the cash-in-lieu land
dedication payment is calculated by multiplying the square footage of the area
of land to be dedicated by the current market value per square foot of the land
to be subdivided.

way on collector and local streets. When a variance to remove a parking lane is
granted by the Town Council, the paved shoulder width shall apply.
3. Design By Registered Engineer. The street structural section shall be designed
by a registered engineer based on the physical characteristics of the soils upon
which the street is to be constructed and the projected future traffic volumes for
the street.
I. Urban and Rural Classifications
The primary visual differences between urban and rural are vertical curb-and-gutter
and pedestrian ways. Vertical curb-and-gutter in conformance with these standards
shall be provided where the density level exceeds 4 units per acre (high). In density
levels between 2 and 4 units per acre (medium), both urban and rural sections are
allowed. Curb-and-gutter shall be used as described below and where intersections
of roads generally in the development are closer than 500 feet apart. In densities
less than two 2 units per acre (low), it shall be provided where it is determined
necessary to: protect pedestrians; protect children at play; define the roadway in
unusual higher traffic areas than surrounding development suggests; define and
control traffic at intersections; controlled access is desired; provide for better storm
drainage solutions in level terrain or poor soil/erosion conditions.
J. Horizontal Alignment
1. Relate to Natural Contours. Both horizontal and vertical street alignment should
relate to the natural contours of the site insofar as is practical while being
consistent with safe geometric design.
2. AASHTO Policy. Arterial streets shall be designed in accordance with AASHTO
“A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,” AASHTO, 1990, as it
may be amended and updated from time to time.
3. Radius Curve. Collector and local street curves shall be designed with as large
a radius curve as feasible, with the radius controls shown in the table below.

4. Switchbacks. Where topography is such that it is necessary to include
“switchbacks” in the local street layout, the minimum radius may be reduced
to 50 feet, provided that the street grade is not greater than 4% through the
switchback and for a distance of 100 feet each way from the point of tangency.
5. Commercial and Industrial Areas. Street alignment in commercial and industrial
areas shall be commensurate with the topography but shall be as direct as
possible. Alignment in residential areas shall fit closely the existing topography
to the extent possible without reducing the safety of the facility.

with a typical cross-slope of 0.015 foot per foot. Pavement cross-slope on local
or collector streets at intersections or in special cases shall not exceed 0.03 foot
per foot.
4. Cut or Fill Slope. Finished cut or fill slope shall be no steeper than 2 foot
horizontal to 1 foot vertical (2:1) unless stabilized with structural support. Cut
or fill slopes for roads shall not exceed 15 feet in height unless approved by
the Town Engineer and said slopes have been designed considering soils
properties. Fill slopes shall not be located on natural slopes 2 foot horizontal to 1
foot vertical (2:1) or steeper.
5. Tops and Toes of Cut-and-Fill Slopes. Tops and toes of cut-and-fill slopes shall
be set back from site boundaries a distance of 5 feet plus one-half of the vertical
height of the cut or fill slope, but not more than a horizontal distance of 15 feet
shall be required. Tops and toes of cut-and-fill slopes shall be set back from
structures a distance of 6 feet plus one-fifth the height of the cut or fill.
6. Relation to Base of Slope. On roads, fill slopes shall not be located where
the base of the slope is within 15 feet horizontally of the top of an existing or
planned cut slope, except at road switchbacks.
M. Intersections
1. Intersect at Right Angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect at right
angles. Where topography or other site conditions justify variations, a minimum
angle of intersection of two local streets shall be 70 degrees, and a minimum
angle of intersection involving an arterial or collector street shall be 80 degrees.
2. Safe Sight Distances. Safe sight distances at all intersections shall be assured.
Intersections including median openings shall be designed with adequate
corner sight distance and the area kept free of obstacles. “Corner sight
distance” is defined as measured from a point on the minor road at least 15 feet
from the edge of the major road pavement and measured from a height of eye
of 3.75 feet on the minor road to a height of object of 4.5 feet on the major road.
The intersection sight distance shall be as shown in the table in 7.6.3.K.
3. Sight Obstruction. In addition to the corner sight distance requirement, no fence,
wall, entrance, hedge, shrub planting, tree or other sight obstruction above 2.5
feet above the pavement elevation shall be located within the triangular area
formed by curb-lines and a line connecting them at points 30 feet from their
point of intersection in residential zones and 15 feet in commercial zones.

Div. 7.8. Workforce Housing Incentive Program
Div. 7.8
7.8.1. Intent (11/23/16, Ord. 1153)
7.8.1
This Division establishes incentives for the development of workforce housing. Because
not every landowner will use the incentives, this Division manages growth by limiting the
actual (rather than a projected) use of the incentives. Section 7.8.2. establishes the limit
on the cumulative use of the incentives over time, and the following Sections establish
specific incentives.
7.8.2. Cumulative Limit on Incentives (11/23/16, Ord. 1153)
7.8.2
Use of an incentive in this Division is prohibited if the application would increase the
amount of residential development allowed in the Town and County above the amount
allowed and planned for since 1994.
A. The amount of residential development allowed in the Town and County is reported
annually as Indicator 1 of the Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan Indicator
Report. Past Indicator Reports can be found at www.jacksontetonplan.com.
B. A residential unit shall be added to the amount of residential development allowed in
the Town and County upon its initial approval using an incentive in this Division.
C. A residential unit approved using an incentive in this Division shall be subtracted
from the amount of residential development allowed in the Town and County upon
expiration, revocation, or extinguishment of the approval.
EXAMPLE: A project proposing 4 residential units through use of the Workforce
Housing Floor Area Bonus (Sec. 7.8.4.) receives Sketch Plan approval in 2016. The
2017 Indicator Report would report an increase of 4 residential units as a result of the
project. If by 2018 the units are not built and the Sketch Plan approval has expired,
the 2019 Indicator Report would report a decrease of 4 residential units as a result of
the project expiration. The cumulative effect of the increase reported in the 2017 and
decrease reported in the 2019 would reflect that no incentive units have been built on
the site.
7.8.3. Deed Restricted Housing Exemption (7/18/18, Ord. 1196)
7.8.3
A. Intent
Deed restricted housing is required by Div. 6.3., and other standards of these LDRs.
A landowner may also voluntarily deed restrict housing. In order to encourage
incorporation of required and voluntary deed restricted housing into development,
deed restricted housing is exempt from certain LDRs.
B. Applicability
The exemptions of this section shall apply to the following floor area.
1. Required Restricted Housing. Floor area in a residential unit that is required to be
restricted in order to comply with Div. 6.3.. or another standard of these LDRs.

7.8.4. Workforce Housing Floor Area Bonus (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
7.8.4
A. Intent
In most cases, the volume of building allowed by the minimum setbacks and
maximum height exceeds the volume of building allowed by the FAR of a
property. The purpose of the workforce housing floor area bonus is to encourage
development, especially by the private sector, of additional affordable or workforce
housing units in that excess volume by allowing additional unrestricted floor area.
B. Applicability
The exemptions of this Section shall apply to both the deed restricted and
unrestricted floor area approved pursuant to this Section.
1. Maximum Amount of Unrestricted Housing. The maximum amount of unrestricted
floor area that can be approved pursuant to this Section is limited by the amount
of restricted floor area provided pursuant to this Section, as tabulated below.

8.2.1. Pre-application Conference (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
8.2.1
A. Purpose
The purpose of the pre-application conference is to identify the standards and
procedures of these LDRs that would apply to a potential application prior to
preparation of the final proposal and to identify the submittal requirements for
the application. The intended outcome is that the applicant and the Town each
understand the anticipated key issues to be evaluated in review of the proposal.
B. Applicability
See Div. 8.3.-Div. 8.8. for the processes that require a pre-application conference. A
required pre-application conference shall be held with staff.
C. Optional Conferences
A pre-application conference may be requested for any application. For applications
that require public hearing, an additional pre-application conference may be
requested with the Design Review Committee, Planning Commission, or Town
Council.

A potential applicant shall initiate a request for a pre-application conference
pursuant to Sec. 8.2.4. The pre-application conference shall be scheduled for a date
acceptable to the requester that is within 60 days of receipt of the request.
E. Conference Focus
At the pre-application conference, the applicant and representatives of the Town
shall discuss the potential proposal to identify the standards and procedures that
would apply to the proposal. Applicable LDR provisions not identified at the preapplication
conference or amended following the pre-application conference are still
applicable to the proposal. The level of detail of the Town’s review will match the level
of detail contained in the materials submitted with the request for the pre-application
conference. The pre-application conference is intended as a means of facilitating the
application review process; discussions at the meeting and the written summary of
the meeting are not binding on the Town.
F. Conference Summary
The pre-application conference requester shall be provided a written summary of the
pre-application conference within 14 days of its completion.
G. Expiration
A pre-application conference only satisfies a pre-application conference requirement
if the application for which it is required is submitted within 12 months of the preapplication
conference.
8.2.2. Environmental Analysis (EA) (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
8.2.2
A. Purpose
The purpose of an Environmental Analysis (EA) is to coordinate the application
of all natural resource protection standards through identification of the natural
resources on a site. An EA review does not result in application approval, it results in
recommended natural resource protections for an application.
B. Applicability
Unless exempted below, physical development, use, development options, and
subdivision subject to Div. 5.1., Div. 5.2. or Sec. 7.1.2. shall complete an EA in
accordance with the requirements of this Section.
1. Exemptions
a. Previous Approval. Physical development, use, development options, and
subdivision that has received approval in accordance with the LDRs.
b. Detached Single-Family Dwelling. Physical development of a detached
single-family dwelling if:
i. The proposed location is not within the NRO;
ii. It is the only dwelling unit on the lot of record, or the density on the site
is less than or equal to one dwelling unit per 35 acres of base site area;
and

Article 8. Administrative Procedures | Div. 8.2. Common Procedural Standards
8.2.2. Environmental Analysis (EA) (7/18/18, Ord. 1197)
iii. Compliance with all setback and buffer standards in Div. 5.1. and Div.
5.2. is demonstrated.
c. Expansion. Expansion of an existing building or the addition of an
accessory structure within the impact area of the existing building.
d. Conservation Easement. Land subject to a conservation easement held
by a formal land trust that has a mandate to protect conservation values,
for which a rigorous review and study of the conservation values of the
land has been performed as a basis for establishing the easement, if the
applicant demonstrates that the review and study satisfies the objectives
of the EA. In such instances the review and study completed for the
conservation easement may be substituted for the EA.
e. Other. The Planning Director may waive the requirement for an EA if the
development complies with the following:
i. The lot of record is outside the NRO and the application demonstrates
compliance with all setback and buffer standards in Div. 5.1. and Div.
5.2.; or
ii. The lot of record is in the NRO but is also in an area that has
well-documented habitat information where additional physical
development, use, development options and subdivision is anticipated
to have minimal additional negative impacts to animal species
protected by Sec. 5.2.1. While an EA is not required for lands meeting
this exemption, development on such lands shall still be subject to
certain standards for development determined appropriate by the
Planning Director or the Town Council.
C. Professional Preparation
An EA shall be prepared by an environmental professional with expertise in the
subject of environmental sciences based on education, professional certifications,
experience in the field, and their understating of these LDRs, the Jackson/Teton
County Comprehensive Plan, and the goals and objectives thereof.
D. Substantial Changes
When changes are made to the proposal after the EA has been completed, so that
the accuracy of the EA is significantly compromised, the Planning Director may
require that the applicant provide updated analysis data to address the changes.
E. Expiration
1. An EA that is completed 3 or more years before the submittal of the associated
application shall not be considered current and shall not meet the requirements
of this Section.
2. Notwithstanding the standard above, the Planning Director may require a wholly
new or amended EA for EAs that are less than 3 years old if the standards or
circumstances analyzed have been altered significantly.
3. The Planning Director may extend the expiration date of an EA beyond 3 years
if:

8.2.14. All Public Hearings (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
Div. 8.3. Physical Development Permits
Div. 8.3
Physical development permits provide for the review of proposed construction, land
disturbance, and other physical development to ensure it complies with the standards
of these LDRs. Physical development permits allow a finite amount of development and
are active until that development is complete or the permit has expired. Conditions on
physical development permits should not relate to operational characteristics of the
physical development. This Division establishes 5 permit types for the review of physical
development.
A. Sketch Plan (Sec. 8.3.1.)
For the largest and most complex projects, a sketch plan is required prior to review
of a development plan.
B. Development Plan (Sec. 8.3.2.)
A development plan is required prior to application for a building permit or grading
permit for larger projects that require public review.
C. Building Permit (Sec. 8.3.3.) or Grading Permit (Sec. 8.3.4.)
A building permit and grading permit is required before any physical development
occurs. For small projects these are the only permits needed.
D. Sign Permit (Sec. 8.3.5.)
A sign permit is required prior to erection of any sign, independent of any other
permits or approvals.

8.3.1
A. Purpose
The purpose of a sketch plan is to publicly review a
large physical development or development option for
general consistency with these LDRs at a preliminary,
conceptual level of detail before the development is
fully designed. The objectives of the sketch plan review
are:
1. Identification of the opportunities to achieve the
desired future character for the site;
2. Identification of development related issues to be
addressed through the development plan;
3. Discussion of alternative site designs that may
better implement these LDRs; and
4. Identification of natural and scenic resource
protected by these LDRs.
B. Applicability
1. Physical development that requires a sketch plan
is identified in the standards for each zone. See
Article 2.-Article 4. for zone standards.
2. A sketch plan application within a Planned Unit
Development (PUD) must include all land in the
PUD.

application:
1. Is consistent with the desired future character
described for the site in the Jackson/Teton County
Comprehensive Plan;
2. Achieves the standards and objective of the
Natural Resource Overlay (NRO) and Scenic
Resources Overlay (SRO), if applicable;
3. Does not have significant impact on public facilities
and services, including transportation, potable
water and wastewater facilities, parks, schools,
police, fire, and EMS facilities;
4. Complies with all relevant standards of these LDRs
and other Town Ordinances as can be determined
by the level of detail of a sketch plan; and
5. Is in substantial conformance with all standards
or conditions of any prior applicable permits or
approvals.
D. Effect of Approval
Sketch plan approval permits the submittal of a
development plan; it does not permit actual physical
development or subdivision of land.
E. Expiration
A sketch plan shall expire 2 years after the date
of approval except under one of the following
circumstances:
1. A sufficient development plan application to
implement the sketch plan is submitted and
approval of the development plan is being pursued
in good faith;
2. An approved development plan is being
implemented;
3. In the case of a phased development, not more
than 2 years have passed since the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for physical development
approved by the sketch plan; or

8.4.1. Basic Use Permit (BUP) (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
Div. 8.4. Use Permits
Div. 8.4
A use permit is a review process to ensure that the use of a
property complies with these LDRs and that the impacts of
the use are mitigated. Use permits run with a property and
are valid as long as the use remains in operation. Conditions
on use permits are often ongoing and apply throughout the
life of the permit. There are 3 types of use permits in these
LDRs.
A. Basic Use Permit (Sec. 8.4.1.)
A basic use permit (BUP) permits uses that are allowed
by right, but require administrative review to ensure
compliance with the standards of these LDRs.
B. Conditional Use Permit (Sec. 8.4.2.)
A conditional use permit (CUP) permits a use that is
generally compatible with the character of a zone, but
requires project specific conditions to limit and mitigate
potential adverse impacts.
C. Special Use Permit (Sec. 8.4.3.)
A special use permit (SUP) permits a use that is
incompatible with the character of all zones, but is an
essential service of the community and must be located
somewhere under specific conditions to mitigate
adverse impacts.
8.4.1. Basic Use Permit (BUP) (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
8.4.1
A. Purpose
The purpose of a basic use permit is to ensure
compliance with the standards of these LDRs for uses

which they are proposed.
B. Applicability
Uses that require a basic use permit are identified in
the standards for each zone. See Articles 2-4 for zone
standards.
C. Findings for Approval
A basic use permit shall be approved upon finding the
application:
1. Complies with the use specific standards of Div.
6.1. Allowed Uses and the zone;
2. Complies with all other relevant standards of these
LDRs and all other Town Ordinances; and
3. Is in substantial conformance with all standards
or conditions of any prior applicable permits or
approvals.
D. Permit Expiration
A basic use permit shall expire one year after the
date of approval except under one of the following
circumstances:
1. The use is commenced and has not been
operationally discontinued or abandoned for a
period of one year or more;
2. A physical development permit has been issued
and is active for physical development needed to
commence the use; or
3. An alternate expiration is set through the approval
of the basic use permit.

Article 8. Administrative Procedures | Div. 8.5. Development Option and Subdivision Permits
8.5.1. Sale or Transfer of Land (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
Div. 8.5. Development Option and Subdivision Permits
Div. 8.5
Development option permits provide for the review of an amount or type of development
that is not allowed by a zone’s base physical development and use standards. Development
option permits are intended to permit a specific change to the amount or type of
development otherwise allowed under the base requirements of these LDRs, but which
requires certain standards to be met. Subdivision permits provide for the review of modifications
to property configuration. Subdivision permits are intended to ensure orderly land
records and the provision of adequate infrastructure, open space, and other requirements
for the health, safety and welfare of the community.
Development option and subdivision permits do not permit actual physical development
or change the zoning of a property. Conditions on development option and subdivision
permits should relate to achievement of the development option or subdivision; they
should not be on-going and create new standards for a property that have the effect of a
LDR text amendment or zoning map amendment that should be processed pursuant to
Div. 8.7.
This Division includes 4 review processes.
A. Development Option Plan (Sec. 8.5.2.)
Development option plan review is for development options that are allowed by right
under specific circumstances. A development option plan does not require review
at public hearing, but does require review of compliance with the development
option standards before physical development and use permits can be reviewed.
For larger developments that would benefit from public review, the development plan
and sketch plan processes of Div. 8.3. are utilized instead of the development option
plan.
B. Subdivision Plat (Sec. 8.5.3.)
Subdivision Plat review is a technical review of all divisions of land or airspace to
ensure that property is being properly divided and conveyed. The subdivision plat
process relies upon the development plan and sketch plan processes of Div. 8.3. to
ensure the configuration of the subdivision complies with these LDRs.
C. Exempt Land Division (Sec. 8.5.4.)
The exempt land division procedure is for applicants seeking exemption under Wyo.
Stat. § 18-5-303.
D. Boundary Adjustment (Sec. 8.5.5.)
The boundary adjustment procedure ensures that the adjustment of property lines
results in property configurations that comply with the standards of these LDRs.
8.5.1. Sale or Transfer of Land (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
8.5.1
No owner or agent of an owner of any land shall transfer, sell, agree to sell, or negotiate a
binding agreement to sell any land by reference to, exhibition of, or by the use of a plat or
map of subdivision or boundary adjustment before such plat or map has been approved
and recorded in the applicable manner prescribed in this Division. The description of
such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or the documents

Article 8. Administrative Procedures | Div. 8.5. Development Option and Subdivision Permits
8.5.1. Sale or Transfer of Land (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from the
provisions of this Division. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of condominium or
townhouse type developments, an owner may enter into binding agreements to sell lots
or units subsequent to approval of a development plan. Conveyance of individual lots or
units, however, shall not occur until approval and recordation of the plat.

88..55..23
A. Purpose
The purpose of a development option plan is to review a development option that
requires a determination of compliance with these LDRs prior to preparation of
physical development, use, or subdivision permit applications, but does not require
public review.
B. Applicability
Development options that require a development option plan are identified in the
standards for each zone. See Article 2.-Article 4. for zone standards.
C. Findings for Approval
A development option plan shall be approved upon finding the application:
1. Is consistent with the desired future character described for the site in the
Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan;
2. Achieves the standards and objectives of the Natural Resource Overlay (NRO)
and Scenic Resources Overlay (SRO), if applicable;
3. Complies with the Town of Jackson Design Guidelines, if applicable;
4. Complies with all relevant standards of these LDRs and other Town Ordinances;
and
5. Is in substantial conformance with all standards or conditions of any prior
applicable permits or approvals.
D. Effect of Approval
Approval of a development option plan permits submittal of a building permit, use
permit, subdivision plat, or other application to complete the proposed development;
it does not permit actual physical development or constitute subdivision of land.
E. Expiration
A development plan shall expire 18 months after the date of approval except
under one of the following circumstances. The applicable circumstances shall be
established in the notice of decision on the application.
1. In the case of a subdivision, a subdivision plat has been recorded with the
County Clerk;
2. In the case of a development option, the action required to entitle the
development option, such as the recording of a conservation easement for a
development option requiring open space, has been taken; or
3. An alternate expiration is set through the approval of the development plan.
F. Review Process
All steps and deadlines in the following chart are required unless noted otherwise.
An applicant must complete the each step before moving to the step below.

8.5.5. Boundary Adjustment (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
8.5.5
A. Purpose
The purpose of the boundary adjustment process is to ensure that the adjustment
of property lines results in property configurations that comply with the standards of
these LDRs.
B. Applicability
The adjustment of boundaries between lots of record that involves the division of a
portion of one property so that the divided portion can be completely merged into an
adjacent property shall be exempt from the standards of Sec. 8.5.3. but shall comply
with the standards of this Section. Specifically, but not exclusively, this Section shall
be applicable in the following situations.
1. The conveyance of a parcel from a public agency to a private party that owns
land contiguous to the conveyed public land shall be treated as a boundary
adjustment to the contiguous private land and not as the creation of a separate,
legal, buildable lot of record.
2. The remedying of an encroachment, setback violation, bona fide boundary
dispute, or similar circumstance through boundary adjustment shall comply with
the standards of this Section.
3. A change in the lot configuration and/or roadway location in a limited part of
a platted subdivision that does not abridge or destroy any of the rights and
privileges of other landowners or others who have an interest in the plat shall be
reviewed as a boundary adjustment; otherwise the change in configuration of a
platted subdivision shall comply with the standards of 8.2.13.C.
C. Recorded Documents
Adjustment of the boundaries between unplatted lots requires the recordation of
different documents from the adjustment of the boundaries between platted lots.
1. Unplatted Parcels. In order to adjust the boundaries between unplatted lots of
record the following documents shall be recorded with the County Clerk.
a. Map of Survey. A map of survey of the new configuration of the lots of record
shall be recorded. The map of survey shall contain a certificate of Surveyor,
Certificate of Owners, and Certificate of Acceptance of Mortgagees signed
by all holders of mortgages of the properties being adjusted. Each of the
certificates shall be appropriately acknowledged and comply with the
applicable sections of state statute.
b. Conveyance of Parcels. An acceptable instrument, which shall totally merge
the divided portions with and combine them into the adjoining lots of record
so that no additional lots of record are created, and the resulting lots of
record shall be established as single lots of record for all purposes.
2. Platted Lots. In order to adjust the boundaries between platted lots, or a platted
lot and an unplatted parcel, the following documents shall be recorded with the
County Clerk.

the area to be reconfigured that is signed by all owners of record of the
lots involved.
iv. All mortgagees shall acknowledge the replat.
v. If only one subdivision is involved, the name shall be the name of the
original subdivision, followed by a numerical designation. The resulting
(new) lots shall be numbered consecutively with numbers different
from the original subdivision. If 2 or more neighboring subdivisions are
involved, the new plat shall have a name materially different than any of
the original plats.
vi. An adjusted unplatted parcel is not required to become a part of the
subdivision, however the new configuration of the unplatted parcel shall
be shown on the plat, to the satisfaction of the County Surveyor.
b. Conveyance of Platted Lots. If there is more than one owner of the vacated
portion of the plat, instruments shall be recorded conveying ownership of
the individual lots of record resulting from the replat.
c. Conveyance of Unplatted Parcels. An instrument acceptable to the Town
Attorney and the Town Surveyor shall be recorded to establish a newly
adjusted unplatted parcel.
D. Findings

Div. 8.6. Interpretations of the LDRs
Div. 8.6
Interpretations of the LDRs are made throughout the review of all permit applications.
These interpretations are incorporated and finalized through the processes described in
other divisions of this Article and do not require a separate process. However, there are
times when a clarification on the meaning of the LDRs is needed independent of an application.
This Division outlines the process for 2 types of independent interpretations:
A. Formal Interpretations (Sec. 8.6.1.)
A formal interpretation provides a written answer to a specific question of how a
provision of these LDRs is applied;
B. Zoning Compliance Verification (Sec. 8.6.2.)
A zoning compliance verification is a moment-in-time analysis of the compliance of a
specific property with all or certain provisions of these LDRs.

8.6.1. Formal Interpretations (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
8.6.1. Formal Interpretations (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
8.6.1
A. Purpose
The purpose of a formal interpretation is to provide a written answer to a specific
question on the application of a provision of these LDRs or the boundaries or
classifications of the Official Zoning Map independent from any other review
procedure. A formal interpretation provides consistency in the implementation of
these LDRs.
B. Applicability
A formal interpretation may be requested to interpret any provision of these LDRs
or boundary or classification of the Official Zoning Map. The Planning Director may
require a different application to be filed if an interpretation should be evaluated in
the context of a full application rather than as a separate question.
C. Findings
In making a formal interpretation the Planning Director shall consider the following:
1. The Jackson/Teton County Comprehensive Plan;
2. The purposes for which the regulation was initially adopted, the Planning
Director’s judgment should not be substituted for the legislative intent of the
Town Council;
3. Previous interpretations of similar circumstances; and
4. Flexibility to achieve the desired future character within the established
protections of these LDRs is to be encouraged, while flexibility around the
protections provided by the standards in these LDRs shall be prohibited.
D. Official Record
The Planning Director shall maintain a record of all formal interpretations rendered
pursuant to this Section. This record shall be available for public inspection in the
Planning Department during normal business hours.
E. Review Process
All steps and deadlines in the following chart are required unless noted otherwise.

8.6.2
A. Purpose
The purpose of a zoning compliance verification is to determine in writing if all or a
portion of a property is in compliance with these LDRs at a specific point in time.
B. Applicability
A zoning compliance verification may be requested for any property, portion of
a property, or attribute of a property’s physical development, use, development
options, or subdivision.
EXAMPLE: Examples of zoning compliance verification requests include, but
are not limited to: a determination of the current development potential on a
site; identification of any apparent nonconformities on a site; review of a wetland
delineation or Environmental Analysis exemption prior to application submittal;
and visual resource analysis that informs application submittal but is not
dependent upon application information for review.
C. Findings
In order to issue a zoning compliance verification the Planning Director shall find that
the property, portion of the property, or attribute of the property in question:
1. Complies with all relevant standards of these LDRs and other Town Ordinances;
and
2. Is in substantial conformance with all standards or conditions of any prior
applicable permits or approvals.
D. Effect
A zoning compliance verification shall only apply to the circumstances reviewed
and will only be as detailed as the information provided in the request. A
zoning compliance verification does not permit any physical development,
use, development option, or subdivision, nor does it guarantee approval of any
application.
E. Expiration
A zoning compliance verification shall only verify zoning compliance at the time it is
issued.

A PUD shall be reviewed concurrently with the initial
physical development permit application required for
the proposal.
EXAMPLE: If the density or intensity of the project
requires a sketch plan, the PUD application shall
be reviewed concurrently with the sketch plan
application.
D. Findings for Approval
The advisability of amending the Official Zoning Map
to include a planned unit development classification is
a matter committed to the legislative discretion of the
Town Council and is not controlled by any one factor.
In deciding to adopt or deny a proposed planned unit
development the Town Council shall consider:
1. The extent to which the PUD enhances the
implementation of the desired future character for
the land of the proposal beyond what could be
achieved by base zoning;
2. The findings for the applicable PUD option found in
Article 4.;
3. The applicable findings for the amendment of
an existing PUD or other special project found in
8.2.13.D.;
4. The findings of Sec. 8.7.1.; and
5. The findings of Sec. 8.7.2.
E. Effect
Approval of a PUD constitutes a zoning map
amendment that has the effect of applying the master
plan as the zone-specific standards for the site.
Approval of a PUD does not permit actual physical
development or use of the site, nor does it constitute
subdivision of land.
F. Expiration
1. Expiration. A PUD shall expire if the physical
development permit with which it was approved
expires except under one of the following
circumstances:
a. The PUD option in Article 4. establishes an
alternative expiration; or
b. An alternate expiration is set through the
approval of the PUD.
2. Effect of Expiration. Upon expiration, all rights
established by the master plan shall become null
and void. The Town shall amend the Official Zoning
Map pursuant Sec. 8.7.2. from PUD to the zone
that existed on the land prior to the PUD approval.
If the prior zone no longer exists, the Planning
Director shall propose the appropriate zone in
which to place the land.

Div. 8.8. Relief from the LDRs
Div. 8.8
At times the strict application of these LDRs to a specific site inadvertently impedes the
applicant’s ability to realize the community’s desired future character. In such instances
relief may be sought from the strict application. There are 4 types of relief processes in
this Division:
A. An Administrative Adjustment allows for minor relief from the LDRs where a public
review is not necessary to determine that the protection afforded the community is
upheld.
B. A variance is a larger relief from the LDRs that is a public review of the balance
between the protections afforded the community by the LDRs and the hardship they
place on the applicant.
C. An appeal allows for the challenge of an administrative decision.
D. A Beneficial Use Determination is a non-judicial remedy for a landowner to seek relief
when the landowner believes the application of these LDRs constitutes a “takings”
under the United States or Wyoming Constitution.

8.8.1. Administrative Adjustment (11/23/16, Ord.
1154)
8.8.1
A. Purpose
The purpose of an administrative adjustment is to
allow minor adjustments to certain requirements and
numerical standards in these LDRs based on specific
review standards. The intent is to provide relief when
application of a standard creates practical difficulties in
advancement of Comprehensive Plan goals or zoning
district purposes.
B. Applicability
An application may be made for administrative
adjustment of the following standards of the LDRs.
1. Landscape Surface Ratio may be adjusted up to
20%.
2. Structure setbacks, not including setbacks from
natural resources, may be adjusted up to 20%.
3. Site development setbacks, not including setbacks
from natural resources, may be adjusted up to
20%.
4. Fencing height and setbacks may be adjusted up
to 20%.
5. Grade of developable slopes may be adjusted up
to 20%.
6. Any dimensional standard of a building frontage
may be adjusted up to 20%.
7. Building facade width may be adjusted up to 20%.
8. Wildlife friendly fencing may be adjusted as
allowed by 5.1.2.E.
9. Standard plant units may be adjusted as allowed
by 5.5.3.E.3.
10. Sign standards may be adjusted as allowed by
5.6.1.B.2.
11. Parking requirement may be adjusted as allowed
by 6.2.2.A.1.
12. Pedestrian frontage standards may be adjusted as
allowed by 2.2.1.C..
C. Findings
An administrative adjustment shall be approved upon
finding the application:
1. Complies with the applicability standards of this
Section;
2. Either:
a. Compensates for some unusual constraint
of the site or proposal that is not shared by
landowners generally, or
b. Better protects natural and scenic resources,
or
c. Better supports the purpose of the zone;
3. Is consistent with the purpose of the zone and the
desired future character for the area described in
the Comprehensive Plan;
4. Will not pose a danger to the public health or
safety; and
5. The site is not subject to a series of incremental
administrative adjustments that circumvent the
purpose of this Section.
D. Effect
Issuance of an administrative adjustment shall not
ensure the approval of any other application. The
decision on an administrative adjustment cannot be
reversed by the Town Council through review of an
associated permit application. The decision on an
administrative adjustment can only be reversed through
an appeal pursuant to Sec. 8.8.3.
E. Expiration
An administrative adjustment shall expire one year after
the date of approval except under one of the following
circumstances:
1. The physical development, use, development
option, or subdivision enabled by the administrative
adjustment is in review or implementation; or
2. An alternate expiration is set through the approval
of the administrative adjustment.

8.8.2. Variance (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
8.8.2. Variance (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
8.8.2
A. Purpose
The purpose of a variance is to allow a specific
deviation from these regulations that is not contrary to
the desired future character for the site when, due to
special circumstances of the land, strict application
of these regulations would result in undue and unique
hardship.
B. Applicability
A variance may be sought for any standard of these
LDRs unless the variance would:
1. Increase maximum density, FAR, or maximum scale
of development;
2. Allow a prohibited sign;
3. Allow a prohibited use or allow additional
expansion of a nonconforming use;
4. Reduce the requirements of a development option
(e.g. required open space, minimum lot size, unit
type mix);
5. Reduce a requirement where an option for
independent calculation of the requirement exists
(e.g. housing, development exactions); or
6. Reduce the threshold for review of an application.
C. Findings for Approval
A variance shall be approved upon finding:
1. There are special circumstances or conditions
which are peculiar to the land or building for which
the variance is sought that do not apply generally
to land or buildings in the neighborhood;
2. The special circumstances and conditions have not
resulted from any willful modification of the land or
building;
3. The special circumstances and conditions are
such that the strict application of the regulation
sought to be varied would create a hardship on the
applicant far greater than the protection afforded to
the community;
4. The variance sought is the minimum variance
necessary to provide balance between the
purpose of the regulation sought to be varied and
its impact on the applicant;
5. The granting of the variance will not be injurious
to the neighborhood surrounding the land where
the variance is proposed, and is otherwise not
detrimental to the public welfare; and
6. The granting of the variance is consistent with the
general purpose and intent of these LDRs.
D. Effect
Issuance of a variance shall not ensure the approval
of any other application. A variance is unique to the
special circumstances identified in the findings and
does not create precedent. A variance approved for
a specific development or use shall only apply to that
development or use.
E. Expiration
A variance shall expire one year after the date
of approval except under one of the following
circumstances:
1. The use, physical development, development
option, or subdivision permit enabled by the
variance is under review or implementation;
2. In the case of a phased development, not more
than one year has passed since the completion of
a physical development, development option, or
subdivision, or initiation of a use, enabled by the
variance; or
3. Another expiration has been set through the
approval of the variance.

8.8.4. Beneficial Use Determination (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
8.8.4. Beneficial Use Determination (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
8.8.4
A. Purpose
The intent of the Town is that every landowner in the Town enjoy an economically
beneficial use of their land. The procedures set forth in this Section are intended to
permit landowners who believe they have been deprived of economically beneficial
use of their land to apply to the Town for relief from application of these LDRs
sufficient to provide an economically beneficial use of the land.
B. Applicability
If a landowner is of the opinion that the decisions on the appropriate physical
development, use, development option, or subdivision applications has denied
economically beneficial use of that landowner’s land, then the procedures of this
Section shall be used prior to seeking relief from the courts in order that any denial of
economically beneficial use of land may be remedied through a non-judicial forum.
C. Findings
In determining if a landowner is deprived of an economically beneficial use of land,
the following factors shall be taken into account.
1. Economically Beneficial Use. The uses of the land as provided by these LDRs,
and the uses of land in relation to the uses provided similarly situated lands.
For the purposes of this Section, “economically beneficial use” means the
opportunity to make a return equivalent to that which would have been received
from a conservative financial investment. Transitory economic issues shall not
be relevant to this determination.
2. Diminution in Value. The market value of the land, as established by the
comparable sales approach, prior to adoption of the regulations that caused
the landowner to apply for relief shall be compared to the market value of the
land, as established by the comparable sales approach, with the regulations
as applied. Market value of the land prior to the adoption of the regulations that
caused the landowner to apply for relief shall constitute its highest and best use
one day prior to the effective date of the regulations that caused the landowner
to apply for relief, or the date of purchase of the land, whichever is later; and any
other land value/appraisal information that the applicant would like considered.
All appraisals shall be proposed by qualified licensed appraisers, and shall
follow the best professional practices as established by the profession. A mere
diminution in market value is not sufficient to support a determination of denial of
economically beneficial use.
3. External Costs. The amount or nature of any subsidy that may be required by the
Town, neighbors, purchasers, tenants, or the public at large if the uses allowed
under these LDRs are modified; and any other adverse effects on the Town and
its residents.
4. Current State of the Law. The state of the law established by the United States
Supreme Court, the 10th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, and the Wyoming
Supreme Court relevant to these standards.
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 8-75
Article 8. Administrative Procedures | Div. 8.8. Relief from the LDRs
8.8.4. Beneficial Use Determination (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
D. Granting of Relief
If the finding is that a landowner has been deprived economically beneficial use
of land or is otherwise entitled to relief in accordance with to the standards of this
Section, relief shall be granted.
1. General. In granting relief, any legally available incentive or measure reasonably
necessary to offset any substantial economic hardship may be adopted, and
such incentives may be conditioned upon approval of specific development
plans. If there is a finding that the denial of the application would create a
substantial economic hardship, additional relief to provide an appropriate
increase in market value or other benefit or return to the applicant sufficient
to offset the substantial economic hardship may be considered. The types of
incentives include, but are not limited to:
a. An amendment of the Official Zoning Map to a more appropriate
classification, issuance of an administrative adjustment, issuance of a
conditional use permit, issuance of a variance, approval of a development
plan (public or administrative), or other appropriate land-use regulatory
action that will enable the applicant to realize a reasonable return on the
land;
b. An opportunity to cluster development on other land;
c. A waiver of permit fees;
d. Development finance assistance;
e. Approval of development on some portion of the land; or
f. Acquisition of all or a portion of the land at market value.
2. Minimum Increase. In granting relief, the landowner shall be given the minimum
increase in use, intensity, or other possible concessions from these LDRs
in order to permit an economically viable use of the land, or a use that is
determined to be required by law. The highest use, or even an average or
generally reasonable expectation, is not required or intended as the appropriate
remedy. The following guidelines shall be used for determining the minimum
economically viable use of land and, therefore, the amount of relief to be granted
a landowner in order to reach that minimum.
a. No Governmental Subsidy. A minimum economically viable use of the land
should be one that does not have any governmental subsidy attached to
the long-term safe occupation of the land. If such a subsidy is needed, then
that should be reflected by lowering the use or intensity that is considered a
minimum economically viable use on a market valuation basis.
b. Common Use. A use common to the Town, although it may not involve
further development of the land, is considered an economically viable
use. Attention shall also be given to land uses that are considered to be
the lowest intensity in the Town but which uses still provide for occupation
and living within the Town. These land uses, as well, shall be considered
economically viable uses.

Article 8. Administrative Procedures | Div. 8.8. Relief from the LDRs
8.8.4. Beneficial Use Determination (1/4/17, Ord. 1165)
c. Actual Condition of Land Considered. The actual condition of the land
shall be considered. The reality of limited development potential, given
the natural condition of the land, shall not be attributed to the regulations
applied to the land. If the land is such that it cannot safely accommodate
development with normal grading and clearing practices, this fact shall
lower the intensity of use that is considered a minimum economically viable
use.
d. Potential for Damages. The potential for damages to either residents or land
shall be assessed in determining economically viable use. The need for a
governmental subsidy to future landowners shall be considered, and the
cost of such subsidies shall be deducted from the otherwise established
minimum economically viable use.
e. Only Investment Backed Expectations Considered. Expectations shall,
in general, not be considered. Only reasonable expectations backed
by investments as recognized by the current state of the law shall be
considered.
f. Current State of the Law. The current state of law established by the United
States Supreme Court, the 10th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, and the
Wyoming Supreme Court, relevant to the granting of relief.
E. Effect
The beneficial use determination shall not permit any physical development, use,
development option, or subdivision that has not been approved pursuant to these
LDRs and shall not ensure approval of any future application.
F. Rules of Procedure
A beneficial use determination shall be governed by the contested case rules
adopted by the Town.
G. Review Process
All steps and deadlines in the following chart are required unless noted otherwise.
An applicant must complete the each step before moving to the step below.

Article 9. Definitions | Div. 9.4. Rules of Measurement
9.4.5. Floor Area (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
C. Adjusted Site Area
Adjusted site area is used to calculate maximum site development and lot coverage.
Adjusted site area is gross site area minus the following:
1. All land within existing vehicular access easements;
2. All land between levees or banks of rivers and streams; and
3. All land within lakes or ponds, when the sum of the surface area of the ponds
and/or lakes exceeds one acre.
D. Minimum Site Area
Minimum site area is the minimum gross site area or minimum base site area, as
specified, required to permit a use or development option. On sites in more than one
zone, the entire site may be used to meet minimum site area requirements in either
zone. On sites with multiple uses or development options, the entire site may be
used to meet minimum site area requirements for each use or development option.
9.4.5. Floor Area (1/1/15, Ord. 1074)
9.4.5
Floor area is the area of all floors interior to an enclosed building that have at least 5 feet
of clearance between floor and ceiling. Floor area shall be measured to the exterior face
of the structural members of the wall. Roofed architectural recesses and open covered
porches are not considered interior to the building. A building with at least 50% of its
perimeter open to the outside shall not be considered enclosed.
9.4.6. Density/Intensity (7/18/18, Ord. 1198)
9.4.6
The following standards shall apply to the calculation of maximum density, maximum floor
area, and minimum landscape surface area.
A. General
1. Split Zoning. On sites in multiple zones, calculations shall be based on the base
site area, or gross site area in Character Zones (Div. 2.2. & Div. 3.2..), in each
zone.
2. Mixed Use. On sites with multiple uses, the base site area, or gross site area
in Character Zones (Div. 2.2. & Div. 3.2.), shall be prorated to determine the
allowed density/intensity each use.
EXAMPLE: On a base site area of 30,000 square feet with an FAR of 0.3
for a single family unit, a 3,000 square foot single family unit would occupy
10,000 square feet of the base site area (3,000/.3 = 10,000), leaving 20,000
square feet of base site area left to calculate the remaining maximum floor
area for other uses on the property.
Town of Jackson Land Development Regulations 9-9
Article 9. Definitions | Div. 9.4. Rules of Measurement
9.4.6. Density/Intensity (7/18/18, Ord. 1198)
B. Maximum Density
Unless stated otherwise for a specific provision of these LDRs, density is calculated
by dividing the number of units by the base site area, or gross site area in Character
Zones (Div. 2.2. & Div. 3.2.).
EXAMPLE: 3 units on 35 acres of base site area is a density of 0.086 units/acre
(3/35 = .086).
C. Floor Area Ratio (FAR)/Maximum Floor Area
1. The maximum floor area (see Sec. 9.4.5. for definition of Floor Area) allowed on
a site shall be the maximum habitable floor area not including basement floor
area, as defined in Sec. 9.5.B.
2. The site area used to calculate maximum floor area shall be:
a. gross site area in Character Zones (Div. 2.2. & Div. 3.2.), and
b. base site area in Legacy Zones (Div. 2.3. & Div. 3.3.).
3. Unless otherwise defined in these LDRs, the maximum allowed floor area above
grade is calculated by multiplying the allowed FAR by the applicable site area.
Inversely, FAR is calculated by dividing the habitable floor area above grade by
the applicable site area.
EXAMPLE: On a site area of 24,000 square feet a building with 8,000 square
feet of habitable floor area where 2,000 square feet was in the basement would
have an FAR of .25 ((8,000-2,000)/24,000 = .25). Alternatively, unless otherwise
defined in these LDRs, the maximum allowed floor area is calculated by
multiplying the allowed FAR by the base site area (see Sec. 9.5.F. for definition of
Floor Area).
D. Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR)/Minimum Landscape Surface Area
1. The landscape surface ratio (LSR) is calculated by dividing the landscape
surface area by the base site area, or gross site area in Character Zones (Div.
2.2.. & Div. 3.2.).
EXAMPLE: A property that has 6,000 square feet of landscape surface area
and a base site area of 24,000 square feet has an LSR of .25 (6,000/24,000
= .25). Unless otherwise defined in these LDRs, the minimum required
amount of landscape surface area is calculated by multiplying the required
LSR by the base site area (see Sec. 9.5.L. for definition of Landscape
Surface Area).

E. Lot Coverage
Lot coverage is calculated by dividing the building footprint by the adjusted site
area, or gross site area in Character Zones (Div. 2.2. & Div. 3.2.).
EXAMPLE: A single-family unit with a building footprint of 1,500 square feet on
an adjusted site area of 7,500 sf would have a lot coverage of .2 (1,500/7,500 =
.2). Unless otherwise defined in these LDRs, the maximum building footprint is
calculated by multiplying the maximum lot coverage by the adjusted site area
(see Sec. 9.5.F. for definition of Footprint, Building). Sites with residential and
nonresidential use shall be exempt from any lot coverage requirement.
F. Minimum Lot Size
Minimum lot size means the required minimum gross site area of a newly created lot
of record, including remnant parcels.

9.4.8
A setback is a measure of the shortest horizontal distance between a physical
development or use and the feature from which it is being set back.
A. Setback Runs Parallel to Feature
A required setback shall be applied parallel to the length of the feature from which
the setback is required.
B. Minimum Setback
Unless otherwise defined in these LDRs, a setback shall be the minimum distance
between a physical development or use and a certain feature.
C. Zero-Or Setback
When a required setback is 0 OR another distance, the physical development or use
shall be located either adjacent to the feature or set back the minimum distance.
