CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE
CITY OF OAK CREEK
PREFACE
Democracy is a government of laws. Good democracy requires not only good laws, but laws which are readily available
in written form to all who are subject to them, to the public officials and police officers who must administer them
and to the judges and attorneys who must interpret and apply them. It is for this reason that the Common Council of the
City of Oak Creek has adopted this Code of Ordinances. This Code represents the contribution of the Common Council
to the democratic and efficient administration of the government and affairs of the City of Oak Creek.

FOREWORD
We are pleased to provide this new Code of Ordinances for the City of Oak Creek, Wisconsin. This codification provides
a complete revision and codification of all Ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the City. All
amended Ordinances are brought up to date. The Code also includes certain new Ordinances that were prepared to fill
gaps not covered by existing Ordinances.
The Code also includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles follow one another
in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference
points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the alphabetical index at the end of the volume. At the
beginning of each chapter, there is a section-by-section analysis of the articles within the chapter.
Nontextual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered
by Title 1 of the Code. In most instances, references to “this ordinance” in the text of an ordinance have been
changed to “this chapter” or “this article” as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes, state law references and
amendment notes have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions.
We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by City of Oak Creek officials in the preparation of
this Code.

OPEN MEETING LAW GUIDE
General Requirements
1. Wisconsin’s Open Meeting Law provides that all meetings of governmental bodies shall be open to all citizens
at all times. Sec. 19.81(2), Wis. Stats.
2. Meetings of local governing bodies or their subunits must be held in places reasonably accessible to the public.
3. Meetings are open to all members of the public unless specifically provided otherwise by law.
4. When members of a governmental body gather in sufficient numbers to compose a quorum, that meeting is presumed
to be convened for the purpose of conducting official business. Such a meeting is in violation of The
Open Meeting Law if proper notice was not given and the meeting is not open to the public. Sec. 19.82(2),
Wis. Stats.
5. The Open Meeting Law also applies when members of a governing body, or committee thereof, engage in business
of that body and when the number of members present is potentially sufficient to determine the governing
body’s course of action regarding the proposal discussed [State vs. Showers, No. 85-471 (June 15, 1987)].
Public Notice
1. WHO MUST RECEIVE NOTICE. For any meeting, the presiding officer, or his/her designee, shall give notice
to the official newspaper and to any other members of the news media who have filed a written request to receive
such notices, or if neither exists, in a manner likely to give notice to the public. Notice must also be given
as required by any other state statutes.
2. CONSTRUCTION OF NOTICE. The notice for the meeting shall include:
a. The time, date and place of the meeting, and
b. The subject matter of the meeting, including subject matter to be considered in closed session.
The governmental body may discuss and, if urgent, act upon matters, which were not specifically referred to in
the agenda where the agenda contains a general item, such as “miscellaneous business.” Where the presiding officer
has specific knowledge that matters may come before the body, they should be included on the agenda.
3. TIME FOR NOTICE. Notice must be given at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the commencement of the
meeting unless for good cause such notice is impossible or impractical, in which case shorter notice may be
given. In no case may notice be provided less than two (2) hours in advance of the meeting. Sec. 19.84(3), Wis.
Stats.
4. COMMITTEES AND SUBUNITS EXEMPTION TO NOTICE REQUIREMENT. A legally constituted subunit
of a parent government body may conduct a meeting during the recess of the governing body’s meeting or
immediately after the lawful meeting to act or deliberate upon a matter which was the subject of that meeting.
For this exemption to apply, the presiding officer must publicly announce the time, place and subject matter of
the subunit’s meeting in advance at the meeting of the governing body.
Procedure for Closed Sessions
1. Required notice must be given if the presiding officer or his/her designee knows that a closed session is being
contemplated. Notice is required regardless of whether a majority of members will or will not support going into
closed session at the meeting. Sec. 19.84(2), Wis. Stats.
2. After first meeting in open session, with proper notice, a motion made and recorded, supported by majority vote,
is required to close, with the vote of each member recorded in the minutes. Sec. 19.85(1), Wis. Stats.
3. If the motion to go into closed session is carried, the presiding officer shall announce to those present at the
meeting (to be recorded in the minutes) the nature of the business to be considered in the closed session and the
specific exemption(s) relied upon in Sec. 19.85, Wis. Stats., under which the closed session is permitted.
4. Only matters contained in the presiding officer’s announcement of the closed session may be considered during
the closed session.
5. An open session, with adequate notice, must proceed a closed session, even where it was decided at a prior open
session to go into a closed session at a subsequent meeting.
6. A governmental body may vote to go into closed session at a properly convened open session, for a permitted
purpose, where specific notice of intent to consider going into closed session was not included on the agenda at
the time notice of the open session was given. However, such procedure requires that the presiding officer or
his/her designee did not contemplate or have knowledge that any of the other members contemplated a closed
session at the time notice of the agenda was given.
Specific Exemptions Allowing Closed Sessions
1. Sec. 19.85(1)(a), Wis. Stats., creates an exemption for governmental bodies deliberating after quasi-judicial trials
or hearings. However, boards of review cannot rely on this exemption, for Sec. 70.47(2m), Wis. Stats., requires
all board of review meetings to be held in open session.
2. Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., is a limited exception to the Open Meeting Law allowing the use of a closed session
when a governmental body is considering the demotion, dismissal, licensing, discipline or tenure of a public
employee or a person licensed by a board or commission. This exception permits preliminary discussion and
investigation without the necessity of providing actual notice to the individual involved. However, before any
evidentiary hearing can be conducted or formal action taken, notice must be given to the person involved so that
he or she can exercise his or her right to request an open session for those purposes.
3. Sec. 19.85(1)(c), Wis. Stats., sanctions the use of closed sessions where governmental bodies are considering
employment, promotion, and compensation or performance evaluation of any public employee. Governmental
bodies should exercise caution when considering performance to avoid discussing matters that are covered by
Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats.
4. Sec. 19.85(1)(c), Wis. Stats., permits the use of closed sessions when applications for parole or probation are being
considered, or when crime detection or prevention strategy is to be discussed.
5. Sec. 19.85(1)(e), Wis. Stats., allows closed sessions for the purpose of deliberating or negotiating the purchase
of public properties, the investing of public funds, or the conducting of other specified public business, as long
as competitive or bargaining reasons require a closed session. Under this exception, a governmental body could
meet in closed session for the purpose of forming negotiation strategies, although the body must give notice that
an open session will be held for the purpose of taking a vote to convene in closed session for the purpose of discussing
labor negotiation strategies.
6. Discussions by governmental bodies considering the financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary
data of specific persons which, if conducted in public, would have a “substantial adverse effect upon the
reputation of any person referred to” may be held in closed session under Sec. 19.85(1)(f), Wis. Stats. However,
this exemption is unavailable where Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis. Stats., is applicable.
7. Sec. 19.85(1)(g), Wis. Stats., allows a governmental body to confer with its legal counsel in closed session for
the purpose of obtaining oral or written advice concerning strategy to be adopted by the body with respect to
present and prospective litigation directly involving the governmental body.
8. Closed sessions may be utilized by governmental bodies to consider requests for confidential written advice
from ethics boards under Sec. 19.85(1)(h), Wis. Stats.
Limitations on Closed Sessions
1. Sec. 19.85(2), Wis. Stats., makes it impermissible for a governmental body to reconvene in open session within
twelve (12) hours after a closed session, unless public notice of the subsequent open session was given at the
same time and in the same manner as was required for the original open session.
2. Final ratification or approval of a collective bargaining agreement is required to be in open session under
Sec. 19.85(3), Wis. Stats. However, a governmental body can vote to preliminarily approve bargaining proposals
in closed session, in order to reach a consensus, as long as final ratification occurs in open session.
Ballots, Votes and Records
1. Unless provided elsewhere by statute, no secret ballot may be utilized by a governmental body to determine any
election or decision, except the election of the officers of such body. This narrow exception does not permit the
use of secret ballots to elect members of committees, officers of the governmental units such as department
heads, or fill vacancies on the body itself.
2. Any member may require the ascertainment and recording of each vote.
3. Records of motions and roll-call votes must be preserved and open for public inspection.
Use of Equipment in Meetings
1. A governmental unit must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the media’s equipment.
2. Any person may record, film or photograph a meeting in open session, provided that the use of this equipment
does not interfere with the conduct of the meeting(s).
3. A member of a governmental body does not have the right to tape record a closed session of the Common Council.

person, the requirement shall be construed to

(g) General Rule. All words and phrases shall be
construed according to their plain meaning in
common usage. However, words or phrases with a
technical or special meaning shall be understood
and construed according to that technical or special
meaning if such is the intent of the ordinances.
(h) Joint Authority. All words purporting to give a
joint authority to three (3) or more City officers or
employees shall be construed as giving such
authority to a majority of such officers of other
persons.
(i) Person. The word “person” shall mean any of the
following entities: natural persons, corporations,
partnerships, associations, bodies politic or any
other entity of any kind which is capable of being
sued.

repealing a prior ordinance is itself repealed, such
repeal shall not be construed to revive the prior
ordinance or any part thereof, unless expressly so
provided.
(k) Singular and Plural. Every word in these
ordinances referring to the singular number only
shall also be construed to apply to several persons
or things, and every word in these ordinances
referred to a plural number shall also be construed
to apply to one (1) person or thing.

shall not preclude the interpretation of the verb in
the future tense where appropriate.

each other, the provisions of each individual
chapter shall control all issues arising out of the
events and persons intended to be governed by that
chapter.

chapter conflict with each other, the provision
which is more specific in its application to the
events or persons raising the conflict shall control
over the more general provision.

conflict with any provision of this Code, the
provision of this Code shall control. Nothing in

ENFORCEMENT OF ORDINANCES;
ISSUANCE OF CITATIONS
SEC. 1.20 METHOD OF ENFORCEMENT.
The City of Oak Creek hereby elects to use the citation
method of enforcement of ordinances. All City law enforcement
officers and other City personnel charged with
the responsibility of enforcing the provisions of this Code
of Ordinances are hereby authorized pursuant to Sec.
66.0113, Wis. Stats., to issue citations for violations of
this Code of Ordinances, including ordinances for which
a statutory counterpart exists.
Ordinance #2616 A 1/18/11 Sec. 1.20
SEC. 1.21 INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CITATION.
The citation shall contain the following:
(a) The full name, including middle initial, date of
birth, and address of the alleged violator.
(b) Factual allegations describing the alleged violation.
(c) The date, time and place of the offense.
(d) The section of the ordinance violated.
(e) A designation of the offense in such manner as can
readily be understood by a person making a reasonable
effort to do so.
(f) The date and time at which the alleged violator
may appear in court or shall appear in court, if a
court appearance is mandatory.
(g) A statement which in essence informs the alleged
violator:
(1) That a cash deposit based on the schedule established
by this Chapter may be made
which shall be delivered or mailed to the
Clerk of Municipal Court prior to the time of
the scheduled court appearance.
(2) That if the alleged violator does not make a
cash deposit and does not appear in court at
the time specified the court may issue a
summons or a warrant for the defendant’s arrest
or consider the non appearance to be a
plea of no contest and enter judgment under
Wis. Stats. Sec. 66.0113(3)(d) or may commence
an action against the alleged violator
to collect the forfeiture, plus costs, fees and
surcharges imposed under Chapter 814 Wis.
Stats.
(3) That if the alleged violator makes such a deposit,
no appearance in court is necessary unless
he/she is subsequently summoned, provided
that a court appearance is necessary if
the citation indicates mandatory court appearance.
(4) That if the alleged violator makes a cash deposit
and does not appear in court, he/she either
will be deemed to have tendered a plea
of no contest and submitted to a forfeiture,
plus costs, fees and surcharges imposed under
Ch. 814, not to exceed the amount of the
deposit or will be summoned into court to
answer the complaint if the court does not
accept the plea of no contest.
(5) If the court finds that the violation involves
an ordinance that prohibits conduct that is
the same as or similar to conduct prohibited
by state statute punishable by fine or imprisonment
or both, and that the violation resulted
in damage to the property of or physical
injury to a person other than the alleged

construed in favor of the City so as to promote
the general welfare of peace, good order

Wisconsin Statutes Sec. 62.11(5) vests the management

SEC. 3.50 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM USER CHARGES
(a) PURPOSE. The Common Council of the City of
Oak Creek finds that the management of storm water and
other surface water discharges within and beyond the
Oak Creek, the Root River, Lake Michigan and other
bodies of water within the City is a matter that affects the
health, safety and welfare of the City, its citizens and
businesses and others in the surrounding area. Failure to
effectively manage storm water affects the sanitary sewer
utility operations of the City by, among other things, increasing
the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the
sanitary sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause
erosion of lands, threaten residences and businesses with
water damage, and create environmental damage to the
rivers, lakes and other bodies of water within and adjacent
to the City. A system for the collection and disposal
of storm water provides services to all properties within
the City of Oak Creek and surrounding areas, including
those properties not currently served by the system. The
cost of operating and maintaining the City storm water
management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements,
improvements and extensions thereof
should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship
to the services received from the system. In order to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the
Council hereby exercises its authority to establish a storm
water management service charge and establish the rates
for storm water management services. In promulgating
the regulations contained in this chapter, the City is acting
pursuant to authority granted by Chapters 62 and 66
of the Wisconsin Statutes, including, but not limited to,
sections 62.04, 62.11, 62.16(2), 62.18, 66.0621, 66.0809,
66.0811, 66.0813, 66.0821, and 66.0627.

(10) “Impervious Area” or “Impervious surface”
means a horizontal surface which has been compacted
or covered with a layer of material so that it is highly
resistant to infiltration by rainwater. It includes, but
is not limited to, compacted gravel, as well as streets,
roofs, sidewalks, parking lots and other similar surfaces.
The City Engineer shall be responsible for determining
the impervious area based on the best
available information, including, but not limited to,
data supplied by the City Assessor, aerial photography,
the property owner, tenant or developer. The
City Engineer may require additional information as
necessary to make the determination. The number of
ERU’s determined applicable to a property shall be
updated by the City Engineer based on any additions
to the impervious area.
(11) “Multifamily residential property” means any
residential property other than condominiums identified
for habitation containing more than two dwelling
units on one parcel.
(12) “Non-residential property” means any developed
lot or parcel not exclusively residential as defined
herein, including, but not limited to, transient
rentals (such as hotels and motels), business, manu11
facturing, institutional, governmental property and
parking lots.
(13) “Residential property” means any lot or parcel
developed exclusively for residential purposes including,
but not limited to, single family homes, manufactured
homes, multifamily apartment buildings and
condominiums, and agricultural property that contains

as the responsibility of the City, and all activities
undertaken to conserve water, control discharges
necessitated by rainfall events, incorporate methods to
collect, convey, store, absorb, inhibit, treat, use or reuse
water to prevent or reduce flooding, overdrainage,
environmental degradation, and water pollution
or otherwise affect the quality or quantity of
discharge from such system.
(17) “Undeveloped property” means any nonresidential
property which has less than one-fourth
(0.25) of the equivalent runoff unit of impervious area.
Vacant land currently in agricultural use shall be
considered undeveloped property.
(c) CREATION. There is hereby established a storm
water management service charge in the City of Oak
Creek. The administration of the storm water management
service charges shall be under the supervision of
the City Administrator.
(d) MANAGEMENT. The storm water management
service charge is subject to approval by the Council. All
collected revenues shall be placed in the Storm Water
Fund and shall be managed consistent with all other City
funds.
(e) AUTHORITY. The City may acquire, construct,
lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace,
clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage, monitor and finance
such facilities as are deemed by the City to be
proper and reasonably necessary for a system of storm
and surface water management. These facilities may include,
without limitation by enumeration, surface and
underground drainage facilities, sewers, watercourses, retaining
walls and ponds, and such other facilities as will
support a storm water management system.
(f) STORM WATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE
CHARGES.
The charges to be imposed for storm water management
service pursuant to the rate classifications in
Section 3.50(h) shall be made by Resolution duly
adopted by the Common Council. The charges for
storm water management service shall be calculated
on an Equivalent Charge (EC) basis. The EC shall be
imposed on all property with an impervious surface.
The EC will be calculated on the basis of a single
family property (an ERU). Other classifications of
property will be charged multiples of the EC based on
the ERU calculation for that property.
(g) STORM WATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE
CHARGE; PAYMENT. The charges established hereunder
shall be billed to the storm water management service
charge customer for the ensuing year, at the same
time as the tax bill, except for the initial billing. The initial
billing will be for the current year and will be billed
to the customer within six months of the effective date of
this ordinance. The property owner shall be the ultimate
responsible party for payment of the storm water management
service charge. Failure to pay the charges when
due will subject the owner to such penalties as are established
by State law and/or the Council, and may result in
the charges being assessed as a lien against the property
pursuant to Sec. 66.0821, Wis. Stats.
(h) STORM WATER CUSTOMER
CLASSIFICATION.
(1) For purposes of imposing the storm water management
service charges and based upon the use as of
the first day of January preceding the billing, all lots
and parcels within the City except exempt parcels are
classified into the following six (6) customer classes:
a. Residential – Single Family: The charge imposed
for a single family residential property
shall be the fee for one (1) EC.
b. Residential – Duplex: The charge imposed
for a duplex residential property shall be the fee
for one (1) EC.
c. Residential – Condominium: The charge
imposed for each dwelling unit within a condominium
residential property shall be the fee
for five-tenths (0.5) of one (1) EC.
d. Residential – Multifamily: The charge imposed
for a multifamily residential property
shall be the fee for one (1) EC, multiplied by the
numerical factor obtained by dividing the total
square footage of impervious area of the property
by the square footage of one (1) ERU. Such
impervious area shall be determined based on
the best information reasonably available. The
factor shall be rounded down to the nearest
one-fourth (0.25), i.e., Multifamily Charge =
EC fee x (total impervious area ÷ 3,300 square
feet).
e. Non-residential: The charge imposed for a
non-residential property shall be the fee for one
(1) EC, multiplied by the numerical factor ob12
tained by dividing the total square footage of
impervious area of the property by the square
footage of one (1) ERU. Such impervious area
shall be determined based on the best information
reasonably available. The factor shall be
rounded down to the nearest one-fourth (0.25),
i.e., Non-residential Charge = EC fee x (total
impervious area ÷ 3,300 square feet).
f. Undeveloped: The charge imposed for an
undeveloped property shall be zero (0) until
changed by resolution by the Council.
(2) Minimum Charge. The minimum ERU calculations
for any customer other than undeveloped properties
shall be not less than the rate of one-fourth
(0.25) of one ERU.
(i) STORM WATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE
CHARGE-ADJUSTMENT.
(1) Adjustments may be made for customers who
own and properly maintain storm water management
practices as defined in Section 13.103, except as provided
in Section 3.50(i)(4). In considering such a request,
the City Engineer shall consider whether and to
what extent the City’s cost of providing service available
to a property has been lessened by the storm water
management practices. If the City’s cost of
providing service or making service available to a
property has not been lessened by the storm water
management practices, the request for an adjustment
shall be denied. If the City’s cost of providing service
or making service available to a property has been
lessened by the storm water management practices,
the customer shall be eligible for an adjustment, subject
to conditions outlined by the City Engineer, including,
but not limited to, the signing of a maintenance
agreement with the City, by the customer and
the City.
(2) In considering a request for an adjustment, the
City Engineer may, at his or her discretion, separately
examine multiple drainage areas on one piece of
property and may recommend allowing an adjustment
for a portion of the property if the characteristics of
one or more drainage areas meet the criteria set forth
in this section.
(3) The City Engineer, at his or her discretion, may
recommend allowing an adjustment which may be as
low as zero for a property for reasons other than as
specifically set forth in this section provided that the
adjustment is reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory.
(4) No adjustments shall be considered for structural
or nonstructural Best Management Practices that are
required in order to comply with any local, state, or
federal regulation, including, but not limited to, Sections
13.100 through 13.114 of the Municipal Code,
Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District’s Chapter
13, Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapters NR103,
NR151, NR216 or Chapter 30, Wisconsin Statutes.
(5) No adjustments shall be considered for any “natural”
features such as, but not limited to, wetlands,
lakes, rivers, creeks and floodplains or water impoundment
of any kind in existence prior to passage
of this Ordinance.
(6) City Engineer’s Review Procedure For Adjustments.
a. The City Engineer shall issue a written Determination
as to whether a written request for
adjustment will be granted, denied or granted in
part and denied in part, within fifteen (15) days
of receipt of all materials and reports required
by the City Engineer on the request for an adjustment.
The Determination shall be mailed to
the customer requesting adjustment.
b. A customer may appeal a Determination
within thirty (30) days of the date of the City
Engineer’s Determination, by submitting a written
request for appeal to the Small Claims
Committee. Any request for appeal in excess of

the Determination of the City Engineer
shall be final.
d. The Small Claims Committee review of the
appeal to the Determination shall be completed
within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the written
request for appeal. The Small Claims
Committee shall review the appeal and determine
whether the City Engineer’s Determination
shall be approved, modified or rejected.
The determination of the Small Claims Committee
shall be in writing and set forth the reason or
reasons for its decision and shall be mailed to
the customer.
e. A customer may appeal the Small Claims
Committee Determination within thirty (30)
days of the date of the Determination, by submitting
a written request for appeal to the
Common Council.
(j) APPEAL OF CHARGE.
(1) Method of Review.
a. A customer may request a review of a classification
and ERU determination by submitting a
written request specifying all bases for the request
to the City Engineer.
b. The City Engineer shall provide a written explanation
as to the customer’s classification and
ERU determination within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the request for an adjustment. The explanation
shall be mailed to the customer requesting
an adjustment.
c. Within thirty (30) days of the date of the City
Engineer’s explanation, the customer may appeal
the City Engineer’s classification and ERU determination
to the Small Claims Committee by
filing with the City Clerk a written request for
appeal. Any request for appeal in excess of five
thousand ($5000) dollars shall be forwarded directly
to the Council.
13
d. The Small Claims Committee shall hear the
appeal within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
the written request for appeal. The Small Claims
Committee shall hold a contested case hearing to
determine whether the classification and/or ERU
determination is fair and reasonable or whether a
modification to the classification and/or ERU is
warranted. The Small Claims Committee shall
determine whether the City Engineer’s determination
shall be approved, modified or rejected.
The determination of the Small Claims Committee
shall be filed within ten (10) days of the hearing,
in writing, and set forth in detail the reason
or reasons for its decision and shall be mailed to
the customer.
e. A customer may appeal the Small Claims
Committee Determination within thirty (30) days
of the date of the Determination, by submitting a
written request for appeal to the Common Council.
(2) Application of Adjustment. There shall be no retroactive
adjustment for user charges imposed prior to
the date of the granted request. Adjustments will be
effective on the first bill following the date of the
granted request for adjustment.
(3) As a condition precedent to challenging any
storm water classification, all charges must be paid to
the City. Failure to comply with Section (j)(l) waives
all right to challenge the classification.
(k) SEVERABILITY. If any section, clause, provision
or portion of this ordinance is judged unconstitutional
or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
of the ordinance shall remain in force and not
be affected by such judgment.

of repair shall be as provided in Sec. 6.21(f)(1)b.
(b) Sidewalk Permit Required. No person shall hereafter
install, remove, replace or repair any public

be undertaken.
(c) Illegal Sidewalks. No sidewalk constructed contrary

that is in conformity with this Section.
(d) Design of Sidewalks. The design and construction
of sidewalks shall conform with the standards outlined
in the City of Oak Creek Engineering Design
Manual, the City of Oak Creek construction standards,
and by other criteria established by the City
Engineer.
(e) Criteria for Inspection and Repair of Public
Sidewalks.
(1) Order to Repair. The City Engineer will order
property owners abutting public sidewalks
to repair or replace sections of sidewalk
where it is determined that any of the
following conditions are present:
a. An abrupt transverse elevation difference,
greater than three-quarters of one inch
(3/4"), between adjacent sidewalk
squares.
b. A transverse pitch greater than one inch
per foot (1":1').
c. A difference in longitudinal pitch greater
than one inch per foot (1":1') as compared
to the plan grade of the sidewalk.
d. Existence of cracking and/or deterioration
which has resulted in:
1. A crack or joint greater than threequarters
of an inch (3/4") wide.
2. An abrupt elevation difference, greater
than three-quarters of one inch
(3/4"), along a longitudinal or transverse
crack or cracks.
3. Loose or spalled concrete, which has
resulted in surface irregularities
greater than three-quarters of an inch
(3/4") depth relative to the sidewalk
surface.
4. A sidewalk square with a transverse
crack within one (1) foot of the sidewalk
square having any of the above
characteristics.
e. Underground vault covers and frames,
ground level surface accesses, drainage
grates, window well grates and similar
fixtures:
1. Which are cracked or broken in any
manner.
2. Which are rusted through in any
place.
3. Where the fixture creates an abrupt
change in elevation greater than
three-quarters of one inch (3/4") with
the adjacent sidewalk.
(2) Temporary Repairs. Materials such as crack
fillers, wedges of any type, surface treatments,
or applications of other material of
any nature constitute the temporary treatment
of a sidewalk condition addressed above, and
are not authorized or permissible as a permanent
repair. Mudjacking or patching with
concrete or epoxy material may be used only
upon the prior approval of the City Engineer.
(f) Notice to Property Owners.
(1) Property owners are responsible for the repair
and/or replacement of the sidewalk
fronting their property in accordance with
Sec. 66.615, Wis. Stats., and must comply
with City specifications for construction.
Sidewalks identified for repair will be
marked with a paint spot. Property owners
will receive preliminary notice from the City
that the sidewalk section marked must be repaired
and/or replaced. There are two (2) alternatives
for making the necessary repair
and/or replacements:
a. Property owners may make arrangements
to have the work performed by a
private contractor. The contractor or
City of Oak Creek
6-5
property owner must obtain a permit
from the Engineering Department prior
to performing the work.
b. The City will replace a defective sidewalk
and the cost will be billed to the
property owners. The full assessment
for concrete walk removal and replacement
shall amount to one hundred percent
(100%) of the construction costs
plus ten percent (10%) of construction
costs for engineering and administration.
The full assessment shall apply if
an existing walk is replaced after fifteen
(15) years or more of service. If a walk
is replaced after one to five (1-5) years
of its projected fifteen (15) year life,
there will be no assessment to property
owners. If a sidewalk is replaced after
six to fifteen (6-15) years of its projected
fifteen (15) year life, property owners
will be assessed between ten percent to
one hundred percent (10%-100%) of the
replacement cost, with the property
owner’s share increased by ten percent
(10%) for each year.

(c) Information to Accompany Application. The
applicant shall submit to the City Engineer, at the
time the permit is applied for, sufficient information
on the proposed work for proper evaluation.
The City Engineer shall determine whether

no case shall it be less than a plan or sketch in triplicate
of the proposed work showing the location,
nature, reason and method of doing the work.
(d) Deposit.
(1) The applicant shall submit to the City Engineer
a cash deposit conditioned to guarantee
the restoration of the surface of such right-ofway
or portion of right-of-way disturbed by
the proposed excavation, unless the required
deposit has been waived by the Common
Council. The applicant shall in all cases be
responsible for the surface restoration or the
cost of such restoration.
(2) The amount of the required cash deposit shall
be as follows:
a. For all excavations along a public highway

times be maintained at that amount.
f. No deposit will be required for excavations
in an arterial street where jurisdictional
control is afforded by Milwaukee
County or the State of Wisconsin.
(e) Use of Deposits. The City may use any or all of a
deposit to pay the cost of work the City performs to

SEC. 7.02 ISSUANCE AND REVOCATION OF
LICENSES.
(a) License Required. No person shall engage in any

a license or permit therefor as provided by this
Section. The words “license” and “permit” as used
throughout this Chapter shall be considered interchangeable.
(b) Application. Application for a license under this
Chapter shall be made to the City Clerk on a form
furnished by the City. Such application shall contain
such information as may be required by the
provisions of this Chapter or as may be otherwise
required by the Common Council.

(2) All other licenses shall be granted by the
Council unless otherwise designated.
(e) Terms of Licenses. Licenses issued hereunder
shall expire on June 30th in the year of issuance
unless issued for a shorter term, when they shall
expire on midnight of the last effective day of the
license, or unless otherwise provided by these ordinances
or state laws.
(f) Form of License. All licenses issued hereunder
shall show the date of issue, the activity licensed,
and the term of the license, and shall be signed by
the City Clerk and be impressed with the City Seal.
(g) Record of Licenses. The City Clerk shall keep a
record of all licenses issued.
(h) Display of Licenses. All licenses hereunder shall
be displayed upon the premises or vehicle for
which issued, or if carried on the person shall be
displayed to any officer of the City upon request.
(i) Transfer of Licenses. All licenses issued hereunder
shall be personal to whom issued and shall
not be transferred except with the consent of the
Council.
(j) Exemptions. No license other than a liquor or beer
license shall be required under this Section for any
nonprofit educational, charitable, civic, military, or
religious organization where the activity which
would otherwise be licensed is conducted for the
benefit of the members or for the benefit of the
public generally.
(k) Consent to Inspection. An applicant for a license
under this Chapter thereby consents to the entry of
police or authorized representatives of the City upon
licensed premises at all reasonable hours for the
purposes of inspection and search, and consents to
removal from the premises and introduction into
evidence in prosecutions for violations of this
Chapter all things found therein in violation of this
Chapter or state law.
(l) License Investigation. The following investigation
procedure shall be followed prior to issuance
of a license or permit for Class A or Class B licenses.
The City Clerk shall notify the Chief of Police,
Fire Inspector, Sanitarian, City Treasurer or
other appropriate official of all license and permit
applications. These officials shall inspect or cause
to be inspected each application to determine
whether the applicant and the premises sought to
be licensed comply with the regulations, ordinances
and laws applicable thereto. These officials
shall furnish to the City Clerk or Council in writing
information derived from such investigation. No license
shall be renewed without a report from the
Chief of Police, Fire Inspector, Sanitarian, City
Treasurer or other appropriate official.
(1) No license shall be issued for operation on
any premises or with any equipment for
which taxes, assessments, forfeitures or other
financial claims of the City are delinquent
and unpaid.
(2) No license shall be issued unless the premises
conform to the sanitary, safety and health
requirements of the State Building Code, and
the regulations of the State Board of Health
and local Board of Health applicable to restaurants,
if applicable. The premises must be
properly lighted and ventilated, must be
City of Oak Creek
4
equipped with separate sanitary toilet and
lavatory facilities equipped with running water
for each sex and must conform to all Ordinances
of the City, if applicable.
(3) Consideration for the granting or denial of a
license will be based on:
a. Arrest and conviction record of the applicant,
subject to the limitations imposed
by Secs. 111.321, 111.322, and 111.335,
Wis. Stats.;
b. The financial responsibility of the applicant;
c. The appropriateness of the location and
the premises where the licensed business
is to be conducted; and
d. Generally, the applicant’s fitness for the
trust to be reposed.
(4) An application may be denied based upon
the applicant’s arrest and conviction record if
the applicant has been convicted of a felony
(unless duly pardoned), or if the applicant
has habitually been a law offender or if the
applicant has falsified the application. For
purposes of this licensing procedure, “habitually
been a law offender” is generally considered
to be an arrest or conviction of at
least two (2) offenses which are substantially
related to the licensed activity within the five
(5) years immediately preceding the license
application. Because a license is a privilege,
the issuance of which is a right granted solely
to the Common Council (or to the City
Clerk in the case of amusement device and
cigarette licenses), the Common Council reserves
the right to consider the severity, and
facts and circumstances of the offense when
making the determination to grant, deny, not
renew or revoke a license.
Ordinance #2007 A 6/15/99 Sec. 7.02(d)(1)

AND CLAIMS.
No license shall be issued under this Chapter for any
premises for which taxes, assessments or other claims of
the City are delinquent and unpaid or to any person delinquent
in payment of such taxes, assessments or other
claims to the City. It shall be a condition of holding a license
under this Chapter that the licensee comply with all
ordinances of the City.
SEC. 7.04 REVOCATION AND NON-RENEWAL
OF LICENSES.
Except as provided in Section 7.90 and 7.101(m) and (n),
any license issued under this Chapter may be revoked for
cause by the Mayor and Common Council. The Common
Council shall notify the licensee in writing of the City’s
intention to revoke or not renew the license and provide
the licensee with an opportunity for a hearing. The notice
shall state the reasons for the intended action. If the licensee
does not appear at the hearing, the allegations of
the complaint shall be taken as true and if the Common
Council finds the allegations sufficient, the license shall
be revoked or not renewed. If the licensee appears pursuant
to the written notice, the licensee may produce witnesses,
cross examine witnesses, and be represented by
counsel. The licensee shall be provided a written transcript
of the hearing at his expense. The Common Council
may suspend, revoke or not renew the license. The action
of the Common Council in suspending, revoking or
not renewing the license may be reviewed by the Circuit
Court for Milwaukee County. The licensee shall have
twenty (20) days from the date of the Common Council
decision to file an action in the Milwaukee County Circuit

SEC. 7.21 AMUSEMENT ARCADES.
(a) Declaration of Intent.
(1) It is the belief of the Common Council that
such arcades are intended to, and in fact do,
draw a major portion of their clientele from

(2) It is the policy of the Common Council that
it is in the best interest of the community to
closely monitor, regulate as necessary, and
oversee the operation of those businesses
that have a high degree of contact with the
youth of the community.
(3) It is the belief of the Common Council that
without proper regulation, arcades may substantially
interfere with the attainment of
public education objectives and priorities for
the youth of the community, create an environment
for disorderly behavior and conduct,
and threaten the peaceful enjoyment of
the properties in the neighborhood; all contrary
to the good order, safety, health and
welfare of the community.
(4) Therefore, it is determined that it is in the
best interest of the health, safety and welfare
of the community to establish reasonable
regulations for the operation of arcade businesses,

hereby enacted.

PRIVATE ALARM SYSTEMS
SEC. 7.180 PURPOSE OF CHAPTER.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate private alarm
systems in the City of Oak Creek. It is recognized that
private alarm systems can significantly contribute to the
protection of persons and property within the City provided
that the use of such alarm systems is properly coordinated
within the Police and Fire Departments and
that the alarm systems are maintained and operated in
such a manner so as to minimize the unwarranted use of
police and fire personnel and resources in responding to
false alarms.
SEC. 7.181 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
It is hereby found that those properties which are serviced
with mechanical alarm systems for alerting either
the Police Department or the Fire Department have substantially
more service responses than other properties.
The reasons are that alarms can be made easier by mechanical
systems than by direct personal notification or
personal notification through the telephone system; mechanical
alarm systems are susceptible to the telephone
system; mechanical alarm systems are susceptible to the
intentional or inadvertent false alarms caused by employees,
customers and others; mechanical alarm systems are
also susceptible to false alarms activated by weather conditions
and defects in basic equipment or in related telephone
equipment. For all of these reasons, the properties
serviced by mechanical alarm systems tend to cause the
City more expense than properties not so serviced.
SEC. 7.182 DEFINITIONS.
The following definitions shall be applicable in this
Chapter:
(a) Alarm System. Fire, burglar and/or other detection
systems that are designed to be connected to the
Police Department alarm panel or a commercial
alarm company to alert the Police and Fire Departments
of danger to persons and/or property.
(b) Intrusion Alarm System. Any system designed to
detect an unauthorized entry into a residence or
place of business and which automatically sounds
an alarm at the police station or a commercial
alarm company.
(c) Fire, Smoke, Water Flow and Heat Detection
Systems. Any device designed to detect fire,
smoke, water flow in a sprinkler system and extreme
heat which automatically sounds an alarm at
the Police or Fire Department or a commercial
alarm company.
(d) Local Alarm System. Any detecting device that
gives a signal which is visible or audible to persons
in the vicinity of the premises.
SEC. 7.183 GENERAL PROHIBITIONS.
(a) No person, firm or corporation shall use or cause to
be used any telephone or electronic device or attachment
which automatically connects to a primary
telephone trunk line of the Police or Fire Department,
for the purpose of activating a prerecorded
message to report an emergency.
(b) No person, firm or corporation shall maintain a
private alarm system programmed to alert a central
office unless it shall also maintain a patrol and
maintenance service capable of immediately dispatching
a company representative to respond
within thirty (30) minutes to the location of the
alarm.
(c) All police alarm systems shall be designed and
maintained to automatically reset or shut off the local
portion of the alarm signal within ten (10)

shall be designed and maintained to allow the Fire
Department to reset or shut off the local portion of
the alarm upon their arrival.

SEC. 7.203 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
1. Findings of fact.
Based on public testimony and other evidence
and information before it, the Common Council
makes the following findings of fact:
City of Oak Creek
42
(a) The secondary effects of the activities defined
and regulated in this section are detrimental
to the public health, safety and general
welfare of the citizens of the city and, therefore,
such activities must be regulated as provided
in this section.
(b) Regulation of the adult entertainment industry
is necessary because, in the absence of
such regulation, significant criminal activity
has historically and regularly occurred. This
history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment
industry has included prostitution,
narcotics and liquor law violations, breaches
of the peace and the presence within the industry
of individuals with hidden ownership interests
and outstanding arrest warrants.
(c) The Common Council, based on the experience
of other cities including Seattle and
Renton, Washington, and Detroit, Michigan,
has previously determined that adult oriented
establishments can contribute to the impairment
of the character and quality of surrounding
residential neighborhoods, and contribute
to the decline and the value of surrounding
properties.
(d) The Common Council has reviewed studies
distributed by the National Obscenity Law
Center in a three volume set that documents
the secondary effects of adult entertainment
establishments that affect property values,
contribute to physical deterioration and blight,
have a deleterious effect on both existing
businesses around them and surrounding residential
areas, including increased transiency,
increased levels of criminal activities including
prostitution, rape, assaults and other sex
related crimes. The Common Council is also
aware that similar studies have been done in
other communities across the United States
such as St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Austin, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona.
(e) The Common Council believes that the
experiences and studies of other communities
set forth herein are relevant in addressing the
secondary effects adult oriented establishments
can have upon areas surrounding such
establishments in the City of Oak Creek.
(f) It has been found in Milwaukee and Kenosha
Counties, Wisconsin; Chattanooga,
Tennessee; Newport News, Virginia; and Marion
County, Indiana, that the viewing booths
in adult oriented establishments have been and
are being used by patrons of said establishments
for engaging in sexual acts, particularly
between males, including but not limited to intercourse,
sodomy, oral copulation and masturbation,
resulting in unsafe and unsanitary
conditions in said booths.
(g) Contact between entertainers and patrons
of adult entertainment businesses facilitates
prostitution and other related crimes and the
concern over unlawful sexual activities and related
crimes is a legitimate health concern of
the city which demands reasonable regulation
of adult entertainment businesses in order to
protect the health and well-being of the citizens.
(h) Licensing is a legitimate and reasonable
means of accountability to ensure that operators
of adult entertainment businesses comply
with reasonable regulations and to ensure that
operators do not knowingly allow their establishments
to be used as places of illegal sexual
activity or solicitation.
(i) It is necessary to license entertainers in the
adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation
of minors, to ensure that each such
entertainer is an adult, to ensure that such entertainers
have not assumed a false name
which would make regulation of the entertainer
difficult or impossible and to ensure that
such entertainers are not involved in criminal
activity.
(j) It is necessary to have a licensed manager
on the premises of establishments offering
adult entertainment at such times as such establishments
are offering adult entertainment
so that there will, at all necessary times, be an
individual responsible for the overall operation
of the establishment, including the actions of
patrons, entertainers and other employees.
(k) The license fees required in this section
are nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory
measures designed to help defray the substantial
expenses incurred by the city in regulating
the adult entertainment industry.
(l) Hidden ownership interests for the purpose
of skimming profits and avoiding the payment
of taxes have historically occurred in the adult
entertainment industry in the absence of regulation.
These hidden ownership interests have
historically been held by organized and whitecollar
crime elements. In order for the city to
effectively protect the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry, it is important
that the city be fully apprised of the actual
ownership of adult entertainment establishments.
(m) The Common Council desires to prevent
these adverse effects and thereby protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry;
protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve
the quality of life; preserve the property
City of Oak Creek
43
values and character of surrounding neighborhoods;
and deter the spread of urban blight.
(n) It is not the intent of this section to suppress
any speech activities protected by the
First Amendment or Article I, Section 3 of the
Wisconsin State Constitution, but to enact
content neutral regulations which address the
secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses,
as well as the health problems associated
with such businesses.
(o) The City is empowered to enact such ordinances
pursuant to the Constitution and
Laws of the State of Wisconsin.
2. Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose of this section to regulate
adult entertainment businesses and related activities,
to promote health, safety, morals, and
general welfare of the citizens of Oak Creek,
and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
to prevent the establishment and operation
of adult entertainment businesses in locations
within the city which would have a
harmful effect on the residents of the city. The
purpose of this section is to alleviate undesirable
social problems that accompany adult entertainment
businesses, and to enact content
neutral regulations which address the secondary
effects of adult entertainment businesses as
well as health problems associated with such
business, not to curtail the First Amendment
expression, namely dancing or entertainment.
The provisions of this section have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect
of this section to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected
by the state or federal constitutions, or to deny
access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect
of this section to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene materials.

or more of a business’ stock-intrade
in adult retail material, based on
either the dollar value (wholesale or
retail) or the number of titles of such
material, is significant or substantial.
In determining whether or not the
presumption is rebutted, the Common
Council may consider the following
factors, which are not conclusive:
(a) Whether minors are prohibited
from access to the
premises of the establishment
due to the adult entertainment
nature of the inventory;
(b) Whether the establishment
is advertised, marketed,
or held out to be an adult
merchandising facility;

material is an establishment’s
primary or one
of its principal business purposes;
or
(d) Whether thirty (30) percent
or more of an establishment’s
revenue is derived
from adult entertainment
material.
An establishment may have
other principal purposes that
do not involve the offering
for sale or rental of adult entertainment
materials and
still be categorized as an
adult retail establishment.
Such other business purposes
will not serve to exempt
such establishments from
being categorized as an adult
retail establishment so long
as one (1) of its principal
business purposes is offering
for sale or rental, for some
form of consideration, the
specified adult entertainment
materials.
The Common Council shall
have full discretion to give
appropriate weight to the
factors set forth above as
well as other factors considered
depending on the particular
facts and circumstances
of each application.

and wild flowers native to North America which
are designed and purposely cultivated to exceed
twelve (12) inches in height from the ground. Specifically

Chapter. The growth of a natural lawn on nonagricultural
land in excess of twelve (12) inches in
height from the ground surface shall be prohibited
within the City of Oak Creek unless the Council
designates a property by resolution as a nature center
or wildlife preserve.
SEC. 8.07 REGULATION OF LENGTH OF
LAWNS AND GRASSES.
(1) Purpose. This Section is adopted due to the unique
nature of the problems associated with lawns,
grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow
to excessive length in the City of Oak Creek.
(2) Public Nuisance Declared. The Common Council
finds that lawns, grasses and noxious weeds on
non-agricultural lots or parcels of land, as classified
under the Zoning Code, within the City of Oak
Creek in violation of Section 8.05 adversely affect
the public health and safety of the public in that
they tend to emit pollen and other discomforting
bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety
City of Oak Creek
10
hazard in that debris can be hidden in the grass, interferes
with the public convenience and adversely
affects property values of other land within the
City. For that reason, any non-agricultural lawn,
grass or weed on a lot or other parcel of land which
is in violation of Section 8.05 is hereby declared to
be a public nuisance, except for property located in
a designated floodplain area and/or wetland area or
where the lawn, grass or weed is part of a nature
center or wildlife preserve designated by the
Common Council.

shall permit any public nuisance as defined
in Subsection (b) above to remain on any premises
owned or controlled by him within the City.

shall inspect or cause to be inspected all
premises and places within the City to determine
whether any public nuisance as defined in Subsection
(b) above exists.
(e) Abatement of Nuisance.
(1) If the Weed Commissioner shall determine
with reasonable certainty that any public nuisance
as defined in Subsection (b) above exists,
he shall immediately cause written notice
to be served that the City proposes to
have the lot grass or lawn cut so as to conform
with this Section and Section 8.05.
(2) The notice shall be served at least five (5)
days prior to the date of the hearing and shall
be mailed or served on the owner of the lot
or parcel of land or, if he is not known and
there is a tenant occupying the property, then
to the tenant, of the time and place at which
the hearing will be held.
(f) Due Process Hearing. If the owner believes that
his grasses or weeds are not a nuisance, he may request
dispute resolution pursuant to the City’s
complaint dispute policy. The request for dispute
resolution must be made in writing to the City
Clerk’s office within the five (5) days set forth in
the Weed Commissioner’s notice. Upon application
for dispute resolution, the property owner
must deposit a Twenty-five Dollar ($25.00) bond.
If a decision is rendered in the property owner’s
favor, the Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) will be returned
to the property owner. If the property owner
fails to appear for the dispute resolution meeting or
for the hearing or if the decision is rendered against
the property owner, the deposit shall be forfeited
and applied to the cost of City personnel abating
the nuisance, if necessary. When a dispute resolution
meeting or a hearing is requested by the owner
of the property, a dispute resolution meeting or a
hearing by the Common Council shall be held
within fourteen (14) days from the date of the
owner’s request. The property in question will not
be mowed by the City until such time as the meeting
or hearing is held. If there is a hearing, the
owner may appear in person or by his attorney,
may present witnesses in his own behalf and may
cross-examine witnesses presented by the City as
well as subpoena witnesses for his own case. At
the close of the hearing, the Common Council shall
make its determination in writing specifying its
findings, facts, and conclusions. If the Common
Council determines that a public nuisance did exist,
the Council shall order the Weed Commissioner to
mow the property in question unless the property
has been mowed by the owner within forty-eight
(48) hours of the Common Council’s decision. If
the owner does not abate the nuisance within the
described forty-eight (48) hours, the Weed Commissioner
shall cause the same nuisance to be abated
and cost in excess of the forfeited fee assessed
accordingly.
(g) City’s Option To Abate Nuisance. In any case
where the owner, occupant or person in charge of
the property shall fail to cut his lawn, grass or
weeds as set forth above, then, and in that event,
the City may elect to cut said lawn, grass or weeds
as follows:
(1) The written notice required in Subsection (e)
shall inform said person that in the event of
his failure to abate the nuisance within the
prescribed time, the City shall abate the same
and the cost thereof shall be assessed to the
property owner as a special charge.
(2) The City shall cut or cause to be cut all grass
and weeds from the subject’s property and
shall charge the expenses of so doing at a
rate as established by resolution by the
Common Council. The charges shall be set
forth in a statement to the City Clerk who, in
turn, shall mail the same to the owner, occupant
or person in charge of the subject premises.
If said statement is not paid in full within
thirty (30) days thereafter, the City Clerk
shall enter the charges in the tax roll as a
special tax against said lot or parcel of land,
and the same shall be collected in all respects
like other taxes upon real estate, or as provided
under Sec. 66.615(3)(f), Wisconsin
Statutes.

parent, guardian or custodian was informed by any

required under Sec. 48.20(5), Wis. Stats. If
the child is believed to be an intoxicated person
who has threatened, attempted, or inflicted
physical harm on himself/herself or on another
and is likely to inflict such physical
harm unless committed or is incapacitated by
alcohol, the officer shall take such action as
is required under Sec. 48.20(6), Wis. Stats.

STORM WATER RUNOFF
SEC. 13.100 AUTHORITY
(a) This ordinance is adopted by the City under the authority
granted by Sec. 62.234 Wis. Stats. This ordinance
supersedes all conflicting and contradictory
storm water management regulations previously
enacted under Sec. 62.23 Wis. Stats. Except as
specifically provided for in Sec. 62.234 Wis. Stats,
Sec. 62.23, Wis. Stats applies to this ordinance and
to any amendments to this ordinance.
(b) The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to
limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the
same governing body.
(c) The City hereby designates the City Engineer to
administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
(d) The requirements of this ordinance do not pre-empt
more stringent storm water management requirements
that may be imposed by WPDES Storm Water
Permits issued by the DNR under Sec. 283.33
Wis. Stats.
SEC. 13.101 FINDINGS OF FACT
(a) The City finds that uncontrolled storm water runoff
from land development activity has a significant
impact upon water resources and the health, safety,
and general welfare of the community, and diminishes
the public enjoyment and use of natural resources.
Specifically, uncontrolled storm water
runoff can:
1. degrade physical stream habitat by increasing
streambank erosion, increasing streambed
scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, and
diminishing stream base flows;
2. diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to
support fish, aquatic life, recreational, and water
supply uses by increasing the export of nutrients
and other urban pollutants;
3. alter wetland communities by changing wetland
hydrology and by increasing pollutant
loads;
4. reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing
pollutant loading;
5. threaten public health, safety, property, and
general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers,
drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities;
6. threaten public health, safety, property, and
general welfare by increasing major flood
peaks and volumes;
7. undermine flood plain management efforts by
increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.
SEC. 13.102 PURPOSE AND INTENT
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to set
forth storm water requirements and criteria which
will prevent and control water pollution, and diminish
the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and
aquatic life due to runoff of storm water from development
or redevelopment.
(b) INTENT. The City recognizes that a method of
addressing storm water management problems and
needs is through the preparation of comprehensive
storm water management plans for subwatershed
areas which are designed to meet the purpose and
intent of this ordinance. Accordingly, the standards
for onsite storm water management measures set
forth in Section 13.106 do not apply in areas where
such plans have been prepared and approved by the
City. In those areas for which approved storm water
management plans have been prepared, all land
development activities will include storm water
management measures set forth in those approved
storm water management plans. It is the general intent
of the City to achieve its purpose through:
1. managing long-term, construction site erosion
and post-construction storm water discharges
from land development activities;
2. providing two options for developing storm
water management requirements including:
a. application of generic requirements in this
ordinance on a site-by-site basis in areas
for which no approved storm water management
plan exists; and
b. implementation of management practices
set forth in the City Storm Water Management
Master Plan or any other detailed
storm water management plan approved
by the City.

SEC. 13.106 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
STANDARDS
(a) DRAINAGE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR
NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT.
The developer shall install all the storm
drainage facilities indicated on the plans required in
Subsection 13.108 of this ordinance necessary to
serve, and resulting from, the phase of the land development.
1. A drainage system shall be designed and constructed
by the developer to provide for the
proper drainage of the surface water of the
land division and the drainage area of which it
is a part. Design shall be in conformance with
Chapter 4 and 5 of the Engineering Design
Manual.
2. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings, and individual
lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
general storm drainage pattern for the area.
3. Any storm water drainage system will be separate
and independent of any sanitary sewer system.
Storm sewers, where utilized, shall be
designed in accordance with all governmental
regulations and Chapter 5 of the Engineering
Design Manual. A copy of design computations
for engineering capacities shall accompany
plans submitted by the petitioner’s engineer.
4. Storm water drainage systems shall be designed
to utilize the natural drainage and storage
capabilities of the site to the fullest extent
practicable. Storm water drainage systems
shall be designed to provide an economical
gravity flow drainage system.
5. Storm water drainage systems shall be designed
to utilize the collector and land access
streets as open runoff channels during major
storm events without flooding adjoining building
sites. The streets will be supplementary to
the minor storm water drainage system.
6. Bridges and Culverts. All new and replacement
culverts and bridges over waterways shall
be designed so as to accommodate, according
to the categories listed below, the designated
flood event without over topping the related
roadway or railway track:
a. Minor and collector streets used or intended
to be used primarily for access to abutting
properties: a 10-year recurrence interval
flood discharge.
b. Arterial streets and highways, other than
freeways and expressways, used or intended
to be used primarily to carry heavy
volumes of traffic: a 50-year recurrence
interval flood discharge.
c. Freeway and expressway: a 100-year recurrence
interval flood discharge.
d. Railways: a 100-year recurrence interval
flood discharge.
The depth of flow over the top of minor,
collector, and arterial streets and highways
shall not exceed six inches during the 100-
year recurrence interval flood discharge.
Bridges and culverts shall be designed to
facilitate fish passage through elimination
of hydraulic drops, maintenance of low
24
flow channels, and minimization of excess
stream enclosures.
7. Street Drainage. All streets shall be provided
with an adequate storm drainage system. The
street storm drainage system shall serve as the
minor drainage system and shall be designed to
carry street, adjacent land and building storm
water drainage. Storm water shall not be permitted
to be run into the sanitary sewer system
within the proposed subdivision. In order to
provide an acceptable level of access to property
and traffic service, the drainage system
shall be designed to provide two clear lanes of
moving traffic on arterial streets and one 10-
foot lane for moving traffic on collector and
land access streets during the 10-year critical
duration storm. Temporary accumulations of
storm runoff from ponding or flowing water, in
or near minor system components, shall be
permitted during events beyond the ten year
event providing such accumulations do not encroach
on any traffic lane of any collector or
arterial street, nor be more than 6-inches deep
as measured at the centerline of any local
street.
8. Off-Street Drainage. The design of the offstreet
major drainage system shall include the
entire watershed affecting the land development
and shall be extended to a watercourse or
ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
When the drainage system is outside of the
street right-of-way, the developer shall make
provisions for providing an easement pursuant
to Subsection 13.106(b) of this ordinance, to
provide for the future maintenance of said system.
9. Drainage Piping Systems. Unless otherwise
approved by the City Engineer, all drainage
piping shall conform to the requirements in
Chapter 5 of the Engineering Design Manual.
10. Agricultural Drains. Agricultural drain tiles
which are disturbed during construction shall
be restored, reconnected or connected to public
storm drainage facilities.
11. Open Channel Systems. Where open channels
are utilized in either the minor or major drainage
system, they shall be designed so as to
minimize maintenance requirements. Drainage
easements or dedications shall be utilized to
accommodate open channels provided with adequate
access by the City for maintenance of
drainage capacity. Side slopes shall be in conformance
with the requirements of roadside
ditches in Chapter 5 of the Engineering Design
Manual.
12. Major Drainageways. Major drainageways
should be designed with low flow channels to
maintain increased stream velocity to reduce
sedimentation in the stream channels and accompanying
nuisance vegetation.
13. Protection of Drainage Systems. The developer
shall adequately protect all ditches to the satisfaction
of the City Engineer. Open channels
shall be seeded and erosion matted, sodded or
riprapped based upon recommendations made
in the technical standards identified, developed
or disseminated by the Wisconsin Department
of Natural Resources under subchapter V of
chapter NR151, Wis. Adm. Code.
(b) DRAINAGE EASEMENTS. Where a land division
is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream:
1. There shall be provided a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially
to the dimensions of such watercourse
and such further width or construction,
or both, as will be adequate for the purpose
and as may be necessary to comply with this
Section; or
2. The watercourse, drainageway, channel or
stream may be relocated in such a manner that
the maintenance of adequate drainage will be
assured. When channels are relocated, a storm
water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming
to the dimensions of the relocated watercourse,
and such further width for construction,
or both, will be provided. For state designated
navigable streams, such relocations
shall only be in accord with a permit issued by
the DNR; or
3. Wherever possible, drainage shall be maintained
in an easement by an open channel with
vegetated banks and adequate width for maximum
potential volume flow. In all cases, such
easements shall be wide enough to convey the
10-year critical duration storm for the minor
drainage system, and the 100-year critical duration
storm for the major drainage system.
The drainage easement under all circumstances
shall not be less than thirty (30) feet in width.
(c) STORM WATER DISCHARGE QUANTITY.
Unless otherwise provided for in this ordinance, all
land development activities subject to this ordinance
shall establish on-site management practices
to control the peak flow rates of storm water discharged
from the site. Infiltration of storm water
runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, and
landscaped areas shall be incorporated to the maximum
extent practical, as defined by the City Engineer,
to provide volume control in addition to control
of peak flows.
All land development activities subject to this Ordinance
shall establish on-site management practices
to:
1. Requirements for increases of impervious surface
of 0.5 acres or more. Limit the runoff
25
leaving the site to a release rate of less than
0.40 cfs/ac for the one (1) percent probability
event (100-year recurrence interval) and less
than 0.15 cfs/ac for the fifty (50) percent probability
event (2-year recurrence interval).
2. Requirements for redevelopment disturbing
two acres or more. If redevelopment will disturb
two acres or more but will not add 0.5
acres or more of impervious surface, the runoff
release rate shall be reduced by the amount
listed in the following table for the one (1)
percent probability event (100-year recurrence
interval) and the fifty (50) percent probability
event (2-year recurrence interval):
Area Disturbed by Demolition
or Construction
Reduction to the Existing
Runoff Release Rate
Between 2 acres and 3.5 acres 10%
From 3.5 to 5 acres 15%
Greater than 5 acres 20%
3. Requirements for new impervious surface of
5,000 square feet to 0.5 acres.
a. Whenever development or redevelopment
will increase impervious surface by an area
equal to or greater than 5,000 square feet
but less than 21,780 square feet (0.5 acres),
on a net basis, then the development or redevelopment
shall include green infrastructure
with a detention volume equal to onehalf
inch multiplied by the area of the net
new impervious surface, except as provided
is 13.106(c)3.b.
b. If the new impervious surface is within a
residential subdivision for which the City
has approved a storm water management
plan and a storm water management
maintenance agreement, then no additional
storm water runoff management is required.
(d) TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS. BMPs shall be
designed, installed and maintained to control total
suspended solids (TSS) carried in runoff from the
post-construction site as follows:
Note to Users: Under s. 281.33 (6)(a)2., Wis.
Stats., the municipality may enact and enforce
provisions of an ordinance that are stricter than
the TSS performance standards in NR 151, Wis.
Adm. Code, if the stricter provisions are necessary
to comply with federally-approved total maximum
daily load requirements.
1. BMPs shall be designed in accordance with
the following TSS Reduction Standards Table
or to the maximum extent practicable as provided
in Sec. 13.106(d)2. The design shall be
based on an average annual rainfall, as compared
to no runoff management controls.
TSS Reduction Standards
Development Type TSS Reduction
New Development 80 percent
In-fill development 80 percent
Redevelopment
40 percent of load from
parking areas and roads
2. Maximum Extent Practicable. If the design
cannot meet a total suspended solids reduction
performance standard of the TSS Reduction
Standards Table, the storm water management
plan shall include a written, sitespecific
explanation of why the total suspended
solids reduction performance standard
cannot be met and why the total suspended
solids load will be reduced only to the maximum
extent practicable.
Note to Users: Pollutant loading models such
as DETPOND, WinSLAMM, P8 or equivalent
methodology may be used to evaluate the efficiency
of the design in reducing total suspended
solids. Use the most recent version of the
model and the rainfall files and other parameter
files identified for Wisconsin users unless
directed otherwise by the regulatory authority.
3. Off-Site Drainage. When designing BMPs,
runoff draining to the BMP from off-site shall
be taken into account in determining the treatment
efficiency of the practice. Any impact on
the efficiency shall be compensated for by increasing
the size of the BMP accordingly.
(e) DISCHARGE TO WETLANDS. Wetlands shall
be protected from the damaging modifications and
adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated
with new developments. Wetlands delineated
in new developments should be classified into
Category I, II or III according to guidelines established
in the Engineering Design Manual. To
protect the quality of wetlands in the City, the following
criteria will be followed:
1. Increased volumes of storm water shall not be
discharged to high quality wetlands classified
as Category III wetlands in the City of Oak
Creek Storm Water Master Plan or subsequent
City approved studies. Category III wetlands
have vegetation and wildlife communities that
cannot tolerate any discharge of sediment or
pollutants, and cannot tolerate any changes in
water levels.
26
2. Untreated storm water shall not be discharged
to wetlands classified as Category II wetlands
in the City of Oak Creek Storm Water Master
Plan or subsequent City approved studies.
Category II wetlands have vegetation and wildlife
communities that cannot tolerate discharges
of sediment or pollutants without becoming
degraded. Discharge of treated storm water is
allowed to Category II wetlands provided that
inundation of the vegetation is for periods of
less than one week, and that no dredging in the
wetland takes place.
3. Discharge of pretreated storm water is allowed
to wetlands classified as Category I wetlands
identified in the City of Oak Creek Storm Water
Master Plan or subsequent City approved
studies. Category I wetlands have vegetation
that is not impacted by the discharge of pollutants
or impacted by changing water levels.
Category I wetlands can be used for storm water
storage provided the water is pretreated for
sediment removal, and that no dredging in the
wetland takes place.
(f) EXCEPTIONS. The requirements for on-site storm
water management practices established in Sections
13.106 (c) and (d) do not apply to:
1. Areas which are determined by the City Engineer
to be covered by an approved storm water
management plan, which was developed and
approved as an alternative storm water management
planning approach to carrying out onsite
measures consistent with the purpose and
intent of this ordinance. In such cases, the recommendations
of the approved storm water
management plan shall be applied either
through the installation of storm water management
provisions recommended to be included
on the development site being considered
and/or through the payment of a fee as set
forth in Sec. 13.106 (g). These minimum requirements
may also be waived in whole or in
part by the Council upon written request of the
applicant, provided provisions are made to
manage storm water by an off-site facility.
This requires that the off-site facility is in
place, is designed and adequately sized to
provide a level of storm water control that is
equal to or greater than that which would be
afforded by application of the standards of this
ordinance.
2. Residential infill if:
a. The site is five acres or less; and
b. The development is exclusively
residential; and
c. The net increase in the area of impervious
surface is less than 20% of the site; and
d. Each boundary of the site is contiguous to:
1. Sites that contain earlier development
served by sanitary sewers, streets, or
public water supply when the government
unit receives the plans for the
new development; or
2. Parkland, other public land, a utility
right-of-way, or a watercourse.
3. Construction or reconstruction of a public
road or public sidewalk that creates a net increase
of impervious surface by less than 0.5
acres.
4. Recreational trails if:
a. The trail is less than or equal to 10 feet in
width and
b. Has a continuous pervious buffer at least
5 feet wide on each side, disregarding interruption
by streets, driveways, or other
impervious surfaces crossing the trail.
(g) FEE IN LIEU OF ON-SITE STORM WATER
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. If the Council
waives all or part of the minimum on-site storm
water management requirements under Sec.
13.106(c) and (d), or where the waiver is based on
the provision of adequate storm water facilities
provided by the City downstream of the proposed
development, the applicant shall be required to
pay a fee in an amount determined by the Council.
In setting the fee for land development projects,
the Council shall consider an equitable distribution
of the cost of land, engineering design, construction,
and maintenance as set forth in Section
66.0617 of the Wisconsin Statutes.
(h) GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ON-SITE
AND OFF-SITE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
MEASURES. The following considerations
shall be observed in managing storm water
runoff.
1. Natural topography and land cover features
such as natural stream channels, flood plain,
natural depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity,
and natural groundwater recharge areas
shall be preserved and used, to the extent
possible, to meet the requirements of this section.
2. Emergency overland flow for all storm water
facilities shall be considered to prevent exceeding
the capacity of downstream drainage
facilities and prevent endangerment of downstream
property or public safety.
(i) INFILTRATION.
1. Best Management Practices. BMPs shall be
designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate
runoff in accordance with the following
or to the maximum extent practicable:
a. Low imperviousness. For development
up to 40 percent connected imperviousness,
such as parks, cemeteries, and low
density residential development, infiltrate
sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be
at least 90 percent of the pre27
development infiltration volume, based
on an average annual rainfall. However,
when designing appropriate infiltration
systems to meet this requirement, no
more than one percent of the postconstruction
site is required as an effective
infiltration area.
b. Moderate imperviousness. For development
with more than 40 percent and up to
80 percent connected imperviousness,
such as medium and high density residential,
multi-family development, industrial
and institutional development, and office
parks, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume
so that the post-development infiltration
volume shall be at least 75 percent of the
pre-development infiltration volume,
based on an average annual rainfall.
However, when designing appropriate infiltration
systems to meet this requirement,
no more than 2 percent of the postconstruction
site is required as an effective
infiltration area.
c. High imperviousness. For development
with more than 80 percent connected imperviousness,
such as commercial strip
malls, shopping centers, and commercial
downtowns, infiltrate sufficient runoff
volume so that the post-development infiltration
volume shall be at least 60 percent
of the pre-development infiltration
volume, based on an average annual rainfall.
However, when designing appropriate
infiltration systems to meet this requirement,
no more than 2 percent of the
post-construction site is required as an
effective infiltration area.
2. Pre-development. The pre-development condition
shall assume “good hydrologic conditions”
for the appropriate land covers and not
exceed the runoff curve numbers established in
Chapter 4 of the Engineering Design Manual.
3. Source Areas.
a. Prohibitions. Runoff from the following
areas may not be infiltrated and may not
qualify as contributing to meeting the requirements
of this section unless demonstrated
to meet the conditions identified
in Sec. 13.106(i)6.:
i. Areas associated with a tier 1 industrial
facility identified in NR
216.21 (2)(a), Wis. Adm. Code, including
storage, loading and parking.
Rooftops may be infiltrated
with the concurrence of the regulatory
authority.
ii. Storage and loading areas of a tier 2
industrial facility identified in NR
216.21 (2)(b), Wis. Adm. Code.
Note to Users: Runoff from the employee and
guest parking and rooftop areas of a tier 2 facility
may be infiltrated but runoff from the
parking area may require pretreatment.
iii. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas.
Runoff from rooftops of fueling
and vehicle maintenance areas may
be infiltrated with the concurrence of
the regulatory authority.
b. Exemptions. Runoff from the following
areas may be credited toward meeting the
requirement when infiltrated, but the decision
to infiltrate runoff from these
source areas is optional:
i. Parking areas and access roads less
than 5,000 square feet for commercial
development.
ii. Parking areas and access roads less
than 5,000 square feet for industrial
development not subject to the Prohibitions
under par a.
iii. Except as provided under Sec.
13.106(n), redevelopment postconstruction
sites.
iv. In-fill development areas less than 5
acres.
v. Roads on commercial, industrial and
institutional land uses, and arterial
residential roads.
4. Location of Practices.
a. Prohibitions. Infiltration practices may
not be located in the following areas:
i. Areas within 1000 feet upgradient
or within 100 feet downgradient of
direct conduits to groundwater.
ii. Areas within 400 feet of a community
water system well as specified
in NR 811.16(4), Wis. Adm. Code
or within the separation distances
listed in NR 812.08, Wis. Adm.
Code for any private well or noncommunity
well for runoff infiltrated
from commercial, including multi-
family residential, industrial and
institutional land uses or regional
devices for one- and two-family
residential development.
iii. Areas where contaminants of concern,
as defined in NR 720.03 (2),
Wis. Adm. Code, are present in the
soil through which infiltration will
occur.
28
b. Separation distances.
i. Infiltration practices shall be located
so that the characteristics of
the soil and the separation distance
between the bottom of the infiltration
system and the elevation of
seasonal high groundwater or the
top of bedrock are in accordance
with the following table:
ii. Notwithstanding Sec. 13.106(i)4.b.
applicable requirements for injection
wells classified under NR 815, Wis.
Adm. Code shall be followed.
c. Infiltration rate exemptions. Infiltration
practices located in the following areas
may be credited toward meeting the requirements
under the following conditions,
but the decision to infiltrate under
these conditions is optional:
i. Where the infiltration rate of the soil
measured at the proposed bottom of
the infiltration system is less than 0.6
inches per hour using a scientifically
credible field test method.
ii. Where the least permeable soil horizon
to 5 feet below the proposed
bottom of the infiltration system using
the U.S. Department of Agriculture
method of soils analysis is one
of the following: sandy clay loam,
clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy
clay, silty clay, or clay.
5. Alternate Use. Where alternate uses of
runoff are employed, such as for toilet
flushing, laundry, or irrigation or storage on
green roofs where an equivalent portion of
the runoff is captured permanently by rooftop
vegetation, such alternate use shall be
given equal credit toward the infiltration
volume required by this section.
6. Groundwater Standards.
a. Infiltration systems designed in accordance
with this section shall, to the
extent technically and economically
feasible, minimize the level of pollutants
infiltrating to groundwater and
shall maintain compliance with the
preventive action limit at a point of
standards application in accordance
with NR 140, Wis. Adm. Code. However,
if site specific information indicates
that compliance with a preventive
action limit is not achievable, the infiltration
BMP may not be installed or
shall be modified to prevent infiltration
to the maximum extent practicable.
b. Notwithstanding Sec. 13.106(i)6.a., the
discharge from BMPs shall remain below
the enforcement standard at the
point of standards application.
7. Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff,
pretreatment shall be required for parking
lot runoff and for runoff from new road
construction in commercial, industrial and
institutional areas that will enter an infiltration
system. The pretreatment shall be designed
to protect the infiltration system
from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance
and to protect groundwater quality in
accordance with Sec. 13.106(i)6. Pretreatment
options may include, but are not limited
to, oil and grease separation, sedimentation,
biofiltration, filtration, swales or filter
strips.
8. Maximum Extent Practicable. Where the
conditions of Sec. 13.106(i)3, and Sec.
13.106(i)4 limit or restrict the use of infiltration
practices, the performance standard
of Sec. 13.106(i) shall be met to the maximum
extent practicable.
(j) PROTECTIVE AREAS.
1. Definition. In this section, “protective area”
means an area of land that commences
at the top of the channel of lakes, streams
and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of
wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following
widths, as measured horizontally
from the top of the channel or delineated
wetland boundary to the closest impervious
surface. However, in this section, “protective
area” does not include any area of land

species such as reed canary grass;
cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel
pits, or dredged material or fill material
disposal sites that take on the attributes
of a wetland.
g. In Sec. 13.106(j)1.d., Sec.
13.106(j)1.e. and 13.106(j)1.f., determinations
of the extent of the protective
area adjacent to wetlands shall be
made on the basis of the sensitivity and
runoff susceptibility of the wetland in
accordance with the standards and criteria
in NR 103.03, Wis. Adm. Code.
h. Wetland boundary delineation shall be
made in accordance with NR 103.08
(1m), Wis. Adm. Code. This paragraph
does not apply to wetlands that have
been completely filled in compliance
with all applicable state and federal
regulations. The protective area for
wetlands that have been partially filled
in compliance with all applicable state
and federal regulations shall be measured
from the wetland boundary delineation
after a fill has been placed.
Where there is a legally authorized
wetland fill, the protective area standard
need not be met in that location.
i. For concentrated flow channels with
drainage areas greater than 130 acres,
10 feet.
j. Notwithstanding Sec. 13.106(j)1.a.
through 13.106(j)1.i. the greatest protective
area width shall apply where
rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands are
contiguous.
Note to User: A stream or lake is not eligible
for a lower protective area width even if contiguous
to a less susceptible wetland.
2. Applicability. This section applies to
post-construction sites located within a
protective area, except those areas exempted
pursuant to 13.106(j)4.
3. Requirements. The following requirements
shall be met:
a. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out
of the protective area entirely or to
the maximum extent practicable. If
there is no practical alternative to locating
an impervious surface in the
protective area, a minimum 10 feet
wide protective area (without impervious
surface) shall be provided and
the storm water management plan
shall contain a written, site-specific
explanation.
b. Where land disturbing construction
activity occurs within a protective area,
adequate sod or self-sustaining
vegetative cover of 70 percent or
greater shall be established and maintained
where no impervious surface is
present. The adequate sod or selfsustaining
vegetative cover shall be
sufficient to provide for bank stability,
maintenance of fish habitat, and
filtering of pollutants from upslope
overland flow areas under sheet flow
conditions. Non-vegetative materials,
such as rock riprap, may be employed
on the bank as necessary to prevent
erosion such as on steep slopes or
where high velocity flows occur.
Note to Users: It is recommended that seeding
of non-invasive vegetative cover be used in the
protective areas. Some invasive plants that
should not be used are listed in NR 40, Wis.
Adm. Code. Flood and drought-tolerant vegetation
that can provide long-term bank stability
because of an extensive root system is preferable.
Vegetative cover may be measured using
the line transect method described in the
University of Wisconsin extension publication
number A3533, titled “Estimating Residue Using
the Line Transect Method”.
c. BMPs such as filter strips, swales, or
wet detention ponds, that are designed
to control pollutants from non-point
30
sources, may be located in the protective
area.
Note to Users: Other laws, such as ch. 30,
Wis. Stats., and chs. NR 103, 115, 116 and
117, Wis. Adm. Code, and their associated review
and approval processes may apply in the
protective area.
4. Exemptions. This section does not apply
to any of the following:
a. Except as provided under Sec.
13.106(n), redevelopment postconstruction
sites.
b. In-fill development areas less than 5
acres.
c. Structures that cross or access surface
water such as boat landings, bridges,
and culverts.
d. Structures constructed in accordance
with s. 59.692 (1v), Wis. Stats.
e. Areas of post-construction sites from
which the runoff does not enter the
surface water, including wetlands,
without first being treated by a BMP
to meet the local ordinance requirements
for total suspended solids and
peak flow reduction, except to the extent
that vegetative ground cover is
necessary to maintain bank stability.
Note to Users: A vegetated protective area to
filter runoff pollutants from post-construction
sites described in par. (e) is not necessary
since the runoff at that location is treated prior
to entering the surface water. Other practices
necessary to meet the requirements of this
section, such as a swale or pond, will need to
be designed and implemented to reduce runoff
pollutants prior to runoff entering a surface
water of the state.
(k) FUELING AND VEHICLE MAINTENANCE
AREAS. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas
shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have
BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce
petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that
enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum
sheen.
(l) ALTERNATE REQUIREMENTS. The City Engineer
may establish storm water management requirements
more stringent than those set forth in
Section 13.106 if the City Engineer determines that
the capacity of downstream drainage systems may
be exceeded or an added level of protection is
needed to protect sensitive resources.
(m) SWALE TREATMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION
FACILITIES.
1. Requirement. Except as provided in Sec.
13.106(m)2., transportation facilities that use
swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant
removal are exempt from the requirements of
local ordinance requirements for total suspended
solids control, and infiltration, if the
swales are designed to do all of the following
or to the maximum extent practicable:
a. Swales shall be vegetated. However,
where appropriate, non-vegetative
measures may be employed to prevent
erosion or provide for runoff treatment,
such as rock riprap stabilization or check
dams.
Note to Users: It is preferred that tall and
dense vegetation be maintained within the
swale due to its greater effectiveness at enhancing
runoff pollutant removal.
b. Swales shall comply with sections
V.F. (Velocity and Depth) and V.G.
(Sale Geometry Criteria) with a swale
treatment length as long as that specified
in section V.C. (Pre-Treatment)
of the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources technical standard 1005
“Vegetated Infiltration Swales”, dated
May 2007, or a superseding document.
Transportation facility swale
treatment does not have to comply
with other sections of technical standard
1005.
2. Other requirements.
a. Notwithstanding Sec. 13.106(m)1.,
the City Engineer may, consistent
with water quality standards, require
that other requirements, in addition to
swale treatment, be met on a transportation
facility with an average daily
traffic rate greater than 2,500 and
where the initial surface water of the
state that the runoff directly enters is
one of the following:
i. An outstanding resource water.
ii. An exceptional resource water.
iii. Waters listed in section 303 (d)
of the Federal Clean Water Act
that are identified as impaired in
whole or in part, due to nonpoint
source impacts.
iv. Water where targeted performance
standards are developed
pursuant to NR 151.004, Wis.
Adm. Code.
b. The transportation facility authority
shall contact the City Engineer to determine
if additional BMPs beyond a
water quality swale are needed under
this subsection.
31
(n) MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT. For redevelopment
sites where the redevelopment will be replacing
older development that was subject to postconstruction
performance standards of NR 151,
Wis. Adm. Code in effect on or after October 1,
2004, the responsible party shall meet the total suspended
solids reduction, peak flow control, infiltration,
and protective areas standards applicable to
the older development or meet the redevelopment
standards of this ordinance, whichever is more
stringent.

that the proposed modifications be submitted
for approval prior to incorporation into
the storm water management plan and implementation.
6. The permit holder shall maintain all storm water
management practices specified in the approved
storm water management plan until the
practices either become the responsibility of
the City, or are transferred to subsequent private
owners as specified in the approved
maintenance agreement.
7. The permit holder authorizes the City to perform
any work or operations necessary to bring
storm water management practices into conformance
with the approved storm water management
plan, and to charge such costs against
any performance bond or cash bond posted for
the project.
8. The permit holder shall provide a written guarantee
for all structural storm water management
practices dedicated to the City, installed
as part of the storm water plan and accepted by

to public right-of-ways, wetlands or
drainageways including but not limited to any
ditch, channel, creek, river or storm sewer pipe
line whether natural or manmade. If a proposed
storm water management plan does not
discharge to a public right-of-way, wetland or
drainageway and involves significant changes
in the direction of drainage (creates an increase
in the peak rate of runoff), the permittee shall
make appropriate arrangements with downstream
property owners between the site discharge
and the receiving public right-of-way,
wetland or drainageway concerning the prevention
of endangerment to downstream property
or public safety. It shall be the responsibility
of the developer to obtain from adjacent

Ordinance # 2734 A 9/17/14 Sec. 14.40(c)
SEC. 14.41 LAND SUITABILITY.
(a) Suitability. No land shall be subdivided for residential,
commercial or industrial use which is held
unsuitable for such use by the Common Council,
upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission,
for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse
soil or rock formation, unfavorable topograCity
of Oak Creek
9
phy or any other feature likely to be harmful to the
health, safety, or welfare of the future residents of
the proposed subdivision or of the community. The
Common Council, in applying the provisions of
this Section, shall in writing recite the particular
facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the
land is not suitable for residential use and afford
the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence
regarding such unsuitability if he so desires. Thereafter
the Common Council, upon the recommendation
of the Plan Commission, may affirm, modify,
or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.
(b) Existing Flora. The subdivider shall make every
effort to protect and retain all existing trees, shrubbery,
vines, and grasses not actually lying in public
roadways, drainageways, building foundation sites,
private driveways, soil absorption waste disposal
areas, paths, and trails. Such trees are to be protected
and preserved during construction in accordance
with sound conservation practices, possibly
including the preservation of trees by well islands
or retaining walls whenever abutting grades
are altered, pursuant to a landscaping plan filed by
the subdivider.
SEC. 14.42 CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENTS.
(a) Purpose.
(1) The Common Council hereby finds that certain
issues arise in condominium developments
that require limited applicability of
this Chapter to condominium developments.
The State Legislature has recognized that
subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums
but that subdivision ordinances
shall not impose burdens upon condominiums
that are different from those imposed
on other property of a similar character
not subject to a declaration of condominium.
(2) The factor that makes this Chapter applicable
to a condominium development is the creation
of multiple, distinct property entities at
or near the ground surface, subject to property
taxation as separate “parcels,” with each
property entity having different ownership
and management. The City determines that
this factor makes a condominium development
dissimilar, both physically and in ownership,
from developments in which the land
and improvements are under unitary ownership,
management, and control.
(3) Thus, the Common Council hereby finds that
new condominium developments can place
impacts on community resources in the same
manner as other new developments which
are characterized by division of land into
lots. These impacts include:
a. Additional population density.
b. Possibility of use of particular land in a
manner unsuitable to the land’s characteristics.
c. Additional demands upon City area
parks, recreation areas, utility facilities
and schools.
d. Additional traffic and street use.
(b) Exceptions. This Section shall not apply to the following
condominiums:
(1) Any condominium plat recorded prior to the
effective date of this Chapter.
(2) Any conversion of a structure or structures in
existence on the effective date of this Chapter
to a condominium after the effective date
of this Chapter.
SEC. 14.43 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
(a) Dedications.
(1) Effect of Recording on Dedications. When
any plat is certified, signed, acknowledged
and recorded as prescribed by Chapter 236,
Wis. Stats., every donation to grant to the
public or any person, society or corporation
marked or noted as such on said plat shall be
deemed a sufficient conveyance to vest the
fee simple of all parcels of land so marked or
noted, and shall be considered a general warranty
against such donors, their heirs and assigns
to the said donees for their use for the
purposes therein expressed and no other; and
the land intended for the streets, alleys, ways,
commons or other public uses as designated
on said plat shall be held by the City, in
which said plat is situated in trust to and for
such uses and purposes.
(2) Dedications to Public Accepted by Approval.
When a final plat of a subdivision has
been approved by the City and all other required
approvals are obtained and the plat is
recorded, such approval shall constitute an
acceptance for the purpose designated on the
plat of the uses of all lands shown thereon as
dedicated to the public, including street dedications.
(b) Adoption of More Restrictive Provisions. To accomplish
the purposes of this Chapter, inasmuch as
the City has established a planning agency, the
Common Council pursuant to Sec. 236.45, Wis.
Stats., adopts additional platting requirements
which are deemed more restrictive than the general
provisions of said statutes and no plat shall be approved
by the Common Council, nor shall the
same be entitled to be recorded unless said plat
complies with such additional requirements as may
appear in this Chapter.
City of Oak Creek
10
(c) Inspection of Public Improvements Within
Subdivision. All required land improvements to be
installed under the provisions of this Chapter shall
be subject to inspection at all times by the City Engineer
or other authorized person or department
and no underground improvements shall be covered
unless this subdivider, his agents, servants or
contractors shall have first obtained permission to
cover any underground installation from the department
authorized to make such inspection.
(d) Building Permit. No building permit shall be issued
by any governing official for the construction
of any building, structure or improvement to land
or any lot within a subdivision or other land division
as defined herein which has been approved for
platting or dividing until all requirements of this
Chapter have been fully complied with and until a
contract has been awarded for the construction of
all such improvements. All building permits shall
be subject to the approval of the Building Commissioner,
City Engineer, Director of Community Development
and City Clerk.
(e) Occupancy Permit. No occupancy permit shall be
granted by any governing official for the use of any
structure within a subdivision approved for platting
or replatting until required utility and public improvement
facilities have been installed, made
ready to service the property and approved by the
City and that roadways providing access to the
subject lot or lots have been constructed or are in
the course of construction and are suitable for vehicular
traffic.

of any objection based upon failure of
the plat to comply with the statutes or rules
which its examination is authorized to cover,
or, if all objections have been satisfied, it
shall so certify on the face of a copy of the
plat and return that copy to the approving authority
from which it was received. The plat
shall not be approved or deemed approved
until any objections have been satisfied. If
the objecting agency fails to act within the
twenty (20) day limit, it shall be deemed to
have no objection to the plat. The recommendations
of City agencies shall also be
transmitted to the Plan Commission within
twenty (20) days from the date the plat is
filed.
SEC. 14.62 PRELIMINARY PLAT REVIEW AND
APPROVAL.
(a) Official Approval. The Plan Commission shall,
within ninety (90) days of the submission of the
preliminary plat to said body, review the plat and
negotiate with the subdivider on changes deemed
advisable, and approve, approve conditionally or
reject the plat. In the event that the location of the
streets within a proposed preliminary plat would
make a principal structure on land that adjoins or
abuts any street within the preliminary plat nonconforming
as to setback, the Common Council
shall have approval authority over the preliminary
plat, subject to the recommendation of the Plan
Commission. In that event, the Common Council

filing of additional preliminary plats regardless
of whether the first one has been approved.
(2) The subdivider may resubmit to the City
Clerk corrected copies of the rejected plat.
(c) Effect of Preliminary Plat Approval. Approval
or conditional approval of a Preliminary Plat shall
not constitute automatic approval of the Final Plat.
Conditional approval may be granted subject to
satisfactory compliance with pertinent provisions
of this Chapter and Chapter 236, Wis. Stats. The
Preliminary Plat shall be deemed an expression of
approval or conditional approval of the layout
submitted as a guide to the preparation of the Final
Plat, which will be subject to further consideration
by the Plan Commission and Common Council at
the time of its submission.
(d) Preliminary Plat Amendment. Should the subdivider
desire to amend the Preliminary Plat as approved,
he may resubmit the amended plat which
shall follow the same procedure outlined herein,

Deeds, said plat shall be reapproved by the Common
Council. No Final Plats shall be reapproved
by the Common Council following the expiration
of the six (6) month period. Such plats shall be
submitted as a new plat. All previous approvals
shall be null and void and shall have no further
bearing on the subsequent review and approval of
the plat by the City.
SEC. 14.65 DETERMINATION OF ADEQUACY
OF PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES.

land division in accordance with the
Official Map and City Standards.
(d) Where the Plan Commission and the Common
Council determine that one (1) or more public facilities
or services are not adequate for the proposed
development, but that a portion of the area
could be served adequately, or that careful phasing
of the development could result in all public facilities
and public services being adequate, conditional
approval may include only such portions or may
specify phasing of the development.
(e) No land shall be divided which has been officially
mapped as a public lands storm water management
facility or is determined by the Common Council
to be unsuitable for use by reason of flooding, bad
drainage, soil or rock formations with severe limitations

in terms of grid bearing and distance;
and the material and Wisconsin state plane
coordinates of the monument marking the relocated
section or quarter corner to which the
plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. The
grid bearing and distance of the tie shall be
determined by a closed survey meeting the
error of closure herein specified for the survey
of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision.
(g) Surveying and Monumenting. All Final Plats
shall meet all the surveying and monumenting requirements
of Section 236.15, Wis. Stats.
(h) State Plane Coordinate System. Where the plat is
located within a quarter section, the corners of
which have been relocated, monumented and coorCity
of Oak Creek
19
dinated by the City, the plat shall be tied directly to
one of the section or quarter corners so relocated,
monumented and coordinated. The exact grid bearing
and distance of such tie shall be determined by
field measurements, and the material and Wisconsin
state plane coordinates of the monument marking
the relocated section or quarter corner to which
the plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. All
distances and bearings shall be referenced to the
Wisconsin Coordinate System, South Zone, and
adjusted to the City’s control survey.

(a) General Requirement.
(1) In accordance with the authority granted by
Sec. 236.13 of the Wisconsin Statutes, the
City of Oak Creek hereby requires that the
subdivider shall install all public improvements
required by this Chapter prior to approval
of the Final Plat. As a further condition
of approval, the Common Council hereby
requires that the subdivider be responsible
for the cost of any necessary alterations of
any existing utilities which, by virtue of the
platting or certified survey map, fall within
the public right-of-way.
(2) As a condition for the acceptance of dedication
of public rights-of-way, the City requires
that the public ways have been previously
provided with all necessary facilities
constructed to City specifications, including,
but not limited to, sewerage, storm drainage,
water mains and services, grading and improvement
of the streets and other public
ways, sidewalks, street signing, street lighting
and such other facilities required by the

have been established by the City Engineer and
adopted by the Common Council. The improvements
shall be made in accordance with established
engineering practices, approved prior to the start of
construction by the City Engineer. The “Engineering
Design Manual” is the principal source that establishes
the requirements. When new or revised
standards and/or specifications have been adopted
by the City, work on public improvements not begun
within eighteen (18) months of the date of the
development agreement shall be made to the new
or revised standards and/or specifications. The City
Engineer shall review and approve the construction
plans, specifications and calculations for the construction
of the required public improvements.
(c) Project Manager. The subdivider shall designate
a project manager who shall be readily available on
the project site during the construction of the required
public improvements. The project manager
shall be granted authority on behalf of the subdivider
to make decisions related to the construction
of the required public improvements as they may
arise during the course of the construction. The
project manager shall also be responsible for the
scheduling and coordination of the required work
to construct the required improvements. Correspondence
with or verbal orders to the designated
project manager shall have the same authority as
with the subdivider directly.
(d) Responsibility for Improvements. The installation
of all public improvements shall either be administered
by the Engineering Division of the Public
Works Department through the public bidding
and contracting process, or shall be by the developer
under private contract, as authorized by the
Common Council. Payment for the cost of such installations
by the owner shall be assured by the
submittal of a letter of escrow, cash bond or other
financial guarantee acceptable to the City Attorney.
SEC. 14.101 REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT
AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR PROPER INSTALLATION
OF IMPROVEMENTS; SURETY.
(a) Development Agreement. The subdivider shall be
required to enter into a development agreement
with the City for land division improvements, by
agreeing to install the required public improvements
as herein provided before the submission
and final approval of any plat. The agreement form
shall be provided by the City and may provide for
a phasing of public improvements construction,
providing such phasing is approved by the Common
Council. The City reserves the right to control
the phasing through limits, sequence, and/or additional
surety so as to provide for continuity of
streets, sewers, water mains, and other necessary
public improvements within and between the phases.
(b) Financial Guarantees.
(1) If the installation of public improvements is
administered by the City, the subdivider shall
file, subject to the approval of the City Attorney,
a certified check, or other form of financial
guarantee as approved by the City
Attorney, in an amount equal to one hundred
fifteen percent (115%) of the estimate of the
cost of improvements, as determined by the
City Engineer.
(2) The subdivider may elect to install the improvements
in construction phases provided
that:
a. The phases are specified in the development
agreement for land division improvements;
b. A subsequent phase shall not be commenced
until completion of improvements
of all prior phases, except with express
written authorization of the City
Engineer.
c. The subdivider minimize grading and
other disturbances to lands included in
City of Oak Creek
21
future construction phases in order to
prevent erosion; and
d. Erosion control plans and measures submitted
and approved herein shall address
the individual phases of construction.
(3) The time limit for completion of a phased
improvement program shall take into account
the needs and desires of the City and
adjacent property owners for street and other
improvements to serve lands adjacent to and
within the land division.
(4) As work progresses on installation of improvements
constructed as part of the agreement,
the City Engineer, upon written request
from the subdivider from time to time,
is authorized to recommend to the City a reduction
in the amount of surety as hereinafter
provided. When portions of construction
(water, sanitary sewer, street, sidewalk,
greenway or other improvements) are completed
by the subdivider and determined acceptable
by the City Engineer, he is authorized,
in his sole discretion, upon submission
of lien waivers by the subdivider’s contractors,
to reduce the amount of surety. The
amount of surety remaining shall be equal to
one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of
the estimate of the City Engineer of costs of
work remaining to be completed and accepted
and to insure performance of the one (1)
year guarantee as specified in Subsection (d)
below against defects in workmanship and
materials on work accepted. As a further
guarantee that all obligations under contract
for work on the development are satisfied,
the contractor and subcontractors who are to
be engaged in the construction of utilities or
street improvements on the street right-ofway
to be dedicated shall be pre-qualified for
such work by the City Engineer prior to
commencing construction.
(5) The subdivider shall agree in the development
agreement to pay all City legal fees,
City engineering fees, City administrative
fees, street and sidewalk assessments, specifically
all area charges for sanitary sewer
mains and all water main assessments, including
where the land division abuts existing
streets which are not improved within the
City standard street improvements (including,
but not limited to curb and gutter, local
storm sewer, sidewalks and an asphaltic concrete
or Portland cement concrete pavement).
(c) Waiver of Special Assessment Notice and Hearing.
The subdivider shall file with said agreement,
subject to the approval of the City Attorney, a
waiver of special assessment notices and hearings
such that the subdivider, his heirs and assigns (including
purchasers of property from the subdivider),
waive notice and hearing for and authorize the
assessment for any and all of the required public
improvements in phases of the land division intended
for future development in accordance with
Sec. 66.60(18), Wis. Stats.
(d) Improvement Guarantee. If within one (1) year
after the date of final acceptance of any public improvement
by the Common Council (or such longer
period of time as may be prescribed by laws or
regulations or by the terms of any special guarantee
required by the terms of said contract as may be
necessary due to the phasing of the construction of
public improvements), any work on any public improvement
is found to be defective, the subdivider
shall remove it and replace it with nondefective
work in accordance with written instructions given
by the City Engineer. If the subdivider does not
promptly comply with the terms of such instructions,
or in an emergency where delay would cause
serious risk of loss or damage, the City may cause
the removal and replacement of said defective
work and charge all direct, indirect and consequential
costs of such removal and replacement to the
improvement guarantee instrument.
(e) Survey Monumentation. Before final approval of
any plat or certified survey within the corporate
limits of the City, the subdivider shall install monuments
placed in accordance with the requirements
of Chapter 236, Wis. Stats., or as may be required
by the City Engineer. All survey monumentation
located adjacent to street or public rights-of-way,
but not located within street pavement, shall be
protected with steel fence posts erected near the
survey monumentation. When the land division includes
an established one-half (1/2), one quarter
(1/4), one quarter-one quarter (1/4-1/4), or other
such section monument, the established monument
shall be preserved and/or fully restored by the subdivider
at his cost.
(f) Future Public Improvements. Where the map area
is located such that it is impractical to install full
public improvements at the time of its development,
those further improvements will be installed
in future years. These may include, but not be limited
to, sanitary sewer and laterals, watermain and
laterals, storm sewer, storm channels, storm laterals,
downstream storm drainage improvements,
street paving, curb and gutter, sidewalk and street
lights. The financing of the cost of said future improvements
shall be accomplished by the applicable
special assessment laws, regulations and rates
in effect at the time of installation. The Developer

costs advanced by him on or before the 31st
day of March following the end of the calendar
year in which the oversizing costs are incurred.
(2) Where a public improvement, financed by
the owner, is assessed to other benefiting
property owners, he shall be reimbursed for
such assessment. Said reimbursement shall
be paid by the City to the developer in full
on or before the 31st day of March following
the end of the calendar year in which an immediate
or deferred assessment becomes due
and payable; but in no event shall such reimbursement
in full by any later than ten (10)
years subsequent to the City’s approval of
the agreement, all in accordance with requirements
of this Code of Ordinances.
(h) Payment of Outstanding Special Assessments.
Any special assessment previously levied for public
improvements fronting the map area shall be
paid in accord with the respective Common Council
resolution authorizing said improvements and
financing thereof by the special assessment process.
Where authorized, such payments may be
made under the installment plan.
(i) Deed Restrictions. The owner or developer shall
prepare and submit, for review and approval by the
City, a draft of deed restrictions governing the proposed
parcel(s). The City shall record the Cityapproved
deed restrictions with the Register of
Deeds for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin prior to
the sale and/or the building upon, whichever occurs
first, of the proposed parcels. “Developer,” as

of home construction and/or lot grading
or improvements as may be caused by said
developer or his contractors while working
or traversing within the certified survey map
limits or on an adjacent parcel or within the
abutting street right-of-way.
(4) Prior to issuance of a building permit for
each respective parcel, the developer, owner
or builder shall obtain a permit from the
City, County, or State Highway Department,
for installation of a driveway culvert along
the respective City street, county road, or
state highway abutting the map area. Such
permit must be accompanied by the appropriate
fee to the respective highway department
for labor and material provided. The
culvert shall be installed prior to issuance of
the building permit.
(5) All electric, telephone and cable television
services on the parcels shall be via underground
service lines.
(6) The property owner of said parcels shall
submit with his building permit application a
certified plat of survey indicating existing

required by the Council in conformance with the
Engineering Design Manual.
(b) Extra-Sized Sidewalks. Wider-than-standard
sidewalks may be required by the Common Council
in the vicinity of schools and commercial areas;
and the Common Council may require the construction
of sidewalks in locations other than required
under the preceding provisions of this Section
if such walks are necessary, in their opinion,
for safe and adequate pedestrian circulation.
(c) Location. The subdivider shall be required to provide
sidewalks and bikeways where required to
City specifications as follows: Sidewalks and
bikeways shall normally be located as far from the
traffic lane as is possible, but not closer than six (6)
inches to the right-of-way line. Where, as a result
of such major obstructions as large and established
trees, steep hills, drainageways, or major utility
lines, the construction costs of the sidewalk or
bikeway in its normal location would be prohibitive,
sidewalks or bikeways may be located elsewhere
within the street right-of-way, or within an
easement, with the approval of the City Engineer.
Sidewalks and bikeways constructed at street intersections
or within five (5) feet of a legal crosswalk
shall include provisions for curb ramping as required
by Sec. 66.625, Wis. Stats., and in accordance
with City standards. In all cases where the
grades of sidewalks or bikeways have not been
specifically fixed by ordinance, the sidewalks and
bikeways shall be laid to the established grade of
the street [Ref. Sec. 66.615(2), Wis. Stats.].
(d) Bikeways.
(1) Bikeways shall be designed to serve both
pedestrian and bicycle traffic in high traffic
areas.
(2) Bikeways may be installed in lieu of sidewalks.

(a) Utility Easements. The Common Council, on the
recommendation of appropriate departments, utilities
and agencies serving the City, shall require
utility easements for poles, wire, conduits, storm
and sanitary sewers, water and other utility lines. It
is the intent of this Chapter to protect all established
easements so as to assure proper grade, assure
maintenance of the established grade, prohibit
construction of permanent fences or retaining walls
over underground installation and prevent the
planting of trees in the easement area. Such easements
shall be established at the rear of each lot
and along such other lot lines as to provide continuity
or alignment from block to block. At deflection
points in these easements, if overhead utility
lines are contemplated, additional easements shall
be established for pole-line anchors.
(b) Drainage Easements. Drainage easements shall
comply with the requirements of Section
13.106(b).
(c) Easement Locations.
(1) Utility easements shall be at least twelve (12)
feet wide, or wider where recommended by
the City Engineer. Evidence shall be furnished
to the Plan Commission that easements
and any easement provisions to be incorporated
in the plat or in deeds have been
reviewed by the individual utility companies
or the organization responsible for furnishing
the services involved.
(2) All easements dedicated on final plat or certified
survey maps for poles, cables or conduits
for electricity, telephone or other private
utility lines shall be noted thereon as
“Utility Easement”. All easements for storm
and sanitary sewers, water and force mains,
pedestrian walks and other public purposes
shall be noted thereon as “Public Easement
for” followed by reference to the use or uses
for which they are intended.
(d) Deed Restrictions for Easements. Deed restrictions
shall accompany each final plat or certified
survey map, and shall be filed in the Register
of Deeds office. In addition to whatever else may
be contained therein, such restrictions shall describe
the location and width of utility and public
easements which are being established; a description
by reference to the final plat or certified survey
map shall suffice. Such restrictions shall further recite
that the utility companies and the public agencies
using such easements are granted the right to
place, and shall state that the elevation of such
easements as graded by the subdivider may not be
altered thereafter by him, or any subsequent landowner
by more than six (6) inches.
SEC. 14.113 OVER-SIZING AND OFF-SITE FACILITIES.
(a) Design Capacity. All improvements within or entering
or leaving the proposed development shall
be installed to satisfy the service requirements for
the entire service or drainage area in which the development
is located and the improvements shall
be of sufficient capacity to handle the expected development
of the overall service area involved.
(b) Mains of Large Capacity. Where sanitary sewer
mains and water mains of larger capacity than normally
necessary are required by the overall system
plan to serve the subdivision as delineated in the
preliminary plat, the subdivider shall be required to
pay for the proportionate benefit of the installation
to his subdivision as established by the Council in
the City’s oversizing policy.
(c) Lift Stations. Where sanitary or storm sewer lift
stations and force mains are required to lift sewage
or clear water to the gravity system, the subdivider
shall have plans, profiles, specifications and estimated
operation and maintenance costs prepared
for the installation of such facilities to the City Engineer’s
requirements. Equipment similar to existing
City equipment shall be utilized whenever possible.
The installation, inspection, supervision and
engineering fees for lift stations and/or force mains
shall be paid for by the subdivider unless otherwise
determined and agreed upon by the Common

Common Council by adoption of a resolution accepting
such dedication. Improvements shall be
dedicated to the City free and clear of any encumbrances.
The subdivider shall be responsible for
and liable for the maintenance, safety and operation
of all required public improvements until such
time as the improvements are accepted by the
Common Council by resolution. In the event the
City must take measures to maintain, operate or
make safe a public improvement existing or required
as a result of the land division but which has
not yet been accepted by the City, the costs of such
measures shall hereby be determined to be Cityincurred
costs to be reimbursed to the City by the
subdivider in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter.
(b) Inspection and Certification of Improvements.
(1) After any of the following increments of the
required improvements have been installed
and completed, the subdivider shall notify
the City Engineer, in writing, that the work is
complete and ready for final inspection, shall
file reproducible record drawings of the
completed improvements and shall file lien
waivers or affidavits, in a form acceptable to
the City Engineer and approved by the City
Attorney, evidencing that there are no
claims, actions or demands for damages,
based upon contract or tort arising out of or
in any way related to the project and that no
moneys are owned to any surveyor, mechanic,

DESIGN STANDARDS
SEC. 14.120 GENERAL STREET DESIGN
STANDARDS.
(a) Compliance with Statutes. In laying out a certified
survey map or subdivision, the owner shall
conform to the provisions of Chapter 236, Wis.
Stats., and all applicable City regulations, including
the Engineering Design Manual as published by
the City. In all cases where the requirements of this
Chapter are different from the requirements of
Chapter 236, the more restrictive provision shall
apply.
(b) Dedication. The subdivider shall dedicate land and
improve streets as provided in this Chapter and
Section 14.103. Streets shall be located with due
regard for topographical conditions, natural features,
existing and proposed streets, utilities and
land uses and public convenience and safety.
Streets shall conform to official maps adopted by
the Common Council. The subdivision or certified
survey map shall be so designed as to provide each
lot with satisfactory access to a public street or
road.
(c) Compliance with Comprehensive Plan and Ordinances.
(1) The arrangement, character, features, and
layout of land divisions in the City of Oak
Creek shall be designed to comply with the
standards of this Chapter, the Comprehensive
Plan, the Official Map, and/or
any comprehensive utility plans and the Engineering
Design Manual or other planning
documents which may pertain to the standards
of design for land divisions and which
have been adopted by the Common Council.
In the absence of a street being shown on the
Official Map, streets shall be provided in locations
determined necessary by the City
Engineer and to the right-of-way widths required
in this Chapter for the classification of
street required.
(2) The arrangement, character, extent, width,
grade, and location of all streets shall conform
to City master plans, the Official Map,
the Engineering Design Manual, this Chapter,
and other City planning documents, and
shall be considered in their relation to: existing
and planned streets, reasonable circulation
of traffic, topographical conditions,
run-off of storm water, public convenience
and safety, and in their appropriate relation
to the proposed uses of the land to be served
by such streets. The Common Council may
deny a Certified Survey Map, or a Preliminary
or Final Plat if the location of the streets
within the Certified Survey Map or plat
would make a principal structure on land that
adjoins or abuts any street within the plat or
Certified Survey Map nonconforming as to
setback.
(3) The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
shall make provision for the appropriate
continuation at the same or greater
width of the existing streets in adjoining areas.
(4) Collector streets shall be properly related to
the arterial highway and to the mass transportation
system, to special traffic generators
such as schools, churches and shopping centers,
and to the major streets into which they
connect.
(5) Minor streets shall be designed to reasonably
conform to the topography to discourage use
by through traffic, to permit efficient storm
and sanitary sewerage systems, and to require
the minimum street area necessary to
provide safe and convenient access to abutting
property.
(6) Proposed streets shall be extended to the
boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided,
unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions or unless in the opinion
of the Plan Commission such extension is
not necessary or desirable for the coordination
of the layout of the subdivision or for
the advantageous development of the adjacent
tracts.
(d) Areas Not Covered by Official Map or Plan. In
areas not covered by an Official Map, the layout of
streets shall conform to the plan for the most advantageous
development of adjoining areas of the
neighborhood. Streets shall be designed and located
in relation to existing and officially planned
streets, topography and natural terrain, streams and
lakes and existing tree growth, public convenience
and safety and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed use of the land to be served by such
streets.
(e) Arterial Streets and Highways. Provisions shall
be made for serving lots for residential use abutting
major streets and highways by either the use of
marginal access streets; backing lots to the primary
street with a screen planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation along the rear property line; or
deeper lots fronting on the primary street with rear
service alleys. These methods are recommended
for the purpose of providing adequate protection of
residential properties and to afford separation of
through and local traffic.
(f) Width. The right-of-way widths shall be of the
width specified on the Official Map or Master
City of Oak Creek
29
Plan, or if no width is specified there, they shall be
not less than the width specified below:
(1) Arterial Street. One hundred twenty (120)
feet.
(2) Collector Street. Eighty (80) feet.
(3) Minor Street. Sixty (60) feet.
(4) Half Street. One-half (1/2) total right-of-way
of proposed street.
(5) Cul-de-Sac Street. Sixty (60) feet.
(6) Marginal Access Street. Thirty (30) feet.
(7) West Grays Lane from South 27th Street to
South 20th Street. Fifty (50) feet.
(8) One-way Streets in Residential Planned Development
District. Fifty (50) feet
(g) Alignment. Horizontal and vertical alignment of
all streets shall conform to the Engineering Design
Manual.
(h) Cul-de-sac or Dead End Streets.
(1) Temporary Cul-de-sacs. A temporary cul-desac
with a minimum pavement diameter of
seventy-five (75) feet shall be installed for
each dead end street in excess of two hundred
(200) feet measured from the street of
origin to the end of its right-of-way. If each
side of a dead end street not requiring a culde-
sac abuts one (1) lot only, the driveway
for such lot shall be located to exit onto the
street of origin. If either side of said dead
end street abuts two (2) lots, the driveway for
the lot nearest the dead end shall be located
within the first thirty (30) feet nearest the
street of origin. Cul-de-sac streets shall be
not more than five hundred (500) feet in
length measured along their center lines from
the streets of origin to the ends of their rightof-
way unless there are not more than fifteen
(15) lots abutting the cul-de-sac.
(2) Permanent Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sac streets
shall be not more than five hundred (500)
feet in length measured along their center
lines from the streets of origin to the ends of

terminus point of existing sanitary sewer,
watermain or storm sewer, only if the
sanitary sewer, watermain and storm
sewer laterals are installed in a perpendicular
manner from the proposed principal
building to the street right-of-way
or proposed street rights-of-way as depicted
in Figure 1 (see appendix at the
end of this chapter).
b. A building permit shall be issued for one
residential principal building proposed to
be built beyond the terminus point of an
existing street or beyond the terminus
point of an existing sanitary sewer, watermain
or storm sewer only if a temporary
cul-de-sac is installed with the terminus
point of the proposed cul-de-sac
installed at least seventy-five (75) feet
from the terminus of the existing pavement
or to a point perpendicular to the
midpoint of the proposed principal building,
whichever is greater, as depicted in
Figure 2 (see appendix at the end of this
chapter).
c. A building permit shall not be issued for
a second residential principal building
which is proposed to be built across the
street from a principal building as described
in sub. (a) and (b) unless all public
improvements including paved streets,
storm sewer or other storm drainage facility,
sanitary sewer and watermain are
installed across the entire frontage of the
lot or parcel on which the building is located,
or across the minimum lot frontage
for the zoning district in which the property
is located, whichever is less, provided
that a temporary cul-de-sac is installed
in accordance with sub. (b), as depicted
in Figure 3 (see appendix at the end of
this chapter).
d. If in the judgement of the City Engineer
a physical feature that exists beyond the
terminus of the new pavement, described
in sub. (c), prevents this pavement from
being extended further, the temporary
cul-de-sac described in sub. (c) may, at
the discretion of the Plan Commission
and Common Council, be required to be
a permanent cul-de-sac, as depicted in
Figure 4 (see appendix at the end of this
chapter).
(i) Half Streets. Where a half street exists adjacent to
the subdivision, the other half of the street shall be
dedicated by the subdivider. Platting of new half
streets along property lines shall not be permitted
except by approval of the Plan Commission.
(j) Intersections.
(1) Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and not more than two (2) streets
shall intersect at one (1) point unless approved
by the Plan Commission.
City of Oak Creek

(2) Street jogs with center line offsets of less
than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall
be avoided. Where streets intersect major
streets, their alignment shall be continuous.
(k) Street Names. New street names shall not duplicate
the names of existing streets, but streets that
are continuations of others already in existence and
named shall bear the names of the existing streets.
Continuous streets that change directions shall be
given a distinct street name for each street segment
of a different direction. Street names shall be subject
to approval by the Plan Commission.
(l) Limited Access Highway and Railroad Rightof-
way Treatment. Whenever the proposed subdivision
contains or is adjacent to a limited access
highway, arterial street or railroad right-of-way, the
design shall provide the following treatment:
(1) Subdivision Lots. When lots within the proposed
subdivision back upon the right-ofway
of an existing or proposed limited access
highway or a railroad, a planting strip at
least thirty (30) feet in depth shall be provided
adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition
to the normal lot depth. This strip shall
be part of the platted lots but shall have the
following restriction lettered on the face of
the plat: “This strip reserved for the planting
of trees and shrubs, the building of structures
or use for vehicular access hereon prohibited.”
(2) Commercial and Industrial Districts. Commercial
and industrial districts shall have
provided, on each side of the limited access
highway, arterial street or railroad, streets
approximately parallel to and at a suitable
distance from such highway or railroad for
the appropriate use of the land between such
streets and highway or railroad, but not less
than one hundred fifty (150) feet.
(3) Streets Parallel to a Limited Access Highway.
Streets parallel to a limited access
highway or railroad right-of-way, when intersecting
a major street and highway or collector
street which crosses said railroad or
highway, shall be located at a minimum distance
of two hundred fifty (250) feet from
said highway or railroad right-of-way. Such
distance, where desirable and practicable,
shall be determined with due consideration
of the minimum distance required for the future
separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.
(4) Minor Streets. Minor streets immediately adjacent
and parallel to railroad rights-of-way
shall be avoided, and location of minor
streets immediately adjacent to arterial

VARIATIONS; PENALTIES AND
VIOLATIONS
SEC. 14.180 VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
(a) Where the subdivider alleges that extraordinary
hardships or particular difficulties may result from
strict compliance with these regulations, he may
request variations or exceptions to the regulations
so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured, provided that such variation or
exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this Chapter. Application for
any such variation shall be made in writing by the
subdivider to the City Clerk at the time when the
Preliminary Plat or certified survey is filed for consideration,
stating fully all facts relied upon by the
petitioner, and shall be supplemented with maps,
plans, or other additional data which may aid City
officials in the analysis of the proposed project.
The plans for such development shall include such
covenants, restrictions or other legal provisions
necessary to guarantee the full achievement of the
plan. The Director of Community Development
may request that the City Engineer, City Attorney
or other officials review each situation to insure
that the request is consistent with the requirements
and standards of this Chapter. The Director of
Community Development shall refer the matter to
the Plan Commission with a written report and
recommendation from City staff. The Plan Commission
shall make a recommendation to the
Common Council. The previous granting of variations
or exceptions in the same or similar circumstances
shall not, of itself, constitute grounds for
the granting of a variance or exception, nor shall
strictly financial rationale.
(b) The Plan Commission shall not recommend nor the
Common Council shall not grant variations or exceptions
to the regulations of this Chapter unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented
to it in each specific case that:

to the public safety, health or welfare
or injurious to other property or improvements
in the neighborhood in which the
property is located;
(2) The conditions upon which the request for a
variation is based are unique to the property
for which the variation is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;
(3) Because of the particular physical surroundings,
shape or topographical conditions
of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, financial
hardship or self-imposed hardship, if
the strict letter of the regulations were carried
out.
(4) There would be no costs (present or future)
to the City resulting from the granting of the
variation or exception.
(c) Any recommendations for variations or exceptions
by the Plan Commission must be approved by a
three-fourths (3/4) majority vote of the Plan Commission
and shall be so endorsed by the Corresponding
Secretary and transmitted to the Common
Council. The Common Council, if it approves,
shall do so by resolution adopted by a majority
vote and shall instruct the City Clerk to notify the
Plan Commission and the subdivider.
(d) Variations from the strict application of this Chapter
may also be granted in accordance with this

Chapter and may stop construction or use of
approved materials, equipment, methods of
construction, devices or appliances for any
of the following reasons:
a. Whenever the City Engineer shall find at
any time that applicable ordinances,
laws, orders, plans, specifications and
agreements are not being complied with
and that the subdivider or his contractor
has refused to conform after written
warning or instruction has been issued to
him.
b. Whenever the continuance of any construction
becomes dangerous to life or
property.
c. Whenever there is any violation of any
condition or provisions of the application
for permit, or of the permit or of any approval.
d. Whenever, in the opinion of the City Engineer
or Building Commissioner, the
subdivider has provided inadequate management
of the project.
e. Whenever any false statement or misrepresentation
has been made in the application
for permit, plans, drawings, data
specifications or certified lot or plot plan
on which the issuance of the permit or
approval was based.
f. Whenever there is a violation of any of
the conditions of an approval or occupancy
given by the City Engineer or
Building Commissioner for the use of all
materials, equipment, methods of construction,
devices or appliances.
(2) The notice revoking a permit or approval
shall be in writing and may be served upon
the applicant of the permit, owner of the
premises and his agent, if any, and/or on the
person having charge of construction.
(3) A revocation placard shall also be posted
upon the premises in question by the City
Engineer or Building Commissioner.
(4) After the notice is served upon the persons as
aforesaid and posted, it shall be unlawful for
any person to proceed thereafter with any
construction operation whatsoever on the
premises, and the permit which has been so
revoked shall be null and void, and before
any construction or operation is again resumed,
a new permit, as required by this
Chapter, shall be procured and fees paid
therefor, and thereafter the resumption of any
construction or operation shall be in compliance
with the regulation of this Chapter.
However, such work as the City Engineer or
Building Commissioner may order as a condition
precedent to the reissuance of the
building permit may be performed, or such
work as he may require for the preservation
of life and safety.
(5) Any appeals of such revocations or suspensions
must be made in writing and within
seven (7) calendar days to the City Clerk for
consideration by the Common Council at its
next regularly scheduled meeting, provided
the appeal is filed not less than seven (7)
days prior to the meeting date.
(6) The Building Commissioner is hereby directed
to withhold the issuance of building
permits within the land division until compliance
with the provisions of this Chapter is
obtained.
(7) The Building Commissioner is hereby directed
to withhold the issuance of occupancy
permits within the land division if violations
City of Oak Creek
39
of this Chapter may result in health or safety
problems for the occupants.
SEC. 14.182 DISCLAIMERS ON APPROVALS.
(a) The purpose of requiring approvals under this
Chapter is to insure the health, safety, comfort,
prosperity and general welfare of the City. This
Chapter shall not be interpreted as placing any responsibility
or liability on any City official, City
employee, or the City as a municipal corporation
for the granting of approval, or the denial of any
approval. All approvals rendered as part of this
Chapter shall be considered as being approved
conditionally based on the information and circumstances
apparent at that time.
(b) Approvals issued by the City shall not be construed
as an assumption or expression of any responsibility,
warranty, or guarantee, for the design or construction
of any improvements within the land division.
SEC. 14.183 RESTRICTIONS FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT.
Pursuant to Sec. 236.293, Wis. Stats., any restriction
placed on platted lands by covenant, grant of easement,
land division, certified survey or consolidation approval,
which was required by the City and which names a public
body or public utility as grantee, promisee or beneficiary,
vests in the public body or utility the right to enforce
the restriction by law or in equity against anyone
who has interest in the land subject to the restriction. The
restriction may be released or waived by resolution of the
Common Council.

BUILDING CODE
SEC. 15.10 BUILDING CODE ESTABLISHED.
(a) Title. This Subchapter shall be known as the
“Building Code of the City of Oak Creek” and will
be referred to in this Section as “this Code,” “this
Subchapter” or “this Ordinance.”
(b) Purpose. This Code provides certain minimum
standards, provisions and requirements for safe and
stable design methods of construction and uses of
materials in buildings and/or structures hereafter
erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, repaired,
moved, converted to other uses or demolished and
regulates the equipment, maintenance, use and occupancy
of all such buildings and/or structures. Its
purpose is to protect and foster the health, safety
and well-being of persons occupying or using such
buildings and the general public.
(c) Scope. The provisions of this Section shall govern
the design, construction, alteration, erection, installation,
addition, demolition, moving and repair of
all buildings and structures, including building
components and systems, except as they are herein
specifically exempted from part or all of its provisions.
Any alteration, enlargement or demolition of
an existing building and any installation therein of
electrical, gas, heating, plumbing or ventilating
equipment which affects the health or safety of the
users thereof or any other persons is a “new building”
to the extent of such change. Any existing
building shall be considered a “new building” for
the purposes of this Code whenever there is a
change of use, unless it was being used for such
purpose at the time this Code was enacted.
(d) Zoning Code. The provisions of this Code supplement
the laws of the State of Wisconsin pertaining
to construction and use and the Zoning Code of
the City and amendments thereto to the date this
Code was adopted and in no way supersede or nullify
such laws and the said Zoning Code.
SEC. 15.11 INSPECTION DIVISION - BUILDING
SECTION.
There is hereby created within the Inspection Division the
Building Section. The Building Section shall be under the
direct supervision of the Building Commissioner. The
Building Commissioner or authorized agent shall have the
general authority and control of all matters pertaining to
building plan review, building inspections, and shall enforce
all state laws and City ordinances relating thereto.
SEC. 15.12 BUILDING PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
(a) Permit Required.
(1) General Permit Requirement. No building of
any kind shall be moved within or into the
City of Oak Creek and no new building or
structure, or any part thereof, shall hereafter
be erected, or ground broken for the same, or
enlarged, altered, moved, demolished, razed
or used within the City, except as herein provided,
until a permit therefor shall first have
been obtained by the owner, or his authorized
agent, from the Inspection Division.
(2) Alterations and Repairs. The following provisions
shall apply to buildings altered or repaired:
a. Alterations. When not in conflict with
any regulations, alterations to any building
or structure, or building component or
system accommodating a legal occupancy
or use but of substandard type of construction,
which involves either the structural
members of floors, roofs, beams,
girders, columns, bearing or other walls,
room arrangement, heating or air conditioning
systems, electrical systems,
plumbing systems, light and ventilation
systems, changes in location of exit stairways
or exits, or any or all of the above,
then such existing construction shall be
made to conform to the minimum requirements
of this Section applicable to
such occupancy and use and given type
of construction.
b. Repairs. Repairs for purposes of maintenance,
or replacements in any existing
building or structure which do not involve
the structural portions of the building
or structure or which do not affect
room arrangement, light and ventilation,
access to or efficiency of any existing
stairways, or exits, fire protection, or exterior
aesthetic appearance and which do
not increase a given occupancy or use,
shall be deemed minor repairs.
c. Alterations When Not Permitted. When
any existing building or structure, which,
for any reason whatsoever, has deteriorated
from any cause whatsoever to an
extent greater than fifty percent (50%) of
the equalized value of the building or
structure, as determined by the Assessor,
no alterations or moving of such building
or structure shall be permitted. Any such
building or structure shall be considered a
menace to public safety and welfare and
shall be ordered vacated and thereafter
demolished and debris removed from the
premises within thirty (30) days of notice
thereof.
d. Alterations and Repairs Required. When
any building or structure or building
City of Oak Creek
5
component thereof, whether existing or
being constructed, has deteriorated from
any cause whatsoever to less than its designed
or safe performance level, the
owner of such a building or structure
shall commence within forty-eight (48)
hours to cause such building or structure,
or building component thereof, to be restored
to its designed or safe performance
level. Failure to restore shall cause the
building or structure or building component
thereof to be considered a menace to
public safety and welfare, and shall be
ordered vacated and disconnected from
utilities and thereafter no further occupancy
or use shall be permitted. If the orders
of the Inspection Division are not
complied with after due notice and within
thirty (30) days, the Inspection Division
shall proceed as required by this Section
to have such building or structure demolished.
e. Use of Unsanitary Building. No person
shall occupy or use, or permit to be occupied
or used, any building or structure
that is unsanitary, dilapidated, deteriorated
or out of repair, thereby being unfit for
human habitation, occupancy or use until
the regulations of this Section and Chapter
16 of this Code are complied with.
f. Extent of Deterioration. The amount and
extent of deterioration of any existing
building or structure shall be determined
by the Inspector.
(b) Permit Requirements.
(1) Permit Required. A permit shall be obtained
by the owner or his agent from the Inspection
Division for any of the following:

new construction of any building or structure,
except minor repairs. All demolition
or moving of any building, or portion
thereof, into, within, or out of the City.
b. Electrical. All additions, alterations or
new installations of electrical wiring,
equipment or devices, except that no
permit shall be required for the repair or
replacement of defective fittings, fixtures,
receptacles, sockets or switches.

additions to an existing system. All alterations
or modifications involving more

by the Common Council.
(2) Application for Permit.
a. Application for any permit shall be on
forms prescribed by the Inspection Division.
With such application for one- and
two-family residential properties, there
shall be submitted three (3) complete sets
of plans, specifications and survey. For
commercial, industrial and multi-family
residential properties, there shall be submitted
five (5) complete sets of plans,
specifications or survey.
b. The Inspection Division may waive such
filing of plans, specifications or survey if,
in the opinion of the Inspector, the character
of the work is sufficiently described
in the application.
c. No building permit shall be issued until
the City has determined that all outstanding
connection and development fees and
special assessments levied against the
property have been fully paid or an
agreement for payment has been approved
by the Common Council.
d. No building permit shall be issued for the
erection or construction of any building
upon platted and unplatted lands until a
culvert of such size and length to preserve
the capacity and grade of any
drainage ditch laid alongside a public
highway or public service drive abutting
the building site is installed. The City
shall determine the size and length of
culvert required, but in no case shall the
culvert be less than twelve (12) inches in
diameter and twenty (20) feet in length.
e. In those cases where a building site is not
serviced by public sewer and a private
sewage disposal system is required, proper
soil borings shall be taken at the proposed
location of the septic system on the
property in accord with the current reCity
of Oak Creek
6
quirements of the Section 15.63 of this
Code. The results of such tests shall be
submitted in duplicate with the building
permit application.
(3) Division to Issue Permits.
a. If the Inspection Division finds that the
proposed work will comply in every respect
with this Section, other City ordinances,
laws of the state, and lawful orders
issued pursuant thereto, a permit
shall be issued. After receiving a permit,
the plans and specifications shall not be
altered in any respect which involves any
of the above-mentioned ordinances, laws,
orders or safety of the project, except
with the written consent of the Inspection
Division filed with the application.
b. In appropriate cases, the Inspection Division
may issue a permit for part of a project
prior to receiving plans for the entire
project. No person shall commence work
on any building or structure, or part
thereof, before the proper permits are issued.
The issuance of a permit shall not
prevent the Inspection Division from
thereafter requiring the correction of any
errors in such plans and specifications or
from preventing building operations being
carried on thereunder when in violation
of any ordinance, law or lawful order.
(c) Dedicated Street and Approved Subdivision
Required. Unless a waiver is granted by the Plan
Commission, following a recommendation from the
Inspection Division, no building permit shall be issued
unless the property on which the building is
proposed to be built abuts a street that has been
dedicated for street purposes. No building permits
shall be issued until the subdivision and/or certified
survey, and required improvements, meet the requirements
of Chapter 14.
(d) Utilities Required.
(1) Residential Buildings. No building permit
shall be issued for the construction of any
residential building until sewer, water, grading,
graveling, curb and gutter (if required)
and a minimum of two (2) inches of bituminous
pavement has been installed in the
streets necessary to service the property for
which the permit is required, unless otherwise
approved by the Common Council.
(2) Non-Residential Building. No building permit
shall be issued for the construction of any
building other than residential buildings until
contracts have been let for the installation of
sewer, water, grading and graveling in the
streets necessary to service the property for
which the permit is requested.
(3) Occupancy. No person shall occupy any
building until sewer, water, grading and
graveling are installed in the streets necessary
to service the property and a certificate of
occupancy shall not be issued until such utilities
are available to service the property.
(4) Lawns. A permanent lawn shall be established
on each parcel within one (1) year after
the issuance of the initial occupancy permit
for the home on such parcel. An area
landscaped with perennial grass able to withstand
continued cutting from a height of 6” or
less is a permanent lawn.
(e) Plans. With applications for new, detached structures
or additions, there shall be submitted three (3)
complete sets of plans and specifications [five (5)
sets of plans for commercial, industrial and multifamily
structures], including a plot plan showing
the location and dimensions of all buildings and
improvements on the lot, both existing and proposed,
dimensions of the lot, dimensions showing
all setbacks of all buildings on the lot, proposed
grade of proposed structure (to City datum), grade
of lot and of the street abutting lot, grade and setback
of adjacent buildings (if adjacent lot is vacant,
submit elevation of nearest buildings on same side
of street), type of monuments at each corner of lot,
water courses or existing drainage ditches, easements
or other restrictions affecting such property,
and other requirements in accordance with the Engineering
Design Manual or as required by the City
Engineer, the signature of the applicant and, if necessary
due to the nature of the project, a construction
erosion control plan setting forth proposed
information and procedures needed for control of
soil erosion, surface water runoff and sediment disposition
at the building site. Residential building
plans and specifications shall be drawn to a minimum
scale of one-quarter (1/4) inch to one (1) foot
[fireplace details to three-quarters (3/4) inch to one
(1) foot] and commercial and industrial plot plans
at a scale of one (1) inch to fifty (50) feet. Plans for
buildings involving the State Building Code shall
bear the stamp of approval of the State Department
of Industry, Labor and Human Relations. One (1)
plan shall remain on file in the Inspection Division
for one (1) year after construction for residential.
One (1) plan shall remain on file permanently for
commercial or industrial plans. All plans and specifications
shall be signed by the designer.
(f) Partial Approval of Plans. In case adequate plans
are presented for part of the building only, the Inspection
Division, at its discretion, may issue a
permit for that part of the building before receiving
the plans and specifications for the entire building.
City of Oak Creek
7
(g) Property Lot Marking
Prior to commencement of construction, every single
or two-family residence shall have stakes placed
at the corners of the property upon which the residence
is being constructed. The stakes shall be a
minimum of 36 inches in height, with the top eight
(8) inches of the stake to be painted with a fluorescent
orange paint. The stakes shall be maintained
by the permit holder until the occupancy permit has
been issued or the lawn has been established,
whichever is later.
(h) Fees; Reports.
(1) Payment of Fees. Except as otherwise specifically
provided, all permit, license and inspection

SEC. 15.21 MOVING BUILDINGS.
(a) General Requirements.
(3) No person shall move any building or structure
upon any of the public ways of the City
without first obtaining a permit therefor from
the Inspector and upon the payment of the
required fee. Every such permit issued by the
Inspector for the moving of a building shall
designate the route to be taken, the conditions
to be complied with, and shall limit the
time during which said moving operation
shall be continued.
(4) A report shall be made by the City Engineer
with regard to possible damage to trees or the
required movement of any public utilities
and/or improvements. The estimated cost of
trimming, removing and replacement of public
trees, or the required movement of any
City of Oak Creek
14
public utilities and an improvement shall be
determined by the City Engineer and shall be
paid to the City Treasurer prior to issuance of
the moving permit.
(5) Issuance of a moving permit shall further be
conditioned on approval of the moving route
by the City Engineer and Chief of Police.
(b) Continuous Movement. The movement of buildings
shall be a continuous operation during all the
hours of the day, and at night, until such movement
is fully completed. All of such operations shall be
performed with the least possible obstruction to
thoroughfares. No building shall be allowed to remain
overnight upon any street crossing or intersection,
or so near thereto as to prevent easy access to
any fire hydrant or any other public facility. Lights
shall be kept in conspicuous places at each end of
the building during the night.
(c) Street Repair. Every person receiving a permit to
move a building shall within one (1) day after said
building reaches its destination, report that fact to
the Inspector, who shall thereupon in the company
of the City Engineer, inspect the streets, highways,
and curbs and gutters over which said building has
been moved and ascertain their condition. If the
removal of said building has caused any damage to
any street or highway, the person to whom the permit
was issued shall forthwith place them in as
good repair as they were before the permit was
granted. On the failure of said permittee to do so
within ten (10) days thereafter to the satisfaction of
the Director of Public Works, the City shall repair
the damage done to such streets and hold the person
obtaining such permit and the sureties on his
bond responsible for the payment of same.
(d) Conformance with Code. No permit shall be issued
to move a building within or into the City and
to establish it upon a location within the said City
until the Inspector has made an investigation of
such building at the location from which it is to be
moved, and is satisfied from such investigation that
said building is in a sound and stable condition and
of such construction that it will meet the requirements
of this Building Code in all respects. A complete
plan of all further repairs, improvements and
remodeling with reference to such building shall be
submitted to the Inspector, and he shall make a
finding of fact to the effect that all such repairs, improvements
and remodeling are in conformity with
the requirements of this Building Code, and that
when the same are completed, the building as such
will so comply with said Building Code. In the
event a building is to be moved from the City to
some point outside the boundaries thereof, the provisions
with respect to the furnishing of plans and
specifications for proposed alterations to such
building may be disregarded.
(e) Bond.
(1) Before a permit is issued to move any building
over any public way in the City, the party
applying therefor shall give a bond to the
City of Oak Creek in a sum to be fixed by the
City Engineer and which shall not be less
than Twenty-five Thousand Dollars

to be approved by the City Engineer or designated
agent conditioned upon, among other
things, the indemnification to the City for any
costs or expenses incurred by it in connection
with any claims for damages to any persons
or property, and the payment of any judgement
together with the costs and expenses incurred
by the City in connection therewith,
arising out of the removal of the building for
which the permit is issued.
(2) Unless the Inspector, upon investigation,
shall find it to be a fact that the excavation
exposed by the removal of such building
from its foundation shall not be so close to a
public thoroughfare as to permit the accidental
falling therein of travelers or the location,
nature and physical characteristics of the
premises and the exposed excavation, such as
to make intrusion upon the premises and the
falling into such excavation of children under
twelve (12) years of age unlikely, the bond
required by Subsection (e)(1) shall be further
conditioned upon the permittee erecting adequate
barriers and within forty-eight (48)
hours, filling in such excavation or adopting
and employing such other means, devices or
methods approved by the Inspector reasonably
adopted or calculated to prevent the occurrences
set forth herein.
(f) Insurance. The Inspector shall require, in addition
to such bond above indicated, public liability insurance
covering injury to one (1) person in the sum of
not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00)
and for one accident in a sum not less than One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), together with
property damage insurance in a sum not less than
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), or such other
coverage as deemed necessary. The City shall be
named as an additional insured on the policy.
(g) Plan Commission Review.

an examination of the application for the
permit which shall include exterior elevations
of the building and accurate photographs of
all sides and views of the same, and in case it
is proposed to alter the exterior of said buildCity
of Oak Creek

alterations and after a view of the
building proposed to be moved and of the
site at which it is to be located, that the exterior
architectural appeal and functional plan
of the building to be moved or moved and altered,
will not be so at variance with either
the exterior architectural appeal and functional
plan of the buildings already constructed
or in the course of construction in the immediate
neighborhood, or the character of the
applicable district established by the Zoning
Ordinances of the City or any ordinance
amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto,
as to cause a substantial depreciation in the
property values of said neighborhood within
said applicable district. In case the applicant
proposes to alter the exterior of said building
after moving the same, he shall submit with
his application papers complete plans and
specifications for the proposed alterations.
Before a permit shall be issued for a building
to be moved and altered, the applicant shall
give a bond to the City, which shall not be
less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00)
to be executed in the manner provided in
Subsection (e) hereof to the effect that he will
within a time to be set by the Plan Commission,
complete the proposed exterior alterations
to said building in the manner set forth
in his plans and specifications. This bond
shall be in addition to any other bond or surety
which may be required by other applicable
ordinances of the City. No occupancy permit
shall be issued for said building until the exterior
alterations proposed to be made have
been completed.
(2) Upon application being made to the Inspector,
he shall request a meeting of the Plan
Commission to consider applications for
moving permits which he has found comply
in all respects with all other ordinances of the
City. The Plan Commission may, if it desires,
hear the applicant for the moving permit in
question and/or the owner of the lot on which
it is proposed to locate the building in question,
together with any other persons, either
residents or property owners, desiring to be
heard, giving such notice of hearing as they
may deem sufficient. Such hearing may be
adjourned for a reasonable length of time,
and within forty-eight (48) hours after the
close of the hearing, the Plan Commission
shall, in writing, make or refuse to make, the
finding required by this Subsection, and file

to utilize any other methods or powers otherwise available
for accomplishing the purposes set forth herein, either
in substitution of or in conjunction with this Subchapter.
SEC. 15.103 RECITALS.
(a) Sec. 66.0617, Wis. Stats., requires a political subdivision
to prepare a needs assessment for the public
facilities for which it is anticipated that impact
fees may be imposed, prior to enacting an ordinance
that imposes impact fees.

Oak Creek retained the consulting engineering firm
of Ruekert & Mielke, Inc. to review Sec. 66.55,
Wis. Stats., the predecessor statute to Sec. 66.0617
Wis. Stats., its application to the City of Oak Creek,
its public facilities needs required by growth
through development, and to prepare a needs assessment

prepared an Impact Fees Needs Assessment - 1995
and Report to the Mayor and Common Council.

Acts 203 and 477 in 2006 and by Wisconsin
Act 44 in 2008.

Creek to prepare an updated needs assessment.
(f) Reukert & Mielke prepared an Impact Fee Study
Update dated June, 2009, which is on file in the office
of the City Clerk (“Impact Fee Study Update”).
(g) The Impact Fee Study Update sets forth the public
facilities required by land development which may
be financed by impact fees and has recommended
that impact fees be established for parks, playgrounds
and other recreational facilities, fire protection
facilities, and libraries.
(h) A public hearing was held before the Common
Council of the City of Oak Creek on the third (3rd)
day of August, 2009, to consider amendments to

as a Class 1 Notice under Ch. 985, Wis.
Stats., which notice specified that a copy of the
proposed ordinance and the Impact Fee Study Update
having been available in such office for at least
twenty (20) days prior to the public hearing.
(j) The Common Council of the City of Oak Creek
finds and determines that the impact fees it considered
for adoption bear a rational relationship to the
need for new, expanded or improved public facilities
required to serve land development; that such
fees do not exceed the proportionate share of the
capital costs that are required to serve land development
as compared to existing uses of land within
the City; and that the impact fees are based upon
reasonable estimates of the capital costs for new,
expanded or improved public facilities and do not
include amounts necessary to address existing deficiencies
in public facilities.

Oak Creek will designate the location of all
hydrants to be attached to the City’s water
mains. These will normally be located on
public property but if the convenience of the
City is better served, they may be located on
easements to provide better accessibility.

and private fire hydrants will be supplied
by private fire lines. Private fire lines
must be either fully metered or protected
by an appropriate check valve, both of
which must be approved by the utility.
Fire service mains, hydrants, and appurtenances
and the installation thereof must
City of Oak Creek
45
comply with the City’s utility standards.
The property owner must provide and
maintain the private fire line from the
main to the point of use. Vaults with
sump pumps must be provided for all meters
and check valves when other suitable
sites within the building cannot be made
available by the property owner or when
the building site may be unacceptable to
the utility. All private hydrants must be
maintained by the property owner and
kept accessible to the Fire Department at
all times. They must be inspected and operated
each spring and fall, with written
notification provided both the Utility and
City Fire Department that the hydrant is
in good working order and that all control
valves are open. Combined fire and domestic
service lines will be permitted if
acceptable to the property owner’s insurance
carrier.
b. The location of all private fire hydrants
must be approved by the City Fire Department
and the Water Utility.
c. One (1) set of plans for private fire protection
systems shall be submitted with an
application for permit to the Plumbing Inspector.
No work shall commence prior
to approval of the plans and application
and payment of the permit and test fees.
Double permit fees shall apply for work
started prior to permit issuance.
d. All plans for private fire protection systems
must be approved by the City Fire
Department and the Water Utility.
(e) Hydrant Flows. The hydrants providing coverage
to a building under this Section must supply a total
flow sufficient to meet the requirements of the
building. The formula used by the Insurance Services
Office will be used to make this calculation.
The developer of the building is responsible for
supplying this information along with the hydrant
plans. Hydrant minimum flows will be 1250 gpm
with 20 psi residual.

HOUSING CODE
SEC. 16.01 PURPOSE.
(a) The purpose of this Housing Code is to prevent
the deterioration of residential units and neighborhoods.
This Code recognizes that such deterioration
could develop because of:
(1) Faulty design and/or construction;
(2) Poor maintenance;
(3) Lack of proper sanitary facilities;
(4) Inadequate lighting and ventilation;
(5) Inadequate heating facilities; or
(6) A combination of these factors.
(b) Such buildings could become so dilapidated and
neglected that they jeopardize or are detrimental
to the health, safety, morals, general welfare or the
economic values of adjoining properties.
(c) The adoption and subsequent enforcement of this
Chapter is therefore declared to be essential to the
public interest. It shall be liberally construed to
maintain a pleasant, safe and healthful environment

STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND
PURPOSE
SEC. 17.0101 AUTHORITY
These regulations are adopted under the authority
granted by Sections 62.23(7), 62.231, 87.30, and
144.26 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Therefore, the
Common Council of the City of Oak Creek, Wisconsin
does ordain as follows:
SEC. 17.0102 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Chapter is to promote the health,
safety, morals, prosperity, aesthetics, and general welfare
of this community.
SEC. 17.0103 INTENT
It is the general intent of this Chapter to regulate and
restrict the use of all structures, lands, and waters; and
to:
(a) Regulate lot coverage and the size and location
of all structures so as to prevent overcrowding
and to provide adequate sunlight, air, sanitation,
and drainage;
(b) Regulate population density and distribution so
as to avoid sprawl or undue concentration and to
facilitate the provision of adequate public services
and utilities;
(c) Regulate parking, loading and access so as to
lessen congestion in and promote the safety and
efficiency of the streets and highways;
(d) Secure safety from fire, flooding, pollution, contamination,
and other dangers;
(e) Prevent flood damages to persons and property;
(f) Minimize expenditures for flood relief and flood
control projects;
(g) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful water
conditions;
(h) Protect the traffic-carrying capacity of existing
and proposed arterial streets and highways;
(i) Stabilize and protect existing and potential property
values;
(j) Further the appropriate use of land and conservation
of natural resources;
(k) Preserve and protect the beauty of the community;
(l) Facilitate the use of solar energy devices and
other innovative development techniques;
(m) Implement those municipal, county, watershed,
and regional comprehensive plans or plan components
adopted by the City of Oak Creek;
(n) Provide for the administration and enforcement
of this Chapter and to provide penalties for its
violation.
SEC. 17.0104 ABROGATION AND GREATER
RESTRICTIONS
It is not intended by the provisions of this Chapter to
repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any
existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions,
agreements, ordinances, rules, regulations, or permits
previously adopted or issued pursuant to laws. Except
as otherwise provided in this Chapter, wherever this
Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of
this Chapter shall govern.
SEC. 17.0105 INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements
and shall be liberally construed in favor of the
City and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of
any other power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.
SEC. 17.0106 SEVERABILITY
If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
Chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
Chapter shall not be affected thereby.
SEC. 17.0107 WARNING & DISCLAIMER OF
LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection provided for by this
Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on engineering experience and scientific
methods of study. On rare occasions, larger
floods may occur or the flood height may be increased
by man-made or natural causes such as ice
jams or bridge openings restricted by debris. Therefore,
this Chapter does not imply that areas outside
the delineated flood lands or uses permitted within
the flood lands will be totally free from flooding and
the associated flood damages. Nor shall this Chapter
create a liability on the part of, or a cause of action
against, the City of Oak Creek or any office or employee
thereof for any flood damages that may result
from reliance on this Chapter.
SEC. 17.0108 TITLE
This Chapter shall be known as, referred to, or cited
as the “ZONING CHAPTER OF THE MUNICIPAL
CODE OF ORDINANCES (ZONING CODE), CITY
OF OAK CREEK, MILWAUKEE COUNTY
WISCONSIN.”
SEC. 17.0201 JURISDICTION
The jurisdiction of this Chapter shall include all lands
and waters within the corporate limits of the City of
Oak Creek.
SEC. 17.0202 COMPLIANCE
No structure, land, or water shall hereafter be used or
developed (as “development” is defined in Section
17.1402 of this Chapter) and no structure or part
City of Oak Creek
17-5
thereof shall hereafter be located, erected, moved, reconstructed,
extended, enlarged, converted, or structurally
altered except in conformity with the regulations
herein specified for the district in which it is located;
except that in residence districts, a lot of record
as of 12/1/64, even though not meeting the requirements
of this Chapter as to area and width, may be
used for single family residence purposes.
SEC. 17.0203 MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE

herein shall be conducted within the street
right-of-way. Temporary uses permitted under
this section may be allowed one (1) temporary

(3) Shelters for materials and equipment being
used in the construction of a permanent
structure or public utility may be
permitted in any district. The Building

other portable structure, other than an accessory
building or shed complying with
all building codes and land use requirements,
that can or is used for the disposal
or storage of personal property of any
kind and which is located for such purposes

of construction and must be
removed from the site within fourteen
(14) days of the end of construction.
Portable storage structures
associated with construction
are exempt from the aforementioned
conditions.
(9) Because it is difficult to enumerate all
temporary uses that may occur in the
City, any other use which the Plan Commission
finds to be similar to other temporary
uses permitted in a given district,
will not be disruptive to the neighborhood,
and will not create a hazard to traffic
in a neighborhood may be permitted.
The Plan Commission may impose additional
operational or construction conditions
on such temporary uses when it is
deemed necessary.

and 17.0204(d)(9)
SEC. 17.0205 SITE RESTRICTIONS
No land shall be used or structure erected where the
land is unsuitable for such use or structure by reason
of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage,
adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography,
low percolation rate or bearing strength, erosion
susceptibility, or any other feature likely to be harmful
to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics, and
general welfare of this community. The City Building
Commissioner or a designee, in cooperation with the
City Engineer, shall, in applying the provisions of this
section, recite in writing the particular facts upon
which he bases his conclusion that the land is not suitable
for certain uses. The applicant shall have an opportunity
to present evidence contesting such unsuitability
if he so desires. Thereafter the City Plan
Commission may affirm, modify, or withdraw the determination
of unsuitability. In addition:
(a) All lots shall abut upon a public street, and each
lot shall have a minimum lot width measured at
the street setback line as specified in each district,
but not less than 65 feet. The required
minimum lot width shall be maintained for at
least 30 feet beyond the street setback line for
construction of the principal structure.
(b) All principal structures shall be located on a lot;
and only one principal structure shall be located,
erected, or moved onto a lot in single-family
and two-family residential districts. The Plan
Commission may permit more than one structure
per lot in other districts where more than
one structure is needed for the orderly development
of the parcel. Where additional structures
are permitted, the Plan Commission may
impose additional yard requirements, landscaping
requirements, or parking requirements, or
require a minimum separation distance between
principal structures.
(c) Lots abutting more restrictive district boundaries
shall provide side and rear yards not less
than those required in the more restrictive abutting
district. The street yards on the less restrictive
district shall be modified for a distance of
not more than 60 feet from the district boundary
line so as to equal the average of the street
yards required in both districts.
(d) A buffer yard shall be created and maintained
around all business and manufacturing districts
which abut upon residential districts and which
are adjacent to freeways and limited access arterial
streets and highways which abut upon residential
districts. The Plan Commission may also
require a buffer yard around business and
industrial districts abutting park and institutional
districts. Buffer yards shall be a minimum of
20 feet in width; shall be in addition to the required
street yards, side yards, and rear yards;
and shall screen business or manufacturing uses
from adjoining lands in such a manner that:
(1) If the buffer yard is composed entirely of
plant materials, it shall be of sufficient initial
depth and height and of such varieties
as to provide adequate visual screening
within no more than two years and
during all seasons of the year.
(2) Where architectural walls or fences are
used, sufficient landscaping shall be used
in conjunction with such wall or fence to
create an attractive view from the residential
side, and all walls and fences shall be
maintained in a structurally sound and attractive
condition. Any wall or fence shall
be not less than four (4) feet nor more
than six (6) feet in height.
(3) All landscaping shall be maintained by
the owner or operator to the satisfaction
of the Zoning Administrator or a designee..
(4) Where the land adjacent to the buffer
yard is a parking lot, the buffer yard shall
be sufficiently opaque to prevent the penetration
of headlight glare. Overhead
lighting installed in or adjacent to a buffer
City of Oak Creek
17-7
yard shall not throw any rays onto adjacent
residential properties.
(5) No signs shall be permitted on or in any
part of the buffer yard.
(e) On a vacant through or corner lot, either of the
lot lines abutting street right-of-way lines may
be established as its front lot line, except that
where 2 or more through lots are contiguous
and a front lot line has been duly established,
the same street lot line shall thereafter be
deemed to be the front lot line of all such contiguous
lots. On a through lot, a front yard shall
be provided along any lot line abutting a street.
(f) On a corner lot, the owner has the option of
designating a side yard and a rear yard of the
two remaining yards after the front yard and
side yard abutting a street have been identified;
as long as one is at least equal to the required
side setback and the other at least equal to the
required rear setback.

17.1009 for any premises containing a Destination
Retail building that has a gross floor area
of 250,000 square feet or more. For the purpose
of promoting compatible development stability
of property values, and to prevent impairment or
depreciation of property values, no person shall
erect or modify any structure without first obtaining
the approval of detailed site and architectural
plans, as set forth in this section, prior to the issuance
of a building permit. The Plan Commission
shall review architectural plans and site
plans showing existing and proposed structures,
neighboring uses, parking areas, driveway locations,

(1) Principles. To implement and define criteria for
the purposes set forth above, the following principles
are established to apply to new structures
and uses and to changes or additions to existing
structures and uses except as specifically noted to
the contrary.
a. No building shall be permitted where any
exposed facade is not constructed or faced
with high quality and durable materials.
b. Buildings shall be designed in such a manner
that long expanses of blank wall are
broken up by the use of articulation or
modulation of the building footprint and/or
changes in building materials and colors on
the front elevation. Colors should be visually
coordinated, harmonious, and may include
features consistent with corporate or
franchise practices.
c. Arrangements of uses in a pattern similar to
conventional strip malls shall not be allowed.
d. Each principal building shall have a clearly
defined, highly-visible customer entrance
with features such as canopies, arcades,
arches, wing walls, and integral planters.
e. Sides of a building that are visible from adjoining
residential properties and/or public
streets should feature characteristics similar
or complementary to the front façade of the
building.
f. No building or use shall be permitted that
would have a significant adverse impact on
the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions
of the City.
g. Buildings and uses shall maintain existing
topography, drainage patterns, and vegetative
cover insofar as is practical. The street
layout shall be adapted to the topography,
unique natural features, environmental constraints
of the site, and peripheral open
space areas. The street layout shall provide
for open space views and surrounding vistas.
h. Buildings and uses shall provide for safe
and efficient traffic circulation and driveway
locations, and drive-through facilities,
where permitted (other than customer pickup
areas), may not be located in the front
yard.
i. Buildings and uses shall be provided with
adequate access to the public street and
highway system as set forth in this Section.
i. Access onto major streets should be
minimized to provide safe and efficient
traffic flow.
ii. Provisions shall be made for cross access
between compatible commercial
developments.
iii. Primary commercial access shall not
be through residentially-zoned areas.
j. Buildings and uses shall provide adequate
parking and loading areas.
i. Loading docks or overhead doors
may face upon a street right-of-way
only in cases where no practical alternative
exists.
ii. Parking should be directed to the side
or rear of the lot, where it is less visually
intrusive. No more than 50% of
the off-street parking for commercial
developments directly abutting a public
right-of-way shall be located between
the front of the building and the
primary abutting street unless the
overall development design includes
smaller buildings or other amenities
closer to the street. Uninterrupted
parking lots along full street frontage
will be discouraged, except where the
City of Oak Creek
17-38
physical orientation of the lot makes it
necessary.
(2) Exceptions for Large Scale Destination Retail.
The following principles are established to apply
only to premises developed with a Destination
Retail building of 250,000 square feet or more of
gross floor area:
a. Any exposed building façade shall be constructed
or faced with high quality and durable
materials, which may include precast and
metal panels.
b. Large walls may have less articulation or
modulation of the building footprint and/or
fewer changes in building materials and colors.
c. It is recognized that buildings of 250,000
square feet or more will seem larger than
residential scale and should not be artificially
altered.
d. Only the first building of 250,000 square
feet or more to be built in any area zoned B-
6 Interchange Regional Retail District may
incorporate primary colors into more than
10% of its exterior finishes.
(3) Appeals. Any person or persons aggrieved by
any decisions of the Plan Commission related to
plan review may appeal the decision to the Zoning
Board of Appeals. Such appeal shall be filed
with the City Clerk within thirty (30) days after
the decision of the Plan Commission.
(4) Modifications and Standards. The Plan Commission
may modify any of the standards in subsection
(l) above (but not (l)(2)(d) above) by a ¾
majority vote of those Commissioners present at
a meeting, but only if supplemental design elements
or improvements are incorporated into the
project which compensate for the modification of
the particular standard.
m. Landscaping:
All provisions of Sections 17.1010 and 17.0205
of the Municipal Code are applicable to this subsection
except that the provisions below shall
override or supersede, in their entirety, the provisions
of Sections 17.1010 and 17.0205 for any
premises containing a Destination Retail building
that has a gross floor area of 250,000 square feet
or more.
1. Parking Lot Screening. Those parking areas
for five (5) or more vehicles if adjoining a
residential zoning district line or public
right-of-way shall be screened from casual
view by an earth berm, a solid wall, fence,
evergreen planting or equivalent visual density
or other effective means. Such fence or
berm and landscaping together shall be an
average of three (3) feet in height between
the parking and the street right-of-way and
six (6) feet in height between the parking
and any adjacent residential property line.
All screening materials shall be placed and
maintained at a minimum height of three (3)
feet. Landscaped areas shall include native
plantings. At least 50% of the total green
space area shall be landscaped utilizing plant
materials, other than maintained turf, which
contribute to ground coverage.
2. Interior Landscape Area. All public offstreet
parking lots which serve (5) vehicles
or more shall be provided with accessory
landscaped areas, which may be landscape
islands, landscape peninsulas or peripheral
plantings totaling not less than five (5) percent
of the surfaced area. Landscape islands
or peninsulas may be dispersed throughout
the off-street parking area and shall include
native plantings not exceeding five (5) feet
in height. Landscape islands shall provide a
minimum 30-inch clear area for vehicle
overhang and snow storage. Within 100 feet
of the entrance elevation of a Destination
Retail building in excess of 250,000 square
feet, landscape may not exceed three (3) feet
in height.
3. Perimeter Landscape Area. In an effort to
prevent adjacent parking lots from becoming
one large expanse of paving, perimeter landscaping
shall be required. The perimeter
strip shall be a minimum 5 feet in width. A
minimum of five native plantings are required
for every linear feet and one tree for
every 80 linear feet of the perimeter of the
parking area where it is adjacent to existing
or future parking and located within the perimeter
landscape area. This requirement
may be modified by the Plan Commission.
4. Buffer Yards. A buffer yard shall be created
and maintained where the B-6 Interchange
Regional Retail District abuts residential or
park districts. Buffer yards shall be a minimum
of 20 feet in width, shall be in addition
to the required street yards, side yards, and
rear yards; and shall screen in such a manner
that:
a. If the buffer yard is composed entirely
of plant materials, it shall be of sufficient
initial depth and height and of
such varieties as to provide adequate
visual screening within no more than
two years and during all seasons of the
year.
b. Where architectural walls or fences are
used, sufficient landscaping shall be
used in conjunction with such wall or
fence to create an attractive view, and
all walls and fences shall be mainCity
of Oak Creek
17-39
tained in a structurally sound and attractive
condition.
c. Where the land adjacent to the buffer
yard is a parking lot, the buffer yard
shall be sufficiently opaque to prevent
the penetration of headlight glare unless
the parking lot is more than 40 feet
from the residential or park district.
Overhead lighting installed in or adjacent
to the buffer shall not trespass onto
adjacent residential properties. The
light source, whether bulb or tube,
shall not be visible from adjacent residential
properties.
d. No signs shall be permitted on or in
any part of the buffer yard.
n. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of Section
17.0325, any PUD Planned Unit Development
Overlay District adopted for the B-6 District:
1. Shall not be required to be under single or
corporate ownership or control; and
2. Shall, with Plan Commission approval and
not to be deemed a substantial alteration of
the original plan, allow for flexibility of any
dimensional, architectural or landscaping
standards that otherwise would apply under
this Chapter.

make pitches to an audience of qualified
investors (International Economic
Development Council. Accelerating Success:
Strategies to Support Growth-

glare, and vibration resulting from the
manufacturing activity are confined entirely
within the building.

MANUFACTURING DISTRICT
SEC. 17.03171 M-1 MANUFACTURING
DISTRICT
The M-1 Manufacturing District is intended to provide
for manufacturing, industrial, and related uses of
a limited nature and size which, on the basis of actual
physical and operational characteristics, would not be
detrimental to the surrounding area or to the City as a
whole by reason of smoke, noise, dust, odor, traffic,
physical appearance, or other similar factors.
It is the intention of the Common Council of the City
of Oak Creek to enact regulations for the purpose of
promoting health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
Pursuant to the City of Oak Creek’s authority, it is the
intent of the Common Council to adopt by ordinance
regulations restricting the location of adult entertainment
businesses as defined herein to promote the City
of Oak Creek’s interest in protecting and preserving
the quality of its neighborhoods, commercial districts,
and quality of urban life through effective land-use
planning.
It has been the experience of other cities including
Seattle and Renton, Washington and Detroit, Michigan
that adult entertainment businesses can contribute
to the impairment of the character and quality of a
surrounding residential neighborhood; and contribute
to a decline in the value of surrounding properties.
Adult entertainment businesses in proximity to residential
areas, religious institutions, parks, schools and
day care centers may lead to an increase in criminal
activities in the surrounding areas and the City desires
to protect the youth of the community from the deleterious
effects such businesses can have on adjacent
areas by restricting their close proximity to places of
worship, schools and residential areas.
The Common Council has reviewed studies distributed
by the National Obscenity Law Center in a three
volume set that documents the secondary effects of
adult entertainment businesses that affect property
values, contribute to physical deterioration and blight,
have a deleterious effect on both existing business
around them and surrounding areas, including increased
transiency, increased levels of criminal activities
including prostitution, rape, assaults and other
sex related crimes. The Common Council is also
aware that similar studies have been conducted in
other communities across the United States such as
St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN; Indianapolis, IN; Hilton
Head, SC; Austin, TX; Phoenix, AZ and Los Angeles,
CA.
The Common Council believes that the experiences
and studies from other communities set forth herein
are relevant in addressing the secondary effects adult
entertainment businesses can have upon areas surrounding
such establishments in the City of Oak
Creek.
A reasonable regulation of the location of adult entertainment
businesses will provide for the protection of
the image of the community and its property values
and protect the residents of the community from the
adverse secondary effects of an adult entertainment
business, while providing to those who desire to patronize
adult entertainment businesses, such an opportunity
in areas within the City which are appropriate
for the location of adult entertainment businesses.
The United States Supreme Court in the case of City
of Renton vs. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 US 41,
106 S. Ct., 925, 89 L. Ed., 2d, 29 (1986) and Young
vs. American Mini Theaters, 427 US 50, 96 S. Ct.,
2440, 49 L. Ed., 2d, 310 (1976) have approved efforts
by local government to regulate the location of
adult entertainment businesses through land-use
plans.
The Common Council of the City of Oak Creek conducted
a public hearing and heard testimony from
proponents and opponents of the proposed ordinance.
The Plan Commission has the adoption of the proposed
ordinance as an amendment to our existing
zoning code.
The proposed ordinance serves a substantial government
interest and does not unreasonably limit alternative
avenue of communication.
The Common Council of the City of Oak Creek,
Milwaukee County, Wisconsin do ordain as follows:
(a) Permitted Uses:
1. Assembly, processing, manufacturing, and/or

(e) GENERAL PROVISIONS:
(1) AREAS TO BE REGULATED. This ordinance
regulates all areas that would be
covered by the regional flood or base
flood.
Note: Base flood elevations are derived
from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance
Study. Regional flood elevations
may be derived from other studies. Areas
covered by the base flood are identified
as A-Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS. The
boundaries of all floodplain districts are
designated as floodplains or A-Zones on
the maps listed below and the revisions in
the City of Oak Creek Floodplain Appendix.
Any change to the base flood elevations
(BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) must be reviewed and approved
by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective.
No changes to regional flood elevations
(RFE’s) on non-FEMA maps shall
be effective until approved by the DNR.
These maps and revisions are on file in
the office of Community Development,
City of Oak Creek. If more than one map
or revision is referenced, the most current
approved information shall apply.

(b) City of Oak Creek Floodplain Appendix:
All DNR-and FEMA-approved
floodplain maps, flood profiles,
floodway data tables, regional or base
flood elevations and other information
located in the appendix on
page 3 of this ordinance. The community
shall provide the most up to
date appendix to the DNR and FEMA
regional offices.
(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.
The regional floodplain areas are divided
into three districts as follows:
(a) The Floodway District (FW) is the
channel of a river or stream and
those portions of the floodplain adjoining
the channel required to carry
the regional floodwaters.
(b) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that
portion of the floodplain between the
regional flood limits and the floodway.
(c) The General Floodplain District
(GFP) is those areas that have been
or may be covered by floodwater
during the regional flood.
(4) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN
BOUNDARIES. Discrepancies between
boundaries on the official floodplain zoning
map and actual field conditions shall
be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs
(a) or (b) below. If a significant
difference exists, the map shall be
amended according to Section 17.1207.
The Zoning Administrator supported by
engineering can rely on a boundary derived
from a profile elevation to grant or
deny a land use building permit, whether
or not a map amendment is required. The
Zoning Administrator or a designee shall
be responsible for documenting actual
pre-development field conditions and the
basis upon which the district boundary
was determined and for initiating any
map amendments required under this section.
Disputes between the Zoning Administrator
or a designee and an applicant
over the district boundary line shall be
settled according to Section
17.1050(c)(3) and the criteria in (a) and
(b) below.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale
and the profile elevations shall determine
the district boundary. The
regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist,
the location of the boundary shall be
determined by the map scale, visual
on-site inspection and any information
provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are
based on established base flood elevations
from a FIRM, FEMA must
City of Oak Creek
17-55
also approve any map amendment
pursuant to Section 17.1207(a)(6).
(5) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM
FLOODPLAIN. Compliance with the
provisions of this ordinance shall not be
grounds for removing land from the
floodplain unless it is filled at least two
feet above the regional or base flood elevation,
the fill is contiguous to land outside
the floodplain, and the map is
amended pursuant to Section 17.1207.
Note: This procedure does not remove
the requirements for the mandatory purchase
of flood insurance. The property
owner must contact FEMA to request a
Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
(6) COMPLIANCE. Any development or
use within the areas regulated by this ordinance
shall be in compliance with the
terms of this ordinance, and other applicable
local, state, and federal regulations.
(7) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE
AGENCIES REGULATED. Unless specifically
exempted by law, all cities, villages,
towns, and counties are required to
comply with this ordinance and obtain all
necessary permits. State agencies are required
to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats.,
applies. The construction, reconstruction,
maintenance and repair of state highways
and bridges by the Wisconsin Department
of Transportation is exempt when s.
30.2022, applies.
(8) ABROGATION AND GREATER
RESTRICTIONS.
(a) This ordinance supersedes all the
provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under s. 62.23 or
s. 87.30, Stats., which relate to
floodplains. If another ordinance is
more restrictive than this ordinance,
that ordinance shall continue in full
force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(b) This ordinance is not intended to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing
deed restrictions, covenants or
easements. If this ordinance imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions
of this ordinance shall prevail.
(9) INTERPRETATION. In their interpretation
and application, the provisions of
this ordinance are the minimum requirements
liberally construed in favor of the
Common Council and are not a limitation
on or repeal of any other powers granted
by Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of

ordinance.
(10) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF
LIABILITY. The flood protection standards
in this ordinance are based on engineering
experience and scientific research.
Larger floods may occur or the
flood height may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This ordinance
does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain
areas or permitted floodplain
uses will be free from flooding and flood
damages. Nor does this ordinance create
liability on the part of, or a cause of action
against, the municipality or any officer
or employee thereof for any flood
damage that may result from reliance on
this ordinance.

which meets the requirements of ch. NR
116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These
annexed lands are described on the municipality’s
official zoning map. County
floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated
by reference for the purpose of administering
this section and are on file in
the office of the municipal zoning administrator.
All plats or maps of annexation
shall show the regional flood elevations
and the location of the floodway.
(13) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT
STANDARDS. The community shall review
all permit applications to determine
whether proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed
building site is in a flood-prone area,
all new construction and substantial
improvements shall be designed or modified
and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of
the structure resulting from hydrodynamic

and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage; be
constructed by methods and practices that
minimize flood damages; and be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities designed
and/or located so as to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of
flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed
for compliance with the above standards.
All subdivision proposals (including
manufactured home parks) shall include
regional flood elevation and floodway data
for any development that meets the
subdivision definition of this ordinance.

planning, diversified location of structures, diversified
building types, and/or mixing of compatible uses.
Such developments are intended to provide a safe and
efficient system for pedestrian and vehicle traffic; to
provide attractive recreation and open spaces as integral
parts of the developments; to enable economic
design in the location of public and private utilities
and community facilities; and to ensure adequate
standards of construction and planning. The PUD
Overlay District under this Chapter will allow for
flexibility of overall development design with benefits
from such design flexibility intended to be derived
by both the developer and the community, while
at the same time maintaining insofar as possible the
land use density and other standards or use requirements
set forth in the underlying basic zoning district.
(a) Permitted Uses. Uses permitted in a Planned
Unit Development Overlay District shall
conform to uses permitted in the underlying
base zoning district, as more particularly set
forth in the specific PUD Overlay District

Unit Development Overlay District. FolCity
of Oak Creek
17-64
lowing the public hearing, the Common
Council shall decide whether the Planned
Unit Development Overlay District application
is to be granted or denied.
(e) Basis for Approval of the Application.
(1) The City Plan Commission in making its
recommendation and the Common Council
in makings its determination, shall
consider:
a. That the applicants for the proposed
Planned Development Overlay District
have indicated that they intend to
begin and complete the physical development
of the PUD within a time
frame approved by the Common
Council, after recommendation by the
Plan Commission.
b. That the proposed Planned Unit Development
Overlay District is consistent
in all respects to the purpose of
this Section and to the spirit and intent
of this Chapter; is in conformity with
the adopted master plan or any adopted
component thereof; and, that the
development would not be contrary to
the general welfare and economic
prosperity of the community.
c. The constraint or burden that will be
imposed on public services and facilities,
such as fire and police protection,
street maintenance, and maintenance
of public areas by the proposed development.
d. All property to be included in a
Planned Unit Development Overlay
District shall be held in single ownership.
However if there is more than
one (1) owner, the applicants shall
create a property owners association;
whose responsibility it shall be to
agree upon any plan prior to it being
presented to the Plan Commission for
approval and, thereafter, shall be the
responsible entity for the maintenance
of the exterior of all buildings, as well
as all common areas within its
Planned Unit Development Overlay
District. The by-laws of this association,
which contain its duties and responsibilities,
shall be first approved
by the Plan Commission and shall be
written so that all subsequent amendments
shall also have to be approved
by the Plan Commission before they
can take effect.
e. The proposed site shall be provided
with adequate drainage facilities for
surface and storm waters.
f. The proposed site shall be accessible
from public roads that are adequate to
carry the traffic that can be expected
to be generated by the proposed development.
g. The streets and driveways on the site
of the proposed development shall be
adequate to serve the residents of the
proposed development and shall meet
the minimum standards of all applicable
ordinances or administrative regulations
of the City.
h. Public water and sewer facilities shall
be provided.
i. Adequate guarantee is provided for
permanent preservation of open space
areas as shown on the approved site
plan either by private reservation and
maintenance or by dedication to the
public.
(2) That in the case of a proposed residential
Planned Unit Development Overlay District:
a. Such development will create an attractive
residential environment of
sustained desirability and economic
stability, including structures in relation
to terrain, consideration of safe
pedestrian flow, ready access to recreation
space, and coordination with
overall plans for the community.
b. The total net residential density within
the Planned Unit Development Overlay
District will be consistent with development
permitted in the underlying
basic use district. The district area,
width, and yard requirements of the
underlying basic use district may be
modified, however, in no case shall
the average density in the district exceed
the number of dwelling units that
would have been permitted on that
amount of land if the PUD Planned
Unit Development Overlay District
regulations had not been utilized. This
allows for transfer of density within a
site, but not an increase in density.
c. Each residential planned unit development,
having more than one property
owner involved and featuring common
open space or other common improvements,
shall be managed by a
Property Owners’ Association, or other
appropriate management mechanism,
to assure that any common facilities
are properly maintained. A
copy of the by-laws of the management
association shall be included
City of Oak Creek
17-65

Planned Unit Development Overlay
District:
a. The proposed development will be
adequately served by off-street parking
and truck service facilities.
b. The locations for entrances and exits
have been designated to prevent unnecessary
interference with the safe
and efficient movement of traffic on
surrounding streets, and that the development
will not create an adverse
effect upon the general traffic pattern
of the surrounding neighborhood.
c. The architectural design, landscaping,
control of lighting, and general site
development will result in an attractive
and harmonious service area
compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood.
d. Each commercial planned unit development
featuring common open space
or other common improvements shall
be managed by a Property Owner’s
Association, or other appropriate
management mechanism, to assure
that any common facilities are properly
maintained. A copy of the by-laws
of the management association shall
be included with the PUD application.
(4) That in the case of a proposed industrial
Planned Unit Development Overlay District:
a. The operational character, physical
plant arrangement, and architectural
design of buildings will be compatible
with the latest in performance standards
and development design and will
not result in adverse effect upon the
surrounding neighborhood.
b. The proposed development will include
adequate provisions for offstreet
parking and truck service areas
and will be adequately served by rail
and/or arterial highway facilities.
c. Each industrial planned unit development
featuring common open space or
other common improvements shall be
managed by a Property Owner’s Association,
or other appropriate management
mechanism, to assure that
any common facilities are properly
maintained. A copy of the by-laws of
the management association shall be
included with the PUD application.
(f) Determination. The Common Council, after due
consideration, may deny the application, approve
the application as submitted, or approve
the application subject to additional conditions
and restrictions; including but not limited to,
beginning and completing the physical development
of the PUD within a time frame approved
by the Common Council, after recommendation
by the Plan Commission and that the
City shall be a part of the approval process for
any amendment to the by-laws of the Property
Owners’ Association. The approval of a
Planned Unit Development Overlay District
shall be based upon and include as conditions
thereto the building, site and operational plans
for the development as approved by the City
Council. The approval of a planned unit development,
and the attendant conditions of approval,
shall be applicable to the developer, his
heirs, successors, or assigns.
(g) Existing Planned Developments. All properties
with planned development zoning, on the effective
date of this Chapter, which remain planned
developments after the effective date of this
Chapter are hereby declared to be conforming
planned developments. Such planned developments
shall be subject to the regulations contained
in the resolution or ordinance which authorized
and approved the planned development.
(h) Changes and Additions Prior to Final PUD Approval.
Any change or addition to the plans or
uses prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit
shall first be submitted for approval to the
City Plan Commission and if in the opinion of
the Plan Commission, such change or addition
constitutes a substantial alteration of the original
plan, a public hearing before the Plan
Commission shall be required and notice thereof
be given pursuant to the provisions of Section
17.1300 of this Chapter, and said proposed
alterations shall be submitted to the Common
Council for approval after a public hearing.
(i) Subsequent Land Division. The division of any
land or lands within a Planned Unit Development
Overlay District for the purpose of change
or conveyance of ownership shall be accomplished
pursuant to the land division regulations
of the City and when such division is contemplated,
a subdivision plat or certified survey
map, as may be appropriate, of the lands to be
divided shall accompany the application for
PUD approval.
(j) Changes and Additions to the PUD After Final
Approval.
City of Oak Creek
17-66
(1) Any change in occupancy within an approved
planned unit development project
shall be administered in the same manner
as a change in occupancy in a basic use
district as set forth in Section 17.1006 of
this Chapter. A certificate of compliance
shall not be issued to a use that is not consistent
with conditions placed on approval
in any PUD district.
(2) Any addition to a planned unit development
in years subsequent to construction
and occupancy shall be considered a
new and separate proposal, and shall be
required to comply with all of the review
and approval requirements of this district,
including the requirement for submittal of
development plans and the conduct of public
hearings required by this section.
Ordinance 2907, A 8/6/18, Sec. 17.0325
SEC. 17.0326 ADJUSTMENTS TO MINIMUM
AREA REQUIREMENTS.
The purpose of this section is to allow adjustments to
the minimum area requirements for the creation of a
Planned Unit Development (PUD) district. Reducing
the minimum area requirements, where justified, will
allow for the more efficient development of certain
properties that are less likely to develop under a conventional
zoning district due to such limiting factors
as shape, size and accessibility. The Plan Commission
may recommend approval to the Common Council
of a request for a PUD district on a property, that
does not meet the minimum area requirements as set
forth in Section 17.0325(b), by at least a ¾ majority
vote of the Commissioners present at a meeting, but
only if supplemental design elements, reduced density
or other improvements, requested by the Plan Commission,
are incorporated into the project, which
compensate for the modification of this minimum area
standard.

DEVELOPMENT-PUD
Proposed developments contemplated by an applicant
to include design features described as “traditional
neighborhood development” in Wisconsin Statutes
Sec. 66.1027(1)(c)(1999-2000 Statutes) may be considered
for approval at locations determined appropriate
by the City under this section as a Planned Unit
Development.
A document identified as “A MODEL ORDINANCE
FOR TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD
DEVELOPMENT”, dated December, 2000, published
by the University of Wisconsin Extension pursuant
to Wisconsin Statutes sec. 66.1027(2), shall
serve as a non-exclusive guidebook to assist in further
defining the various aspects of this form of urban design,
along with such other sources of guidance the
Plan Commission and local governing body may
choose to consult.
Ordinance 2170, A 12/18/01, Sec. 17.0327
SEC. 17.0328 LAKEFRONT OVERLAY
DISTRICT
The City of Oak Creek (the “City”) borders approximately
five miles of Lake Michigan, a navigable body
of water.
By virtue of Section 281.31 Wis. Stats., State of Wisconsin
adopted the navigable waters protection law to
aid in the fulfillment of the state’s role as trustee of its
navigable waters and to promote public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare in order to establish
policies, make plans and authorize municipal
shoreland regulations for the efficient use, conservation,
development and protection of the state’s water
resources.
The purposes of the navigable waters protection law
is to further the maintenance of safe and healthful
conditions; prevent and control water pollution; protect
spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control
building sites, placement of structure and land uses
and reserve shore cover and natural beauty.
Pursuant to Wisconsin Statute, Section 281.31, the
Department of Natural Resources was directed to
prepare a comprehensive plan, based on the use classification
of navigable waters and the shorelands to
be governed by the following general standards:
1. Domestic uses shall be generally preferred.
2. Uses not inherently a source of pollution
within an area shall be preferred over uses
that are or may be a pollution source.
3. Areas in which the existing or potential
economic value of public, recreational or
similar uses exceeds the existing or potential
economic value of any other use shall be
classified primarily on the basis of the higher
economic use value.
4. Use locations within an area tending to
minimize the possibility of pollution shall be
preferred over use locations tending to increase
that possibility.
5. Use dispersions within an area shall be
preferred over concentrations of uses of their
undue proximity to each other.

Ordinance 2227, A 01/07/03, Sec. 17.0328
SEC. 17.0329 GENERAL 27TH STREET
OVERLAY DISTRICTS DESIGN STANDARDS.
Coordinated efforts between the City of Oak Creek
and the City of Franklin have resulted in the creation
of four overlay districts along the 27th Street corridor
within Oak Creek. The intent of the 27th Street overlay
districts is to allow current permitted uses to
maintain their permitted use standing while planning
for coordinated development or redevelopment along
the 27th Street corridor.
Whether the current use is permitted or special use,
does not change based on the overlay district zoning
until the specific use changes. At that time the new
overlay district zoning and design standards come in
effect.
The intent of the design standards is to provide creative
ideas, stimulate forward thinking, promote quality
design, and preserve designated woodlands and
wetlands as well as ensure that the construction of
buildings, facilities, and properties are compatible
with their surroundings, are attractive, and enhance
the corridor and building design and development
standards established by the City of Oak Creek.
These design standards shall apply to Se. 17.0330
Regional Retail Overlay District, Sec. 17.0331
Mixed-Use/Office/Urban Village Overlay District,
Sec. 17.0332 Mixed-Use Neighborhood Overlay District,
and Sec. 17.0333 Mixed-Use Office Overlay
District and as shown on the Official Zoning Map.
(a) General Design Guidelines
1. Establish and improve the visual character
of the 27th Street corridor to reflect its
role as one of the most prominent entrances
and gateways in the cities of
Franklin and Oak Creek and Milwaukee
County, and to establish a unique, quality
identity for this important corridor.
2. Enhance the destination and market appeal
of the corridor.
3. Design a visually pleasing, safe, and socially
stimulating business district and
destination for Franklin, Oak Creek, and
southern Milwaukee County.
4. Facilitate well-planned, coordinated,
quality private development along and
across the corridor.
5. Ensure that public streets, buildings, infrastructure,
and open spaces set a high
standard for a quality physical environment
throughout the corridor.
6. Enhance the quality of the pedestrian experience
along the corridor by providing
a pleasant experience for business patrons,
employees, and residents.
7. Enhance economic investment for business
and property owners.
8. Protect and conserve neighborhood character,
and establish safe, convenient and
attractive linkages between neighborhoods
and shopping and employment areas.
9. Encourage flexible and individual creativity
rather than uniformity.
10. Promote community awareness of the
physical environment.
11. Preserve and protect environmentally
sensitive areas including woodlands and
wetlands.
(b) Design Principles
1. Land Use
a. Development must provide a mix of
uses that encourage pedestrian activity,
respect the natural topography
and express the street’s cultural
identity. Fostering a mix of retail,
restaurants, offices, service businesses,
light industry, residential,
civic/institutional uses, and public
open spaces is encouraged.
2. Buildings
a. Buildings must be, or appear to be
at least two stories in height to give
scale to the street. Buildings are
located closer to the street to create
a sense of enclosure for the public
sidewalk. Building setbacks provide
space for amenities that enhance
pedestrian activity along the
street.
3. Parking
a. Parking lots must be primarily located
on the sides and rears of
buildings and are shared by two or
more businesses. Large parking areas
contain significant landscape islands
with clear pedestrian walkways.
4. Streets
a. Streets within developments must
be designed to accommodate efficient
traffic flow and multiple
transportation choices including automobiles,
bicycles, buses, and possible
other mass transit options.
5. Walkability
City of Oak Creek
17-69
a. Sidewalks/terrace areas within developments
must be a minimum of
ten (10) feet wide with a six (6)
foot unobstructed sidewalk zone
and minimum four (4) foot wide
terrace next to the public street.
Street furnishings are provided in
the terrace to enhance the pedestrian
character and use of the street
including pedestrian scale lighting,
benches, bicycle racks, information
kiosks, etc. Crosswalks are clearly
marked and include pedestrian refuge
islands for safe pedestrian and
bicycle crossings.
6. Landscaping
a. Street trees must be provided to
shade the sidewalk, provide a sense
of enclosure for the street, and visually
unify the blockface.
(c) Design Standards
The following general design standards provide
overarching design principles that area
common to all new construction and renovation
projects along the 27th Street corridor.
These standards fit into four (4) functional
categories: blockface design, building design,
site design, and streetscape design.
1. Blockface Design
The buildings and sites along 27th Street
are not isolated structures. The placement
and appearance of the buildings,
sites, and signs contribute to the character
of the entire block and ultimately to
the character of the street. A blockface
is one side of a street block. Because
27th Street runs north and south, the
blockface along the street area oriented
either east or west. When the buildings
along a street block are closely spaced
or contiguous, the blockface becomes a
cohesive vertical element or “street
wall”. The opposing blockfaces along
the street create a series of relatively
parallel street walls that – to varying
degrees – enclose the public streetscape
and create outdoor, linear “rooms”.
a. The general guidelines for how private
property owners can improve
the blockface design include:
1) Coordinate building and site
designs with adjoining properties.
2) Promote shared driveways
and parking.
3) Use landscaping and furnishings
to enhance the public
sidewalk.
4) Consider infill development
and landscaping to create a
continuous blockface.
b. Circulation and Access
1) The internal transportation
network for new developments
or redevelopment of
existing properties shall be
designed to accommodate all
modes of transportation and
incorporate a network of interconnecting
streets and
blocks with respect to the natural
landscape. The internal
transportation network shall
provide alternate routes to
every destination, distributing
automobile traffic and shortening
walking distances.
2) Commercial buildings shall
incorporate pedestrian walkways
and open spaces and encourage
safe movement
through their site and to the
surrounding area. Such
walkways shall be connected
with public streets in an engaging
and identifiable manner
and conflicts between pedestrians
and vehicles shall be
minimized, to the extent possible.
3) Development that maximizes
the opportunity to preserve
and access adjacent natural
and scenic areas including
Falk Park, the Root River
Corridor, and the Oak Creek
Corridor is expected.
4) Loading docks and other service
requirements shall be
placed at the rear of buildings
and accessed from service
driveways. Pedestrian areas
and customer parking areas
shall be separated from these
areas.
2. Building Design
The design of buildings is a key part of
shaping a positive and attractive character
for the 27th Street corridor. New
buildings and renovation of existing
buildings shall enliven the public
streetscape, complement the character
of adjacent buildings, and provide inviting
entrances to pedestrians. Building
designs shall be sustainable, as well.
“Green” architecture, which uses water,
City of Oak Creek
17-70
energy, and other natural resources
more efficiently, is encouraged.
a. General design parameters for
building design include:

by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers,
the City may deny the application,
require a size
City of Oak Creek
17-75
reduction in the proposed
development, or require
that the developer construct
and/or pay for required
off-site improvements.
3. Site Design
Site design refers to the physical arrangement
of buildings, walkways, parking lots,
landscaping, and other elements on a property.
The placement of these elements of the
site will contribute to the functional and aesthetic
character of the site and the entire 27th
Street corridor. For example, sites with
large front parking areas or large setbacks
generally contribute little to the aesthetic
quality or walkability of 27th Street. Site development
that places well-designed buildings
closer to the street will strengthen the
character and spatial enclosure of the street.
a. The general guidelines for how private
property owners shall improve their
sites include:
1) Locate buildings close to the street.
2) Connect entrances with public
sidewalks.
3) Avoid parking in front yards.
4) Provide attractive landscaping/
outdoor spaces.
5) Utilize woodlands and wetlands as
functional open spaces.
6) Complement the public
“streetscape”.
7) Locating and screening trash and
utility areas away from the street.
8) Promote crime prevention through
environmental design.
9) Employ sustainable design practices.
b. Parking
1) Parking lots shall be landscaped
around the perimeter to screen the
view from public streets.
2) Parking lots shall include landscape
islands to break up large surface areas.
A common standard is a nine
(9) foot landscape island for every
linear row of ten (10) to fifteen (15)
parking spaces.
3) Parking for new buildings shall be
primarily located at the rear and on
the sides of the building for buildings
fronting 27th Street. If parking
in front cannot be avoided, landscaping
shall be provided between
the parking area and the public
street. For existing properties,
where the site permits, parking in
the front shall be relocated to the
side and rear of the building as
properties redevelop.
4) For properties such as gas stations -
-where front parking cannot be removed
– walkways, landscaping,
architectural features, and lighting
shall be provided to make these areas
more attractive and inviting.
Decorative fences, walls, and/or
landscaped edges shall screen front
parking areas from the public sidewalk.
Screening shall not exceed
forty-two (42) inches in height.
5) Large parking areas shall include
walkways to allow safe pedestrians
access to the building entrance and
connect the site to adjacent streets
and properties. Pedestrian walkways
shall be designed with amenities
such as special paving treatments
(colored paver blocks or textured
concrete), lighting, and furnishings
to create a pedestrian
friendly character.
6) Parking lots shall be connected with
adjoining lots where practical.
c. Landscaping, Lighting, and Site Furnishings.
1) All landscaping standards in the
City of Oak Creek Zoning Code
Section 17.1010 shall be upheld in
all 27th Street corridor overlay districts.
2) Lighting styles and fixtures shall
complement the architectural design
and coordinate with lighting in
the larger development or on adjacent
properties.
3) Light fixtures shall have a cut-off or
beveled prism light that directs
lighting toward the ground to minimize
off-site impacts. Higher
lighting levels shall be provided for
pedestrian use areas. Low-level
building and landscape accent lighting
is encouraged, where appropriate.
4) Lighting and site furnishings
(benches, trash receptacles, bicycle
racks, etc.) shall be designed to
complement the character of the
building, and provide an attractive
and strong relationship with adjoining
properties and the public sidewalk.
5) Bicycle storage facilities shall be
located near the building entrance.
City of Oak Creek
17-76
6) Screen fences and/or landscaped
buffers shall be provided at property
edges, particularly where commercial
and light industrial properties
adjoin residential properties.
7) New streets as proposed as part of
new developments shall provide
“pedestrian friendly” streetscape
with on-street parking.
d. Environment
1) All environmentally sensitive areas
such as wetlands and woodlands as
designated by the City Engineer
shall remain uninterrupted.
2) All primary and secondary environmental
corridors and isolated
natural areas as recorded by the
Southeastern Wisconsin Regional
Planning Commission shall remain
uninterrupted.
3) Development shall not negatively
impact any environmentally sensitive
areas.
e. Signage
Building signage shall fit with and enhance
the character of a building and the
overall environment of the 27th Street
corridor. The 27th Street area shall be
designated a special signage district to
ensure well-designed and cohesive signage
in the gateway corridor into the cities
of Oak Creek and Franklin and Milwaukee
County.
1) Preferred sign types include signs
integrated into the design of the
building, along a sign band, window
signs, awning signs, projecting
signs, and monument signs of six
(6) to eight (8) feet in height.
2) Natural landscaping features shall
be used in conjunction with monument
signs.
3) Signs shall be simple and easy to
read and include street names and
addresses prominently.
4) Sign colors shall relate to and complement
the primary colors of the
building façade.
5) Sign design and placement shall fit
the character of the building and
not obscure architectural details.
6) Signage shall be centered within the
prescribed signage area of the
building.
7) Large pylon or post mounted box
signs are prohibited on 27th Street.
8) Plastic, internally illuminated signs
are not allowed.
9) Window signs shall not exceed fifty
(50) percent of the total window area.
10) Billboards or signs on roofs, dormers,
and balconies are not allowed.
11) Signs affixed to the exterior of a
building shall be architecturally
compatible with the style, composition,
materials, colors, and details
of the building, as well as with other
signs used on the building or its
vicinity.
4. Streetscape Design
The 27th Street/State Highway 41 corridor
has long served as an auto-oriented commercial
district and a major arterial street that
historically provided a direct truck route between
Milwaukee and Chicago. Public input
during the 27th Street Corridor Planning process
has identified the need to create a highquality
urban atmosphere for the 27th Street
corridor. The following are standards for
public street improvements to accomplish
this goal.
a. The general design standards for public
street improvements include:
1) Establish gateways and districts.
2) Accommodate multiple transportation
modes (e.g., transit, autos, pedestrians,
bicyclists).
3) Create and enhance pedestrian safety
and comfort (e.g., crosswalks,
lighting).
4 Visually ‘unify’ the streetscape
(lighting, street trees, and street
furniture).
5) Reduce visual ‘clutter’ (private
signage and overhead utilities).
b. These standards are divided into four
(4) parts:
1) Street Design
a. Sidewalks

curb ramps at all
crosswalks.
(ii) Provide refuge islands at
all crosswalk locations that
are wide enough for pedestrian
and bicyclists.
(iii) Provide pedestrian activated
crossing lights,
(countdown pedestrian
walk lights) at key signalized
intersections.
c. Medians
(i) The nose of the median
shall fully enclose the
crosswalk and be wide
enough to allow safe refuge
for multiple pedestrians
and bicyclists.
(ii) Provide landscaping, lighting,
and banners.
(iii) Sections of medians that
are too narrow for landscaping
shall be paved
with special colored paving
in lieu of plain concrete
to visually break up
the wide expanse of
pavement and add character
to the area.
(iv) Explore having businesses,
or business association,
fund special median landscape
treatments.
d. Bicycle Circulation
(i) Establish a continuous bicycle
system on both sides
of 27th Street through eight
to ten foot wide off-street
multi-use paths within the
right-of-way.

visual interest and
seasonal variety in compliance
with WISDOT
standards. Street trees
shall have the same characteristics
of both sides of
the street in a given block.
(ii) Provide low maintenance,
perennial plantings in the
medians. Higher maintenance
plantings can be
provided if individuals or
groups take responsibility
for contracting out annual
planting and maintenance.
d. Street Furniture and Amenities
(i) Street furniture and amenities

shall be coordinated with other
City of Oak Creek
17-78
design features such as lighting,
furnishings, and street banners.
Entrance features and signage
shall be located to avoid clutter
and confusion with other signage.
c. The 27th Street Corridor Land
Use Plan recommends a full
highway interchange at the intersection
of 27th Street and I-

or public improvements
shall be used at this interchange
to identify this as an important
community gateway.
d. All intersections shall be beautified
with landscaping and signage
features that are scaled and
proportional to respond to both
the pedestrian and vehicular
travelers.

shall be designed that directs
visitors to the many public
destinations located along and
around 27th Street, and in both
communities, such as the medical
centers, the airport, park and
ride facilities, parks, libraries,
community centers, etc.
b. Wayfinding signage shall be located
in the terrace or median.
5) Regulatory Signage
a. Opportunities to reduce the
number of regulatory signs shall
be evaluated to limit signage
clutter and improve the visual

landscaped areas; which may be landscape
islands, landscape peninsulas or peripheral
plantings totaling not less than five (5) percent
of the surfaced area. For parking lots designed
for twenty-five (25) parking spaces or
more, at least one-half of the minimum five (5)
percent landscaped area shall be within the
parking lot. When parking lots are extended,
these regulations shall apply only to the extended
portion of the parking lot. Location of landscape
areas, plant materials, protection afforded
the plantings, including curbing and provision
for maintenance shall be subject to approval by
the City Plan Commission. Landscape islands
or peninsulas shall be dispersed throughout the
off-street parking area. All plans for such proposed
parking areas shall include a topographic
survey or grading plan which shows existing
and proposed grades and location of improvements.
The preservation of existing trees,
shrubs, and other natural vegetation in the parking
area may be included in the calculation of
the required minimum landscape area. (See Illustrations

SEC. 17.0404 ADJUSTMENTS TO REQUIRED
PARKING
The purpose of this section is to allow adjustments to
the minimum number of parking spaces required to
avoid constructing unneeded and excessive off-street
parking facilities. Reducing the amount of excess offstreet
parking facilities is intended to provide for
more cost-efficient site development, to eliminate
constructing more impervious surface than necessary,
to minimize storm water runoff, to avoid construction
of unnecessarily large storm water management facilities,
and to provide more landscape areas and open
space on commercial and industrial sites. To achieve
these purposes, the Plan Commission may reduce the
minimum number of required off-street parking spaces
in specific cases as described in this section.
(a) Adjustments. In all districts, the minimum
number of required parking spaces may be adjusted
by the Plan Commission on a case-bycase
basis. The petitioner for such an adjustment
shall show to the satisfaction of the Plan
Commission that adequate parking will be provided
for customers, clients, visitors, and employees.
The following provisions and factors
shall be used as a basis to adjust parking requirements:
(1) Evidence That Actual Parking Demands
Will Be Less Than Ordinance Requirements.
The petitioner shall submit written
documentation and data to the satisfaction
of the Plan Commission that the operation
will require less parking than the
Chapter requires.
(2) Availability of Shared Parking. The petitioner
shall submit written documentation
to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission
that off-site shared parking spaces
are available within 400 feet of the lot
line and within the same block to satisfy
the parking demand. When a reduction of
parking spaces attributable to shared
parking is requested, the petitioner shall
submit written verification that such parking
is available and shall include copies
of any contracts, joint lease agreements,
City of Oak Creek
17-92
purchase agreements, and other such
documentation to show that such shared
parking can be accomplished. Any and all
such agreements shall be recorded with
the Milwaukee County Register of Deeds,
at the applicants expense, and a copy of
the recorded agreement shall be filed with
the City Clerk. The off-site shared parking
spaces shall be clearly posted for the
joint use of employees, and/or tenants, or
customers of each respective use sharing
those spaces.
(3) Use of Optional Modes of Transportation.
Upon demonstration to the Plan
Commission that effective alternative
transportation to the automobile will occur
within 12 months following the issuance
of the certificate of compliance, the
Plan Commission may reduce parking requirements.
Optional modes of transportation
may include, but is not limited to,
bus transit, van pool operations, car
pool/ride sharing, and bicycles. Parking
management plans/operations may also
be used as a basis to reduce required
parking. Parking management plans may
include, but are not limited to, flexible
working hours or shifts, preferential parking
for car pools/van pools, transit/van
pool fare subsidy, imposition of a charge
for parking, and establishment of a transportation
coordinator to implement car
pool, van pool, and transit programs.
Proposals for adjustments of parking requirements
under this section shall show
how the alternative transportation modes
will be implemented, the permanency of
such modes, extent of the program, the
number of vehicles the mode will replace,
and other pertinent information.
(4) All businesses that cater to customers
who drive vehicles larger than what can
be accommodated in a 10’ X 20’ parking
space, shall provide the appropriate number
of parking spaces and access aisles to
accommodate these vehicles.
(b) Space to be Set Aside for Reduced Parking.
The site plan for the commercial or industrial

additional parking spaces otherwise required by
this Chapter. Such open space shall be in addition
to required yards, setbacks, driveways, private
streets, loading and service areas. Sufficient
open space shall be provided which, if
converted to parking spaces, would provide offstreet
parking to meet the full requirements of
this Chapter at the time of application.
(c) Changes in Occupancy or Use. When the use of
a building, structure, or land is changed to another
use or occupancy that requires more parking
spaces than required for the use existing
immediately prior to such change, additional
parking spaces shall be constructed for the new
use or occupancy in the amount necessary to
conform to this Chapter prior to the issuance of
a Certificate of Occupancy for the new use.
(d) Changes in Intensity of Use. When the intensity
of use of a building, structure or land is increased
by an addition of employees, gross
floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of
measurement, additional parking spaces shall
be constructed for such additions in the amount
necessary to conform to this Chapter.
(e) Plan Commission Review and Verification. The
Plan Commission shall review the adequacy of
parking where an adjustment to parking requirements
has been granted within one year
following such parking modification grant--and
periodically thereafter--to determine that the
conditions justifying the parking requirement
still exist. If the parking is found to be inadequate,
the Plan Commission shall order the use
of the property to comply with the parking requirements
set forth in Section 17.0403(I) of
this Chapter.

SEC. 17.0504 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION
SITES
(a) Background and Purpose. Recent advances in
wireless communications technology have resulted
in a new generation of telecommunication
services. These new services transmit electromagnetic
waves of such a frequency and
power that will likely require numerous antenna
locations. These antennas may be located on
buildings, water towers and other similar structures
but will also frequently be located on new
or enlarged towers. This requires that the City
of Oak Creek regulate these wireless communication
system facilities in a different manner
than conventional television and radio transmission
towers, which are able to transmit their
signals at much greater distances.
A number of providers of wireless communication
services have recently been licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission and additional
providers are expected to be licensed in
the near future. These firms are expected to
pursue antenna sites within the City of Oak
Creek and these efforts are expected to include
requests to construct new communication towers.
The intent of this proposed regulation is to provide
for the establishment and or expansion of
wireless telecommunication services within the
City of Oak Creek while protecting neighborhoods
and minimizing the adverse visual and
operational effects of wireless telecommunications
facilities through careful design, siting and
screening. More specifically this regulation has
been developed in order to:
• Maximize use of existing and approved
towers and other structures to accommodate
new antennas and transmitters in order
to reduce the number of communication
towers needed to serve the community;
• Encourage providers to co-locate their facilities
on a single tower;
• Minimize the location of facilities in visually
sensitive areas;
• Encourage creative design measures to
camouflage facilities;
• Protect residential areas from potential adverse
impacts of communication towers;
• Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties
from tower failure through engineering
and careful siting of tower structures.
(b) Location Preferences. The locations for siting
the equipment involved in receiving or transmitting
electromagnetic waves associated with wireless teleCity
of Oak Creek
17-99
communication services are listed in the following
order of preference.
1. On existing structures such as buildings,
water towers and utility poles.
2. On existing towers that otherwise meet local,
State and Federal regulations.
3. On new towers less than 100 feet in height
located in institutional zones.
4. On new towers 100 feet or greater in
height located in institutional zones.
5. On new towers less than 100 feet in height
located in commercial or industrial zones.
6. On new towers 100 feet or greater in
height located in commercial and industrial
zones.
7. On new towers less than 100 feet in height
located in residential zones.
8. On new towers 100 feet or greater in
height located in residential zones.
(c) Permitted Uses. The following uses which,
generally pose minimum adverse visual effect
shall be permitted without review by the City of
Oak Creek Plan Commission. Such permitted
uses must obtain a building permit, and are subject
to the submittal requirements established in
Sections 17.1004 and 17.0504(e) of the Municipal
Code.
1. Wireless telecommunications sites where
the antenna is mounted to existing buildings,
towers, utility poles, water towers,
light standards or other structures provided
the following standards are met:
a. No changes are made to the height of
such structure.
b. No panel antenna shall exceed 72
inches in height and 24 inches in
width.
c. No dish antenna shall exceed 3 feet in
diameter.
d. All accompanying equipment buildings
or boxes shall be screened and
fenced as approved by the City of
Oak Creek as part of the site plan review.
(d) Uses Allowed Only by Conditional Use Permit.
Wireless telecommunications sites not otherwise
permitted in subsection (c) shall be considered
conditional uses in all zoning districts.
In addition to specific requirements listed in
Subsections (f) and (g), the standards provided
in Section 17.1007 shall also apply to applications
submitted under this section. Section
17.1007 shall also apply to application procedures,
hearing and notice requirements.
(e) Site Plan Requirements. All proposals to develop
a wireless telecommunication site shall
be subject to the site plan requirements listed in
Section 17.1009 of these regulations. In addition
the following information shall be submitted:

licensed engineer and that the interference
cannot be prevented or eliminated
at a reasonable cost as determined
by the Plan Commission.
b. The planned equipment cannot be accommodated
on existing or approved
towers due to structural deficiencies
as documented by a qualified licensed
engineer and that such deficiencies
cannot be eliminated at a reasonable
cost as determined by the Plan Commission.
c. The existing or planned equipment on
an existing or approved tower would
cause unacceptable interference with
the equipment proposed by the applicant
as documented by a qualified licensed
engineer and that the interference

of this regulation, start of construction shall be
defined as the installation of a permanent building
foundation or slab. The Common Council
may grant up to two six-month extensions of the
time to start construction upon written request by
the applicant. The Common Council shall not
approve an extension unless the development
plan is brought into conformance with any relevant
zoning regulations, which have been
amended subsequent to the original approval and
unless the applicant provides adequate evidence
that construction is able to begin within the extended
time period sought. The Common Council

effective date of this Chapter or amendment.
SEC. 17.0906 FLOODLAND NONCONFORMING
USES
(a) GENERAL
(1) APPLICABILITY. If these standards conform
with s. 59.69(10), Stats., for counties
or s. 62.23(7)(h), Stats., for cities and villages,
they shall apply to all modifications
or additions to any nonconforming use or
structure and to the use of any structure or
premises which was lawful before the passage
of this ordinance or any amendment
thereto.
(2) The existing lawful use of a structure or its
accessory use which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this ordinance may
continue subject to the following conditions:
a. No modifications or additions to a nonconforming
use or structure shall be
permitted unless they comply with this
ordinance. The words “modification”
and “addition” include, but are not limited
to, any alteration, addition, modification,
structural repair, rebuilding or
replacement of any such existing use,
structure or accessory structure or use.
Ordinary maintenance repairs are not
considered an extension, modification
or addition; these include painting, decorating,
paneling and the replacement of
doors, windows and other nonstructural
components and the maintenance, repair
or replacement of existing private sewage
or water supply systems or connections
to public utilities. Ordinary
maintenance repairs do not include any
costs associated with the repair of a
damaged structure.
The construction of a deck that does not
exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent
to the exterior wall of a principal
structure is not an extension, modification
or addition. The roof of the structure
may extend over a portion of the
deck in order to provide safe ingress
and egress to the principal structure.
b. If a nonconforming use or the use of a
nonconforming structure is discontinued
for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer
permitted and any future use of the
property, and any structure or building
thereon, shall conform to the applicable
requirements of this ordinance;
c. The municipality shall keep a record
which lists all nonconforming uses and
nonconforming structures, their present
equalized assessed value, the cost of all
modifications or additions which have
been permitted, and the percentage of
the structure’s total current value those
modifications represent;
d. No modification or addition to any nonconforming
structure or any structure
with a nonconforming use, which over
the life of the structure would exceed
50% of its present equalized assessed
value, shall be allowed unless the entire
structure is permanently changed to a
conforming structure with a conforming
use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this ordinance. Contiguous
dry land access must be provided
for residential and commercial uses in
City of Oak Creek
17-116
compliance with Section 17.0323(c)(2).

or addition shall be placed on fill
or floodproofed to the flood protection elevation
in compliance with the standards for
that particular use in Section 17.0323(c),
except where Section 17.0906(c)(2) is applicable.
(2) Where compliance with the provisions of
Section 17.0906(c)(1) would result in unnecessary
hardship and only where the
structure will not be used for human habitation
or be associated with a high flood
damage potential, the Board of Appeals,
using the procedures established in Section
17.1050(c), may grant a variance from
those provisions of Section 17.0906(c)(1)
for modifications or additions, using the
criteria listed below. Modifications or additions
which are protected to elevations
lower than the flood protection elevation
may be permitted if:

found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or
otherwise adverse to the environment or the value
of the neighborhood or the City. Toward this
end, the City Plan Commission shall review the
site, existing and proposed structures, architectural
plans, neighboring uses, parking areas,
driveway locations, highway access, traffic generation
and circulation, drainage, sewerage and
water systems, and the proposed plan of operation.
Conditions such as landscaping, architectural
design, type of construction, construction
commencement and completion dates, sureties,
lighting, fencing, planting screens, operational
control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation,

may be required by the City Plan Commission
upon its finding that these are necessary to
fulfill the purpose and intent of this Chapter.
(f) Compliance with all other provisions of this
Chapter, such as lot width and area, setbacks
height, parking, loading, traffic, and highway access
shall be required of all conditional uses.
(g) Public hearing. The Common Council shall hold

operation in all districts. However, this process
shall not be required in the A-1 Limited Agricultural
District, the ER, Rs-1, Rs-2, Rs-3, Rs-4, and Rd-1
Residential Districts, unless the development site contains
wetlands as shown on either the October 28,
1987, FINAL WETLANDS INVENTORY MAP
issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
or wet areas as shown on the City’s latest
topographic maps or woodlands as shown on the most
recent aerial photos of the City provided by either the
Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission
(SEWRPC) or the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA).
(a) Principles. To implement and define criteria for
the purposes set forth above, the following principles
are established to apply to all new structures
and uses and to changes or additions to existing
structures and uses.
(1) No building shall be permitted if the design
or exterior appearance is of such unorthodox
or abnormal character in relation to its surroundings
as to be unsightly or offensive to
generally accepted taste and community
standards.
(2) No building shall be permitted where any
exposed facade is not constructed or faced
with a finished material which is aesthetically
compatible with the other facades of surrounding
properties and presents an attractive
appearance to the public. Predominant
exterior building materials must be of high
quality. Acceptable exterior materials include
split face concrete masonry, decorative
block, 4-inch brick veneer, 4-inch stone veneer,
cut stone panels, pre-cast concrete wall
panels, and terra cotta. Proposals to use other
materials, including cement fiber products
or cultured stone shall require a 3/4 majority
of the Plan Commission. Materials such as
smooth-faced concrete block, EIFS products
(such as Dryvit) or pre-fabricated steel panels
are not permitted as a primary exterior
building material and shall only be allowed
as an accent material comprising no more
than 25 percent of the visible perimeter of
the building.
i. The façade of a multifamily residential
building shall be provided with an acceptable
brick or decorative masonry
material that covers at least sixty-five
(65) percent of the surface of the total
exterior wall area of the building.
ii. The façade of a manufacturing, commercial,
office, institutional, or park
building shall be finished with an aesthetically
pleasing material. A minimum
of seventy-five (75) percent of the
visible perimeter (see diagram) shall be
finished with an acceptable glass, brick
or decorative masonry material.
iii. Material and color samples shall be
submitted to the Plan Commission for
review and approval.
iv. The Plan Commission has the discretion
to adjust this minimum for building additions.
(3) The relative proportion of a building to its
neighboring buildings or to other existing
buildings shall be maintained or enhanced
when new buildings are built or when existing
buildings are remodeled or altered.
(4) The visual continuity of roofs of neighboring
buildings and their contributing elements
(parapet walls, coping, and cornices) shall
be maintained wherever possible in building
development and redevelopment. A flat roof
appearance is not permitted in commercial
or office and professional business zoning
districts. There must be some type of visible
roof form (parapets, overhanging eaves,
sloped roofs) incorporated into the design of
the building.
(5) No building or sign shall be permitted to be
sited on the property in a manner which
would unnecessarily destroy or substantially
damage the natural beauty of the area, particularly
insofar as it would adversely affect
values incident to ownership of land in that
area; or which would unnecessarily have an
adverse effect on the beauty and general enjoyment
of existing structures on adjoining
properties.
(6) Buildings shall be designed in such a manner
that long expanses of blank wall are broken
up by the use of windows, articulation or
modulation of the building footprint and/or
changes in building materials and colors.
Visible building facades in excess of 100
feet in length must incorporate recesses and
projections along the length of the façade.
Windows, awnings, and arcades must be an
integral part of the façade abutting a public
street.
(7) Each principal building shall have a clearly
defined, highly visible customer entrance
with features such as canopies or porticos,
City of Oak Creek
17-123
arcades, arches, wing walls, and integral
planters.
(8) Sides of a building that are visible from adjoining
residential properties and/or public
streets should contribute to the pleasing
scale features of the building by featuring
characteristics similar to the front façade of
the building.
(9) No building or use shall be permitted that
would have a negative impact on the maintenance
of safe and healthful conditions of the
City.
(10) Buildings and uses shall maintain existing
topography, drainage patterns, and vegetative
cover insofar as is practical. The Plan
Commission may require that drainage
easements be executed.
(11) Appropriate buffers shall be provided between
dissimilar uses as set forth in Section
17.0205(d) of the Municipal Code.
(12) Buildings and uses shall provide for safe and
efficient traffic circulation and driveway locations
as set forth in Section 17.0406
(Highway Access) of the Municipal Code.
(13) Buildings and uses shall be provided with
adequate access to the City’s street and
highway system as set forth in Section
17.0406 (Highway Access) of the Municipal
Code. Adequate street cross-sections appropriate
to the permitted use shall be provided.
e. Access onto major streets should be held
to the minimum necessary to provide safe
and efficient traffic flow as determined
by the Plan Commission.
f. Provisions shall be made for cross access
between compatible commercial developments.
g. Primary access to commercial or manufacturing
developments shall not be
through residentially zoned areas.
(14) Buildings and uses shall provide adequate
parking and loading areas.
a. No loading dock or overhead doors shall
face upon a street right-of-way in commercial
or office and professional business
zoning districts. Loading docks or
overhead doors may face upon a street
right-of-way in manufacturing districts
only in cases where no practical alternative
exists.
b. Uninterrupted parking lots along the full
street frontage of commercial or manufacturing
developments abutting a public
right-of-way are inappropriate, and will
not be permitted, except where the physical
orientation of the lot makes it necessary.
Parking should be directed to the
side or rear of the lot, where it is less visually
intrusive. No more than 50% of the
off-street parking for commercial developments
directly abutting a public rightof-
way shall be located between the front
of the building and the primary abutting
street unless the overall development design
includes smaller buildings on pads
or outlots closer to the street. This
standard applies only to buildings with a
gross floor area in excess of 25,000
square feet.
(15) Each retail or service establishment in excess
of 25,000 square feet gross floor area
must contribute to the establishment or enhancement
of community and public spaces
by providing a community amenity on the
premises such as a patio/seating area, water
feature, clock tower, or pedestrian plaza with
benches. Retail establishments in excess of
100,000 square feet gross floor area must
provide at least two of these amenities.
(16) Sidewalks shall be provided along all sides
of the lot that abut a public street, and a continuous
internal pedestrian walkway must be
provided from the perimeter public sidewalk
to the principal customer entrance. The internal
pedestrian walkways must be distinguished
from driving surfaces through the
use of contrasting materials to enhance pedestrian
safety. Examples of acceptable materials
include, but are not limited to special
pavers, bricks, or scored concrete.
(17) All signs must be designed and constructed
in accordance with Section 17.0706 of the
Municipal Code.
(18) Buildings and uses shall be provided with
adequate public sanitary sewer and water
services as approved by the appropriate utility.
Storm water drainage facilities may be
required.
(19) Buildings and uses shall be provided with
adequate lighting installed in a manner that
does not interfere with users of adjacent
properties.
(20) Buildings and uses shall be provided with
dumpsters and trash receptacles in a number
and location appropriate for the use as de-

termined by the Plan Commission. All
dumpsters shall be fenced and/or screened
from view from street rights-of-way and adjacent
residential uses.
(21) All new buildings, additions and uses shall
make appropriate use of open spaces. A
minimum of 30% of the site shall be set
aside as open space. This required open
space shall be designed as an integral part of
the site, and may not include those areas required
for parking, loading, or other impervious
surfaces. This requirement does not
apply to the redevelopment of sites, including,
but not limited to, the construction of a
new building, additional building, building
addition or expanded parking lot, which do
not meet this minimum requirement at the
time of the adoption of this ordinance. In
those cases, the minimum amount of open
space may not be reduced beyond that which
exists on the property at the time of the
adoption of this ordinance.
(22) Wetlands shall not be cleared, filled or
drained if the development will result in significant
adverse impacts to the functional
values of the affected wetlands, significant
adverse impacts to water quality or other environmental
consequences. They shall be
protected within an overall development
plan for the property. In order to make this
determination, the owner or developer of any
property or properties that are involved with
any of the following shall have any wetland
on the property, as outlined on the 1987 Final
Wetland Inventory Map, identified,
staked and legally described:
a. Rezoning
b. Subdivision Plat
c. Conditional Use
d. Official Map Amendment
e. Certified Survey Map
f. Building Permit
(23) Woodlands shall, to the greatest practical extent
possible, be protected within an overall
development plan for the property. In order
to make this determination, the owner or developer
of any property or properties that are
involved with any of the following shall
have any woodland on the property, as
shown on the most recent SEWRPC or
USDA aerial photo of the City, staked, inventoried
and legally described:
a. Rezoning
b. Subdivision Plat
c. Conditional Use
d. Official Map Amendment
e. Certified Survey Map
f. Building Permit
(24) From a practical standpoint, development
may occur on a cleared or restored site, with
appropriate governmental permits, of up to
20,000 square feet in area; if the wetland and
woodland property is at least five (5) acres
in area and is at least 150 feet in width.
(25) Wetlands may be used in the density calculation
of a development, but in no case shall
they constitute more than twenty-five (25)
percent of the minimum lot area required.
(Removed reference to woodlands.)
(b) Sureties. The Plan Commission shall impose
time schedules for the completion of buildings,
parking areas, open space utilization, and landscaping.
The Plan Commission may require appropriate
sureties to guarantee that improvements
will be completed on schedule; as well as the approved
protection of the identified wetlands and
woodlands on the approved plan.
(c) Appeals. Any person or persons aggrieved by
any decisions of the Plan Commission related to
plan review may appeal the decision to the Zoning
Board of Appeals. Such appeal shall be filed
with the City Clerk within thirty (30) days after
the decision of the Plan Commission.
(e) Modification of Standards. The Plan Commission
may modify any of the above standards by a
¾ majority vote of those Commissioners present
at a meeting, but only if supplemental design elements
or improvements are incorporated into
the project which compensate for the modifications
of the particular standard.

SEC. 17.1010 LANDSCAPING
The Plan Commission shall review landscaping plans
for all new structures and uses and to changes or additions
to existing structures and uses in all zoning
districts except in the A-1 Limited Agricultural District,
the ER, Rs-1, Rs-2, Rs-3, Rs-4, and Rd-1 Residential
Districts. Landscape standards are established
to ensure that landscaping becomes an integral part of
development in the Commercial and Manufacturing
Districts. When buildings or parking lots are extended,
these regulations shall apply to the extended portion
of the building or parking lot. Location of landscape
areas, plant materials, protection afforded the
plantings, including curbing and provision for
maintenance shall be subject to approval by the City
Plan Commission. The preservation of existing trees,
City of Oak Creek
17-125
shrubs, and other natural vegetation in the parking area
may be included in the calculation of the required
minimum landscape area.
(a) Parking Lot Screening. Those parking areas
for five (5) or more vehicles if adjoining a residential
zoning district line or public right-ofway
shall be screened from casual view by an
earth berm, a solid wall, fence, evergreen planting
of equivalent visual density or other effective
means approved by the City Plan Commission.
Such fence or berm and landscaping together
shall be an average of three (3) feet in
height between the parking and the street rightof-
way and six (6) feet in height between the
parking and any adjacent residential property
line. All screening materials shall be placed and
maintained at a minimum height of three (3)
feet. The Plan Commission may require greater
screening requirements for parking of large
trucks, semi-trailers and large equipment.
(1) At least one ornamental deciduous tree, no
less than 2.5” caliper, shall be incorporated
into the design for every 35 linear
feet of public street frontage.
(2) At least 25% of the total green space area
shall be landscaped utilizing plant materials,
other than maintained turf, that contribute
to ground coverage. For purposes
of determining the number of plants necessary
to meet the minimum 25% ground
coverage requirement, plant types are categorized
by their general size and potential
mature at grade coverage area.
Area of Coverage
Plant Type Provided
Evergreen Tree (>8’ Dia.) 75 sq. ft.
Large Shrub (6-8’ Dia.) 38 sq. ft.
Medium Shrub (4-6’ Dia.) 20 sq. ft.
Small Shrub (2-4’ Dia.) 12 sq. ft.
Perennial (4.5” Pot) 6 sq. ft.
* Note shade and ornamental trees are not
considered a plant type contributing to “at
grade” coverage.
(3) To assure a diversity of color, texture and
year-round interest, the total number of
plant materials must be comprised of a
minimum 25% evergreens, but no more
than 70%.
(b) Interior Landscape Area. All public off-street
parking lots which serve five (5) vehicles or
more and are created or extended after July 6,
1999 shall be provided with accessory landscaped
areas; which may be landscape islands,
landscape peninsulas or peripheral plantings totaling
not less than five (5) percent of the surfaced
area. Landscape islands or peninsulas shall
be dispersed throughout the off-street parking area.
Landscape islands or peninsulas shall be dispersed
throughout the off-street parking area.
Landscape islands shall provide a minimum 30-
inch clear area for vehicle overhang and snow
storage. One shade tree shall be provided within
the interior planting area for every 300 square
feet of interior landscaping. For parking lots designed
for twenty-five (25) parking spaces or
more, interior parking lot landscaping shall be
provided at the following rates:
PERCENTAGE OF PARKING LOT TO
BE COVERED BY INTERIOR PLANTINGS
Total paved area of lot
Percent of total paved area which must
be interior planting area
0-49,999 sq. ft. 5%
50,000 sq. ft. or larger 10%
(c) Perimeter Landscape Area. In an effort to prevent
adjacent parking lots from becoming one
large expanse of paving, perimeter landscaping
shall be required. The perimeter strip shall be a
minimum 5 feet in width. A minimum of one
tree and five shrubs are required for every 35 linear
feet of the perimeter of the parking area and
located within the perimeter landscape area.
(d) Landscaping Adjacent to Buildings. There
shall be a minimum three-foot landscape area
provided between the edge of pavement and the
entrance elevation of the building.
(e) Screening of Trash. Trash receptacles shall not
be located within the front or street yard, and

Ordinance 2360, A 8/30/05, Sec. 17.1106
SEC. 17.1107 FINDINGS
No variance to the provisions of this Chapter shall be
granted by the Board unless it finds by a preponderance
of the evidence that all the following facts and
conditions exist and so indicates such in the minutes
of its proceedings.
(a) Preservation of intent: No variance shall be
granted that is not consistent with the purpose
and intent of the regulations for the district in
which the development is located. No variance
shall have the effect of permitting a use in any
district that is not a stated permitted use, accessory
use, or conditional use in that particular district.
(b) Exceptional circumstances: There must be
unique circumstances or conditions applying to
the lot or parcel or structure that do not apply
generally to other properties of uses in the same
zoning classification, and the granting of the variance
should not be of so general or recurrent nature
as to suggest that the Zoning Chapter should
be changed.
(c) Economic hardship and self-imposed hardship
not grounds for variance: No variance shall be
granted solely on the basis of economic gain or
loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be considered
as grounds for the granting of a variance.
(d) Preservation of property rights: The variance
must be necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of substantial property rights possessed by
other properties in the same zoning district and
same vicinity.
(e) Absence of detriment: No variance shall be
granted that will create substantial detriment to
adjacent property or that will materially impair or
be contrary to the purpose and spirit of this
Chapter or the public interest.
(f) Additional requirements in floodplain districts.
The criteria in Section 17.1050(c)(4) must be
met.

MAPPING DISPUTES
(a) Wetland Disputes. Whenever the Board of Appeals
is asked to interpret a C-1 Shoreland Wetland
District boundary where an apparent discrepancy
exists between the City’s Final Wetland
Inventory Map and actual field conditions, the
City shall contact the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) to determine if the
wetland inventory map is in error. If the DNR
staff concurs that the particular area was incorrectly
mapped as a wetland, the Board of Appeals
shall direct the City Plan Commission to initiate
appropriate action to rezone the property
within a reasonable amount of time. If the DNR
staff concurs that the particular area is correctly
mapped, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall deny
the appeal.
(b) Floodland Boundary Disputes. The Zoning
Board of Appeals shall follow the procedure in
Section 17.1050(c)(3) in hearing disputes concerning
floodplain district boundaries.

(2) The Grantee, in its application, may propose
a timetable of construction which will make
cable television service available in the initial
service area sooner than the above minimum
requirements, in which case the said
schedule will be made part of the franchise
agreement, and will be binding upon the
Grantee.
(3) Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable,
unless specifically approved by the
City, will be considered a violation of this
Chapter for which the provisions of either
Sections 20.37 or 20.45 shall apply, as determined
by the City.
(4) In special circumstances the City can waive
one hundred percent (100%) completion
within the two (2) year time frame provided
substantial completion is accomplished
within the allotted time frame, substantial
completion construed to be not less than
ninety-five percent (95%) and justification
for less than one hundred percent (100%)
must be submitted subject to the satisfaction
of the City.
(b) Line Extensions.
(1) Extension Policy. In areas of the franchise
territory not included in the initial service areas,
the Grantee shall be required to extend
its system pursuant to the following requirements:
a. No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily.
Grantee is hereby authorized to
extend the Cable System as necessary
within the City. To expedite the process
of extending the Cable System into a new
subdivision, the City will forward to the
Grantee an approved engineering plan of
each project. Subject to the density requirements
the Grantee shall commence
the design and construction process upon
receipt of the final engineering plan.
Upon notification from the City that the
first (1st) home in the project has been
approved for building permit, the
Grantee shall have a maximum of three
(3) months to complete the construction/
activation process within the project
phase.
b. The Grantee must extend and make cable
television service available to every
dwelling unit in all unserved, developing
areas having at least twenty (20) dwelling
units planned per street mile, as
measured from the existing system, and
shall extend its system simultaneously
with the installation of utility lines.
c. The Grantee must extend and make cable
television service available to any isolated
resident outside the initial service
area requesting connection at the standard
connection charge, if the connection
to the isolated resident would require no
more than a two hundred (200) foot drop
line.
(2) Early Extension. In areas not meeting the requirements
for mandatory extension of service,
the Grantee shall provide, upon the request
of a potential subscriber desiring service,
an estimate of the costs required to extend
service to the subscriber. The Grantee
shall then extend service upon request of the
potential subscriber. The Grantee may require
advance payment or assurance of payment
satisfactory to the Grantee. The amount
paid by subscribers for early extensions shall
be non-refundable, and in the event the area
subsequently reaches the density required for
mandatory extension, such payments shall be
treated as consideration for early extension.
(3) New Development Under Grounding. In
cases of new construction or property development
where utilities are to be placed underground,
the developer or property owner
City of Oak Creek
8
shall give the Grantee reasonable notice of
such construction or development, and of the
particular date on which open trenching will
be available for the Grantee’s installation of
conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals
to be provided at the Grantee’s expense. The
Grantee shall also provide specifications as
needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and
easements required to bring service to the
development shall be borne by the developer
or property owner; except that if the Grantee
fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or
vaults, and laterals within five (5) working
days of the date the trenches are available, as
designated in the notice given by the developer
or property owner, then should the
trenches be closed after the five (5) day period,
the cost of new trenching is to be borne
by the Grantee. Except for the notice of the
particular date on which trenching will be
available to the Grantee, any notice provided
to the Grantee by the City of a preliminary
plat request shall satisfy the requirement of
reasonable notice if sent to the local general
manager or system engineer of the Grantee
prior to approval of the preliminary plat request.
(c) Special Agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed
to prevent the Grantee from serving areas
not covered under this Section upon agreement
with developers, property owners, or residents provided
that five percent (5%) of those gross revenues
are paid to the City as franchise fees under
Section 20.27.
(1) Line Extension Policy. All residents who request
cable television service in the City not
currently serviceable to the existing cable
plant, will be forwarded to Grantee’s engineering
department. The Grantee will prepare
a cost estimate based on the remaining
actual construction footage and the current
year’s actual cost of materials and labor using
the formula provided in Appendix A of
this Chapter.

or interfere with any improvements the City may
deem proper to make, or unnecessarily hinder or
obstruct the free use of the streets, alleys, bridges,

at its own expense whenever the City determines
that the public convenience would be
enhanced thereby.
(2) Where poles or other wire-holding structures
already existing for use in serving the City
are available for use by the Grantee, but it

public convenience would be enhanced
thereby and the terms of the use available to
the Grantee are just and reasonable.
(3) In the absence of any governing federal or
state statute, where the City or a public utility
serving the City desires to make use of the
poles or other wire-holding structures of the
Grantee, but agreement thereof with the
Grantee cannot be reached, the City may require
the Grantee to permit such use for such
consideration and upon such terms as the
City shall determine to be just and reasonable,
if the City determines that the use
would enhance the public convenience and
would not unduly interfere with the
Grantee’s operations.
(d) Relocation of the Facilities. If at any time during
the period of this franchise the City shall lawfully
elect to alter, or change the grade of any street, alley
or other public ways, the Grantee, upon reasonable

expense unless the utilities are compensated, in
which case the Grantee shall be similarly compensated.
(e) Cooperation With Building Movers. The
Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding
a building moving permit issued by the City, temporarily
raise or lower its wires to permit the moving

ground level, of any tree within any public
place without the prior consent of the City, the City
shall have the right to do the trimming requested
by the Grantee at the cost of the Grantee. Regardless
of who performs the work requested by the
Grantee, the Grantee shall be responsible, shall defend

than ninety percent (90%) of the time as measured
on an annual basis.
(g) Under normal operating conditions, the customer
will receive a busy signal less than three percent
(3%) of the total time that the office is open for
business.
(h) Standard installations will be performed within
seven (7) business days after an order has been
placed. A standard installation is one that is within
two hundred (200) feet of the existing system.
(i) Excluding those situations which are beyond its
control, the Grantee will respond to any Service Interruption
promptly and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours from the time of initial notification.
All other regular service requests will be
responded to within thirty-six (36) hours during the
normal work week for that system. The appointment
window alternatives for installations, service

The Grantee will schedule supplemental hours during
which appointments can be scheduled based on
the needs of the community. If at any time an installer
or technician is running late, an attempt to
contact the customer will be made and the appointment
rescheduled as necessary at a time that is
convenient to the customer.
(j) Customer service centers locations will be open for
walk-in customer transactions a minimum of eight
(8) hours a day Monday through Friday, unless
there is a need to modify those hours because of
the location or customers served. The Grantee and
City by mutual consent will establish supplemental
hours on weekdays and weekends if it would fit the
needs of the community.
(k) Upon service Interruption and/or Outages of Subscriber’s
cable service, the following shall apply.
(1) For Service Interruptions and/or Outages of
over four (4) hours and up to seven (7) days,
the Grantee shall provide, at the Subscriber’s
request, a credit of one-thirtieth (1/30) of one
(1) month’s fees for affected Services for
each twenty-four (24) hour period service is
interrupted for four (4) or more hours for any
single subscriber, with the exception of subscribers
disconnected because of non-payment
or excessive signal leakage.
(2) For Service Interruptions and/or Outages of

franchise, to maintain the technical standards, technological
upgrades and quality of service set forth
in this Chapter. Should the City find, by resolution,
that the Grantee has failed to maintain these technical
standards and quality of service, Grantee shall
be required to implement a plan for resolution.
Failure to make such movements within three (3)
months of such resolution will constitute a breach
of a condition for which penalties contained in
Section 20.45 are applicable.
City of Oak Creek
11
(r) The Grantee shall keep a monthly service log
which will indicate the nature of each service complaint
received in the last twenty-four (24) months,
the date and time it was received, the disposition of
said complaint, and the time and date thereof this
log shall be made available for periodic inspection
by the City.
SEC. 20.24 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE MANDATORY.
(a) It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue
receiving service insofar as their financial and
other obligations to the Grantee are honored. If the
Grantee elects to over build, rebuild, modify or sell
the system, or the City gives notice of intent to terminate
or fails to renew this franchise, the Grantee
shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive
continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the
circumstances.
(b) If there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator
acquires the system, the Grantee shall cooperate
with the City, new franchise or operator in maintaining
continuity of service to all subscribers. During
such period, the Grantee shall be entitled to the
revenues for any period during which it operates
the system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs
for its services until it no longer operates the system.
(c) If the Grantee fails to operate the system for seven
(7) consecutive days without prior approval of the
City or without just cause, the City may, at its option,
operate the system or designate an operator
until such time as the Grantee restores service under
conditions acceptable to the City or a permanent
operator is selected. If the City is required to
fulfill this obligation for the Grantee, the Grantee
shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs or
damages in excess of revenues from the system received
by the City that are the result of the
Grantee’s failure to perform.
SEC. 20.25 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
(a) The City Administrator is designated as having
primary responsibility for the continuing administration
of the franchise and implementation of
complaint procedures.
(b) During the terms of this franchise, and any renewal
thereof, the Grantee shall maintain a central office
for the purpose of receiving and resolving all complaints
regarding the quality of service, equipment
functions and similar matters. The office must be
reachable by a local, toll-free telephone call to receive
complaints regarding quality of service,
equipment functions and similar matters. The
Grantee will use its good faith efforts to arrange for
one (1) or more payment locations in a central location
where customers can pay bills or conduct
other business activities.
(c) As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the
system, the Grantee shall, by appropriate means,
such as a card or brochure, furnish information
concerning the procedures for making inquiries or
complaints, including the name, address and local
telephone number of the employee or employees or
agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to
be addressed.
(d) When there have been similar complaints made, or
where there exists other evidence, which, in the
judgment of the City, casts doubt on the reliability
or quality of cable service, the City shall have the
right and authority to require the Grantee to test,
analyze and report on the performance of the system.
The Grantee shall fully cooperate with the
City in performing such testing and shall prepare
results and a report, if requested, within thirty (30)
days after notice. Such report shall include the following
information:
(1) The nature of the complaint or problem
which precipitated the special tests;
(2) What system component was tested;
(3) The equipment used and procedures employed
in testing;
(4) The method, if any, in which such complaint
or problem was resolved;
(5) Any other information pertinent to the tests
and analysis which may be required.
(e) The City may require that tests be supervised, by
an independent professional engineer or equivalent
of the City’s choice. The engineer should sign all
records of special tests and forward to the City
such records with a report interpreting the results
of the tests and recommending actions to be taken.
Should such a test prove that the Grantee failed to
meet the technical standard, the Grantee shall bear
the cost of the test. If the test should prove that the
Grantee met the technical standards, the City shall
bear the cost of the test.
(f) The City’s right under this Section shall be limited
to requiring tests, analysis and reports covering
specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints
or other evidence when and under such circumstances
as the City has reasonable grounds to
believe that the complaints or other evidence require
that tests be performed to protect the public
against substandard cable service.
SEC. 20.26 GRANTEE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
The Grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such
rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the
conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary
to enable the Grantee to exercise its rights and perform
City of Oak Creek
12
its obligations under this franchise, and to assure an uninterrupted
service to each and all of its customers; provided,
however, that such rules, regulations, terms and
conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions
hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and
regulations.
SEC. 20.27 FRANCHISE FEE.
(a) For the reason that the streets of the City to be used
by the Grantee in the operation of its system within
the boundaries of the City are valuable public
properties acquired and maintained by the City at
great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to
the Grantee to the streets is a valuable property
right without which the Grantee would be required
to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs
and acquisitions, the Grantee shall pay to the City
an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the
Grantee’s Gross Annual revenue from the operations
of the Grantee within the confines of the City
or contract area. If the statutory five percent (5%)
limitation on franchise fees is raised or the federal
statute deletes the franchise fee limitation entirely,
then the franchise fee may be subject to possible
re-negotiation.
(b) This payment shall be in addition to any other tax
or payment owed to the City by the Grantee.
(c) The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties
assessed shall be payable quarterly on a calendar
year basis to the City and the Grantee shall file a
complete and accurate verified statement of all
gross receipts as previously defined within fortyfive
(45) days after the quarter as established between
the City and the Grantee.
(d) The City shall have the right to inspect the
Grantee’s income records and the right to audit and
to recompute any amounts determined to be payable
under this Chapter; provided, however, that
such audit shall take place within twenty-four (24)
months following the close of each of the
Grantee’s fiscal years. Any additional amount due
to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid
within thirty (30) days following written notice to
the Grantee by the City which notice shall include
a copy of the audit report.
(e) If any franchise payment or recomputed amount,
cost or penalty, is not made on or before the applicable
dates heretofore specified, interest shall be
charged daily from such date at the legal maximum
rate charged by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
for late tax payments and the Grantee shall reimburse
the City for any additional expenses and
costs incurred by the City by reason of the delinquent
payment(s).
SEC. 20.28 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR
CONTROL.
(a) Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement,
this franchise shall not be assigned or transferred,
either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet
or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title thereto,
either legal or equitable or any night, interest or
property therein, pass to or vest in any person without
the prior written consent of the City. The
Grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise
to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Grantee
and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the
franchise back to the Grantee without such consent,
providing that such assignment is without any
release of liability of the Grantee. The proposed assignee
must show financial responsibility as determined
by the City and must agree to comply with
all provisions of the franchise. The City shall have
one hundred twenty (120) days to act upon any request
for approval of such a sale or transfer submitted
in writing that contains or is accompanied by
such information as is required in accordance with
FCC regulations and by the City of Oak Creek.
The City shall be deemed to have consented to a
proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to
consent is not communicated in writing to the
Grantee within one hundred twenty (120) days following
receipt of written notice and the necessary
information as to the effect of the proposed transfer
or assignment upon the public unless the requesting
party and the City agree to an extension of
time. The City shall not unreasonably withhold
such consent to the proposed transfer.
(b) Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement,
the Grantee shall promptly notify the City of
any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or
acquisition by any other party of, control of the
Grantee. The word “control” as used herein is not
limited to major stockholders but includes actual
working control in whatever manner exercised. A
rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control
has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation
by any person or group of persons of
ten percent (10%) of the voting shares of the
Grantee. Every change, transfer or acquisition of
control of the Grantee shall make the franchise
subject to cancellation unless and until the City
shall have consented thereto, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of
determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer or acquisition of control, the City
may inquire into the qualification of the prospective
controlling party, and the Grantee shall assist
the City in such inquiry.
(c) The consent or approval of the City to any transfer
of the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or reCity
of Oak Creek
13
lease of the rights of the City in and to the streets,
and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly
subordinate to the terms and conditions of this
franchise.
(d) In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the
City will not approve any transfer or assignment of
an initial franchise prior to substantial completion
of construction of the proposed system.
(e) In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control
be approved without the transferee acknowledging
its obligations under this Chapter and the franchise
agreement between the City and the transferor, becoming
a signatory to such franchise agreement
and assuming all rights and obligations thereunder,
and assuming all other rights and obligations of the
transferor to the City.
SEC. 20.29 AVAILABILITY OF BOOKS AND
RECORDS.
(a) The Grantee shall fully cooperate in making available
at reasonable times, and the City shall have
the right to inspect, where reasonably necessary to
the enforcement of the franchise, books, records,
maps, plans and other like materials of the Grantee
applicable to the cable television system, at any
time during normal business hours; provided where
volume and convenience necessitate, the Grantee
may require inspection to take place on the Grantee
premises.
(b) The following records and/or reports are to be
made available to the City upon request, but no
more frequently than on an annual basis if so unless
mutually agreed upon by the Grantee and the
City.
(1) A quarterly review and resolution or progress
report submitted by the Grantee to the
City;
(2) Periodic preventive maintenance reports;
(3) Any copies of FCC Form 395-A (or successor
form) or any supplemental forms related
to equal opportunity or fair contracting policies;
(4) Subscriber inquiry/complaint resolution data
and the right to review documentation concerning
these inquiries and/or complaints periodically;
(5) Periodic construction update reports including
where appropriate the submission of asbuilt
maps and quarterly reports during construction
upgrade.

reports either submitted by the Grantee to the Federal
Communications Commission, Securities and Exchange
Commission, or any other federal or state regulatory
commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to
any matters affecting cable television operations authorized
pursuant to the franchise or received from such
agencies shall be provided to the City upon request.
SEC. 20.31 FISCAL REPORTS.
The Grantee shall file annually with the City no later than
one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the
Grantee’s fiscal year, a copy of a gross revenues statement
certified by an officer of the Grantee.
SEC. 20.32 REMOVAL OF CABLE TELEVISION
SYSTEM.
At the expiration of the terms for which this franchise is
granted and any renewal denied, or upon its termination
as provided herein, the Grantee shall forthwith, upon notice
by the City, remove at its own expense all designated
