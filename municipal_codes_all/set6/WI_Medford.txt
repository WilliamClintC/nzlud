residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium
chloride and sodium sulfate).



         (b)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited
to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions).



         (c)   Unusual B.O.D., chemical oxygen demand, or
chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load
on the sewage treatment works.



         (d)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes
constituting "slugs" as defined herein.



      (10)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not
amendable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amendable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies
having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.



      (11)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other
water or wastes in the sanitary sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form
suspended solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a
condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes.



      (12)   Incompatible pollutants in excess of the allowed limits
as determined by local, state, and federal laws and regulations in reference
to pretreatment standards developed by the Environmental Protection Agency,

over 0.1 mg/l hexqualent chromium per 24 hours composite.



   (E)   (1)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are
proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in division (D) of this
section, and which in the judgement of the Approving Authority, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, process, equipment, or receiving
waters, on which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Approving Authority may:



         (a)   Reject the wastes.



         (b)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition
for discharge to the public sewers.



         (c)   Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or



         (d)   Require payment to cover the added cost of
handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer
discharges under the provisions of division (J) of this section.



      (2)   If the Approving Authority permits the pretreatment or
equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and
equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Approving
Authority and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances
and laws.



   (F)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in
the opinion of the Approving Authority or as required by the Wisconsin
Plumbing Code (Comm. 82.34), an interceptor is necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units.



       (1)   All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Approving Authority, and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.



      (2)   All new systems and replacement systems shall be
inspected by the City of Medford Building Inspector, and/or City of Medford
Public Works Director, and/ or their designees prior to placing the system
into operation.



      (3)   A report on form furnished by the City of Medford Public
Works Department shall be submitted to the City of Medford Public Works
Department within 30 days of each time the interceptor is pumped and/or
cleaned. The form shall include owner information, interceptor information,
and maintenance information. The maintenance information shall include the
name of the person or firm contracted to maintain the unit, date of cleaning,
and pounds of grease removed.



      (4)   All owners of property where interceptors are located
are required to file an annual report with the City of Medford.



      (5)   The City of Medford reserves the right to require each
operator of an interceptor to increase the frequency of cleaning based on
operations and experience.



   (G)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.



   (H)   When required by the Approving Authority, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and
other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling, and measurement of the wastes.  Such manhole, when required, shall
be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with
plans approved by the Approving Authority. The manhole shall be installed by
the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.



   (I)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics
of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole.  In the event that no
special manhole has been required the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which
the building sewer is connected.  Sampling shall be carried out by
customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour
composite of all outfalls of premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken.  Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended
solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas
pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.



   (J)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment
therefore, by the industrial concern.



   (K)   No person shall cause or permit a discharge into the sanitary
sewers that would cause a violation of the municipality's WPDES permit and
any modification thereof.



   (L)   New connections to the municipality's sanitary sewer system
will be allowed only if there is available capacity.



   (M)   (1)   Persons discharging industrial wastes into any public
sewer may be required to pretreat such wastes, if the Approving Authority
determines pretreatment is necessary to protect the wastewater treatment
facilities or prevent the discharge of incompatible pollutants.



      (2)   In that event such person shall provide at his expense
such pretreatment or processing facilities as may be determined necessary to
render wastes acceptable for admission to the sanitary sewers.



   (N)   Persons desiring to discharge contrary to the provisions of
this section may apply to the Approving Authority for a discharge permit. 
Applications shall be made upon forms provided by the Approving Authority and
submitted to the Wastewater Treatment Director, who shall promptly review,
comment upon, and submit such application and comments to the Approving
Authority for consideration.  The Approving Authority may permit discharges
as exceptions to provisions from this chapter upon such terms as the
Approving Authority shall deem appropriate under the circumstances.  These
terms, which may include, but are not limited to:  charges for disposal,
flow rates, total flow, point(s) of discharge, requests for chemistry data
and proof of insurance.  The Approving Authority shall not be obligated to
grant any such discharge permit requested.

(Ord. 557, passed 5-18-88)  Penalty, see § 1.1.99



§ 5.3.08  SEWAGE SERVICE CHARGES.



   (A)   Purposes and scopes.  The City has provided facilities for
collection and treatment of sewage to promote the health, safety and
convenience of its people and to safeguard the water resources common to
all.  In such facilities, provisions of design, construction and operation
have been made to accommodate certain types and quantities of commercial and
industrial wastes in excess of, and in addition to, normal sewage.  The
Council has determined that it is the obligation of the producers of
domestic, commercial and industrial wastes to defray the cost of normal and
extraordinary services rendered by the City in the collection and treatment
of such wastes in the equitable manner and insofar as it is practicable, in
proportion to the benefits derived from such services.



   (B)   Amount of sewer service charges. The Common Council shall by
resolution establish user fees.



   (C)   Disposal of septic tank sludge and holding tank sewage.



      (1)   No person in the business of gathering and disposing of
septic tank sludge or holding tank sewage shall transfer such material into
any disposal area or public sewer unless a permit for disposal has been first
obtained from the Approving Authority.  Written application for this permit
shall be made to the Approving Authority and shall state the name and address
of the applicant; the number of its disposal units; and the make, model, and
license number of each unit.  Permits shall be nontransferable except in the
case of replacement of the disposal unit for which a permit shall have been
originally issued.  The permit may be obtained yearly upon payment of a fee
established by the Common Council.  The time and place of disposal will be
designated by the Approving Authority.  The Approving Authority may impose
such conditions as it deems necessary on any permit granted.



      (2)   Any person or party disposing of septic tank sludge or
holding tank sewage agrees to carry public liability insurance in an amount
not less than $100,000 to protect any and all persons or property from injury
and/or damage caused in any way or manner by an act, or the failure to act,
by any of the person's employees.  The person(s) shall furnish a certificate
certifying such insurance to be in full force and effect.



      (3)   All materials disposed of into the treatment system
shall be of domestic origin, or compatible pollutants only, and the person(s)
agrees that he will comply with the provisions of any and all applicable
ordinances of the municipality and shall not deposit or drain any gasoline,
oil, acid, alkali, grease, rags, waste, volatile or flammable liquids, or
other deleterious substances into the public sewers, nor allow any earth,
sand, or other solid material to pass into any part of the wastewater
treatment facilities.



      (4)   Persons with a permit for disposing of septic tank
sludge and/or holding tank sewage into the wastewater treatment facilities
shall be charged a fee established by the Common Council.



      (5)   The person(s) disposing wastes agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the municipality from any and all liability and claims for
damages arising out of or resulting from work and labor performed.



   (D)   Charge for toxic pollutants.  Any person discharging toxic
pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or
sludge from the municipality's wastewater treatment facility shall pay for
such increased costs, as may be determined by the Approving Authority.



   (E)   Industrial waste pre-treatment.  Where it is necessary that
the utility provide pre-treatment of industrial wastes, the entire cost of
such pre-treatment shall be charged to the person producing the industrial
wastes.  The costs shall include but are not limited to capital
expenditures, operation and maintenance expenses, labor, chemicals, power and
heat.



   (F)   Contract basis.  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the
City from providing sewage services to persons outside the corporate limits
of the City under mutually agreeable conditions.



   (G)   Control manholes.



      (1)   All persons discharging industrial wastes into a public
sewer shall construct and maintain on public property 1 or more control
manholes to facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his wastes,
including normal sewage.  Control manholes shall be located and built in a
manner approved by the Approving Authority.  If measuring devices are to be
permanently installed they shall be of a type approved by the Approving
Authority.



      (2)   Control manholes, and related equipment, shall be
installed by the person discharging the waste, at his expense, and shall be
maintained by him in safe condition, accessible and in proper operating
condition at all times.  Plans for the installation of control manholes and
related equipment shall be submitted for approval to the Approving Authority
prior to the beginning of construction.  The provisions in regard to control
manholes shall apply only to industrial waste discharges having their initial
discharge to the public sewers after the effective date of this chapter.



   (H)   Exemption meters.



      (1)   In the event that a person discharging industrial wastes
into the public sewers produces evidence satisfactory to the Approving
Authority that significant amounts to the total annual volume of water used
for all purposes does not reach the sanitary sewer, the person may be
permitted to have an exemption water meter installed.  Said meter shall be
furnished by the City water utility and installed under its supervision, all
other costs being at the expense of the person requiring the meter, including
any piping revisions required to insure that only water not reaching the
sanitary sewer is metered by the exemption meter.  The City water utility
will charge for each exemption meter at the service charge set for that size
meter by the water utility, said charge to compensate for the cost of
furnishing, reading and servicing the meter.



      (2)   The amount of exemption water metered shall be
subtracted from the total amount of water used by the person and an adjusted
water bill determined based on only water reaching the sanitary sewer.  This
adjusted water bill will be used to determine the applicable sewage service
charge.



   (I)   Waste meters.  Devices for metering the volume of waste
discharged may be required by the Approving Authority if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined by the use of water meters and exemption water
meters.  Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
purchased, installed, owned and maintained by the person.  The type of meter
and metering arrangement shall be approved by the Approving Authority before
installation and it shall be installed in accordance with approved methods. 
Following approval and installation such meters may not be removed without
the consent of the Approving Authority.



   (J)   Waste sampling.  Industrial wastes discharged into the public
sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of
character and concentration.  The determination shall be made as often as
deemed necessary.  Where samples are taken often enough to produce
meaningful averages, charges will be determined based on the average values
determined during the billing period after due allowance for values not
believed to be representative.  Any person may request the utility to make
new tests, such tests to be at expense of the person discharging the waste
and such tests to be of a minimum of 24 hours duration unless otherwise
approved.  If the Approving Authority is satisfied that such test was made
when the plant was operating under normal conditions the results of these
tests shall be used in computing the subsequent billing in the manner
previously prescribed.



   (K)   Analyses.  Laboratory procedures used in the examination of
industrial wastes shall be those set forth in "Standard Methods."  However,
alternate methods for which certain analyses may be used subject to mutual
agreement between the person and the Approving Authority.



   (L)   Sewage service charges.  All other charges provided for in
this chapter shall be included as a separate items on the regular bill for
water service and shall be payable in monthly installments in accordance with
the existing rules and regulations of the City water utility.



   (M)   Payment.  Sewage service charges and all other charges
provided for in the surcharges of this chapter shall be due and payable at
the office of the City water utility or at any other officially designated
location at the same time that the water bills become due, and payments for
water service shall not be accepted without full payment of the sewage
service charges and all other charges provided for in this chapter.



   (N)   Biennial review.  The Approving Authority shall, at least
once every 2 years, report to the Council concerning the adequacy of waste
water charges to cover actual costs.  The charges for sewer and wastewater
treatment shall be adjusted properly by the Council to cover actual costs of
operating the system, including the cost of operation, maintenance and
replacement.



   (O)   Proportionate distribution.  It is the intent of the City
that all user classes utilizing the City's sanitary sewers pay their
proportionate share of operation, maintenance and replacement costs.



   (P)   Revenue levels.  It is the intent of the City to raise
sufficient revenues through the sewer service charges to pay all operation,
maintenance and replacement costs.



   (Q)   Excess class revenue.  Any excess revenues collected from a
user class in 1 year shall be attributed to that class' share of operation,
maintenance and replacement costs incurred the following year.



   (R)   Annual notification.  Users will be notified annually of that
portion of user charges attributable to wastewater treatment services.



   (S)   Pre-existing agreements.  The user charge system included in
this chapter shall take precedence over pre-existing agreements inconsistent
with the governing regulations of this chapter.



   (T)   Replacement fund.  All user charges specifically collected
for replacement shall be deposited in a separate and distinct fund which
shall be used exclusively for replacement.



   (U)   Inflow and infiltration fund.  The sum of $0.10 per 1,000
gallons of the normal service charge set forth in division (B) of this
section shall be set aside in the inflow and infiltration fund.  The monies
in said fund shall be used only for the purposes of study and solution to
inflow and infiltration problems with the public sewage system of the City
and for no other purpose.

   (A)   A CROSS CONNECTION shall be defined as any physical connection
or arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains
potable water from the City Water System, and the other, water from a private
source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or
chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one  system to the other, the
direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two
systems.



   (B)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross connection.  No
interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private,
auxiliary or emergency water  supply other than the regular public water
supply of the City may enter the supply or distribution system of the City,
unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of
connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the Street and

service to such property shall not be restored until the cross connection(s)
has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this section.



   (F)   If it is determined by the Street and Water Superintendent or
his/her designee that a cross connection or an emergency endangers public
health, safety or welfare and requires immediate action, and a written
finding to that effect is filed with the City Clerk and delivered to the
customer’s premises, service may be immediately discontinued.  The
customer shall have an opportunity for hearing under current applicable

sewer, and curb and gutter should file a petition with the City Clerk. 
Sample petitions are available at the City Clerk's Office.  These petitions
should be on file before September 30 in order to be considered in the budget
for the following year.  The amount of construction is limited within the
budget of the City and additional work is delayed until funds are available.



   (B)   The Common Council will hold a public hearing prior to levying
special assessments, unless 100% of adjacent property owners have signed the
petition.



   (C)   Normally, the Common Council approves petitions which are
signed by property owners who own over 50% of the frontage abutting the
proposed improvement.  However, the Common Council has authority to reject
any petition and on its own motion order a public improvement.



   (D)   Special assessment charges are based on the cost of
improvement and the benefits to adjoining property.  It is impossible for
the City to evaluate adjacent property, so the maximum benefit to the
property is usually considered equal to the total cost of the improvement. 
Present use of property by non-profit organizations does not reduce or
eliminate assessments, because the property itself is benefited directly and
the use of property may change.



   (E)   The City may contract for such work to be done by the lowest
qualified bidder if deemed reasonable in cost, or it may have the work done
by persons employed by the City.

maintain sidewalks located within the City and to pay the entire cost
thereof, except as provided below:



      (1)   If the damage to a sidewalk in need of repair or
replacement was caused as a result of activities conducted by or on behalf of
the owner of the property upon which the damaged sidewalk fronts or abuts,
said sidewalk shall be repaired or replaced by the City at its discretion and
the affected property owner shall be responsible for the entire cost thereof.



      (2)   If the damage to the sidewalk in need of repair or
replacement was caused as a result of repairs to public utilities, said
sidewalk shall be repaired or replaced by the City at its discretion and the
responsible public utility shall be responsible for the entire cost thereof.



   (C)   Sidewalk construction.



      (1)   Specifications.  Sidewalks in the City shall, unless
otherwise specifically indicated in writing, be 4 inches thick, except for
driveway area sidewalks which shall be 6 inches thick, and 5 feet in width,
constructed of concrete or locking concrete blocks and in accordance with the
specifications adopted by the Common Council of the City, copies of which are

      (2)   Location.  Sidewalks shall be constructed within public
street rights-of-way, and unless otherwise specifically indicated in writing,
the back line of said sidewalk shall be the front property line.  Sidewalks
located within business districts shall be from the curb to the building in
all instances.  All sidewalks shall slope from the property line, or
building front in business districts, at the rate of  inch per foot per
width.

widest portion of the side slope not less than 18 inches nor more than 24
inches wide at the curb.  The ramp slope may not exceed 1 inch vertical to
12 inches horizontal from the flow line elevation of the curb.  The curb
opening shall not be less than 40 inches nor more than 80 inches wide at the
flow line of the curb.



         (b)   The taper of the curb from the tip of the curb to
the flow line of the curb at the curb opening shall be not less than 18
inches nor more than 24 inches wide.  The ramp shall be bordered on both
sides and on the curb line with a 4 inch wide yellow strip or with brick of a
contrasting color.



      (2)   Curb ramping shall be in the following locations to
provide access to each end of each crosswalk affected:



         (a)   At the center of the curve of the street corner to
accommodate crossing for either direction at the intersection.  The entire
curb corner may not be made a ramp, but shall provide for standard sidewalk
apron and curb on both sides of a ramp.



         (b)   If subdivision (1) is not feasible, centered on
line with the crosswalk and pedestrian traffic and containing surface
texturing to indicate clearly to the sense of touch that the surface differs
from the sidewalk or street.  The surface texturing shall consist of linear
impressions ¼ of an inch to 3/8 of an inch deep, oriented to provide a
uniform pattern of diamond shapes.  The diamond shapes shall measure
approximately 1¼ inches wide to 2¼ inches long, with the length of the
diamond shape parallel to the direction of pedestrian movement.  The diamond
shape shall be spaced ¼ of an inch to 3/8 of an inch apart.  This surface
texture may be achieved by impressing and removing expanded metal regular
industrial mesh into the surface of the ramp while the concrete is in a
plastic state.

   (C)   No person, firm or corporation shall deposit or cause to be
deposited any ice or snow taken or removed from private property onto any

within 30 days of the mailing or delivery of the statement by the Director of
Public Works, the same shall be a charge against the land from which the ice
or snow was removed, and shall be collectable as an ordinary debt of the City
or placed on the tax roll and collected in the same manner as ordinary taxes
are collected against said property.



   (F)   Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
Department of Public Works may, whenever in its sole discretion it believes
that snow needs to be removed from sidewalks on those streets specified in
division (A) of this section, remove snow from those sidewalks and without
any charge to the owner abutting upon those sidewalks.  However, nothing in
this division relieves the property owner of the duty to remove snow from
these sidewalks under division (A) of this section and nothing in this
division shall obligate the City to remove snow from those sidewalks set
forth in division (A) of this section.

south side of all streets, and odd numbers on the west and north side of all
streets.  In all cases where an intersecting street shall not continue
entirely across the City, the lots and buildings shall be so numbered so that
all lots and buildings the same distance from the base line shall have
approximately the same numbers.  All lots and houses shall be numbered
commencing with the hundred assigned to that block, and numbers shall
increase from the base line, 1 number for each 20 feet of frontage or
fraction thereof except where impractical or impossible because of compliance
with the provisions of the preceding sentence.  Where any building has more
than 1 door serving separate occupants, a separate number shall be assigned

20 feet in width.  If the building is 20 feet or less in width the next
consecutive number shall be marked fractional.  Buildings fronting on 2 or
more streets shall have a number assigned only to the main entrance, unless
other entrances serve different occupants.  Where only 1 number can be

   The Common Council shall cause a directory to be prepared and
maintained indicating the numbering of the buildings in accordance with
provisions of this subchapter. Said directory shall be known as the Uniform
Building Numbering Directory. It shall be the duty of all owners and
occupants of buildings to obtain, clean and maintain the correct number to be
placed on their respective buildings within 60 days after passage of this
subchapter. Such numbers shall be of such size and materials as may be
prescribed by the Common Council and shall be placed on the side of the
building facing the street on which they are addressed in a conspicuous place
open to public view.  The numbering shall not be less than 2 inches in
height.  Whenever any building is situated more than 75 feet from the street
line, the number of such building shall be conspicuously displayed at the
street line, near the walk, driveway or common entrance to such building and
upon the gate post, fence, tree, post or other appropriate place so as to be
easily discernable from the street line. The Uniform Building Numbering
Directory as prepared by the Common Council will be on file in the office of
the City Clerk and information relating thereto shall be given by the City
Clerk. Whenever any house, building or structure shall be erected or located
in the City after the entire work of establishing a uniform system of
building numbering has been completed, in order to preserve the continuity
and uniformity of numbers of houses, buildings, and structures, it shall be
the duty of the owners or occupants to procure the correct number or numbers
as designated from the City Building Inspector for the said property and to
immediately fasten the said number or numbers so assigned upon said building
as provided by this subchapter. No building permit shall be issued for any
house, building or structure until the owner has procured from the Building
Inspector the official number of the premises.

new block and each quarter section will evenly divide 200 numbers per quarter
section. The numbering system will begin as follows:



   (A)   All numbers east of the line defined by Bauer Drive, a

property, to prevent the decline of real estate values, to improve
aesthetics, and to protect the public health, safety and welfare.  In order

which must be regulated or prescribed through the exercise of the City's
police powers.

   (A)   No person shall leave unattended any motor vehicle, trailer,
semitrailer or mobile home on any public highway or private or public
property, for such time and under such circumstances as to cause the vehicle
to reasonably appear to have been abandoned.  Except as otherwise provided
in this section, whenever any vehicle has been left unattended without the
permission of the property owner for more than 48 hours, the vehicle is
deemed abandoned and constitutes a public nuisance.  A motor vehicle shall
not be considered an abandoned motor vehicle when it is out of ordinary
public view, or when designated as not abandoned by a duly authorized police,
municipal, or county official pursuant to municipal or county ordinance.



   (B)   Any vehicle in violation of this section shall be impounded
until lawfully claimed or disposed of under Wisconsin Statutes § 342.40.



   (C)   Any person who violates this section shall be subject to a
forfeiture of $100 plus costs and fees.  In addition, any person who
violates any provision of this section shall be subject to payment for the
actual costs of impounding and disposing of the vehicle impounded.

§ 9.8.01  POLICY.



   There hereby exists in the City structures, residential yards or vacant
areas or combinations thereof which are, or may become, unhygienic,
dilapidated or unsafe with respect to the structural integrity, equipment or
maintenance and as such constitute a menace to the health, safety and welfare
of the public.  Lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration of certain
properties have the further effect of creating blighted conditions and if
such conditions are not curtailed and removed, the expenditure of large
amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the same will be
necessary.  Timely regulation and restriction to contain and prevent blight
is necessary, thereby maintaining the desirability and amenities as well as
property values of the neighborhood in the City.



(Ord. 728/95, passed 12-20-95)



§ 9.8.02  PURPOSE.

welfare by establishing minimum property maintenance standards.  This
section shall replace or modify standards otherwise established by other
portions of the City ordinances regulating construction, repair, alteration
or use of buildings.  This chapter is meant to be remedial and essential for
the public interest, and it is intended that this chapter be liberally
construed to effectuate the purposes stated herein.  Violation of the
minimum standards set forth in this chapter shall be deemed to be a public
nuisance.

does any of the following shall be guilty of violating this section:



      (1)   Intentionally absconds without paying rent that has been
contractually agreed upon in a written lease with a landlord, or without
paying charges for utility services to the premises during the term of the
tenancy, where such charges were the responsibility of the tenant in addition
to basic rent.  Prima facie evidence of intentionally absconding will be
established if a tenant fails to pay rent or utility service charges due
prior to the vacating of the rental premises by the tenant, and the
non-payment of said rent or utility service charges continues for a period of
5 days after vacation of the premises; or



      (2)   Issues any check, money order or any other form of bank
or monetary draft as a payment of rent or utility service charges, where such
document lacks sufficient funds, where the account is closed, or where such
draft is unredeemable in any other form or fashion.  Prima facie evidence of
intention to defraud will be established if a tenant fails, within 5 days of
a written demand by the landlord or agent, to pay in full the total amount of
the draft presented as rent or utility service charges payment plus any bank
charges to the landlord attributable to the unredeemability of the draft.



   (B)   Applicability.  This section shall apply to rental agreements
between residential landlords and tenants only.  The words and terms used in
this section shall be defined and construed in conformity with all applicable
State Statutes and DOC-ILHR Codes.  The act of service by a landlord of a
legal eviction notice or notice to terminate tenancy shall not, in itself,
act as a bar to prosecution under this section.



   (C)   Procedure.  An officer may issue a citation only when the
complainant provides the following:



      (1)   The name and current address of the tenant, a copy of
the subject lease agreement, including proof that the utility service charges
were the responsibility of the tenant in addition to basic rent.



      (2)   The amount of rent or utility service charges due, the
date each was due, the date the tenant actually vacated the premises, and
testimony that the rent or utility service charges remained unpaid for not
less than 5 days after vacating and that the tenant did not notify or attempt
to notify the complainant of tenant's new address, or that tenant knowingly
gave complainant a false address.



      (3)   As to an unredeemable payment, the document used for
attempting rent or utility service charges payment, the written demand for
payment of the full amount plus bank charges, proof that the tenant received
the written demand, and testimony that at least 5 days have elapsed since the
demand was received and no payment has been made.

under this subsection if the police or peace officer did not comply with the
preceding sentence or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by
the person was true and, if believed by the police or peace officer at the
time, would have dispelled the alarm.

emergency.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subchapter, such
order shall be effective immediately, but upon petition to the Building
Inspector shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible, in the manner
provided in division (B) of this section.  After such hearing, depending
upon the findings as to whether the provisions of this subchapter have been

historic site or structure within a historic district shall reconstruct,
alter or demolish all or any part of the exterior of such property or
construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties or

such property unless a certificate of appropriateness or statement of waiver
has been granted by the Commission.  Also, unless such certificate has been
granted by the Commission, the Building Inspector shall not issue a permit
for any such work.



      (2)   Any application for a permit for any proposed
construction, alteration, or demolition of an improvement within a historic
district shall be filed with the Building Inspector.  The Building Inspector
shall, within 3 working days of receipt of the application, forward a copy of

schedule a hearing, in accordance with the requirements of a Class 2 notice,
before the Historic Preservation Commission and notify Commission members of
the date and time for said hearing.



   (B)   Certificate of appropriateness.



      (1)   Upon filing of any application for a certificate of
appropriateness with the Commission, the Commission shall grant or deny a
certificate of appropriateness within 30 days of the filing of the
application.  The Commission shall notify the City Clerk within 3 business
days of its decision.  If the Commission grants the application, within 3
business days, the City Clerk shall issue a certificate of appropriateness
which shall be sent, by regular mail, to the applicant.  If the
construction, alteration or demolition has not commenced within 1 year after
the date of issuance of the certificate of appropriateness, the certificate
of appropriateness will expire.



      (2)   If the Commission denies the application, then within 3
business days of such decision, written notice of the denial shall be sent by
the City Clerk by regular mail to the applicant.  The Commission may refuse
to grant a certificate of appropriateness for a period not to exceed 6 months
from the date of the original denial.  Within 6 months, the Commission shall
issue either a certificate of appropriateness or a statement of waiver which
shall be sent by the City Clerk by regular mail to the applicant.



   (C)   In reviewing an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the Commission shall consider the following items:



      (1)   The appropriateness to the historic district of the
proposed construction, alteration or demolition of an improvement;



      (2)   Whether such proposed construction, alteration, or
demolition of an improvement will further the purposes of this chapter;



      (3)   The historical significance of the improvement;



      (4)   The architectural value of the improvement;

building, place or area in question;



      (6)   The relation of such improvement to other improvements

recommend and the Common Council adopt as an historic district plan.



   (D)   If the Commission determines that the application for a
certificate of appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with
the character and features of the property or district, it shall issue the
certificate of appropriateness.  The Commission shall make this decision
within 30 days of the filing of the application.



   (E)   The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not
relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by
the City.  A building permit or other municipal permit shall be invalid if
it is obtained without the presentation of the certificate of appropriateness
required for the proposed work.



   (F)   Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a
certificate of appropriateness, provided that the work involves repairs to
existing features of a historic structure or site or the replacement of
elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance and provided that
the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and
does not require the issuance of a building permit.

§ 15.2.06  STATEMENT OF WAIVER.



   (A)   If the Commission fails to act upon an application for a
certificate of appropriateness within 30 days of filing of the application,
unless such time limit is extended by mutual agreement in writing, such
failure to act shall constitute a waiver by the Commission of any
requirements for a certificate of appropriateness.



   (B)   If the Commission fails to mail to the applicant notice of the
granting or denial of a certificate of appropriateness within 3 business days
of that decision, such failure shall constitute a waiver by the Commission of
any requirement for a certificate of appropriateness.



   (C)   In the event of any such waiver by the Commission, it shall
issue a statement of waiver to the applicant within 30 days after such waiver
is brought to the attention of the Commission.



   (D)   If the construction, alteration, or demolition has not
commenced within 1 year after the date of issuance of the statement of
waiver, the statement of waiver shall expire.

§ 15.2.07  APPEALS.



   Should the Commission fail to issue a certificate of appropriateness
due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the guidelines, the
applicant may appeal such decision to the Common Council within 30 days of
the mailing of the notice of denial to the applicant.



   (A)   The Common Council may affirm, overrule or modify a Commission
decision within 30 days of the receipt of the applicant's written appeal. 
Failure of the Common Council to act upon an appeal of an Commission decision
within such period of time shall constitute a denial of such appeal.  If the
Common Council overrules or modifies a Commission decision, such Common
Council decision shall have an effective date 15 days from the date of the
Common Council decision.  On such effective date, the Commission shall issue
a statement of waiver.



   (B)   The 6-month time period, following a denial of a certificate
of appropriateness by the Commission and during which a certificate of
appropriateness or statement of waiver may not be issued, shall be tolled
during the pendency of an appeal by the applicant.

owner, may cause to be prepared and erected on such property at the City's
expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property is a historic
structure, site or district.



   (B)   Such plaque shall be so placed as to be easily visible to
passing pedestrians.  In the case of a historic district, such plaque shall
state the common name of the district, and such other information as deemed
appropriate by the Commission.  In a case of rescission, the property
owner(s) shall reimburse the City the cost of the plaque.

following designation of his/her property, enter into a restrictive covenant
on the subject property after negotiation with the Commission.  The
Commission may assist the owner in preparing such covenant in the interest of
preserving the historic structure or historic site; and the owner shall cause
to be recorded such covenant in the County Register of Deeds Office, and
shall notify the City Assessor of such covenant and the conditions thereof. 
However, the restrictive covenants shall be within the applicable federal and
state regulations.

   (A)   The Commission may, with the consent of the property owner(s),
after notice and public hearing, designate historic structures and historic
sites or rescind such designation or recommendation, after application of the
criteria in § 15.2.04.  At least 10 days prior to such hearing, the

designation.



   (C)   The Commission shall then conduct such public hearing and, in
addition to the notified persons, may hear expert witnesses and shall have
the power to subpoena such witnesses and records as it deems necessary.  The
Commission may conduct an independent investigation into the proposed
designation or rescission.  Within 10 days after the close of the hearing,
the Commission may designate the property as either a historic structure or a
historic site, or rescind the designation.  After the designation or
rescission has been made, notification shall be sent to the property owner or
owners.  Notification shall also be given to the City Clerk, Building
Inspector, Plan Commission and City Assessor.  The Commission shall cause
the designation to be recorded, at City's expense, in the County Register of
Deeds Office.  The Commission shall require the property owner(s) to record
the rescission at the property owner(s) expense.



(Ord. 705/96, passed 3-28-96)



§ 15.2.11  CREATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICT.



   (A)   For preservation purposes, the Commission shall, with the
consent of the property owner(s), select geographically defined areas within
the City to be designated as historic districts and shall prepare a historic
preservation plan for each area.  A historic district may be designated for
any geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural
significance to the City, after application of the criteria in § 15.2.04. 
Each historic preservation plan prepared for or by the Commission shall
include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic
significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development and a
statement of preservation objectives.



   (B)   Review and adoption procedure.



      (1)   Historic Preservation Commission.



         (a)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing when
considering the plan for a historic district.  Notice of the time, place and
purpose of the public hearing shall be sent by the City Clerk to the
alderperson(s) in which the historic district is located and the owners of
record, as listed in the office of the City Assessor, who are owners of the
property within the proposed historic district or are situated in whole or in
part within 200 feet of the boundaries of the proposed historic district. 
Said notice is to be sent at least 10 days prior to the date of the public
hearing.  Following said public hearing, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall vote to recommend, reject or withhold action on the plan.



         (b)   The Commission shall also notify the Director of
Public Works, Fire Chief, Wastewater Utility Director, Police Chief, Building

the Commission within 30 days of notification with its comments on the
proposed designation.



      (2)   The Common Council.  The Common Council, upon receipt
of the recommendations from the Historic Preservation Commission, shall hold
a public hearing, notice to be given as noted in subdivision (B)(1) of this
section and shall, following the public hearing, either designate or reject
the historic district.  Designation of the historic district shall
constitute adoption of the plan prepared for that district and direct the
implementation of said plan.



(Ord. 705/96, passed 3-28-96)



§ 15.2.12  SALE OF HISTORIC STRUCTURE AND SITES.



   (A)   Any party who is listed as the owner of record of a historic
structure or historic site at the time of designation, who can demonstrate to
the Commission that by virtue of such designation he/she is unable to find a
buyer willing to preserve such historic structure or historic site, even
though he/she has made reasonable attempts in good faith to find and attract
a buyer, may petition the Commission to recommend to the Common Council a
rescission of its designation.



   (B)   Following the filing of such petition with the City Clerk:



      (1)   The owner and the Commission shall work together in good
faith to locate a buyer for the subject property who is willing to abide by
its designation.



      (2)   If at the end of a period not exceeding 6 months from
the date of such petition, no such buyer can be found, and if the owner still
desires to obtain such rescission, the Commission shall recommend to the
Common Council to rescind its designation of the subject property.



      (3)   In the event of such rescission, the Commission shall
notify the City Clerk, Building Inspector, City Planner and the City Assessor
of the same, and shall cause the same to be recorded, at the City's expense,
in the County Register of Deeds Office.



      (4)   Following any such rescission, the Commission may not
recommend to designate the subject property as a historic structure or
historic site for a period of not less than 5 years following the date of
rescission.



(Ord. 705/96, passed 3-28-96)



§ 15.2.13  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; EXCEPTION.



   (A)   Every person in charge of any historic structure or historic
site or improvement in a historic district shall maintain the same or cause
to permit it to be maintained in a condition consistent with the provisions
of this chapter.



   (B)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit the making of
necessary construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any
improvement on a historic site or in a historic district pursuant to the
order of any government agency or pursuant to any court judgment, for the
purpose of remedying emergency conditions determined to be dangerous to life,
health or property.  In such cases, no approval from the Commission or
Common Council shall be required.



(Ord. 705/96, passed 3-28-96)  Penalty, see § 1.1.99



§ 15.2.14  FAILURE OF APPLICANT TO ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH COMMISSION
CRITERIA.



   In the event the applicant makes no attempt to discuss with the
Commission alternatives to save the subject property or to comply with
Commission criteria for construction, alteration or demolition, the
Commission may appeal to the Council for 1 additional stay of construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition.  Such Commission appeal shall be
filed in writing with the City Clerk prior to the expiration of the original
6-month delay period and shall be acted on by the Common Council within 30
days after receipt of the written appeal.  The Common Council may deny such
appeal or grant such appeal for an additional delay period of not more than 6
months.  The burden of showing that the applicant has not attempted to
discuss alternatives with the Commission shall be upon the Commission.  Upon
expiration of any additional delay period, the Commission shall issue a
statement of waiver and the Building Inspector may issue the permit as
requested.



(Ord. 705/96, passed 3-28-96)

   No building permit shall be issued by the Building Inspector for
alteration, demolition, or removal of a nominated historic structure,
historic site, or any property or structure within a nominated historic
district from the date of the meeting of the Commission at which a nomination
form is first presented until the final disposition of the nomination by the
Commission or the Common Council unless such alteration, removal or
demolition is authorized by formal resolution of the Common Council as
necessary for public health, welfare or safety.  In no event shall the delay
be for more than 6 months.

§ 15.3.001  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wisconsin
Statutes, §§ 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and cities; §§ 59.69, 59.692,
and 59.694 for counties; and the requirements in Wisconsin Statutes § 87.30.



(Ord. 904, passed 5-2-06)



§ 15.3.002  FINDING OF FACT.



   Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this
municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general
welfare and tax base.



(Ord. 904, passed 5-2-06)



§ 15.3.003  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to:



   (A)   Protect life, health and property;



   (B)   Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control
projects;



   (C)   Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense
of the taxpayers;



   (D)   Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;



   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;



   (F)   Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the
floodplain;



   (G)   Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;



   (H)   Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood
damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and



   (I)   Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any
practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of
the floodplain.



(Ord. 904, passed 5-2-06)



§ 15.3.004  TITLE.



   This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for
Medford, Wisconsin.



(Ord. 904, passed 5-2-06)



§ 15.3.005  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Areas to be regulated.  This chapter regulates all areas that
would be covered by the regional flood or base flood.  Note: Base flood
elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance
Study.  Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies.  Areas
covered by the base flood are identified as A-Zones on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map.



   (B)   Official maps and revisions.  The boundaries of all
floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones on the maps
listed below and the revisions in the Medford Floodplain Appendix.  Any
change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by
the DNR and FEMA before it is effective.  No changes to regional flood
elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the
DNR.  These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Zoning
Administrator, Medford, WI.  If more than 1 map or revision is referenced,
the most current approved information shall apply.



   (C)   Official maps based on the FIS:



      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 550599
0004 A, dated September 1, 1978; and



      (2)   Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFW), panel number
550435 0005 B, dated September 1, 1978, with corresponding profiles that are
based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated October 1978.  Approved by: 
The DNR and FEMA.



   (D)   Official maps based on other studies.



      (1)   Correction Creek Floodplain Management Study, dated
1993, prepared by USDA Soil Conservation Service in cooperation with the City
of Medford, Taylor County and the Wisconsin DNR.  Approved by:  The DNR and
FEMA.



      (2)   Weather Shield Dam: Non-existent Floodplain map,
prepared by AECOM and dated December 2011.  Approved by: The DNR.



   (E)   Establishment of districts.  The regional floodplain areas
are divided into 3 districts as follows:



      (1)   The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or
stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to
carry the regional floodwaters.



      (2)   The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the
floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway.



      (3)   The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas
that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.



   (F)   Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between
boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions
shall be resolved using the criteria in divisions (F)(1) or (2) below.  If a
significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to §§
15.3.071et seq.  The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived
from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a
map amendment is required.  The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible
for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon
which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map
amendments required under this section.  Disputes between the Zoning
Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be
settled according to § 15.3.063 and the criteria in divisions (F)(1) and (2)
below.



      (1)   If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile
elevations shall determine the district boundary.  The regional or base
flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.



      (2)   Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the
boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and
any information provided by the Department. 



      (3)   Note:  Where the flood profiles are based on
established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map
amendment pursuant to § 15.3.071(F).



   (G)   Removal of lands from floodplain.



      (1)   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not
be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least
2 feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to
land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to §§
15.3.071et seq. 



      (2)   Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements
for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance.  The property owner must
contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC).



   (H)   Compliance.  Any development or use within the areas
regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this
chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.



   (I)   Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless
specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are
required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. 
State agencies are required to comply if Wisconsin Statutes § 13.48(13)
applies.  The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state
highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt
when Wisconsin Statutes § 30.2022 applies.



   (J)   Abrogation and greater restrictions.



      (1)   This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any
municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wisconsin Statutes §§ 59.69,
59.692 or 59.694 for counties; § 62.23 for cities; or § 61.35 for villages;
or § 87.30, which relate to floodplains.  If another ordinance is more
restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force
and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.



      (2)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or
impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements.  If this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail.



   (K)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed
in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any
other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this
chapter, required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision
shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the
adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text
amendment to this chapter.



   (L)   Warning and disclaimer of liability.  The flood protection
standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific
research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by
manmade or natural causes.  This chapter does not imply or guarantee that
non-floodplain area or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding
and flood damages.  Nor does this chapter create liability on the part of,
or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.



   (M)   Severability.  Should any portion of this chapter be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this chapter shall not be affected.



   (N)   Annexed areas for cities and villages.  The Taylor County
floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain
in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas
until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the
requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP).  These annexed lands are described on the municipality's
official zoning map.  County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated
by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in
the office of the municipal Zoning Administrator.  All plats or mans of
annexations shall show the regional flood elevation and location of floodways.



   (O)   General development standards.  The community shall review
all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding.  If a proposed building site is in a
flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be
designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located
so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding.  Subdivisions shall be reviewed for
compliance with the above standard.  All subdivision proposals (including-
manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway
data for any development which  meets the subdivision definition of this
chapter.

§ 15.3.051  GENERAL.



   (A)   Applicability.  If these standards conform with Wisconsin
Statutes § 59.69(10), for counties or Wisconsin Statutes § 62.23(7)(h), for
cities and villages, they shall apply to all modifications or additions to
any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or
premises which was lawful before the passage of this chapter or any amendment
thereto.



   (B)   The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may continue
subject to the following conditions:



      (1)   (a)   No modification or addition to a nonconforming
use or structure shall be permitted unless the modification or addition
complies with this chapter.  The words "modification" and "addition" include
but are not limited to any alteration, addition, modification, structural
repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such existing use, structure or
accessory structure or use.  Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered
an extension, modification or addition; these include painting, decorating,
paneling and the replacement of doors, windows and other nonstructural
components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private
sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities. Ordinary
maintenance repairs do not include any costs associated with the repair of a
damaged structure.



         (b)   The construction of a deck that does not exceed
200 square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal
structure is not an extension, modification, or addition.  The roof of the
structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe
ingress and egress to the principal structure.



      (2)   If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming
structure is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer
permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure or building
thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter;



      (3)   The municipality shall keep a record which lists all
nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized
assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been
permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those
modifications represent;



      (4)   No modification or addition to any nonconforming
structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of
the structure would exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value, shall
be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming
structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this chapter.  Contiguous dry land access must be provided
for residential and commercial uses in compliance with § 15.3.033(B).  The
costs of elevating a nonconforming building or a building with a
nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded from the 50%
provision of this division.



      (5)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B) above, if
any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is
destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed
or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet the ordinance
requirements.  A structure is considered substantially damaged if the total
cost to restore the structure to its pre-damaged condition exceeds 50% of the
structure's present equalized assessed value.



         (b)   For nonconforming buildings that are damaged or
destroyed by a non-flood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such
nonconforming building may be permitted in order to restore it after the
non-flood disaster, provided that the nonconforming building will meet all of
the minimum requirements under 44 C.F.R. Pt. 60, or under the regulations
promulgated thereunder.



      (6)   A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the
alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a
historic structure, the alteration will comply with § 15.3.023, flood
resistant materials are used, and construction practices and floodproofing
methods that comply with § 15.3.065 are used.

including its use, which would preclude its continued designation as an
historic structure.



      (4)   When a floodplain variance is granted the Board shall
notify the applicant in writing that it may increase flood insurance premiums
and risks to life and property.  A copy shall be maintained with the

§ 15.4.07  STREET LAYOUT.



   (A)   In general, street and block layouts within the City limits
shall conform to those shown on the master subdivision plan.  In those areas

continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.



   (C)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of
the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing or the most advantageous development of
adjacent tracts.  Dead end streets not over 400 feet in length may be
approved where necessitated by topography or other physical features, or
where, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, they are appropriate for the
type of development contemplated.

§ 15.4.14  LAND DIVISIONS OTHER THAN SUBDIVISIONS.



   (A)   Applicability.  Any division of lot, parcel or tract of land
into 2 or more parcels or building sites, other than subdivisions defined and
regulated in this section, shall be subject to the provisions of this
section.  However, any such division which creates parcels or building sites
greater than 5 acres, and which does not include any new public streets or
other public ways may be exempted from these provisions by the Plan
Commission.



   (B)   Scope.  If the Plan Commission finds that the application of
the provisions of this section to a particular subdivision might create an
unreasonable hardship or involve peculiar difficulties, including but not
limited to prohibitive cost due to lack of reference corners, the Plan
Commission may waive the requirements contained herein.  However, no such
waiver shall be granted for divisions containing lots which do not comply
with the provisions of this section.



   (C)   Procedures for approval.



      (1)   The divider shall file a certified survey map with the
City Planner who shall within 45 days approve, approve conditionally or
reject the certified survey map.  The City Planner may present the certified
survey map to the Plan Commission for their approval should any extraordinary
conditions or conflicting situation(s) with the Code be evident with the
certified survey map. The divider shall be notified in writing of any
conditions of approval or the reasons for rejection.



      (2)   A written application containing information on the
reason for the survey and all pertinent facts thereto shall accompany the map.



   (D)   Requirements.

A minimum of 5 copies shall be provided to the Clerk's office.



   (F)   Variations and exceptions.  Where the Plan Commission finds
that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from
strict compliance with these regulations, it may recommend to the Common
Council variations or exceptions to the regulations so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such
variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purpose of this chapter, and further provided the Plan Commission shall not
recommend variations or exceptions to the regulations of this code unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that:



      (1)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to
the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.



      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is
based are unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are
not applicable, generally to other property.



      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape
or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations were carried out.

§ 15.4.15  CONSTRUCTION ALTERNATIVES.



   (A)   Before the final plat is approved by the Common Council the
divider shall submit a public utility construction plan, a construction
estimate, a construction agreement and performance bond or some other similar
surety acceptable to the City equal to 100% of the engineer's estimated cost
of the required improvements or cash escrow agreement or other surety to
assure the following:



      (1)   Completion of the required public improvements within a
two year period.



      (2)   Payment by the subdivider for all costs incurred by the
City for review and inspection.  This will include the preparation and
review, plans and specifications by the City Planner and Attorney as well as
other costs of similar nature.

   (B)   The developer may elect to have these improvements constructed
in one of the two following ways:



      (1)   The developer may construct the improvements through his
own financing and construction.  In this case the developer will prepare
utility plans with construction estimates, which shall be submitted to the
City for review and approval prior to construction.  The construction shall
be inspected as determined by the City to see that it is in compliance with
the City's construction design requirements.  Upon completion of these
improvements, they shall be accepted by the City when found to be in
conformity with City standards as determined by the Director of Public Works.



      (2)   The developer may elect to request the City to construct
the improvements under the City's Capital Improvement Program.  In this case
the City will design and construct the improvements under the next Public
Works Program that it can be included in.  The City will bill the developer
for the design and the developer's share of these improvements as per §
15.4.16 of this chapter.  Should the developer elect to have the City make
the improvements, such request shall be made prior to but in no event later
than October 1 of the year preceding construction.

§ 15.4.16  FINANCING METHODS.



   The subdivider can finance his share of the public improvements defined
above by either of the following 2 methods:



   (A)   By requesting the City to finance these improvements under
Wisconsin Statutes § 66.0703 pertaining to special assessments.  This
statute shall be subject to the following restrictions:



      (1)   The assessments shall be applied on an equal basis to
all developable lots.



      (2)   Lots that are not intended for improvement or
development shall not be assessed improvement costs.



      (3)   Should the developer request the City to proceed under
Wisconsin Statutes § 66.0703, the interest rate charged the developer shall
be one-half of one percent (0.5%) above the rate the City pays for funds
pertaining to said project.



   (B)   The developer may proceed to finance this project through his
own private finances.  In this case the City will reimburse the developer
for its share of the actual costs of construction of the improvements as they
are made upon presentation of a bill to the City.



(Ord. 559, passed 6-8-88)



§ 15.4.17  OTHER FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS.



   (A)   The City will proceed under the special assessment methods of
Wisconsin Statutes § 66.0703 for financing only for projects involving 1
block in distance as defined previously in this code.  The Council may waive
this requirement upon the presentation of specific circumstances which
preclude the development to proceed in at least 1 block units.



   (B)   Should the developer pursue financing through Wisconsin
Statutes § 66.0703 (repayment in 10 equal installments) the remaining
special assessment against any lot plus accrued interest shall be payable
upon the sale of such lot.



(Ord. 559, passed 6-8-88)



§ 15.4.18  ENFORCEMENT.



   The Zoning Administrator shall have primary responsibility for
enforcing the code.  No building permit shall be issued for construction on
any lot until the final plat for the subdivision has been duly recorded, or a
certified survey map is recorded.

OFF-STREET PARKING AREA SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS CODE



§ 15.5.15  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   The purpose and intent of these requirements is to assemble the minimum
parking area requirements into one publication which is easy to administer. 
The requirements include requirements on the minimum number of required
spaces, size and layout of parking areas, handicap parking requirements, and
landscaping.  The landscaping requirements have been reduced to a single
worksheet which the Zoning Administrator may use in assisting applicants in
achieving compliance.  The worksheet is attached to Ordinance 586 as
Appendix #1.

minimum requirements of the Zoning Code.  Compliance will also fulfill the
requirements of Wisconsin Statutes § 346.503 with respect to parking spaces
for vehicles displaying special registration plates or special identification
cards.



   (B)   The parking area landscaping requirements do not supersede or
replace the design requirements of the Zoning Code.  Additional landscaping
may be required of applicants under the provisions of the Zoning Code.

   Additions to existing parking lots shall be governed by the following:



   (A)   If an existing parking lot is increased in gross area (paved)
by 50% or more, the entire parking lot shall comply with requirements
contained herein.



   (B)   If an existing parking lot is increased in gross area (paved)
by less than 50%, only that portion of the parking lot that is added shall be
required to conform to the requirements herein.



   (C)   Percentage requirements established in divisions (A) and (B)
of this section shall apply to the accumulative sum of all additions
undertaken after January 1, 1989.



   (D)   Two or more parking areas interconnected by on-site vehicular
circulation are treated as 1 lot as are unconnected parking areas when
separations (unpaved) between them are less than 20 feet in width. 
Unconnected parking areas with a separation of 20 feet or more shall be

§ 15.5.24  MINIMUM LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.



   All open off-street parking areas for 4 or more vehicles will require
landscaping.  The standards herein are designated to provide flexibility in
meeting the landscape requirement.  Applicants can establish a landscape
design which most effectively achieves the desired aesthetic results, and is
consistent with the need of providing readily accessible and visible parking.



   (A)   Landscaping objectives.



      (1)   The objectives of the landscape standards are to
recognize both the functional importance of parking areas and the public
benefits associated with well-designed landscaped areas which enhance the
visual environment, promote public safety, moderate the microclimate and
reduce nuisances, such as noise and glare.



      (2)   The overall intent of the landscape standards is to
soften the visual and other sensory impacts.  This can be achieved through
the use of large canopy trees and well-designed clustered plantings; as
opposed to the requirement of screening the entire perimeter with a hedge or
fence.



   (B)   Minimum canopy tree and parking space requirements.



      (1)   All off-street vehicular parking areas with more than 6
vehicles shall provide and maintain 1 canopy-type tree for each 12 parking
spaces, or fraction thereof, over the initial 6 spaces.  Canopy trees shall
be located in tree islands, or within 10 feet of the periphery of the parking
area surface.  The preservation of desirable existing trees is encouraged. 
Existing mature trees which are a minimum of 2"-2½" caliper and are within
the distance requirements may be applied toward the canopy standard.  All
newly planted canopy trees must also have a minimum of 2"-2½" caliper.



      (2)   Parking spaces must be broken by a tree island at the
rate of 1 tree island for each linear row of 12 parking spaces, for single
row configurations, or for each 24 parking spaces in double row
configurations.

   (C)   Screening standards for parking areas near residential zoned
parcels.



      (1)   In the following situations there shall be a screening
barrier for the purpose of obstructing light beams and muffling noise:



         (a)   Where an off-street parking area for 4 or more
vehicles abuts within 25 feet of an adjoining lot line in an "R-Residential"
Zoning District (R-1, R-2 or R-3).



         (b)   Where an off-street parking for 4 or more vehicles
is located in a manner where nearby residentially zoned properties would be
affected by headlight glare (i.e., directly across a public right-of-way).



      (2)   The effective height of the barrier shall be a minimum
of 3½' above the surface of the parking area.  Such a barrier may consist
of wood or masonry fencing, walls, berming, or the use of plant material. 
Where plant materials are used for screening, they shall be of suitable size
and density to accomplish the screening objective within 3 years from the
time of planting.



   (D)   Minimum landscape element standards and point scoring system.



      (1)   In addition to the requirements for canopy trees and
residential screening, all parking areas shall be required to accumulate a
minimum number of points.  The number of points required is based on the
number of parking spaces.  Parking areas for 4 or more vehicles are required
to accumulate 15 points for each space.



      (2)   To qualify for points, the landscape elements must be
located in a manner which primarily meet the objectives of landscaping
parking areas.  The criteria used to determine which landscape elements
qualify are:  (a) perimeters adjacent to public rights-of-way; (b) interior
areas and immediate perimeters to the parking area; and (c) perimeter of lots
adjacent to other property.  Landscaping which primarily serves the
aesthetic enhancement of the building and related open areas will qualify for
50% of the accumulation of points.  Points are tabulated in the following
manner:

         (e)   The applicant may request points for decorative
fence, earth berms, ground covers, existing vegetation and shrubs of the
mature height of not less than 2 feet.  It must be demonstrated by the
applicant that these landscape elements will contribute to the overall
landscape objectives.  The number of points credited will be negotiated with
the Zoning Administrator and subject to review by the Plan Commission.



   (E)   Minimum dimensions for tree islands and planted areas.



      (1)   All tree islands and landscaped areas with trees shall
be a minimum of 4 feet as measured from the inside of any curb or frame.



      (2)   All landscape areas without trees, but planted with
shrubs, shall have a minimum width of 3 feet measured from inside the curb or
frame.



   (F)   Unsuitable species.  Several shrubs and trees, which are not
native to Wisconsin, have an established history of spreading to nearby parks
and conservancy areas.  These non-native plants tend to become overly
abundant and ultimately eliminate many desirable native species.  The
control and eradication of these unsuitable plants create a costly management
problem.  The following species of plant material are unsuitable for use as
landscape plants:



      (1)   Honeysuckle:  lonicera x-bella, lonicera marrawi and
lonicera tartarica.



      (2)   Buckthorn (common):  rhamnus cathartica and rhamnus
frangula (tall hedge).



      (3)   Norway maple:  acer negcindo.



(Ord. 586, passed 6-21-89)  Penalty, see § 1.1.99



§ 15.5.25  ADJUSTMENTS TO PARKING REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Adjustments in the minimum of spaces may be authorized by the
Plan Commission where the applicant can document shared facilities
arrangements with neighboring uses or where there are documented shared-ride
or carpooling programs.  The documentation for the joint use of shared
parking facilities must be in the form of an easement or contract between
property owners specifying the number of shared parking spaces and the terms
and conditions of the joint usage of parking areas and access.



   (B)   The Plan Commission may authorize stalls sized for smaller
vehicles (8' x 16') where the number of stalls being provided exceeds the
minimum number required and where all of the minimum required stalls are full
sized (9' x 18').



   (C)   The Plan Commission may authorize adjustments to the
requirements where literal compliance with the specifications and standards
would make the parking lot landscaping ineffective or unnecessary. 
Topographic constraints, existing vegetation, traffic safety, or compliance
with fire or other public safety requirements may necessitate adjustments. 
The applicant should be prepared to respond to the following criteria in
requesting an adjustment:



      (1)   The specific conditions which are unique to the
applicant's land and do not exist on other land.



      (2)   The manner in which the strict application of the
standards would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in the
manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners.



      (3)   Reasons that an adjustment to the standard would
preserve, not harm, the public safety and welfare and will not alter the
essential character of the area.



   (D)   Landscape standards for industrial areas.



      (1)   Introduction.  The adopted City landscape for parking
areas are intended to achieve desired aesthetic and environmental results
from both within the interior and along the perimeter of parking areas. 
This is accomplished, in part, by applying the canopy tree, tree island and a
minimum point schedule of 15 points for each parking space.  The application
of requirements provides a pleasing landscape transition between structures
and the necessary parking facility.  In addition, the landscape standards
provide acceptable levels of community appearance for parking areas which are
viewed from adjacent streets, public recreation areas and residentially-zoned
lands.  The intent, however, is to provide landscape parking areas which are
planned and designed to blend with the overall desired community
appearance.  The standard requirements do not attempt to fully screen or
hide parking areas.



      (2)   Variance for industrial parking.  Applicants proposing
industrial parking lots other than for designated visitor parking may propose
a landscape option of effectively screening parking lots from off-site
view.  This variance would not require compliance of the canopy tree, tree
island and minimum point schedule requirements.  However, the proposed
parking lot must conform to the landscape standard of full screening of the
parking lot from public right-of-ways, public recreation sites and
residentially-zoned lands.



      (3)   Minimum industrial screening standard.



         (a)   The proposed plan must satisfy the following
conditions:



            1.   Effectively screen the parking area from
views from public right-of-ways, public recreation sites and
residentially-zoned lands.



            2.   Comply with the landscape requirements
included under standard application (§ 15.5.17), checklist (§ 15.5.19),
minimum dimensions (§ 15.5.24(E)) and species limitations (§ 15.5.24(F)).



            3.   Where plant materials are used for barrier
screening, they must be of suitable size and density to accomplish the
screening objective in the leaf-on season and within 5 growing seasons.



            4.   The effective height of the screen shall be
not less than 4 feet.



            5.   Designated visitor parking areas and major
entry drives are not included in this variance.



            6.   The screening area plan shall be subject to
design review by City staff to determine the functional conditions of the
screen and the aesthetic appearance of the proposal.  Designs should strive
for some level of diversity in utilizing landscape elements.  This may
include some combination of trees and shrubs, fence and landscape berms. 
The design review still includes an equal expectation of functional screening
and a design which provides a visually-pleasing character to the parking
perimeter.



            7.   Plans for parking areas shall include a
description of snow removal methods and indicate snow storage areas.  This
shall be done in sufficient detail to demonstrate required plant screening
will not be killed or harmed.



         (b)   Applicants may find it useful to submit a
preliminary proposal to determine the specific areas requiring screening. 
The specific proposal will provide the detail of contractual plans.

§ 15.7.002  FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.



   Uncontrolled use of shorelands and pollution of the navigable waters of
the municipality would adversely affect the public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of
Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:



   (A)   Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general
welfare;



   (B)   Limit certain land use activities detrimental to shorelands;



   (C)   Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by controlling the
location of structures in shoreland areas and restricting the removal of

the district boundaries and the regulations contained in this Code in
accordance with the requirements of Wisconsin Statutes § 62.23(7)(d)2., NR
117, Wis. Adm. Code, and the following.



   (B)   A copy of each proposed text or map amendment shall be
submitted to the appropriate district office of the Department within 5 days
of the submission of the proposed amendment to the municipal planning agency.



   (C)   All proposed text and map amendments to the shoreland-wetland
zoning regulations shall be referred to the municipal planning agency, and a
public hearing shall be held after class II notice, as required by Wisconsin
Statutes § 62.23(7)(d)2. The appropriate district office of the Department
shall be provided with written notice of the public hearing at least 10 days
prior to such hearing.



   (D)   In order to insure that this Code will remain consistent with
the shoreland protection objectives of Wisconsin Statutes § 144.26, the
municipal governingbody may not rezone a wetland in a shoreland-wetland
zoning district, or any portion thereof, where the proposed rezoning may
result in a significant adverse impact upon any of the following wetland
functions:



      (1)   Storm and flood water storage capacity;



      (2)   Maintenance of dry season stream flow or the discharge
of groundwater to a wetland, the recharge of groundwater from a wetland to
another area or the flow of groundwater through a wetland;



      (3)   Filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;



      (4)   Shoreline protection against erosion;



      (5)   Fish spawning, breeding, nursery or feeding grounds;



      (6)   Wildlife habitat; or



      (7)   Areas of special recreational, scenic or scientific
interest, including scarce wetland types and habitat of endangered species.



   (E)   Where the district office of the Department determines that a
proposed rezoning may have a significant adverse impact upon any of the
criteria listed in division (D) above, the Department shall so notify the
municipality of its determination, either prior to or during the public
hearing held on the proposed amendment.



   (F)   The appropriate district office of the Department shall be
provided with:



      (1)   A copy of the recommendation and report, if any, of the
municipal planning agency on a proposed text or map amendment, within 10 days
after the submission of those recommendations to the municipal governing body;



      (2)   Written notice of the action on the proposed text or map
amendment within 10 days after the action is taken.



   (G)   If the Department notifies the municipal planning agency in
writing that a proposed amendment may have a significant adverse impact upon
any of the criteria listed in division (D) above, that proposed amendment, if
approved by the municipal governing body, shall not become effective until
more than 30 days have elapsed since written notice of the municipal approval
was mailed to the Department, as required by division (F) above. If within
the 30-day period, the Department notifies the municipality that the
Department intends to adopt a superseding shoreland-wetland zoning Code for
the municipality, as provided by Wisconsin Statutes §§ 62.231(6) and
61.351(6), the proposed amendment shall not become effective until the Code
adoption procedure under Wisconsin Statutes §§ 62.231(6) or 61.351(6) is
completed or otherwise terminated.

(Ord. 1001, passed 7-21-15)



§ 15.7.023  DEFINITIONS.



   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE OR USE. A detached subordinate structure or a use
which is clearly incidental to, and customarily found in connection with, the
principal structure or use to which it is related, and which is located on
the same lot as that of the principal structure or use.



   DEPARTMENT. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.



   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures or
accessory structures; the construction of additions or substantial
alterations to buildings, structures or accessory structures; the placement
of buildings or structures; ditching, lagooning, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction
of earthen materials.



   DRAINAGE SYSTEM. One or more artificial ditches, tile drains or similar
devices which collect surface runoff or groundwater and convey it to a point
of discharge.



   ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITY. Any facility, temporary or permanent,
which is reasonably expected to abate, reduce or aid in the prevention,
measurement, control or monitoring of noise, air or water pollutants, solid
waste and thermal pollution, radiation or other pollutants, including
facilities installed principally to supplement or to replace existing
property or equipment not meeting or allegedly not meeting acceptable
pollution control standards, or which are to be supplemented or replaced by
other pollution control facilities.



   NAVIGABLE WATERS. Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland
lakes within Wisconsin, and all streams, ponds, sloughs, flowages and other
waters within the territorial limits of this state, including the Wisconsin
portion of boundary waters, which are navigable under the laws of this state.
Under Wisconsin Statutes § 144.26(2)(d), notwithstanding any other provision
of law or administrative rule promulgated thereunder, shoreland codes
required under Wisconsin Statutes §§ 61.351 or 62.231 and chapter NR 117,
Wis. Adm. Code, do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if:



      (1)   Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable
stream or river;



      (2)   Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such
lands were not navigable streams before ditching; and



      (3)   Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural
use.



Wisconsin's Supreme Court has declared navigable bodies of water that have a
bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow sufficient to
support navigation by a recreational craft of the shallowest draft on an
annually recurring basis [Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492
(1952) and DeGaynor and Co., Inc., v. Department of Natural Resources, 70
Wis. 2d 936 (1975)]. For example, a stream which is navigable by skiff or
canoe during normal spring high water is navigable, in fact, under the laws
of this state though it may be dry during other seasons.



   ORDINARY HIGH-WATER MARK. The point on the bank or shore up to which
the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a
distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized
characteristic.



   PLANNING AGENCY. The municipal plan commission created under Wisconsin
Statutes § 62.23(1), a board of public land commissioners or a committee of
the municipality’s governing body which acts on matters pertaining to
planning and zoning.



   PRINCIPAL BUILDING. The main building or structure on a single lot or
parcel of land, including any attached garage or attached porch.



   SHORELAND SETBACK AREA. As defined in Wisconsin Statutes §
59.692(l)(bn).



   SHORELAND-WETLAND DISTRICT. The zoning district created in this
chapter, comprised of shorelands that are designated as wetlands on the
wetlands inventory maps which have been adopted and made a part of this Code.



   SHORELANDS. 



      (1)   The meaning given in Wisconsin Statutes § 59.692(1 )(b);



      (2)   Lands within the following distances from the ordinary
high-water mark of navigable waters: 1,000 feet from a lake, pond or flowage;
and 300 feet from a river or stream, or to the landward side of the
floodplain, whichever distance is greater.



   WETLAND ALTERATION. Any filling, flooding, draining, dredging,
ditching, tiling, excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures or
dike and dam construction in a wetland area.



   WETLANDS. Those areas where water is at, near or above the land surface
long enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation, and which have
soils indicative of wet conditions.

CITY RECORDS



   I.   Costs of Locating Documents.



   Most of the City's records are readily available or can be located in a
relatively short period of time. There will be no fee imposed for locating a
record upon any person who requests a record if the costs of locating the
record does not exceed $50.00.



   In those cases where a record is not readily available for whatever
reason and where it appears that the costs of locating a record will exceed
$50.00, the official legal custodians will seek the prior written approval of
the requester before proceeding. In addition, the custodians will endeavor,
but will not be required, to provide an estimate of the total anticipated
costs for locating the record.



   The City will determine the cost of locating a record by using the
current hourly rate for employees involved in attempting to locate the record.



   II.   Reproduction Expenses.



      1.   Costs of copying and reproduction of records where
equipment is available.



         A.   $.25 per page.



         B.   There will be no cost charged for clerical
employees' time in photocopying fewer than 10 copies.



         C.   If more than 11 pages are to be copied, an hourly
charge of $29.00/hour shall be paid in advance by the person making the
request on a 1/4 hourly basis. (This is an average of the City Clerk,
Treasurer, Deputy Clerk, Account Technician, and Clerical/Receptionist's
salary/wage including benefits.)



         D.   If a requester requests a record which is not a
document subject to normal copying (e.g., audio tape, video tape, computer
disc, G.I.S. maps, etc.), the requester will be charged an hourly charge of
$29.00/hour beyond the first 15 minutes, to be paid in advance, for time
expended by City staff in duplicating/reproducing the record.



      2.   Costs of reproduction of records where equipment is not
available within the City.



         A.   If equipment necessary for any reproduction is not
available within the City, the City may rent whatever equipment is necessary
to perform the function and will bill the requester for such rental fee. The
cost charged will be the actual costs paid by the City to the third party
vendor. Items in such a situation would include, but would not be limited to,
rental charges for audio or video tape reproduction equipment, microfilm or
fiche or ultra fiche reproduction equipment, assorted computer hardware and
software.



         B.   At its option, the City may use an outside vendor
to reproduce/duplicate the record. The requester is then charged the actual
cost for this service, including any incidental charges such as mailing or
delivery charges.



   III.   Disputes.



      1.   The official legal custodians of the records of the City
shall report any disputes which arise under this fee schedule to the Common
Council and shall recommend such modifications and revisions as they deem
necessary.



   IV.   Payment of Fees.



      1.   The official legal custodians of the records of the City
may require the payment of costs provided herein in advance, if exceeding
$5.00.



      2.   The official legal custodians of the records of the City
may, in his/her sole discretion, elect to waive the imposition of the costs
provided for herein.

such are approved by the City Council on the recommendation of the Planning
Commission in accordance with procedures prescribed for Zoning Amendments
by Section 62.23 Wisconsin Statutes. It is recognized that carefully planned
large scale developments may deserve certain exceptions from the otherwise
fixed requirements of the Zoning District (such as setbacks and minimum lot
27
sizes) where the resulting development would better serve the objectives of this
Code, than would a development of the same land without the use of the
exceptions. A condition of all Planned Unit Developments would require the
preservation of certain open space in perpetuity, or dedication to the City.
2. The area proposed for the Planned Unit Development must be at least five (5)
acres in size. Application for establishing a Planned Unit Development District
must be made in writing to the City Council, which must include duplicate plans
showing the location of all boundaries, buildings, sewage disposal and water
supply facilities, together with information showing how all the applicable
provisions of this Code will be complied with, the exceptions requested, and the
reasons why the applicant considers the exceptions to be consistent with the
spirit of this Code. The Plans may provide for a combination of single and
multiple family development, as well as related commercial uses. The City
council may request the applicant to submit such other maps, studies, plans or
pertinent information as shall be necessary to its consideration of the
application.
3. The application shall be submitted to the City Planning Commission, which
shall hold a public hearing thereon and make a report to the City Council as
required by law. If an application seeks approval of a Planned Unit
Development plat, without first seeking or granting of an overlay, a hearing
must be held on such plat as on any regular amendment to the Zoning Code. If,
however, a hearing is first held on the overlay for a Planned Unit Development
District, a second public hearing need not be held in connection with the
approval of a subsequent plat or plat which complies with the overlay district as
approved.
4. After report from the Planning Commission, Common Council shall hold a
public hearing thereon and shall make written findings as to the compliance of
noncompliance of the proposed Planned Unit Development overlay district with
the provisions of this Code. If the application is granted in whole or in part, the
Common Council’s approval shall attach such written conditions to the approval
as shall be required by or be consistent with this Code. The condition of
approval shall, in all cases, establish the specific restrictions applicable with
regard to minimum lot sizes, widths, setbacks, preservation of ground cover and
open space, etc. In passing upon an application for Planned Unit Development
District, the Common Council shall evaluate the effect of the proposed
development upon:
a. The maintenance of safe and healthful conditions
b. The prevention and control of water pollution, including sedimentation
c. Existing topographic and drainage features and vegetative cover on the
site
d. The location of the site with respect to any floodplains
e. The erosion potential of the site based upon degree and direction of
slope, soil type and vegetative cover
f. The location of the site with respect to existing future roads and
sidewalks as determined to serve the needs of the area involved
28
g. Whether the development will constitute a reasonable extension of the
living areas in the City and will be compatible with surrounding land
uses
h. The type and adequacy of the sewerage disposal and water supply
systems
i. The anticipated demand for police, fire, ambulance, solid, waste
disposal, and school facilities and services and the adequacy of the
existing facilities and services to accommodate the anticipated demand
5. If the Planning Commission and the Common Council approve a PUD, the
developer shall comply with all conditions attached to such approval, and shall
complete the project as specified in his or her application, as modified by the
conditions.
3.11 Exclusive Agriculture District
Land in this district shall be used for purposes permitted by this subsection.
1. The land and structures in the Exclusive Agriculture District may be used only
for agricultural purposes as defined in Section 91.01(1), Wisconsin Statutes, and
for those residential and other uses permitted under section 91.75, Wisconsin
Statutes.
2. A conditional use permit may be granted only as permitted by Section 91.75,
Wisconsin Statutes. A permit granted in this district must follow consideration
of the factors set forth in Section 91.79, Wisconsin Statutes.
29

effect on the established character and quality of the area, its physical attractiveness, existing
topography, drainage features, erosion potential, vegetative cover, the prevention and control
of water pollution, the location with respect to floodplains and floodways, the movement of
