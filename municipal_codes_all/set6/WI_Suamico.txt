(6) Access Procedures.
(a) A request to inspect or copy a record
shall be made to the legal custodian. A
request shall be deemed sufficient if it
reasonably describes the requested record or
the information requested. However, a
request for a record without a reasonable
limitation as to subject matter or length of
time represented by the record does not
constitute a sufficient request. A request
may be made orally, but a request must be in
writing before an action to enforce the
request is commenced under Wis. Stats.
§19.37. Except as provided below, no
request may be refused because the person
making the request is unwilling to be
identified or to state the purpose of the
request. No request may be refused because
Village of Suamico
2-General Government Page 11 of 23 Adopted 1-21-08
the request is received by mail, unless
prepayment of a fee is required under
Section 2.08 (5) (f) 5. A requester may be
required to show acceptable identification
whenever the requested record is kept at a
private residence or whenever security
reasons or federal law or regulations so
require.
(b) Each custodian, upon request for any
record, shall, as soon as practicable and
without delay, either fill the request or notify
the requester of the authority's determination
to deny the request in whole or in part and
the reasons therefore. If the legal custodian,
after conferring with the Village Attorney,
determines that a written request is so
general as to be unduly time consuming, the
party making the request may first be
required to itemize his or her request in a
manner which would permit reasonable
compliance.
(c) A request for a record may be denied
as provided in Section 2.08 (7). If a request
is made orally, the request may be denied
orally unless a demand for a written
statement of the reasons denying the request
is made by the requester within five (5)
business days of the oral denial. If a written
request is denied in whole or in part, the
requester shall receive a written statement of
the reasons for denying the request. Every
written denial of a request shall inform the
requester that if the request for the record
was made in writing, then the determination
is subject to review upon petition for a writ
of mandamus under Wis. Stats. §19.37(1), or
upon application to the Attorney General or
a district attorney.
(7) Limitations on Right to Access.
(a) The Village hereby adopts Wis.
Stats. §19.36. The following records are
exempt from inspection under this section:
1. Records specifically exempted from
disclosure by state or federal law or
authorized to be exempted from disclosure
by state law.
2. Any record relating to investigative
information for law enforcement purposes if
federal law or regulations require exemption
from disclosure or if exemption from
disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by
the state.
3. Computer programs, although the
material used as input for a computer
program or the material produced as a
product of the computer program is subject
to inspection.
4. A record or any portion of a record
containing information qualifying as a
common law trade secret.
(b) As provided by Wis. Stats. §43.30,
public library circulation records are exempt
from inspection under this section.
(c) In responding to a request for
inspection or copying of a record which is
not specifically exempt from disclosure, the
legal custodian, after conferring with the
Village Attorney, may deny the request, in
whole or in part, only if he or she determines
that the harm to the public interest resulting
from disclosure would outweigh the public
interest in full access to the requested record.
Examples of matters for which disclosure
may be refused include, but are not limited
to, the following:
1. Records obtained under official
pledges of confidentiality which were
necessary and given in order to obtain the
information contained in them.
2. Records of current deliberations after
a quasi-judicial hearing.

property, investing of Village funds or other
Village business whenever competitive or
bargaining reasons require nondisclosure.

histories or disciplinary data of specific
persons which, if disclosed, would be likely
to have a substantial adverse effect upon the
reputation of any person referred to in such
history or data.
7. Communications between legal
counsel for the Village and any officer, agent
or employee of the Village, when advice is
being rendered concerning strategy with
respect to current litigation in which the
Village or any of its officers, agents or
employees is or is likely to become involved,
or communications which are privileged
under Wis. Stats. §905.03.
(d) If a record contains information that
may be made public and information that
may not be made public, the custodian of the
record shall provide the information that may
be made public and delete the information
that may not be made public from the record
before release. The custodian shall confer
with the Village Attorney prior to releasing
any such record and shall follow guidance of
the Village Attorney when separating out the
exempt material. If, in the judgment of the
custodian and the Village Attorney, there is
no feasible way to separate the exempt
material from the nonexempt material
without unreasonably jeopardizing
nondisclosure of exempt material, the entire
record shall be withheld from disclosure.
(e) Confidentiality of income and
expenses provided to assessor for assessment
purposes.
1. Adoption. This ordinance adopts by
reference Wis. Statutes §70.47 (7)(af).

expense information has contested the
assessment level at either the board of review
or by filing a claim for excessive assessment

are open and public.
3. Severability. The several sections of
this ordinance are declared to be severable.
If any section or portion thereof shall be
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable,
such decision shall apply only to the specific
section or portion thereof directly specified
in the decision, and shall not affect the
validity of any other provisions, sections, or
portions thereof of the ordinance. The
remainder of the ordinance shall remain in
full force and effect. Any other ordinances

2.09 CODE OF ETHICS. The Village
adopts and incorporates Wis. Stats. §19.59.
The Village reserves its right to adopt further
ordinances including the following policies in
accordance with Wis. Stats. §19.59 and,
further, amends the prior Village ethic
ordinance as follows:
(1) Declaration of Policy.
Village of Suamico
2-General Government Page 14 of 23 Adopted 1-21-08
(a) High moral and ethical standards
are essential to the operation of free
government. A code of ethics is established
for all Village officials, whether elected or
appointed, paid or unpaid, all Village
employees and agents of the Village, all
members of Village boards and committees
and persons furnishing contracted services to
the Village and its boards and committees.
This code establishes guidelines for ethical
standards of conduct for all such officials,
employees, agents, committee and board
members and persons furnishing contracted
services. It directs disclosure by officials,
board and committee members, employees,
agents and candidates for Village office of
private financial or other interests in matters
affecting the Village.
(b) This code of ethics does not prohibit
Village officials from having other
employment and financial interests. Village
officials, however, need to distinguish
between inconsequential conflicts which are
unavoidable and those conflicts which are
substantial. The purpose of this code is to
help Village officials in avoiding serious
conflicts of interest and promote confidence
in our local government.
(2) Responsibility of Public Officials
and Standards of Conduct.
(a) Elected and appointed officials,
committee and board members and
employees of the Village should work for the
benefit of the public and are bound to uphold
the Constitution of the United States and the
Constitution of the State of Wisconsin and to
carry out independently and impartially the
laws of the Nation, State and Village;
observe in their official acts the highest

individual, either personally or on behalf of
an organization or governmental body, may,
in writing, request the ethics board, to issue
an advisory opinion regarding the propriety
of any matter to which the person is or may
become a party. It is prima facie evidence of
intent to comply with the Ethics Code when
a person requests an advisory opinion abides
by the advisory opinion, if the material facts
are as stated in the opinion request. The
Ethics Board may authorize the Village
Attorney to act in its stead in instances
where delay is of substantial inconvenience
or detriment to the requesting party.
(b) Confidentiality. Except as provided
in par. (c), neither the Village Attorney, a

requesting an advisory opinion or of
individuals or organizations mentioned in the
opinion.
(c) Exception to Confidentiality. The
Ethics Board or Village Attorney replying to
a request for an advisory opinion may make
the opinion public with the consent of the
individual requesting the advisory opinion or
the organization or governmental body on
whose behalf it is requested and may make
public a summary of an advisory opinion
issued under this subsection after making
sufficient alterations in the summary to
prevent disclosing the identities of
individuals involved in the opinion. A person
who makes or purports to make public the
substance of or any portion of an advisory
opinion requested by or on behalf of the
person waives the confidentiality of the
request for an advisory opinion and of any
records obtained or prepared by the Ethics
Board or the Village Attorney for the local
governmental unit in connection with the
request for an advisory opinion.

section, the Treasurer may, upon ten (10)
days notice after giving the taxpayer an

improvements to be made is equally
beneficial to all lots, and that the properties
are reasonably homogeneous with respect to

be levied and charged against a parcel of
land shall be determined by dividing the
sum of the assessable project costs by the
total number of lots. Corner lots shall be
counted as one (1) lot for assessment
purposes, except that when only one (1) of
the two (2) abutting streets is being
resurfaced, the corner lot shall be counted
as, and receive a one-half (½) lot
assessment. If in the judgment of the Board
a parcel of land has the potential to be
subdivided to create additional buildable
lots, the Board may assess that parcel of
land additional per lot charges as
appropriate.
4. Minimum Frontage. The assessable
frontage will be calculated as the actual

established by the Village. All sewer
extensions shall be specially assessed by the
Village under the following policies.
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 6 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
1. When sanitary sewer pipe larger than
twelve inches (12) in diameter is installed,
benefiting parcels shall only be assessed for
twelve inches (12) pipe at a cost
determined by the Engineer. The additional
expense for the larger pipe shall be paid by
the Sewer Utility.
2. Repair or replacement of sanitary
sewer mains shall be paid by the Sewer
Utility.
(b) Basis of Assessments. The main line
sanitary sewer will be assessed on a front
footage basis unless a per lot assessment
policy is adopted for a project.
(c) Deferrals.
1. The assessment for sanitary sewer
will be deferred for all properties outside the
approved Village Sewer Service Area
(SSA).
2. The deferral will terminate and the
assessment will become due and payable as
soon as the property is added to the Village
SSA.
3. Properties that can demonstrate the
installation of onsite systems within the five
(5) years previous to the project being
assessed may be eligible for a credit based
on a five (5) year depreciation schedule.
Proof of installation shall be a receipt for the
work performed or an affidavit of
construction from the builder.
4. The Sewer Utility will pay the cost of
all deferrals until the assessment becomes
due and payable.
(d) Service Laterals. The cost of
laterals for sanitary sewer service shall not
be added to the assessable front footage
project costs. The total cost of all laterals
installed shall be divided by the total
number of laterals to produce an average
cost for each type of lateral. Separate costs
shall be established for each size of sanitary
sewer lateral if more than one (1) size is to
be installed within the assessment district.
The resultant lateral cost(s) shall be charged
directly to each parcel within the assessment
district for each type and size of lateral
installed to that parcel.
(10) Water Main Projects. The
Village will use the following criteria for
calculating special assessments levied for
water main projects.
(a) General Application. All water
main extensions shall be constructed by the
Village in accordance with the most current
version of construction specifications
established by the Village. All water
extensions shall be specially assessed by the
Village under the following policies:
1. When water mains larger than eight
inches (8) in diameter are installed,
benefiting parcels shall only be assessed for
an eight inch (8) main at a cost determined
by the Engineer. The additional expense for
the larger main shall be paid by the Water
Utility.
2. Repair or replacement of water main
shall be paid by the Water Utility.
(b) Basis of Assessments. The main
water line will be assessed on a front footage
basis unless a per lot assessment policy is
adopted for a project.
(c) Deferrals.
1. The Water Utility will pay the cost of
all deferrals until the assessment becomes
due and payable.
2. In the event that a previously exempt
property becomes developable, all costs
associated with the exemption, including
interest, shall become due and payable in
accordance with Section 8 of this policy.
(d) Service Laterals. The cost of
laterals for water service shall not be added
to the assessable front footage project costs.
The total cost of all laterals installed shall be
divided by the total number of laterals to
produce an average cost for each type of
lateral. Separate costs shall be established
for each size of water service lateral if more
than one (1) size is to be installed within the
assessment district. The resultant lateral
cost(s) shall be charged directly to each
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 7 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
parcel within the assessment district for each
type and size of lateral installed to that
parcel.
(11) Storm Sewer Improvements.
The Village will use the following criteria
for calculating special assessments levied
for storm sewer projects.
(a) General Application. All storm
sewer facilities shall be constructed by the
Village in accordance with the most current
version of construction specifications
established by the Village. All storm sewer
improvements shall be specially assessed by
the Village under the following policies:
1. When storm sewer pipe larger than
eighteen inches (18) in diameter is installed
within a residential area, all benefiting
parcels shall be assessed for the actual pipe
size installed, or eighteen inch (18) pipe,
whichever is smaller at a cost determined by
the Engineer. A property assessed need not
have pipe installed directly in front of their
properties to be eligible for an assessment
based on benefit.
2. The additional expense for the larger
pipe shall be paid by the Village or by an
area wide assessment to future benefiting
properties.
3. Properties within business, industrial,
and institutional districts will be assessed for
the full diameter of any installed storm
sewer pipes less any incremental size of pipe
which is needed to accommodate drainage
from properties located outside the
assessment district as determined by the
Engineer.
4. Stormwater improvements benefiting
the entire development or a drainage basin
shall be assessed on an area-wide basis.
5. Replacement or repair of storm
sewers shall be paid by the Village.
6. The Village shall own and maintain
all stormwater improvements constructed for
the public benefit unless other agreements
prevail.
(b) Basis of Assessments. The storm

footage basis unless a per lot assessment
policy is adopted for a project.
(c) Service Laterals. The cost of
laterals for storm sewer (should it apply)
shall not be added to the assessable front
footage project costs. The total cost of all
laterals installed shall be divided by the total
number of laterals to produce an average
cost for each type of lateral. Separate costs
shall be established for each size of lateral if
more than one (1) size is to be installed
within the assessment district. The resultant
lateral cost(s) shall be charged directly to
each parcel within the assessment district for

charged to the properties benefited at one
hundred percent (100%) of the cost incurred.
(c) Requirements as detailed under Wis.
Stats. §66.0907 for sidewalks are adopted
and will be utilized by the Village.

Planning Commission feels that the
installation of sidewalks is appropriate or in
the publics best interest.
(e) The Village shall require
replacement of cracked or damaged
sidewalks. Where sidewalks or portions
thereof are in such state of disrepair as to
make it unsafe or impracticable in the
judgment of the Village to repair the same,
the Village may order such sidewalk or
portion thereof replaced with a new
sidewalk of the same or different width.
The following policies apply.
(f) Basis of Assessments. Sidewalk
construction or improvements will be
assessed on a front footage basis unless a per
lot assessment policy is adopted for a
project.
(13) Streets Improvements and
Reconstruction. The Village will use the
following criteria for calculating special
assessments levied for street projects.
(a) General Application. All street

maintenance of existing streets shall be paid
for by the Village.
2. When any street is upgraded from its
current design that portion of improvement
above and beyond the original cross section,
such as widening or addition of curb and
gutter shall be assessed to the benefiting
parcels.
3. When any street within a residential
area is constructed or reconstructed to reflect
an urban cross section, or to be wider than
twenty-eight feet (28) as measured from the
back of curb to back of curb, benefiting
parcels shall only be assessed for a twentyeight
foot (28) street at a cost determined
by the Engineer. The additional expense for
the wider street shall be paid by the Village.
4. When any street within a business,
industrial or institutional district is
constructed or reconstructed to be wider
than forty-four feet (44) as measured from
the back of curb to back of curb, benefiting
parcels shall only be assessed for a fortyfour
foot (44) street at a cost determined by
the Engineer. The additional expense for the
wider street shall be paid by the Village.
(b) Basis of Assessments.
Improvements will be assessed on a front
footage basis unless a per lot assessment
policy is adopted for a project.
(14) Curb and Gutter. At this time the
Village chooses not to require that curb and
gutter sidewalks be installed in retrofitting
existing neighborhoods.
(15) Special Assessment Payments.
(a) Annual Installments. Whenever any
special assessments shall be levied to defray
the cost of any public improvement such
special assessments may be paid in annual
installments of not more than ten (10) in
number as determined by the Board.
1. If an assessment for a particular
property exceeds seven hundred fifty dollars
($750), the owner may elect to pay the
assessment in installments.
2. Interest shall be charged at the rate
the Village is charged plus two and a half
percent (2.5%) if funds are borrowed for the
work involved. If no funds are borrowed,
interest shall be charged at the rate that
would have been charged if funds had been
borrowed as determined by the ten (10) year
treasury note effective on the date of the
final resolution to assess.
3. The use of a tiered plan may be used
by the Village. For example, assessments
from zero dollars ($0) to seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750) are due up front, assessments
from seven hundred fifty-one dollars ($751)
to two thousand five hundred dollars
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 9 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
($2,500) may be paid with up to three (3)
installments in two (2) years, assessments
from two thousand five hundred one dollars
($2,501) to ten thousand dollars ($10,000)
may be paid with up to five (5) installments;
assessments exceeding ten thousand dollars
($10,000) may be made over ten (10) years.
(b) Delinquent Installment. If any
installment was not paid to the Treasurer
with the other taxes, it shall be returned to
the County as delinquent and accepted and
collected by the County in the same manner
as delinquent general taxes on real estate.
(c) Payment Procedures. All publicly
owned and tax exempt properties, including
lands owned or controlled by the Village,
County, State, and School District, will be
assessed at one hundred percent (100%) of
the assessment rate.
(d) When county, state, or federal aids
are available for a specific project, they will
be applied first to reduce the Villages share
of the cost of the project (if any). Any
remaining funds will be applied to reduce
assessments.
(e) Method of payment. Interest rates
shall be compounded annually. Interest
rates and installment payments shall be
determined by the final assessment
resolution of the Board.
(f) Separate current year special
assessment bills on an individual property
may be combined to establish eligibility for
the installment payment options. To avoid
having the entire amount placed on the tax
roll, the Treasurer must be notified in
writing prior to November 1 if an owner is
going to elect an installment option. The
total amount of all outstanding special
assessments will become due and payable
upon sale or transfer of the property.
(16) Calculating Assessable Footage.
Assessable footage is equal to the total
number of developable feet that a parcel of
land fronts upon the right-of-way or
easement in which the public work or
improvement is to be installed and property
benefited or minimum frontage, whichever
is greater. For assessment purposes,
assessable footage shall be determined as
follows:
1. Platted lands. If the parcel of land to
be assessed has been platted under Wis.
Stats. Ch. 236, the lot line dimensions
shown on the certified survey map or
subdivision plat shall be used to determine
assessable footage.
2. Unplatted lands. If the parcel of land
to be assessed is not platted, and if no
accurate plat of survey or other record is
available which indicates the dimensions of
the parcel, assessable footage shall be
determined by scaling or field measurement
or best available information.
3. Corner lots. Corner lots when both
sides are to be improved. The assessable
footage of a corner lot is equal to the sum of
the dimensions of the two (2) lot lines
fronting on the right(s)-of-way or
easement(s) in which the public work or
improvement is to be installed plus the arc
of the intersection of the same two (2) lot
lines and subtracting the minimum lot width
required by zoning from the length of the
longest side being assessed.
4. Corner lots when only one (1) side is
to be improved. The assessable footage
shall be calculated in the manner described
above except that only the dimension of the
lot line which fronts on the right-of-way or
easement in which the public work or
improvement is to be installed shall be used
plus one-half (½) of the arc of the
intersection of said lot line with the lot line
fronting on the second (2nd) right-of-way.
5. Where the dimension of the arc on a
corner lot is not available or cannot be
determined, the tangent, radius, or a field
measurement may be substituted.
6. Double-sided lots. The assessable
frontage for double-sided lots shall be
calculated the same as platted lands but will
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 10 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
only be assessed for the frontage on the side
which utilities are first installed to service
said lot.
7. Triple-sided lots. The assessable
frontage for triple-sided lots will be
calculated by subtracting the minimum lot
width required by zoning from the length of
the two (2) longest sides being assessed.
8. Odd-shaped or irregular lots. The
assessable frontage will be calculated as the
actual frontage of the property at the rightof-
way or the minimum lot width required
by zoning, whichever is greater.
9. Minimum frontage. The assessable
frontage will be calculated as the actual
frontage of the property at the right-of-way
or the minimum lot width required by
zoning, whichever is greater.
10. Full assessment. Anytime storm
sewer, sanitary sewer, or water services are
extended in such a manner so as to allow a
parcel of land to connect to or benefit from
such services, that parcels assessable
footage shall be calculated in the manner
specified in this policy regardless of whether
the storm sewer, sanitary sewer, or water
service mains are physically installed along
the entire length of that parcel of land. Any
parcel of land so assessed shall be deemed
fully served and shall not be subject to any
further assessment for storm sewer, sanitary
sewer or water service mains.
11. Partial assessment. An assessment
shall be considered partial when any public
work or improvement is installed which is
intended to serve only a portion of a parcel
of land, given that such parcel may be
further subdivided, and such subdivision
would then require further extension of
services at that time in order to serve said
parcel.
12. A partial assessment shall be
calculated by subtracting one (1) from the
potential number of lots that could be
created for the property and multiplying that
number by the minimum lot width will
calculate the length of the deferred frontage.
If two (2) or more services are to be
provided, the number of services to be
provided will be subtracted from the
potential number of lots that could be
created for the property. Dividing the total
length of assessable frontage by the
minimum lot width for the property and
rounding the number down to the next
whole number will calculate the potential
number of lots that could be created for the
property. Any parcel of land assessed in
accordance with this policy shall be
considered partially served and shall be fully
subject to future assessments for additional
extensions of public works or
improvements.
13. Adjacent municipalities. Property in
an adjacent municipality which abuts and
benefits from an improvement may be
specially assessed if the adjacent
municipality adopts a resolution approving
the levy. If adopted, the Treasurer of the
adjacent municipality must collect the
assessment as a tax and pay it over to the
Treasurer of the Village.
14. Improvements which are not
directly assessable to abutting property
owners or elsewhere covered in this policy
will be averaged into the unit costs over the
project limits and apportioned to all affected
properties in accordance with the applicable
assessment formula.
15. Utility infrastructure oversize policy
for special assessment districts. To promote
efficient design, to provide needed capacity
for system expansion, and protect the longterm
interest of the community, the Village
may require that water or sewer mains be
larger than necessary within a particular
neighborhood when constructed. The
Village recognizes the burden that these
requirements may place on a landowner, and
the following policy shall apply to those
conditions where the Village will pay for
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 11 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
costs required to invest in additional
capacity.
16. Should a landowner connect into a
water or sewer main that was built oversized
by a developer for a project not within the
assessment district, the Village may require
a partial refund to the developer upon use by
the benefited property. Regulations shall be
followed as indicated in the Wis. Adm.
Code PSC 187.
17. Administrative costs.
Administrative costs are defined as a
reasonable charge for services of the
administrative, engineering, and legal staffs
of the Village. To cover administrativerelated
costs for a project, the Village will
add ten percent (10%) to total project costs.
(17) Exemptions. The Board may grant
an exemption from the requirements of this
policy in any specific case where the Board
considers that there is an emergency,
hardship, or urgent need for granting such
exemption. The Village and/or the
appropriate utility will carry the cost of
exempting the assessment until the
assessment becomes due and payable. Other
exemptions are as follows:
(a) Farmland. Eligible farmland is
exempt from special assessments as
described in Wis. Stat. §91.15. Land zoned
exclusive agriculture or for which a
farmland preservation agreement under Wis.
Stat. Ch. 91 is in existence, is exempt from
special assessments, unless according to
Wis. Stat. §91.15 the assessments were
imposed prior to filing for Exclusive
Agriculture (EA) status or the owner of the
land chooses to use the improvements
created by the assessment. At such time, the
assessments, together with all interest
accrued, shall be charged to the owner for
use of the improvements.
(b) Wetlands. All wetland areas shall be
deferred. Brown County published wetland
mapping shall be utilized to determine
wetland areas. Any property owner
contesting this determination may complete
or present an official wetland delineation by
a qualified expert (as determined by the
Board) subsequent to the preliminary
resolution to assess but prior to passage of
the final assessment resolution. Assessable
footage for this parcel shall be adjusted
according to this determination, but
consistent with other sections of this
ordinance.
(c) Non-Benefited Properties. Those
properties, which are undevelopable as
determined by the Board and thus nonbenefited
due to building setback restriction,
easements, or other zoning restrictions, shall
be deferred.
(18) TID #1 Assessment Policy.
Special assessments shall be levied upon
property within the original boundaries of
TID #1 as it was created for January 1,
2004, based on the policies outlined in
Section 3.02 (1-4 and 8-12) of this policy.
In addition, the following policies are
hereby adopted whenever streets are
required to be constructed in TID #1.
(a ) Definitions.
1. TID means Tax Increment District
created under Wis. Stats. §66.1105 and
defined under Wis. Stats. §66.1105(2)(k).
2. TIF means Tax Incremental
Financing, a method of financing
improvements in the TID.
3. Base TID #1 means the parcels of
land included in the Village TID #1 on
January 1, 2004.
(b) Street, Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter
Construction.
1. Sidewalks - General Application.
The Board shall prescribe the location and
width of new sidewalks. The following
policies apply. The Board may order
sidewalks to be constructed where none
previously existed along any street,
irrespective of whether the abutting lands
have been improved, whenever in the
judgment of the Board the safety and
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 12 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
welfare of the public requires it. Sidewalks
as ordered by the Board are deemed to be a
public improvement and the cost of
installation, construction, maintaining,
reconstructing, removing, replacement, and
repairing the same shall be charged to the
properties benefited at one hundred percent
(100%) of the cost incurred. Requirements
as detailed under Wis. Stats. §66.0907 for
sidewalks are adopted and will be utilized
by the Village.
2. Streets  General Application. All
street improvements and reconstruction
projects undertaken by the Village shall be
constructed by the Village in accordance
with specifications established by the
current edition of the State of Wisconsin
Standard Specifications for highway and
structure construction. All projects shall be
specially assessed by the Village to the
benefiting property. When any street within
a business, industrial or institutional district
is constructed or improved to be wider than
forty-four feet (44) as measured from the
back of curb to back of curb, benefiting
parcels shall only be assessed for a fortyfour
foot (44) street at a cost determined by
the Engineer. The additional expense for the
wider street shall be paid by the Village.
3. Curb & Gutter  General Application.
No street in the Village shall be considered
permanently improved unless curb and
gutter is installed on each side in accordance
with plans and specifications approved by
the Board and the Engineer. Basis of
assessments for street, sidewalk, curb, and
gutter construction  Improvements will be
assessed on a front footage basis unless a per
lot assessment policy is adopted for a
project.
(c) TID Increment Credits. The value
of TIF lies in its ability to finance
infrastructure improvements within its
boundaries to stimulate economic
development, bringing tax base into the
community. Because TID revenue is based
on the increment value between the base
valuation and new construction within the
district from the date of the creation of the
district, a credit will be granted to land
owners located within the Base TID based
on the value of construction occurring after
the creation date of TID #1, January 1, 2004
through the close of the TID.
1. The amount of the special
assessments to be levied on each parcel
included in the Base TID #1 (hereinafter
defined as the net cost of the public
improvements) shall be determined by the
following formula:
A = P - (I -Ø), where
A is the amount of the special
assessment and is also the net cost of the
public improvements;
P is the total cost of the public
improvements including a reasonable charge
for the services of the administrative staff of
the Village and the cost of engineering,
planning, and legal services, and any other
item of direct or indirect cost, including
accrued interest attributable to the public
improvements, but excluding interest on
borrowed funds accruing after the time of
the special assessment levy;
Ø is other project costs (not included
in P above) incurred by the Village in
connection with the Base TID whether or
not funds were borrowed therefore (for
example, consultant and professional fees
and staff costs, including interest on
borrowed funds accruing until, but not after,
the time of the special assessment levy); and
I is the tax increment revenues
collected to date of calculation plus the
present value of the projected tax increment
revenues to be derived from the individual
parcels and collected after the calculation
through TID #1 closeout. The present value
shall be calculated using the interest rate or
rates on amounts borrowed by the Village
for the public improvement project costs. In
calculating the present value of the projected
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 13 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
local tax increments, the Village shall apply
the gross equalized mill rate then in effect
times the then current equalized valuation of
the individual parcels.
(d) The Village shall levy special
assessments as soon as practical upon
completion of the project. The Village shall
defer the collection of the special
assessments for a period of five (5) years
after the passage of the final resolution to
assess. At such time the Village shall
determine if there will be a positive net cost
of the public improvements (A>Ø) as
determined by the formula set forth above.
(e) Regardless of when they are levied,
the special assessments shall be payable in
ten (10) equal annual principal installments,
the last of which shall be due in 2024,
extended from 2023, allowing for the 2013
tax roll installments payable in 2014 be
delayed to the 2014 tax roll payable in 2015,
plus interest as provided in Section 3.02(15)
of the Village Code.
(f) The special assessments shall accrue
interest according to Section 3.02(15) of the
Village Code. If any special assessment
installment is placed on the tax rolls, it shall
from that point forward accrue interest in the
manner and at the rate of other real property
taxes. A developers agreement may be
reached with current or future property
owners in TID #1 - Base Area, under which
the assessments on the property or properties
affected may be reduced or satisfied by
increment generated on the parcels covered
by the agreement.
(g) Assessments shall be levied on all
properties benefited by the installation of
infrastructure. In cases where a property
owner receives only water services, the
assessments will be deferred until sewer is
installed or 2017, ten (10) years prior to the
mandatory close of the TID.
(h) Property owners within the TID
District who do not have sewer available but
who have water available to their properties
may hook-up to water at any time by
requesting service of the water utility. At
such time that hook-up is complete, the five
(5) year deferred assessment billing begins.
Property owners who are not hooked up to
water service are subject to all rules and
regulations of the PSC for non-connected
customers.
3.03 IMPACT FEES.
(1) Introduction and Purpose.
Pursuant to the authority of Wis. Stats.
§66.0617, the local impact fees enabling
legislation, the purpose of this ordinance is
to establish the mechanism for the
imposition of impact fees upon development
including, but not limited to, new users
connecting to water treatment and waste
water treatment facilities and systems for
which excess capacity has been built into
said systems, to finance the capital costs
necessary to accommodate said land
development. This chapter is intended to
assure that land development (as defined
herein) and new development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of capital
expenditures necessary to provide public
facilities within the Village and its service
areas as they are required to serve the needs
arising out of land development.
(2) Definitions.
(a) Capital Costs. As defined in Wis.
Stats. §66.0617(1)(a).
(b) Developer. As defined in Wis.
Stats. §66.0617(1)(b) which shall include,
but not be limited to, new users to water
treatment systems and waste water treatment
systems for which excess capacity has been
built into said systems.
(c) Impact Fees. As defined in Wis.
Stats. §66.0617(1)(c).
(d) Land Development. As defined in
Wis. Stats. §66.0617(1)(d) including, but not
limited to, existing residential equivalent
units added to water treatment systems and
waste water treatment systems for which
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 14 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
excess capacity has been built into the
system and/or additional capital
infrastructure acquired from the former
Town of Suamico Sanitary District.
(e) Public Facilities. As defined in Wis.
Stats. §66.0617(1)(f).
(f) Residential Equivalent Unit
(hereinafter referred to as REU). Means a
residential living space required to house
one (1) family regardless of family size. For
example, a duplex would consist of two (2)
residential equivalent units.
(g) Service Area. Means a geographic
area delineated by the Village within which
the Village provides public facilities.
(h) Service Standard. Means a certain
quantity or quality of public facilities
relative to a certain number of persons,
parcels of land or other appropriate measure
as specified by the Village of Suamico
Village Board.
(3) Public Facilities Needs
Assessment. New public facilities or
improvements for which impact fees will be
imposed are those which are identified in the
Public Facilities Needs Assessment for
water and wastewater impact fees reports
prepared prior to the adoption of this chapter
and any amendments hereto or additional
reports that may be amended or adopted in
the future. All public facilities needs
assessment reports that form the basis of any
impact fee imposed by the Village shall be
kept on file in the office of the Clerk at least
twenty (20) days prior to any public hearing
to be held on the creation of this chapter and
any amendments. A Class 1 notice under
Wis. Stats. Ch. 985 is required prior to any
required hearing. All public facilities needs
assessment reports shall remain on file in the
office of the Clerk for the entire period
during which impact fees arising out of a
specific report and this chapter are collected
prior to expenditure, and such report shall,
after expenditure of all impact fees, be
maintained as a public record for such time
period as required by law.
(4) Impact Fee Revenue
Administration.
(a) Revenues from impact fees shall be
placed in one (1) or more segregated,
interest-bearing accounts and shall be
accounted for separately from other Village
general and utility funds. Impact fee
revenues and interest earned thereon may be
expended only for capital costs for which
the impact fees were imposed.
(b) Impact fee revenues imposed and
collected but not used within seven (7) years
after collection to pay the capital costs for
which they were imposed shall be refunded
along with interest collected on a prorated
proportional basis, as determined by the
Board, to the current record owner or
owners of the property with respect to which
the impact fees were imposed. The Village
reserves the right to extend the time limit up
to three (3) years allowed for extenuating
circumstances by Wis. Stats. §66.0617(9)(b)
on a needs basis.
(5) Use of Impact Fees. Funds
collected from impact fees shall be used
solely for the purpose of paying the
proportionate costs of providing public
facilities that become necessary due to land
development. These costs may include the
costs of debt service on bonds or similar
debt instruments when the debt has been
incurred for the purpose of proceeding with
designated public facilities projects prior to
the collection of all anticipated impact fees
for that project.
(6) Payment of Impact Fee.
(a) New Construction.
1. All required impact fees shall be paid
one hundred percent (100%) by the
developer or property owner fourteen (14)
days prior to the issuance of the building
permit.
2. All required impact fees for lots or
development that does not occur within a
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 15 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
plat or a CSM shall be paid one hundred
percent (100%) prior to the issuance of a
building permit.
(b) Existing Structures.
1. Onsite Water Systems. Due to excess
capacity built into the water system in order
to allow for growth of said water system,
including acquisition cost of capital
infrastructure from the former Town of
Suamico Sanitary District, for current onsite
systems (outside of Harbor Lights Lake
Subdivision Phases I-VII), at the time that a
water extension is awarded to connect
property to the Village water system, an
impact fee per REU shall be paid in
accordance with Section 3.03 (9). For lots
or development within the Village that are
being constructed using onsite water
treatment systems because there is no access
to water services, no water impact fee will
be imposed until such time as the REU is
connected to the water system. At that time,
an impact fee will be charged in accordance
with Section 3.03 (9).
Notwithstanding the foregoing for onsite
systems within Harbor Lights Lake
Subdivision Phases I-VII, at the time that a
water extension is awarded to connect
property to the Village water system, an
impact fee equal to twenty-six and seven
hundred twelve thousandths percent
(26.712%) of the impact fee set forth at
Exhibit A shall be paid. For example, if the
existing water impact fee at Exhibit A is two
thousand dollars ($2,000) per REU for
onsite systems within Harbor Lights Lakes
Subdivision, the impact fee would be five
hundred thirty-four dollars and twenty-four
cents ($534.24) ($2,000 x 26.712%). This
fee may be reviewed and adjusted with
respect to Harbor Lights Lake Subdivision
Phases I-VII in accordance with the
recommendation of Village Engineers and
Foth & Van Dyke Engineers dated
February 3, 2006, the terms of which are
incorporated herein.
2. Onsite Wastewater Systems.
Notwithstanding any other article herein to
the contrary for lots or development within
the Village that are being constructed using
onsite wastewater treatment systems because
there is no access to wastewater services, no
wastewater impact fee will be imposed until
such time as the REU is connected to the
wastewater system. At that time an impact
fee will be charged in accordance with
Section 3.03 (8).
(7) Appeals.
(a) The developer or property owner
upon whom an impact fee is imposed may
contest the amount, collection, or use of an
impact fee as specified herein. An appeal to
contest either the amount or collection of an
impact fee imposed on a developer shall be
commenced at any time prior to
endorsement of the approval certificate on
any subdivision plat or certified survey map
by the Clerk, but no later than thirty (30)
days from the date of notification of final
action approving such plat or survey. An
appeal to contest the amount, collection or
use of an impact fee may be commenced
within thirty (30) days of application for a
building permit, if applicable to the
particular impact fee. An appeal to contest
the use of an impact fee shall be commenced
not later than thirty (30) days prior to the
award of any public contract for expenditure
of the collected fee revenues.
(b) An appeal is commenced by filing a
complaint with the Clerk, which complaint
shall specify the impact fee amount or
collection objected to and the basis for the
objection. The appeal shall be scheduled for
a public hearing before the Village Utility
Commission at it next regular meeting. The
Commission shall take additional evidence
and testimony on the matter, including
reports from Village staff and shall make its
recommendation to the Board based upon
the standards set forth in Wis. Stats.
§66.0617(6). The Board shall consider the
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 16 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
appeal, review the record made before the
Village Utility Commission and the
recommendation of the Commission, and
decide the appeal based upon the standards
for impact fees in Wis. Stats. §66.0617. The
decision of the Village Board is final.
(8) Wastewater Impact Fees.
(a) The wastewater impact fees to be
paid are set forth on the attached Exhibit A
which is fully incorporated herein and which
has been calculated and updated pursuant to
the public facilities needs assessment dated
August 30, 2004 previously set forth and
referenced.
(b) These fees shall be increased on
April 1 of each year by the percentage
increase in the Engineering News Record
Construction Cost Index (ENR) from the
previous calendar year to the current
calendar year. In the event there is a
decrease in the ENR Construction Cost
Index, the previous years impact fee shall
remain unchanged.
(c) These impact fees shall be collected
until all capital costs associated with
specified projects in the Public Facilities
Needs Assessment for Water and
Wastewater Impact Fees report have been
addressed consistent with the requirements
of Section 3.03 (4) (b).
(9) Water Impact Fees.
(a) The water impact fees to be paid are
set forth on the attached Exhibit A which is
fully incorporated herein and which has
been calculated and updated pursuant to the
public facilities needs assessment dated
August 30, 2004 previously set forth and
referenced.
(b) These fees shall be increased on
April 1 of each year by the percentage
increase in the Engineering News Record
Construction Cost Index (ENR) from the
previous calendar year to the current
calendar year. In the event there is a
decrease in the ENR Construction Cost
Index, the previous years impact fee shall
remain unchanged.
(c) These impact fees shall be collected
until all capital costs associated with
specified projects in the Public Facilities
Needs Assessment for Water and
Wastewater Impact Fees report have been
addressed consistent with the requirements
of Section 3.03 (4) (b).
(10) Penalties.
(a) All impact fees must be paid in a
timely manner in accordance with this
ordinance. If fees remain unpaid beyond the
time requirements as set forth herein, any
unpaid fees shall become a lien upon the real
estate parcel upon which the fee is imposed.
Unpaid fees shall accrue interest at the rate
of eighteen percent (18%) per annum as of
the fee due date. If for any reason a building
permit is issued to a subject parcel without
the payment of an impact fee as required
within this ordinance, the Village reserves
the right to withhold any additional permits
for the subject parcel including occupancy
permits or plumbing permits until such time
as the impact fees and accrued interest are
paid in full. This penalty provision may be
enforced through the Village Municipal
Court pursuant to Chapter 25 of the Village
Municipal Code. Enforcement penalties
through municipal or circuit court shall
include the costs of collection and/or
prosecution costs incurred by the Village.

3.09 DEBT MANAGEMENT.
(1) Introduction and Purpose. The
capital financing and debt policy provides
comprehensive guidance for future decisions
regarding financing of capital projects
including the appropriate use of debt. The
Villages legacy of financial stability is built
upon a conservative approach to spending as
well as a long-term commitment to full and
timely repayment of debt. For a debt
management policy to be an effective tool,
the provisions of the policy must be
compatible with the Villages goals
pertaining to the capital improvement
program, the 5-year budget plan, and the
operating needs of the Village. Multi-year
forecasts of debt service are to be included
in all budget plans.
(2) Guiding Principles. The following
policies and principles are intended to
govern the issuance of all Village debt.
(a) Debt financing should be considered
for capital improvement programs as
approved in the 5-year capital improvement
program budget, after all nondebt sources of
funds (e.g. cash, grants, loans, etc.) have
been considered.
(b) The Village has historically paid for
a large portion of its capital budget on a cash
basis through the use of various sinking
funds. It expects to continue this practice
and use cash to pay for capital expenditures
that it expects to recur on an annual basis
(such as Road Reconstruction and
Equipment Replacement) or when reserves
are available that are not expected to be
needed for other purposes in the foreseeable
future.
(c) The Village should consult the
Municipal Financial Advisor, if applicable,
to determine the most appropriate source of
financing (grants, low-interest statesponsored
loans, private market loans,
capital markets, etc.).
(d) Debt financing should not be used
for proprietary fund activities without a
designated revenue source for retiring
principal and interest. The Village should
identify a specific source of revenue for the
repayment of each debt issuance and
calculate the expected impact on rates and
user fees prior to the issuance of the debt.
(e) Generally, revenue debt should be
utilized to finance utility related projects to
minimize impact on statutory debt limits,
except in cases where it is determined that
utilizing less expensive General Obligation
debt will not have a materially adverse
impact on overall debt limits.
(f) Prior to debt issuance considerations,
pay-as-you-go financing should be
considered for all major projects, including
capital improvements projects, to keep debt
at a manageable level.
(g) Debt should be structured so that the
principal will be retired over the useful life
of the project financed. The Village shall not
Village of Suamico
3-Finance & Taxation Page 20 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
issue debt for a period longer than the period
during which it intends to use the capital
improvement being financed.
(h) Village management shall
periodically work with the Municipal
Financial Advisor to determine whether an
economical advantage exists for refinancing
the outstanding debt given changes in the
interest rate and bond market and to review
its overall debt profile to monitor debt levels
relative to statutory and policy limits.
(i) The Village will maintain good
communications with bond rating agencies
about its financial condition with an intent to
retain a favorable bond rating.
(j) The Village should continue to avoid
assuming development risk and
implement specific guarantees from
developers (letters of credit, personal
guarantees, right to assess, etc.).
(k) The Village will work with the
Municipal Financial Advisor to diligently
monitor its compliance with bond covenants,
ensure its adherence to federal arbitrage
regulations, and file annual continuing
disclosure reports as required by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
3.99 PENALTY, SEVERABILITY, AND
ENFORCEMENT.
(1) Penalty. Any person who violates,
or knowingly allows or permits any
violation of, any provision of this ordinance,
shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less
than twenty-five dollars ($25) and not more
than two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500) per violation. Failure or refusal to
pay forfeiture may result in imprisonment
for a period of not more than ninety (90)
days for each offense. A separate offense
and violation shall be deemed committed on
each day on which a violation occurs or
continues.
(2) Severability. If a court of
competent jurisdiction deems any provision
of this ordinance invalid or unconstitutional,
such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall
not affect the other provisions of the same.
The several sections of this ordinance are
declared to be severable. If any section or
portion thereof shall be declared by a
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable,
such decision shall apply only to the specific
section or portion thereof directly specified
in the court's decision, portions remaining in
the ordinance shall retain the full force and
effect thereof.
(3) Enforcement. Enforcement of this
chapter shall be the responsibility of the
Board or its designee, and/or Police
Department.

and may issue subpoenas. So far as
practicable, the rules of evidence provided
in Wis. Stats. §227.08 shall be followed.
The complainant shall have the burden of
proving the charges to a preponderance of
the evidence. The permittee and the
complainant may be represented by counsel,
may call and examine witnesses and crossexamine
witnesses of the other party. All
proceedings and testimony shall be recorded
on tape. If either party requests a
stenographic recording and transcription, the
Village shall make the necessary
arrangements, but the expenses shall be
borne by the requesting party. The Clerk
shall serve as secretary to the Board and
shall make and receive all exhibits admitted
into the record. The Board, upon the
testimony and evidence presented at the
hearing, shall determine by simple majority
vote of those present whether the charges
are true or not.
If the vote is to suspend the sellers
permit, it shall be for a period of not less
than ten (10) days or more than ninety (90)
days. Following the procedure above, the
recommendation may be to revoke the
sellers permit.

dismissed without cost to either party. The
Boards action shall be recorded by the
Clerk.
b. If the complaint is found to be true,
the permittee shall pay the Village the actual
cost of the proceedings. If the complaint is
found by the Board to be malicious and
without probably cause, the complainant
shall pay the costs of the proceedings in the
same amount.
c. When a permit is revoked, it shall be
so entered of record by the Clerk and no
other sellers permit shall be granted to such
permittee for such premises for a period of
twelve (12) months from the date of the
revocation, nor shall any part of the money
paid as application fee for any permit so
revoked be refunded.
(c) Demerit Point System/Revocation
and Suspension of Sellers Permit. In
addition to the procedures set forth at
Section 4.18 (6) (b) above, the Village may
suspend or revoke a sellers permit without a
hearing upon the following demerit system:
1. Point Schedule. Upon conviction by
any Municipal Court, or other court of
competent jurisdiction, a sellers permit
shall be awarded demerit points as follows:
TYPE OF VIOLATION DEMERIT
POINTS
____________________________________
Failure to be permitted: 100
____________________________________
False statement on application: 100
____________________________________
Zoning Code violations: 50
____________________________________
All other violations: 50
____________________________________
2. Concurrent Violations. If two (2) or
more violations are committed concurrently,
the highest point violation shall be assessed.
3. Upon conviction, demerit points shall
be awarded retroactive to the date of the
violation. If one hundred fifty (150) demerit
points are accumulated in a twelve (12)
month period, the Board shall suspend the
permit for a period of ten (10) days.
4. Upon conviction, demerit points shall
be awarded retroactive to the date of
violation. If two hundred (200) demerit
points are accumulated in a twenty-four (24)
month period, the Board shall suspend the
permit for a period of thirty (30) days.
5. Upon conviction, demerit points shall
be awarded retroactive to the date of
violation. If two hundred fifty (250) demerit
points are accumulated in a thirty-six (36)
Village of Suamico
4-Public Safety Page 13 of 23 Adopted 1-21-08
month period, the Board shall suspend the
permit for a period of ninety (90) days.
6. Demerit points are accumulated for
each permit which results from conviction
for a municipal code violation or a state law
violation under the terms and conditions of
this chapter. The actual demerit points are
assessed upon entry of judgment and either
expiration of the appeal period thereafter or
the expiration of any appeal, and where the
results of the appeal sustain the Villages
conviction of the holder of the permit.
7. Each sellers permit shall stand
revoked without further proceedings upon
any conviction in Municipal Court or any
other court of competent jurisdiction (and no
reversal thereof upon appeal) of either the
permitted holder or any employee, or agent
or representative thereof, resulting in an
accumulation of three hundred (300) demerit
points within a forty-eight (48) month
period. Any violation and subsequent
conviction by the holder of the permit for
violations of the Brown County Code of

(2) Definitions: The following
definitions shall apply to this section:
Village of Suamico
4-Public Safety Page 14 of 23 Adopted 1-21-08
(a) Open fire. The burning of materials
wherein products of combustion are emitted
directly into the ambient air without passing
through a stack or chimney from an
enclosed chamber. Open burning does not
include road flares, smudge pots and similar
devices associated with safety or
occupational uses typically considered open
flames or recreational fires.
(b) Accelerant. A flammable or
combustible liquid that will increase the rate
of burning of a material. Under no
circumstances may any flammable or
combustible liquid be used to start or
promote an open fire to burn.
(c) Chamber. For the purpose of this
definition, a chamber shall be regarded as
enclosed when, during the time combustion
occurs, only apertures, ducts, stacks, flues or
chimneys necessary to provide combustion
air and permit the escape of exhaust gases
are open.
(d) Fuel. Fuel for any fires identified
under this code section shall only consist of
dry natural wood materials, leaves or
charcoal. Materials for fires shall NOT
include rubbish, garbage, trash, grass, any
material made of or coated with rubber,
plastic, leather, paint or petroleum-based
materials and shall not contain any
flammable or combustible liquids.
(e) Recreational Fire/Fire Pit. A below
ground pit with a minimum depth of ten
inches (10) not to exceed three feet (3) in
diameter. The fire pit shall be surrounded
on the outside, above ground, by a noncombustible

(4) Safety Considerations: The
following shall be adhered to for open
burning:
(a) Atmospheric Conditions. Fires will
be limited to the following atmospheric
conditions: No fire shall be started unless

with regard to wind direction and speed. No
fire shall be started at a time when the wind
speed exceeds eight miles per hour (8 mph)
as measured at the Green Bay NOAA
National Weather Service station or local
circumstances make fires potentially
hazardous. Open burning shall be
prohibited when such atmospheric
conditions exist that would cause the smoke
from open burning to stagnate such as an
inversion or extremely high humidity.
(b) Burning times. Open fires other
than bonfires or recreational fire/barbecue
pits may only be conducted during daylight
hours and must be extinguished at dusk.
(c) Prohibited open burning. Open
burning that will be offensive or
objectionable to occupants of the
surrounding properties (creating a Public

emissions when atmospheric conditions or
local circumstances make such fires
hazardous shall be prohibited. A fire
department officer is authorized to order the

(b) All ordinances or parts of ordinances
in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
(26) Sharps.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this sharps
section of the municipal code is to outline
those "sharps" materials which are
prohibited from entering the solid waste and
recycling stream and to outline the disposal
methods of "home generated" sharps in the
Village consistent with Ch. NR 526, Wis.
Adm. Code, Wisconsin's Medical Waste
Regulations.
(b) Definitions:
1. "Home Generator of Infectious
Waste" means a person who generates
infectious waste through self-administration
of medication or who receives injected
medication at home from other members of
the household or from employees of a home
care or hospice program under section NR
500.03(102), Wis. Adm. Code.
2. "Infectious Waste" means solid waste
that contains pathogens with sufficient
virulence and in sufficient quantity that
exposure of a susceptible human or animal
to the solid waste could cause the human or
animal to contract an infectious disease
under Wisconsin Statutes.
3. "Sharps" means household sharps,
specifically hypodermic needles, syringes
with needles attached, scalpel blades and
lancets as specified in section NR 526.05
(1)(a) and section NR 500.03 (209), Wis.
Adm. Code.
4. "Sharps Collection Station" means
any clinic, hospital or pharmacy which has
registered with the Department of Natural
Resources. The sharps collection stations
will distribute one (1) gallon sharps
collection containers and education
Village of Suamico
6-Public Works Page 16 of 18 Adopted 1-21-08
materials to household sharps users. The
sharps collection stations will accept full
sharps collection containers for disposal.
5. "Solid Waste" means any garbage,
refuse, sludge from a waste water treatment
plant, water supply treatment plan or air
pollution control facility and other discarded
or salvageable materials, including solid,
liquid, semi-liquid, or contained gaseous
material resulting from industrial,
commercial, mining, and agricultural
operations, and from community activities,
but does not include solids or dissolved

or source, special nuclear or by-product
material as defined under Wisconsin
Statutes.

be placed curbside for collection with
normal refuse or placed with recyclables and

generators may not use the Brown County
Household Sharps Collection Program.
(d) Required Disposal Methods.

handling those sharps. Ch. NR 526 of the
Wis. Adm. Code provides for the safe,
convenient collection of sharps by enabling
hospitals, pharmacies, municipalities, and
others to collect sharps from people, such as
diabetics, who generate small amounts of
needles, syringes and other sharps and such
disposal complies with these regulations.
2. Brown County's Household Sharps
Collection Program has established "sharps
collection stations" to service household
generators of sharps with a need to dispose
of home generated sharps and such disposal
complies with these regulations.
3. Business and agricultural sharps
generators shall deposit and dispose of
sharps in accordance with applicable state
regulations set forth in Ch. NR 526, Wis.
Adm. Code.

person related to these recyclable materials
activities in the Village, to any authorized

representative of the Village who requests
access to the records or property for
purposes of this inspection, and who

person with permits issued by the Village
providing recyclable and solid waste
material collection services in the Village

designees in any inspection of their facilities
or properties. The Board or its designees

or properties unless the Board, by order,
declares that inspections with less or no
notice are necessary to insure compliance by
the occupants or these persons.
6.99 PENALTY, SEVERABILITY, AND
ENFORCEMENT.
(1) Penalty. Any person who violates,
or knowingly allows or permits any
violation of, any provision of this ordinance,
shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less
than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and not
more than two thousand five hundred dollars

days for each offense. A separate offense
and violation shall be deemed committed on

decision of a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable,

water, and fertilizer.
(f) to erect, alter, repair, raze, or move
any building, structure, or other large object
without placing suitable guards around
public trees which may be injured by such
operations. It shall be the responsibility of
the owner thereof to repair or replace any
tree injured or killed by such operations.
(g) if it is found that the moving of any
tree is necessary to allow for such
operations, the cost of the moving or
replacement shall be borne by the owner of
the project.

trench, or place any drive within the radius
of five feet (5) from any tree in a public
area except by written permit from the
Forester or when an emergency or
exceptional situation exists.
(i) the Forester may require the posting
of an adequate surety bond or other
sufficient security by any person proposing

the direct result of the excavation; as
reasonably determined by the Forester.
(j) to damage, injure, remove, or
appropriate for one's own personal or private
use any tree, shrub, or vegetation procured

tree, shrub, or vegetation in a project area.
Any resident may request permission to
remove items from a project area prior to
destruction. Rescued items must be utilized
by the individual for personal use and not
for barter or resale.
(k) to prune, cut, or injure oak trees
from April 15 to July 15 as a preventative
measure against the oak wilt disease. If an
oak tree is wounded during this time,
notification of injury must be made to the

(l) Topping of trees shall not be
considered an acceptable means of pruning
or maintenance.
(9) Obstruction of View at

or maintain any tree, shrub, or other
vegetation on any Village street corner lot
within the clear vision triangle which may
obstruct the vision of the operator of any
motor vehicle or pedestrian approaching
such intersection. Any tree, shrub, or other
vegetation obstructing such view between
the heights of two and a half feet (2½) and
ten feet (10) above street grade shall be
deemed a public nuisance. Special
conditions shall not restrict the Forester
from deeming a public nuisance for a
condition meeting the parameters of this
subsection.
(a) The Village adopts Wis. Stats.
§195.29(6) to properly and consistently
address view restrictions at railroad
crossings caused by trees and brush.
(10) As a Public Nuisance. Any tree or
shrub or vegetation which is specifically
designated a public nuisance in this section
or part of which is on public property which,
by reason of its condition, interferes with the
use of any public place; is detrimental to the
construction of public improvements; or
endangers the life, health, safety, or welfare
of the public, or properties thereof. Any
tree, or shrub or vegetation which is
diseased, infested, considered invasive, or
deemed undesirable shall be considered a
public nuisance whether publicly or
privately owned and is subject to the
conditions set forth.
(a) No person shall permit any public
nuisance enumerated in this section to
remain on any property owned or controlled
by them, including public areas.
Village of Suamico
7-Natural Resources Page 15 of 16 Adopted 1-21-08
(b) Notice of Public Nuisance.
Whenever the Forester shall find and declare
any tree or shrub a public nuisance, he or
she shall notify the property owner or his or
her agent in writing that the nuisance must
be abated and the procedure required for the
abatement.
(11) Abatement of Public Nuisances.
(a) Enforcement. The Police
Department, Public Works Director, Zoning
Administrator, Fire Chief, Building
Inspector, and Health Officer shall enforce
those provisions of this chapter that come
within the jurisdiction of their offices; they
shall make periodic inspections upon
complaint to insure that such provisions are
not violated. No actions shall be taken
under this section to abate a public nuisance
unless the officer has inspected or caused to
be inspected, the premises where the
nuisance is alleged to exist and has satisfied
himself or herself that a nuisance does in
fact exist. Whenever practicable, the
inspecting officer shall cause photographs to
be made of the premises and shall file the
same in the office of the Clerk.
(b) Summary Abatement. If the
inspecting officer determines that a public
nuisance exists within the Village and that
there is great and immediate danger to the
public health, safety, peace, morals, or
decency, the Administrator may direct the
proper officer to cause the same to be abated
or to remove such nuisance within twentyfour
(24) hours and shall state that unless
such nuisance is so abated, the Village will
cause the same to be abated and will charge
the cost thereof to the owner, occupant, or
person causing, permitting, or maintaining
the nuisance, as the case may be.
(c) Abatement by Village. If the
nuisance is not abated within the time
provided, or if the owner, occupant, or
person causing the nuisance cannot be
found, the Administrator shall direct the
proper officer to cause the abatement or
removal of such nuisance.
(d) The charge for the abatement or
removal shall be as set from time to time by
resolution of the Board. If such charges are
not paid by November 1 of the year in which
they are billed, such charges, together with
an additional administrative fee for
collection equal to ten percent (10%) of the
total of such charges and fees, shall be
extended on the next succeeding tax roll as a
tax charged against the property affected,
and collected in the same manner as are
other taxes pursuant to Wis. Stats. §66.98.
(e) Abatement after Notice. If the
inspecting officer determines that a public
nuisance exists on private premises but that
such nuisance does not threaten immediate
danger to the public health, safety, peace,
morals, or decency, he or she shall serve
notice on the person causing or maintaining
the nuisance to remove the same within ten
(10) days. If such nuisance is not removed
within ten (10) days, the proper officer shall
cause the nuisance to be removed as
provided in Sub. (3).
(f) Other Methods Not Excluded.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as
prohibiting the abatement of public
nuisances by the Village or its officials in
accordance with the laws of the State of
Wisconsin.
(g) Court Order. Except when
necessary under Sub. (3), an officer
hereunder shall not use force to obtain
access to private property to abate a public
nuisance, but shall request permission to
enter upon private property if such premises
are occupied and if such permission is
denied, shall apply to any court having
jurisdiction for an order assisting the
abatement of the public nuisance.
(12) Cost of Abatement. In addition to
any other penalty imposed by this chapter
for the erection, contrivance, creation,
continuance, or maintenance of a public
Village of Suamico
7-Natural Resources Page 16 of 16 Adopted 1-21-08
nuisance, the cost of abating a public
nuisance by the Village shall be collected as
a debt from the owner, occupant, or person
causing, permitting, or maintaining the
nuisance; and if notice to abate the nuisance
has been given to the owner, such costs shall
be assessed against the real estate as a
special charge.
(a) No damages shall be paid to any
owner for the destruction or removal of any
tree or part thereof or of any shrub, hedge,
or plant.
7.99 PENALTY, SEVERABILITY, AND
ENFORCEMENT.
(1) Penalty. Any person who violates
any provision of this chapter or any order,
rule, or regulation made hereunder shall be
subject to a forfeiture of not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25) nor more than two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any penalty
for violation of Wis. Stats. §30.772 is
subject to forfeiture not to exceed fifty
dollars ($50) for each violation. In addition,
the person shall be responsible for the costs
of prosecution and in default of payment of
such forfeiture and costs of prosecution; he
or she may be imprisoned in the Brown
County Jail until said forfeiture and costs are
paid, but not to exceed ninety (90) days for
each violation. Each day that the violation
continues to exist shall constitute a separate
offense.
(2) Severability. If a court of
competent jurisdiction deems any provision
of this ordinance invalid or unconstitutional,
such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall
not affect the other provisions of the same.
The several sections of this ordinance are
declared to be severable. If any section or
portion thereof shall be declared by a
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable,
such decision shall apply only to the specific
section or portion thereof directly specified
in the court's decision, portions remaining in
the ordinance shall retain the full force and
effect thereof.
(3) Enforcement. Enforcement of this
chapter shall be the responsibility of the
Board or its designee, and/or Police
Department.

devices necessary to allow testing to take
place.
(c) In the event the property owner
installs plumbing upstream of the backflow
preventer, such plumbing must have its own
approved backflow preventer. The property
owner is required to follow the protection
practices described in the American Water
Works Association publication AWWA
M14 titled Recommended Practice for
Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection
Control, unless the Director requires or
authorizes other means of protecting the

of premises having internal cross
connections that cannot be permanently
corrected or controlled, or intricate
plumbing and piping arrangements or where
entry to all portions of the premises is not
readily accessible for inspection purposes,
making it impracticable or impossible to
ascertain whether or not dangerous cross
connections exist, the Public Water System
shall be protected against backflow from the
premises by installing an approved backflow
preventer in the service line.
(a) In the case of any premises where
there is any material dangerous to health that
is handled in such a manner that, in the
opinion of the Director, could create an
actual or potential hazard to the Public
Water System, the Public Water System
shall be protected by an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced-pressure
principle backflow preventer. Examples of
premises where these conditions will exist
include sewage treatment plants, hospitals,
mortuaries, plating plants, and car wash
establishments.
(b) In the case of any premises where, in
the opinion of the Director, an undue health
threat is posed because of the presence of
toxic substances, the Director may require
an approved air gap at the service
connection to protect the Public Water
System. This requirement will be at the
discretion of the Director.
(15) Wis. Adm. Code. Wisconsin
Administrative Comm. 82 is hereby
adopted, except any penalty provisions
therein. Wis. Adm. Codes NR 810 and 812
is hereby adopted. Wisconsin Public
Service Code 185 is hereby adopted in its
entirety.

9-Sewer Utility Page 4 of 8 Adopted 1-21-08
(90) days after inspection of the sewer
lateral installation or upon occupancy
permit, whichever is first.
(2) Control and Measurement of
Admissible Industrial Wastes.
(a) System Connection and Submission
of Basic Data.
1. Persons discharging abnormal sewage
to a public sewer shall prepare and file with
the Director, a report that shall include
pertinent data relating to the quantity and
characteristics of their wastes in accordance
with Wisconsin DNR Permit No. WI-0020-
001, Part II, Section D-Paragraph 7, within
ninety (90) days after being so notified by
the Director.

of the person discharging the waste, and
shall be maintained by said person in safe
condition, accessible, and in proper
operating condition at all times.
(3) Metering of Waste.
(a) Devices for metering the volume of
waste discharged may be required by the
Director if those volumes cannot otherwise
be determined from the metered water
consumption records. Metering devices for
determining the volume of waste shall be
owned and maintained by the person.
Following approval and installation, such
meters may not be removed without the
consent of the Director.
(b) If installed metering devices
malfunction or if metering devices are
impractical, the person shall provide the
department with documented and certified
material as required by the Director so that
the Village can accurately determine the
volume of waste discharged for billing
purposes. Devices shall be calibrated yearly
or as required. The calibration shall be
made by a testing laboratory approved by
the Director. The Village reserves the right
to have the devices calibrated and the cost of
such calibration billed to the person.
(4) Compliance. Within ninety (90)
days after receiving notice from the
Director, each person who discharges
industrial wastes into a public sewer shall
have complied with this section.

could create an unreasonable burden on the
person to comply with the time schedule
imposed, a request for an extension may be
presented to the Director who may grant an
extension.
(6) Waste Sampling. Industrial wastes
discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic sampling and testing to
determine character and concentration. All
sampling and testing cost is to be at the
expense of the person. The determination
shall be made as often as deemed necessary
by the Director. If any testing by the Village
shall show a changed degree of pollutional
load in the sewage or waste discharged, such
new test results shall be used in computing
the subsequent billings, but no reduction
shall be made unless at least a full day of
Village of Suamico
9-Sewer Utility Page 5 of 8 Adopted 1-21-08
operation of the person's plant has
undergone the test. Any person may request
the Village to make new tests; such tests to
be of a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours
duration. Such test shall be made when the
plant is operating under normal conditions,
and the burden shall be on the person
requesting the testing to establish that such
normal conditions prevail. Upon a
determination by the Director that such test
was made when the plant was operating
under normal conditions, the results of these
tests shall be used in computing the
subsequent billing in the manner previously
prescribed.
(7) Analysis. Laboratory test
procedures used in the examination of
industrial wastes shall be those set forth in
Ch. NR 219, Wis. Adm. Code, and shall be
made by the Village at the cost of the
person.
(8) Pre-Treatment. Where required or
when, in the opinion of the Director,
constituents that are harmful to the sewer
system, processes, or operation of the
pollution control works are present in the
wastes discharged to the sewer system, the
person shall provide, at his or her expense,
such preliminary treatment or processing
facilities as may be necessary to render the
wastes acceptable for admission to the
public sewers. When a determination is
made by the Director, the Director shall
forthwith notify the person required to
provide such preliminary treatment stating
the specific reasons that such determination
has been made.
9.06 SEWER SERVICE CHARGE
SYSTEM.
(1) Policy. It shall be the policy of the
Village to obtain sufficient revenues to pay
the costs of the operation and maintenance
of the sewerage system, including debt
service and replacement costs, through a
system of sewer service charges as defined
in this section. The system shall assure that
each user of the sewerage system pays their
fair and proportionate share of the cost of
such facilities.
(2) Sewer Service Charges Generally.
The Village shall annually or from time to
time as the Board deems necessary,
determine the cost of operating and
maintaining the Village's public sewer
system. A service charge shall be the sum
of the Village's cost of operation and
maintenance of the collection system and the
treatment charge from GBMSD. The sewer
service charge shall consist of a volume
charge, or quantity charge, which represents
treatment and transportation of waste water
and a customer charge which includes the
cost of infiltration/inflow and billing
preparation. These costs shall be charged
proportionally to all users of the sewer
system. There shall also be a fixed charge
for the reduction of debt related to the
installation of the interceptor construction
needed for the GBMSD hook-up.
(a) Sewer Service Charge. A sewer
service charge is hereby levied and assessed
upon each lot, parcel of land, building, or
premises having a connection to the public
sewer system. The sewer service rates will
be included in each years fee schedule. The
Board shall have the authority to amend
such charges by resolution from time to time
as may be deemed necessary.
1. All charges for sewerage service shall
be made quarterly and shall be payable on
the first day of January, April, July and
October in each year. An eighteen percent
(18%) APR penalty will be added to those
bills not paid on or before the twentieth
(20th) day after the due date of the bill with a
minimum penalty charge of fifty cents
($0.50) applied to the bills. Failure to
receive a bill shall not excuse non-payment.
Delinquent charges shall be collected in
accordance with Wis. Stats. §66.0821(4)(d).
Village of Suamico
9-Sewer Utility Page 6 of 8 Adopted 1-21-08
2. Third (3rd) quarter charges for
residential metered customers will be based
upon the average of the previous three (3)
quarters of usage. Where a customer of the
utility has no history or an incomplete
history for the previous three (3) quarters, a
charge equal to the unmetered quarterly
sewer use charge as defined above will be
applied if the usage for the third (3rd) quarter
will exceed forty-four dollars ($44).
3. Any excess revenues collected from a
user class will be applied to that class for the
following year.
(3) Penalties for Late Payment of
Sewer Service Charges.
(a) Delinquency. Bills for sewer service
charges levied and assessed in accordance
with this chapter and resolutions adopted
pursuant hereto and the rules and regulations
of the Suamico Sewer and Water Utility
shall become due and payable within twenty
(20) days after the date of billing.
(b) Legal Basis. Each sewer service
charge levied by or pursuant to this section
shall constitute a lien upon the
corresponding premises serviced by the
sewer system as provided for in Wis. Stats.
§66.0821 and the Clerk shall record such

10.01 AUTHORITY.
(1) This chapter is adopted under the
authority granted by Wis. Stats. §61.354, for
villages. This chapter supersedes all
provisions of any ordinance previously
enacted under Wis. Stats. §59.69, §60.62,
§61.35, or §62.23, that relate to Chapter 10.
Except as otherwise specified in Wis. Stats.
§59.693, §60.627, §61.354, or §62.234, Wis.
Stats. §59.69, §60.62, §61.35, or §62.23,
applies to this chapter and to any
amendments to this chapter.
(2) The provisions of this chapter are
deemed not to limit any other lawful
regulatory powers of the same governing
body.
(3) The Board hereby designates the
Director to administer and enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
(4) The requirements of this chapter do
not preempt more stringent requirements
that may be imposed by any of the
following:
(a) Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources administrative rules, permits or
approvals including those authorized under
Wis. Stats. §281.16 and §283.33.
(b) Targeted non-agricultural
performance standards promulgated in rules
by the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources under s. NR 151.004, Wis. Adm.
Code.
(c) 61.354 of the Wisconsin State
Statutes.
10.02 FINDINGS OF FACT. The Board
finds that runoff from land disturbing
construction activity carries a significant
amount of sediment and other pollutants to
the waters of the state located within the
Village.
The Board also finds that
uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a
significant impact upon water resources and
the health, safety and general welfare of the
community and diminishes the public
enjoyment and use of natural resources.
Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction
runoff can:
(1) Degrade physical stream habitat by
increasing stream bank erosion, increasing
streambed scour, diminishing groundwater
recharge, diminishing stream base flows and
increasing stream temperature.
(2) Diminish the capacity of lakes and
streams to support fish, aquatic life,
recreational and water supply uses by
increasing pollutant loading of sediment,
suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals,
bacteria, pathogens and other urban
pollutants.
(3) Alter wetland communities by
changing wetland hydrology and by
increasing pollutant loads.
(4) Reduce the quality of groundwater
by increasing pollutant loading.
(5) Threaten public health, safety,
property and general welfare by overtaxing
storm sewers, drainage ways, and other
minor drainage facilities.
(6) Threaten public health, safety,
property and general welfare by increasing
major flood peaks and volumes.
(7) Undermine floodplain management
efforts by increasing the incidence and
levels of flooding.
10.03 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
(1) Purpose. The general purpose of
this chapter is to establish runoff
management requirements that will diminish
the threats to public health, safety, welfare
and the aquatic environment. Specific
purposes are to:
(a) Further the maintenance of safe and
healthful conditions.
(b) Prevent and control the adverse
effects of stormwater; prevent and control
Village of Suamico
10-Stormwater Utility Page 3 of 33 Adopted 6-2-08
soil erosion; prevent and control water
pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish
and aquatic life; control building sites,
placement of structures and land uses;
preserve ground cover and scenic beauty;
and promote sound economic growth.
(c) Control exceedance of the safe
capacity of existing drainage facilities and
receiving water bodies; prevent undue
channel erosion; control increases in the
scouring and transportation of particulate
matter; and prevent conditions that endanger
downstream property.
(2) Intent. It is the intent of the
Board that this chapter regulates stormwater
discharges to waters of the state. This
chapter may be applied on a site-by-site
basis. The Board recognizes, however, that
the preferred method of achieving the
stormwater performance standards set forth
in this chapter is through the preparation and
implementation of comprehensive, systemslevel
stormwater management plans that
cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds,
on a municipal and regional scale. Such
plans may prescribe regional stormwater
devices, practices or systems, any of which
may be designed to treat or prevent runoff
from more than one (1) site prior to
discharge to waters of the state. Where such
plans are in conformance with the
performance standards developed under
Wis. Stats. §281.16 for regional stormwater
management measures and have been
approved by the Village, it is the intent of
this chapter that the approved plan be used
to identify measures acceptable for the
community.

following, except as provided in Subds. 8.
through 11.
1. For developments with twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet or more of
impervious surface disturbance and
Village of Suamico
10-Stormwater Utility Page 17 of 33 Adopted 6-2-08
development with one (1) acre or more of
land disturbance, one (1) of the following
shall be met:
a. Low imperviousness. For
development up to forty (40) percent
connected imperviousness, such as parks,
cemeteries, and low density residential
development, infiltrate sufficient runoff
volume so that the post-development
infiltration volume shall be at least ninety
(90) percent of the pre-development
infiltration volume, based on an average
annual rainfall. However, when designing
appropriate infiltration systems to meet this
requirement, no more than one percent of
the post-construction site is required as an
effective infiltration area.
b. Moderate imperviousness. For
development with more than forty (40)
percent and up to eighty (80) percent
connected imperviousness, such as medium
and high density residential, multi-family
development, industrial and institutional
development, and office parks, infiltrate
sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at
least seventy-five (75) percent of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on
an average annual rainfall. However, when
designing appropriate infiltration systems to
meet this requirement, no more than two (2)
percent of the post-construction site is
required as an effective infiltration area.
c. High imperviousness. For
development with more than eighty (80)
percent connected imperviousness, such as
commercial strip malls, shopping centers,
and commercial downtowns, infiltrate
sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at
least sixty (60) percent of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on
an average annual rainfall. However, when
designing appropriate infiltration systems to
meet this requirement, no more than two (2)
percent of the post-construction site is
required as an effective infiltration area.
2. Pre-development condition shall
assume good hydrologic conditions for
appropriate land covers as identified in TR-
55 or an equivalent methodology approved
by the administering authority. The
meaning of hydrologic soil group and
runoff curve number are as determined in
TR-55. However, when pre-development
land cover is cropland, rather than using TR-
55 values for cropland, the following runoff
curve numbers shall be used:
Maximum Pre-Development Runoff Curve #s  Cropland
Hydraulic Soil Group A B C D
Runoff Curve # 56 70 79 83
3. For residential and non-residential
developments with less than twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet of new
impervious surfaces, infiltrate runoff volume
using BMPs from the Village Stormwater
Reference Guide. These sites are not
required to satisfy a numeric performance
standard.
4. The amount of infiltration previously
required for the site shall not be reduced as a
result of the proposed development or
disturbance.
5. Before infiltrating runoff,
pretreatment shall be required for parking lot
runoff and for runoff from new road
construction in commercial, industrial and
institutional areas that will enter an
infiltration system. The pretreatment shall
be designed to protect the infiltration system
from clogging prior to scheduled
maintenance and to protect groundwater
quality in accordance with Subd. 11.
Pretreatment options may include, but are
not limited to, oil/grease separation,
sedimentation, biofiltration, filtration,
swales or filter strips.
6. Exclusions. Infiltration of runoff
from the following areas are prohibited from
Village of Suamico

uses or regional devices for residential
development.
h. Areas where contaminants of
concern, as defined in S. NR 720.03(2), Wis.
Adm. Code are present in the soil through
which infiltration will occur.
Any area where the soil does not
exhibit one (1) of the following soil
characteristics between the bottom of the
infiltration system and the seasonal high
groundwater and top of bedrock: at least a
three foot (3) soil layer with twenty percent
(20%) fines or greater; or at least a five foot
(5) soil layer with ten percent (10%) fines
or greater. This does not apply where the
soil medium within the infiltration system
provides an equivalent level of protection.
This Subd. 8.i. does not prohibit infiltration
of roof runoff.
7. Exemptions. Infiltration of runoff
from the following areas are not required to

ordinance requirements for total suspended
solids and peak flow reduction, except to the
extent that vegetative ground cover is
necessary to maintain bank stability.
e. In-fill development areas less than
five (5) acres.
(e) Fueling and Vehicle Maintenance
Areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance
areas shall, to the maximum extent
practicable, have BMPs designed, installed
and maintained to reduce petroleum within
runoff, such that the runoff that enters
waters of the state contains no visible
petroleum sheen.
(f) Swale Treatment for Transportation
Facilities. This Section 10.17 (3) (f) is not
applicable to transportation facilities that are
part of a larger common plan of
development or sale.
1. Applicability. Except as provided in
Subd. 2., transportation facilities that use
swales for runoff conveyance and pollutant
removal meet all of the requirements of this
section, if the swales are designed to the
maximum extent practicable to do all of the
following:
a. Be vegetated. However, where
appropriate, non-vegetative measures may
be employed to prevent erosion or provide
for runoff treatment, such as rock riprap
stabilization or check dams.
b. Carry runoff through a swale for two
hundred feet (200) or more in length that is
designed with a flow velocity no greater

offsite as part of a regional stormwater
device, practice or system, but shall be
installed in accordance with s. NR 151.003,
Wis. Adm. Code.
(b) Post-construction runoff within a
non-navigable surface water that flows into
a BMP, such as a wet detention pond, is not
required to meet the performance standards
of this chapter. Post-construction BMPs
may be located in non-navigable surface
waters.
(c) Except as allowed under Par. (d),
post-construction runoff from new
development shall meet the postconstruction
performance standards prior to
entering a navigable surface water.
(d) Post-construction runoff from any
development within a navigable surface
water that flows into a BMP is not required
to meet the performance standards of this
chapter if:
1. The BMP was constructed prior to
the effective date of this chapter and the
BMP either received a permit issued under
Wis. Stats. Ch. 30, or the BMP did not
require a Wis. Stats. Ch. 30 permit; and
2. The BMP is designed to provide
runoff treatment from future upland
development.
(e) Runoff from existing development,
redevelopment and in-fill areas shall meet
the post-construction performance standards
in accordance with this paragraph.
1. To the maximum extent practicable,
BMPs shall be located to treat runoff prior to
discharge to navigable surface waters.
2. Post-construction BMPs for such
runoff may be located in a navigable surface
water if allowable under all other applicable
Village of Suamico
10-Stormwater Utility Page 22 of 33 Adopted 6-2-08
federal, state and local regulations such as
Ch. NR 103, Wis. Adm. Code and Wis.
Stats. Ch. 30.
(f) The discharge of runoff from a BMP,
such as a wet detention pond or after a series
of such BMPs is subject to this chapter.
(g) The Director may approve offsite
management measures provided that all of
the following conditions are met:

and maintenance.
(h) Where a regional treatment option
exists such that the Director exempts the
applicant from all or part of the minimum
onsite stormwater management
requirements, the applicant shall be required
to pay a fee in an amount determined in
negotiation with the Director. In
determining the fee for post-construction
runoff, the Director shall consider an
equitable distribution of the cost for land,
engineering design, construction, and
maintenance of the regional treatment
option.
(7) Alternate Requirements. The
Director may establish stormwater
management requirements more stringent
than those set forth in this section if the
Director determines that an added level of
protection is needed to protect sensitive
resources. Also, the Director may establish
stormwater management requirements less
stringent than those set forth in this section
if the Director determines that less
protection is needed to protect sensitive
resources and provide reasonable flood
protection. However, the alternative
requirements shall not be less stringent than
those requirements promulgated in rules by
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
under NR 151 Wisconsin Administrative
Code.
10.18 PERMITTING
REQUIREMENTS, PROCEDURES,

SUBCHAPTER III  ILLICIT
DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION
ORDINANCE
10.25 GENERAL.
(1) The purpose of this chapter is to
provide for the health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of the Village through
the regulation of non-stormwater discharges
to the MS4 to the maximum extent
practicable as required by federal and state
law. This chapter establishes methods for
controlling the introduction of pollutants
into the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) in order to comply with
requirements of the Wisconsin Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (WPDES)
permit process. The objectives of this
chapter are:
(a) To regulate the contribution of
pollutants to the MS4 by stormwater
discharges by any user.
(b) To prohibit illicit connections and
discharges to the MS4.
(c) To establish legal authority to carry
out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring,
and enforcement procedures necessary to
ensure compliance with this chapter.
10.26 APPLICABILITY. This chapter
shall apply to all water entering the MS4
generated on any lands unless explicitly
exempted by an authorized enforcement
agency.
10.27 ADMINISTRATION. The Director
shall administer, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this chapter. Any powers
granted or duties imposed upon the Director
may be to persons or entities acting in the
beneficial interest of or as an employee of
the Village.
10.28 COMPATIBILITY WITH
OTHER REGULATIONS. This chapter is
not intended to modify or repeal any other
chapter, rule, regulation, or other provision
of law. The requirements of this chapter are
in addition to the requirements of any other
ordinance, rule, regulation, or other
provision of law, and where any provision of
this chapter imposes restrictions different
from those imposed by any other ordinance,
rule, regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provision is more restrictive or
imposes higher protective standards for
Village of Suamico
10-Stormwater Utility Page 27 of 33 Adopted 6-2-08
human health or the environment shall
control.
10.29 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
(1) Prohibition of Illicit Discharges.
No person shall throw, drain, or otherwise
discharge, cause, or allow others under its
control to throw, drain, or otherwise
discharge into the MS4 any pollutants or
waters containing any pollutants, other than
stormwater. Pollutants include, but are not
limited to: dredged soil, solid waste, grass
clippings, sewage, garbage, refuse, oil,
chemical waste or biological materials. See
Wis. Stats. §283.01(13) for complete list.

firefighting, and other discharges specified
in writing by the Village as being necessary
to protect public health and safety.
(c) Any non-stormwater discharge
permitted under a WPDES permit, waiver,
or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the
authority of the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources. Any person subject to
such a WPDES stormwater discharge permit
shall comply with all provisions of such
permit.
(3) Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
(a) The construction, use, maintenance
or continued existence of illicit connections
to the MS4 is prohibited.
(b) This prohibition expressly includes,
without limitation, illicit connections made
in the past, regardless of whether the
connection was permissible under law or
practices applicable or prevailing at the time
of connection.
(c) A person is considered to be in
violation of this chapter if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the
MS4, or allows such a connection to
continue.
(d) Improper connections in violation of
this chapter must be disconnected and
redirected, if necessary, to an approved
onsite wastewater management system or
the sanitary sewer system upon approval of
the Village.
(e) Any drain or conveyance that has
not been documented in plans, maps or
equivalent, and which may be connected to
the storm sewer system, shall be located by
the owner or occupant of that property upon
receipt of written notice of violation from
the Village requiring that such locating be
completed. Such notice will specify a
reasonable time period within which the
location of the drain or conveyance is to be
determined, that the drain or conveyance be
identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or
other, and that the outfall location or point
of connection to the storm sewer system,
sanitary sewer system or other discharge
point be identified. Results of these
investigations are to be documented and
provided to the Village.
10.30 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
Every person owning property through
which a watercourse passes, or such
persons lessee, shall keep and maintain that
part of the watercourse within the property
be free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation
and other obstacles that would pollute,
contaminate, or significantly retard the flow
of water through the watercourse. In
addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or
adjacent to a watercourse, so that such
Village of Suamico
10-Stormwater Utility Page 28 of 33 Adopted 6-2-08
structures will not become a hazard to the
use, function, or physical integrity of the
watercourse.
10.31 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
(1) Right-of-Entry Inspecting and
Sampling. The Village shall be permitted to
enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as may
be necessary to determine compliance with
this chapter.
(a) If a discharger has security measures
in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises,
the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the Village.
(b) Facility operators shall allow the
Village ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of
records.
(c) The Village shall have the right to
set up on any facility such devices as are
necessary in the opinion of the Village to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facilitys stormwater discharge.
(d) The Village has the right to require
the discharger to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facilitys
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its
own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(e) Any temporary or permanent
obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall
be promptly removed by the operator at the
written or oral request of the Village and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the operator.
(f) Unreasonable delays in allowing the
Village access to a facility are a violation. A
person who is the operator of a facility
commits an offense if the person denies the
Village reasonable access to the facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
(2) Special Inspection Warrant. If the
Village has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is
discharged, and the Director is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample
as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the
Village may seek issuance of a special
inspection warrant per Wis. Stats. §66.0119.
10.32 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT,
CONTROL, AND REDUCE
STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT
PRACTICES. The owner or operator of
any activity, operation, or facility which
may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of stormwater, the MS4, or
waters of the state shall provide, at their own
expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials
or other wastes into the MS4 or
watercourses through the use of these
structural and constructural BMPs. Further,
any person responsible for a property or
premise that is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said persons expense,
additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid WPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed in compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
Village of Suamico
10-Stormwater Utility Page 29 of 33 Adopted 6-2-08
Stormwater Management Plan
(SWMP)/Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance.
10.33 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law,
as soon as any person responsible for a
facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or
operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are
resulting or may result in illicit discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the
MS4, or waters of the state, said person shall
take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall
immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency
dispatch services. In the event of a release
of non-hazardous materials, said person
shall notify the Village in person or by
phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Village within
two (2) business days of the phone notice. If
the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an onsite
written record of the discharge and the
actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such
records shall be retained for at least five (5)
years. Failure to provide notification of a
release as provided above is a violation of
this chapter.
10.34 VIOLATIONS. It shall be unlawful
for any person to violate any provision or
fail to comply with any of the requirements
of this chapter. Any person who has
violated or continues to violate the
provisions of this chapter, may be subject to
the enforcement actions outlined in this
section or may be restrained by injunction or
otherwise abated in a manner provided by
law. In the event the violation constitutes an
immediate danger to public health or public
safety, the Village is authorized to enter
upon the subject private property, without
giving prior notice, to take any and all
measures necessary to abate the violation.
The Village is authorized to seek costs of the
abatement as outlined in Section 10.28.
(1) Warning Notice. When the Village
finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the
Village may serve upon that person a written
warning notice, specifying the particular
violation believed to have occurred and
requesting the discharger to immediately
investigate the matter and to seek a
resolution whereby any offending discharge
will cease. Investigation and/or resolution
of the matter in response to the warning
notice in no way relieves the alleged violator
of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the warning notice.
Nothing in the subsection shall limit the
authority of the Village to take action,
including emergency action or any other
enforcement action without first issuing a
warning notice.
(2) Notice of Violation. Whenever the
Village finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement
of this chapter, the Village may order
compliance by written notice of violation to
the responsible person. The notice of
violation shall contain:
(a) The name and address of the alleged
violator;
(b) The address when available or a
description of the building, structure or land
upon which the violation is occurring, or has
occurred;
(c) A statement specifying the nature of
the violation;
Village of Suamico
10-Stormwater Utility Page 30 of 33 Adopted 6-2-08
(d) A description of the remedial
measures necessary to restore compliance
with this chapter and a time schedule for the
completion of such remedial action;
(e) A statement of the penalty or
penalties that shall or may be assessed
against the person to whom the notice of
violation is directed;
(f) A statement that the determination of
violation may be appealed to the Village by
filing a written notice of appeal within three
(3) days of service of notice of violation;
and a statement specifying that, should the
violator fail to restore compliance within the
established time schedule, the work will be
done by a designated governmental agency
or contractor and the expense thereof shall
be charged to the violator. Such notice may
require without limitation:
1. The performance of monitoring,
analyses, and reporting;
2. The elimination of illicit connections
or discharges;
3. That violating discharges, practices,
or operations shall cease and desist;
4. The abatement or remediation of
stormwater pollution or contamination
hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
5. Payment of a fine to cover
administrative and remediation costs; and
6. The implementation of BMPs.
10.35 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
(1) Emergency Cease and Desist
Orders. When the Village finds that any
person has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, or any order
issued hereunder, or that the persons past
violations are likely to recur, and that the
persons violation(s) has (have) caused or
contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United
States which reasonably appears to present
an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, the Village may issue an order
to the violator directing it immediately to
cease and desist all such violations and
directing the violator to:
(a) Immediately comply with all chapter
requirements; and
(b) Take such appropriate preventive
action as may be needed to properly address
a continuing or threatened violation,
including immediately halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge. Any
person notified of an emergency order
directed to it under this subsection shall
immediately comply and stop or eliminate
its endangering discharge. In the event of a
dischargers failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the emergency order, the
Village may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize harm to
the MS4 or waters of the United States,
and/or endangerment to persons or to the
environment, including immediate
termination of a facilitys water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility
services. The Village may allow the person
to recommence its discharge when it has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Village that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless further termination
proceedings are initiated against the
discharger under this chapter. A person that
is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the
harmful discharge and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Village
within three (3) days of receipt of the
prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the violator.
(2) Suspension Due to Illicit
Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
Village may, without prior notice, suspend
MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may
Village of Suamico
10-Stormwater Utility Page 31 of 33 Adopted 6-2-08
present imminent and substantial danger to
the environment, or to the health or welfare
of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the
state. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency,
the Village may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to
the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
(3) Suspension Due to the Detection of
Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging
to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may
have their MS4 access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The Village will notify a violator
of the proposed termination of its MS4
access. The violator may petition the
Village for a reconsideration and hearing. A
person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without
the prior approval of the Village.
10.36 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE
VIOLATION. Within thirty (30) days after
abatement of the violation, the owner of the
property will be notified of the cost of
abatement, including administrative costs.
If the amount due is not paid by the date
determined by the Village, the charges shall
become a special charge against the property
and shall constitute a lien on the property.
10.37 VIOLATIONS DEEMED A
PUBLIC NUISANCE. Any condition in
violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter and declared and deemed a
nuisance, may be summarily abated or
restored at the violators expense.
10.38 REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE.
The remedies listed in this chapter are not
exclusive of any other remedies available
under any applicable federal, state, or local
law and it is within the discretion of the
Village to seek cumulative remedies. The
Village may recover all attorney fees court
costs and other expenses associated with
enforcement of this chapter, including
sampling and monitoring expenses.
10.39 FEE SCHEDULE. The permitting
fees for this chapter shall be as set from time
to time by resolution by the Board. A
schedule of the fees established by the
Board shall be available for review at
Village Hall.

abandon any animal in the Village. No
person shall cause or allow any place where
any animal is or may be kept to become
unclean or unwholesome.
11.03 ANIMALS AT LARGE.
(1) No person, owner, or custodian shall
permit an animal to be at large within the
Village. Any animal shall be deemed to be
at large when it is off the premises owned or
leased by its owner or custodian unless
crated, penned, or under the control of a
person able to control the animal by means
of a leash of sufficient strength to control the
action of the animal or such other personal
attention as will reasonably control the
conduct and actions of the animal.
(2) No person, owner, or custodian shall
permit any animal to be left unattended
within five (5) feet of a public right-of-way.
(a) Such public rights-of-way include,
but are not limited to sidewalks, streets,

(b) Unattended animals shall include
those animals which are crated, penned, or

supervision or control sufficient to properly
restrain the animal.
(3) No person shall permit any animal
owned by or under the control of such
person to trespass or be upon the property of
another person without the owners or
occupants permission.
11.04 DANGEROUS OR WILD

(a) As stated in Wis. Stats. §173.23(4),
§174.01, and §29.921(7) members of the

Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 5 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
prairie dog, or other like dangerous wild
animal, reptile, bird or creature in any place
within the Village other than in a safely and
properly maintained zoological park, circus,
scientific, or educational institution, research
laboratory, veterinary hospital, designated
pound, or animal refuge, or in a wellsecured
vehicle, while being transported
without delay to or from any such
authorized place or through the Village.
Any such animal that is within the Village at
any time without being safely and properly
maintained as authorized under any of the
foregoing is declared to be a public nuisance
and shall be dealt with in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
(c) It shall be no defense that the keeper
of any such animal contrary to the
provisions hereof has attempted to
domesticate same.
11.05 NOISY ANIMALS.
(1) No person shall harbor or keep any
animal, bird, or reptile which disturbs the
peace by loud or unusual noises at any time
of the day or night.
(2) No owner or person in control of
any dog shall suffer, permit or allow such
animal to bark or bay in such a manner as to
detrimentally affect the peaceful repose of
one (1) or more property owners or residents
of the immediate area, and within earshot of
the barking or baying. In determining
whether the noise detrimentally affects
peaceful repose, the volume of the noise,
time of day, length of time the noise persists,
the location of the animal, and prior
substantiated complaints shall be relevant.
Where a dog is left unattended out-of-doors,
it shall be presumed the owner or person in
control is permitting the noise.
11.06 DOGS LICENSED. No person shall
own, harbor or keep any dog within the
Village unless the dog is licensed as
provided by Wis. Stats. §174.05. All dogs
shall be licensed according to the provisions
in Section 5.09 of the Village Code.
11.07 NUISANCE ANIMALS. Whereas
animals, birds, and reptiles may have
propensities to or may otherwise cause noise
or odor or perform actions which may
disturb persons in the reasonable use and
enjoyment of property, or cause annoyance,
discomfort, or injury to the health or welfare
of persons, the keeping of any animal, bird,
or reptile in conflict with any provision of
this section declared to be a public nuisance,
and such animal, bird, or reptile may be
impounded as provided by law.
11.08 ANIMALS CAUSING DAMAGE
OR INJURY.
(1) Any incident occurring in the

is suspected of biting a person, shall be
immediately reported to the Police
Department or to the Brown County Health
Department by any person having
knowledge of such incident and the
following procedure shall be followed.
(a) Any animal which bites a person in
the Village, if it can be found, or any animal
which is customarily kept within the Village
and which bites a person, shall be
quarantined for a period of ten (10) days
from the day of the bite for the purpose of
observation for the possibility of rabies.
Such quarantine shall be affected as directed
by the Health Department and may be:
1. Confinement of the animal to a
structure or enclosure, which is adequate to
with-strain the animal on the premises of the
owner or agent.
2. Confinement of the animal with a
licensed veterinarian.
3. Confinement of the animal at a
boarding facility approved by the Village.
Costs of boarding shall be at owners

Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 6 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
(b) No animal which is known or
suspected to have bitten a person shall be
destroyed until after the ten (10) day
quarantine period has elapsed, unless it
cannot be apprehended safely, in which case
the destruction shall be accomplished
without damage to the head of the animal, if
at all possible. The Brown County Health
Department shall be immediately notified of
such destruction of the animal, and the dead
animal shall not be disposed of until such
specimens as the Health Department shall
direct have been obtained and permission is
given by him to dispose of the dead animal.
(c) In case an animal, which has been
quarantined in accordance with this section,
dies for any reason during the quarantine
period, the person having custody of the
animal shall immediately notify the Health
Department as required in Section 11.08
above.
(2) Without notice, the owner,
custodian, or person in control of any animal
shall forfeit not less than twenty dollars
($20) nor more than two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500) if the animal
causes injury to any person, livestock,

and not in front of the home. The Zoning
Administrator shall have the authority to
relax this requirement on larger lots. The
hives shall have visual barrier, not entirely
concealing the hive but providing a
softening appearance. Lots smaller than one
acre in size are limited to two (2) hives. It is
recommended that the hive owner join the
Brown County Beekeepers Association for
education and guidance purposes.
11.10 KEEPING NUISANCE
ANIMALS. The keeping of any animal,
fowl, reptile, mammal, or bird which affects
or disturbs the public health, public peace,
public safety or public decency is a public

Village. No action shall be taken under this
subsection unless and until the Village
investigates, and they have ascertained that
the raising or keeping of a particular animal,
fowl, reptile, mammal, or bird within the
Village reasonably constitutes a condition
which is detrimental to the public health,
safety or welfare. For purposes of enforcing
this subsection, the Humane Officer, Police
Department, Building Inspector, or other
peace officer may enter any premises for the
purpose of inspection. Any person, who
violates any provision of this subsection,

condition continues after notification by the
Village shall be considered a separate
violation of this subsection.

dangerous/potentially dangerous dog to be
kept on a chain, rope, or other type of leash
outside its kennel or pen unless a person is

Conservancy zones that are not publicly
owned shall be regulated according to the
adjacent zone. If the neighboring zones are
Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 16 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
different, they shall be extended to the
center of the conservancy for the purposes
of this section.
(d) Measurements. The measurement
shall be made at or beyond the property line
of the property on which said noise is
generated at or within the property line of
the property on which said noise is
perceived as inappropriate. Measurement
shall be done at a minimum height of four
feet (4) above the ground. The
measurement of sound shall be made either
with a sound level meter that meets or
exceeds the ANSI requirements of the
American Standard Specification for Sound
Level Meters, Type I or Type II (ANSI #1.4
-1971) or with an Octave Band Analyzer
that meets or exceeds the requirements of
ANSI (#1.6 - 1960) or any subsequent
nationally adopted standards superseding the
above standards. In both cases, the
instruments should be maintained in
calibration and good working order.
When a sound level meter is used, it
shall be set to the A-weighting scale and in
the FAST response mode. A windscreen
shall be mounted on the microphone and the
noise limitations shall be the A-scale levels
set forth in Table I.
An octave band analyzer may be
employed when there is a concentration of
sound energy within a limited number of
bands, but its use shall not be restricted to
such situations. When an octave band
analyzer is used, a standard octave band
analyzer shall be conducted that spans the
frequency range set forth in Table I.

motor vehicle section of this section.
3. Non-stationary farming equipment.
(f) Analysis. Where an octave band
analysis is not done, an A-weighted sound
level measurement of the noise shall be
taken. When this method is used, the noise
limitations shall be the A-scale levels
included in the table.
(g) Excessive Construction/Equipment
Noise Prohibited. Between the hours of
10 p.m. and 7 a.m., no person may operate
construction machinery, any equipment, or

the sound, unless an emergency situation
exists requiring the use of such equipment or
tools. The following are exempt from the
provisions of this code: implements of
husbandry being used on agricultural lands,
equipment operated by Brown County
Highway Department, and equipment used
in any municipal operation.

property or portion thereof which is zoned in
any Industrial District classification causing
earth-shaking vibrations such as are created
by uses including, but not limited to, drop

controlled in such manner as to prevent
transmission beyond the lot line of earthshaking
vibrations perceptible without the
aid of instruments.
11.35 STORAGE OF JUNK.
(1) The unsheltered accumulation or
storage of old, unused, stripped, junked, and
automobiles not in good and safe operating
condition, any other vehicles, machinery,
implements, equipment, any parts thereof,
and personal property of any kind which is
no longer safely usable for the purposes for
which it was manufactured within the
Village is declared to be a public nuisance
and dangerous to the public health, safety
and well-being of Village residents.
(2) The owner, tenant, lessee, and
occupants of any lot upon which such
Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 17 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
accumulation or storage is made and the
owner and lessee of the items involved in
such storage, all referred to collectively as
owners, shall jointly and severally abate
the nuisance by promptly moving such items
into completely enclosed buildings
authorized to be used for such storage
purposes, if the same can be found within
the Village, or otherwise by moving the
items to a location outside the Village.
(3) Whenever the owners fail to abate
the nuisance, the Village shall move such
items to a location of its selection, and the
expense therefore shall be billed to the
owners, jointly and severally, which bill
shall be coverable through tax roll. When
such items have been removed and placed in
storage by the Village, they shall be sold by
the Village after the lapse of such time as is
provided. If the proceeds of such sale are
insufficient to pay the costs of abatement,
the owners shall be jointly and severally
liable to the Village for the balance of the
costs to be recoverable in a suit of law. If
the proceeds are in excess of costs, the
balance shall be paid to the owners or
deposited with the Village for their use.
11.35.5 CHRONIC NUISANCE
PROPERTY.
(1) Findings. The Village Board of
Suamico finds that certain premises within
the Village of Suamico receive and require
more than the general, acceptable level of
services from Village departments. These
premises place an undue and inappropriate
burden on the Village of Suamico taxpayers.
Nuisance activity contributes to the general
decay of an affected neighborhood and
negatively impacts law-abiding residents in
these neighborhoods. This ordinance is
intended to encourage responsible
ownership of such properties such as they do
not unduly burden the Villages departments
or taxpayers. This section is not intended to
discourage crime victims or a person in
legitimate need of Village services from
requesting them. This section does not
affect a premise owners duty to comply
with the fair housing laws, nor does it affect
a premises owners duty to comply with all
other laws governing residential tenancies
which are contained in Chapter 704 of the
Wisconsin statutes, Chapter ATCP 134 of
the Wisconsin Administrative Code and
other parts of this code.
(2) Definitions. The following words,
terms and phrases, when used in this
chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to

activities.
(b) Chronic nuisance properties. A
property that meets any of the following
criteria:
1. A property which has generated three

associated with the property; or
2. A property for which a court of law
has determined that, pursuant to a search
warrant request, probable cause exists that
manufacture, distribution or delivery of a
controlled substance has occurred on or in
association with the premises within thirty
(30) days prior to the date of the search
warrant application; or
3. Is a property which has had one (1)
enforcement action associated with the

Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 19 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
(a) Whenever an authorized Village
official determines that three (3) or more
nuisance activities resulting in enforcement
action have occurred at the premises or
property during a three (3) year period, the
Village official may notify the premises or
property owner in writing. The Village
official shall not count nuisance activities
reported by the owner of the premises or
onsite premises manager. Sec. 968.075,
Wis. Stats., broadly defines domestic
abuse. Therefore, in reaching a
determination that a premises is a chronic
nuisance premises, activities that are
domestic abuse incidents pursuant to
S.968.075, Wis. Stats., shall not be included
as nuisance activities unless the incidents
have been reviewed by the Police
Department and the Village Attorney and a
determination is made that, based upon the
specific facts of each incident, the activities
should be deemed nuisance activities. In
determining whether to include such
activities, the Police Department and Village
Attorney shall consider the strong public
policy in favor of domestic victims reporting
alleged abuses, and this ordinance shall not
operate to discourage such reports.
The notice shall be deemed to be
properly delivered if sent either by first class
mail to the premises owners last known
address or if delivered in person to the
premises owner. If the premises owner
cannot be located, the notice shall be
deemed to be properly delivered if a copy is
left at the premises owners usual place of
abode in the presence of some competent
member of the family at least fourteen (14)
years of age, or a competent adult currently
residing there and who shall be informed of
the contents of the notice. If a current
address cannot be located, it shall be deemed
sufficient if a copy of the notice is sent by
first class mail to the last known address of
the owner identified by the records of the
Village Assessor.
(b) The notice shall contain the street
address or legal description sufficient to
identify the premises.
(c) A description of the nuisance
activities that have occurred on the premises
and a statement indicating that the cost of
future enforcement may be assessed as a
special charge against the premises.
(d) A statement that the premises owner,
in addition to actual abatement costs, may be
subject to a forfeiture action with a penalty
of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25) nor
more than two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500) for each day a chronic nuisance is
allowed to continue.
(e) A statement that the premises
owner shall within thirty (30) days, meet
with the Village official either to appeal or
to propose a written course of action to abate
the nuisance activities which is acceptable to
the authorized Village official.
(4) Abatement Plan. Any owner
receiving notice pursuant to Subsection (3),
shall meet with the authorized Village
official or his or her designee within (30)
days of receipt of such notice. The parties
shall review the problems occurring on the
property. Within ten (10) business days of
this meeting, the owner shall submit to the
authorized Village official or his or her
designee, an abatement plan to end the
nuisance activity on the property. The plan
shall also specify a name, address, and
telephone number of a person living within
sixty (60) miles of the property who can be
contacted in the event of further police, fire,
or other authorized Village official contact.
(5) Additional Nuisance Activity.
Whenever the authorized Village official
determines that the additional nuisance
activity has occurred at the premises for
which notice has been issued pursuant to
this section, that this nuisance activity has
occurred not less than fifteen (15) days after
the notice has been issued, and that
reasonable efforts have not been made to
Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 20 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
abate the nuisance activity, the authorized
Village official may calculate the cost of
Village response and enforcement for this
and any subsequent nuisance activities and
cause such charges and administrative costs
to be assessed as collected as a special
charge.
(6) Appeal. Appeal of the
determination of the authorized Village
official may be submitted to the Suamico
Village Health & Safety Committee.
However, if no petition for an appeal
hearing is filed within twenty (20) days
following receipt of the notice provided to
the premises owner, the petitioners right
herein provided to a hearing shall be deemed
waived by the petitioner and the hearing
petition shall be voided as untimely.
11.36 ABATEMENT OF PUBLIC
NUISANCES.
(1) Enforcement. The Police
Department, Zoning Administrator, Fire
Chief, Director of Public Works, Weed

Officer, Forester, or Health Officer shall
enforce those provisions of this chapter that
come within the jurisdiction of their offices;
and they shall make periodic inspections and
inspections upon complaint to insure that
such provisions are not violated. No actions
shall be taken under this section to abate a
public nuisance unless the officer has
inspected or caused to be inspected the
premises where the nuisance is alleged to
exist and has satisfied himself or herself that
a nuisance does in fact exist. Whenever
practicable, the inspecting officer shall cause
photographs to be made of the premises and
shall file the same in the offices of the Clerk.
(2) Summary Abatement. If the
inspecting officer determines that a public
nuisance exists within the Village and that
there is great and immediate danger to the
public health, safety, peace, morals, or
decency, the Administrator may direct the
proper officer to cause the same to be abated
or to remove such nuisance within twentyfour
(24) hours and shall state that unless
such nuisance is so abated, the Village will
cause the same to be abated and will charge
the cost thereof to the owner, occupant, or
person causing, permitting, or maintaining
the nuisance, as the case may be.
(3) Abatement by Village. If the
nuisance is not abated within the time
provided, or if the owner, occupant, or
person causing the nuisance cannot be
found, the Police Department, Zoning
Administrator, Fire Chief, Director of Public
Works, or Weed Commissioner shall cause
the abatement or removal of such nuisance.
The charge for the abatement or removal
shall be as set from time to time by the
Board and its costs shall be charged to the
property owner. If such charges are not paid
by November 15 of the year in which they
are billed, such charges, together with an
additional administrative fee for collection
equal to ten percent (10%) of the total of
such charges and fees, shall be extended on
the next succeeding tax roll as a tax charged
against the property affected and collected in
the same manner as are other real estate
taxes.
(4) Abatement after Notice. If the
inspecting officer determines that a public
nuisance exists on private premises but that
such nuisance does not threaten great and
immediate danger to the public health,
safety, peace, morals, or decency, he or she
shall serve notice on the person causing or
maintaining the nuisance to remove the
same within ten (10) days. If such nuisance
is not removed within ten (10) days, the
proper officer shall cause the nuisance to be
removed as provided in Section 11.36 (2).
(5) Other Methods Not Excluded.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as
prohibiting the abatement of public
nuisances by the Village or its officials in
accordance with the laws of the state.
Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 21 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
(6) Court Order. Except when
necessary under Section 11.36 (2), an officer
hereunder shall not use force to obtain
access to private property to abate a public
nuisance, but shall request permission to
enter upon private property if such premises
are occupied and if such permission is
denied, shall apply to any court having
jurisdiction for an order assisting the
abatement of the public nuisance.
11.37 COST OF ABATEMENT.
In addition to any other penalty imposed by
this section for the erection, contrivance,
creation, continuance, or maintenance of a
public nuisance, the cost of abating a public
nuisance by the Village shall be collected as
a debt from the owner, occupant, or person
causing, permitting, or maintaining the
nuisance; and if notice to abate the nuisance
has been given to the owner, such costs shall
be assessed against the real estate as a
special charge.

warrant alarm for the safety of persons or
property in the vicinity. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in

warranted is the fact that the person takes
flight upon appearance of a police or peace
officer, refuses to identify himself or herself
or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself
or herself or any object. Unless flight by the
person or other circumstances makes it
impracticable, a police officer or peace
officer shall, prior to any arrest for an
offense under this subsection, afford the
person an opportunity to dispel any alarm
which would otherwise be warranted by
requesting him or her to identify himself or
herself and explain his or her presence and
conduct. No person shall be convicted of an
offense under this subsection if the police or
peace officer did not comply with the
preceding sentence or if it appears at trial
that the explanation given by the person was
true and, if believed by the police or peace
officer at the time, would have dispelled the

§961.32 or Wis. Stats. §961.335 shall be a

11.78 POSSESSION/USE OF
TOBACCO AND VAPOR PRODUCTS
BY MINORS.
(1) Statement of Purpose.
(a) The purpose of this section is to
protect the public health, safety and welfare
of the property and persons in the Village of
Suamico by prohibiting persons under
eighteen (18) years of age from possessing
tobacco products and vapor products, and
prohibiting the sale of tobacco products and
vapor products to persons under eighteen
(18) years of age.
(b) Persons under age eighteen (18) are
prohibited by law from purchasing or
possessing cigarettes and other tobacco
products, and retailers are prohibited from
selling them to minors. There are new
tobacco-less products, however, commonly
referred to as "electronic cigarettes," "ecigarettes,"
"e-cigars," "e-cigarillos," "epipes,"
"e-hookahs," or "electronic nicotine
delivery systems," which allow the user to
simulate cigarette smoking. These products
may be purchased by minors and are being
marketed without age restrictions or health
warnings and come in different flavors that
appeal to young people.
(c) E-cigarettes, and similar devices, are
a relatively new nicotine delivery system.
While devices vary in their appearance and
specific method of operation, they have a
few basic elements in common. A solution
of water, dissolved nicotine, and other
ingredients (usually flavoring) is heated with
a heating element (usually battery-powered).
This vaporizes the nicotine solution, which
passes into a mouthpiece and is inhaled in a
manner similar to cigarette smoking. Often,
glycerol or propylene glycol is added to the
solution to give the appearance of smoke
when the solution is vaporized. The
concentration of nicotine contained in the
solution can be customized by the retailer to
the buyer's specifications, and many
manufacturers make nicotine-free solutions.
(d) The production and distribution of ecigarettes
is not currently regulated by
federal or state authorities, and the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has not
completed testing of these products. But,
initial studies by the FDA have determined
that e-cigarettes can increase nicotine
Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 31 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
addiction among young people and contain
chemical ingredients known to be harmful,
which may expose users and the public to
potential health risks.
(e) The use of e-cigarettes and similar
devices has increased significantly in recent
years.
(f) Existing studies on electronic
smoking devices' vapor emissions and
cartridge contents have found a number of
dangerous substances including:
1. Chemicals known to cause cancer
such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, lead,
nickel and chromium;
2. PM 2.5 , acrolein, tin, toluene, and
aluminum, which are associated with a
range of negative health effects such as skin,
eye, and respiratory irritation, neurological
effects, damage to reproductive systems, and
even premature death from heart attacks and
stroke.
(g) Some cartridges used by electronic
smoking devices can be refilled with liquid
nicotine solution, creating the potential for
exposure to dangerous concentrations of
nicotine.
(h) Clinical studies about the safety and
efficacy of these products have not been
submitted to the FDA for the over four
hundred (400) brands of electronic smoking
devices that are on the market and for this
reason, consumers have no way of knowing
whether electronic smoking devices are safe,
what types of potentially harmful chemicals
the products contain, and what dose of
nicotine the products deliver.
(i) Electronic smoking devices often
mimic conventional tobacco products in
shape, size, and color, with the user exhaling
a smoke-like vapor similar in appearance to
the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other
conventional tobacco products.
(j) The use of electronic smoking
devices in smoke-free locations threatens to
undermine compliance with smoking
regulations and reverses the progress that
has been made in establishing a social norm
that smoking is not permitted in public
places and places of employment.
(k) It is the intent of the Suamico
Village Board, in enacting the ordinance
codified in this section, to provide for the
public health, safety and welfare by
facilitating uniform and consistent
enforcement of smoke-free air laws; by
reducing the potential for re-normalizing
smoking in public places and places of
employment; by reducing the potential for
children to associate the use of electronic
smoking devices with a normative or healthy
lifestyle; and by prohibiting the sale or
distribution of electronic smoking devices to
minors.
(l) Therefore, the Suamico Village
Board determines that prohibiting the sale,
giving, or furnishing of e-cigarettes to
minors and prohibiting the purchase,
possession, or use of e-cigarettes by minors
is in the Villages best interest and will
promote public health, safety, and welfare.
(2) Definitions. For the purpose of
construction and application of this section,
the following definitions shall apply:
(a) Law Enforcement Officer. The
meaning given in Wis. Stats.§30.50(4s).

part, of the retail sale of vapor products.
(e) Possession of a Tobacco Product.

simulate smoking in the delivery of nicotine
or any other substance through inhalation of
vapor from the product. Electronic delivery
device shall include any component part of
such a product whether or not sold
separately. Electronic delivery device shall
not include any product that has been
approved or otherwise certified by the
United States Food and Drug Administration
for legal sales for use in tobacco cessation
treatment or other medical purposes, and is
being marketed and sold solely for that

11.81 JUVENILE CURFEWS.
(1) Legislative Purpose. Pursuant to
Sec. 59.54 (6), Wis. Stats., 1995-1996, the
Suamico Board has determined that there
has been an increase in juvenile violence,
juvenile gang activity and crime by persons
under the age of seventeen (17) in the

perpetrators of crime. The Village of
Suamico has an obligation to provide for the
protection of minors from each other and
from other persons, for the enforcement of
parental control over the responsibility for
children, for the protection of the general
public, and for the reduction of the incidence
of juvenile criminal activities, and a
nighttime curfew for those under the age of
seventeen (17) will be in the interest of the
public health, safety, and general welfare

11.126 CHILD PROTECTION
RESTRICTIONS.
(1) Findings and Intent.
(a) Repeat sexual offenders, sexual
offenders who use physical violence, and
sexual offenders who prey on children are
sexual predators who present an extreme
threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders
are extremely likely to use physical violence
and to repeat their offenses; and most sexual
offenders commit many offenses, have many
more victims that are never reported, and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their
crimes. This makes the cost of sexual
offender victimization to society at large,
while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
(b) It is the intent of this ordinance not
to impose a criminal penalty but rather to
serve the Villages compelling interest to
promote, protect, and improve the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
Village by creating areas around locations
where children regularly congregate in
concentrated numbers wherein certain
sexual offenders and sexual predators are
prohibited from establishing temporary or
permanent residence. Due to the high rate
of recidivism, and the unpredictability and
severity of these crimes, it is the intent of
this ordinance to limit the availability of
situations where the potential for such
Village of Suamico
11-Public Nuisances Page 44 of 55 Adopted 1-21-08
crimes is increased in the interest of
protecting the children of our community.

terms, and phrases, when used in this
ordinance, shall have the meanings ascribed

SUBCHAPTER II  HOUSE/BUILDING
NUMBERING
16.20 SYSTEM ESTABLISHED. There
is hereby established a uniform system of
numbering houses and buildings fronting on
all streets, avenues, and public ways in the
Village, and all houses and buildings shall
be numbered in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance.
16.21 BASE LINES ESTABLISHED.
Lineville Road, 1825, shall constitute the
base line for numbering along all streets
running north and south, and Bayside Road,
650, shall constitute the base line for
numbering all streets running east and west.
16.22 CONSISTENCY WITH VILLAGE
OF HOWARD. The numbering for each
street and occupancy will begin off of base
lines and for all intensive purposes and
when possible will be consistent with the
Village of Howard. The north and south
base line will be Lineville Road on the south
and 1825 will be the lowest north-south
number. The east and west base line will be
north-south line extending through Bayside
Road. The east-west reference will be 650.
To be consistent with the adjoining Village
of Howard, there will be five hundred
twenty-five (525) numbers per mile. The
one (1) exception to the north-south base
will be Velp Avenue because of the existing
numbers south of Lineville Road. A one (1)
will prefix the north-south base on Velp
Avenue or the base number will be 11825.
Every one quarter (¼) mile from the section
line will have approximately one hundred
thirty (130) numbers (sixty-five (65) per
side). Circle streets will be numbered based
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 14 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
on the direction of travel from entrance to
exit from section lines.

ASSIGNMENTS. All lots and houses on
the south and west side of all streets shall be
numbered with odd numbers, and all lots
and houses on the north and east side of all
streets shall be numbered with even
numbers, each commencing with the one
hundred (100) assigned to that block. Circle
streets will remain odd and even based on
where they begin.
16.24 CORNER LOTS. All lots fronting
on two (2) streets shall have an address
assigned to the street less traveled as
determined by the Building Inspection
Department. The Building Inspector shall
have the authority to change the street
assignment based on the information
submitted with the building permit.
Duplexes shall have one (1) address on each
of the streets.
16.25 BUILDINGS WITH SEPARATE
OCCUPANTS. Where any building has
more than one (1) door serving separate
occupants, a separate number shall be
assigned to each door serving a separate
occupant. Buildings fronting on two (2) or
more streets shall have a number fronting on
the main entrance, unless other entrances
serve other occupants.
16.26 RELATIVE NUMBERS. All
streets not extending through to the base line
shall be assigned the same relative numbers
as if the said street had extended to the said
base line.
16.27 FURNISHING/PLACEMENT OF
NUMBERS.
(1) The Board has caused a survey to be
made and there is hereby assigned to each
house and building located on any street,
alley, highway, or avenue in the said Village

1998, after the effective date of this
ordinance, the Village shall place or cause to
be placed for each existing house or building
that exists prior to August 1, 1997, the
number or numbers assigned under the
uniform system provided for in this
ordinance.
The original costs of such numbers and
pole shall be paid for by Village tax and said
numbers and pole shall be furnished by the
Village. Subsequently applied for numbers
and pole will be paid for as part of the
building permit. Effective May 31, 1998,
after placement of numbers and pole by the
Village, it shall be the responsibility of the
owner or occupant to maintain said numbers
and pole at the owners or occupants

SUBCHAPTER III  DESIGN REVIEW
STANDARDS
16.35 DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS
FOR COMMERCIAL, MULTIFAMILY,
AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
(1) Design Review Authority.
(a) The Village Design Review
Standards are adopted pursuant to the
authorization contained in Wis. Stat. §61.35,
§62.23, and §61.34.
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 16 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
(b) The review duties included in this
ordinance are delegated by the Suamico
Board to the Design Review Committee.
(2) Statement of Intent.
(a) To encourage growth and
development which is consistent with
maintaining rural design character and
protects and enhances the Villages rural
appeal for citizen and visitor use and
enjoyment and protect against development
which uses standard urban and suburban
design approaches.
(b) To implement the goals and policies
of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. To
safeguard property values, protect public
and private investments and promote highquality
commercial, multifamily, and
industrial development which is consistent
with rural character.
(c) To safeguard property values,
protect the public and private investments
and promote high-quality commercial,
multifamily, and industrial development
which is consistent with rural character.
(d) To develop and apply Design
Review Standards which do not overly
restrict innovation and variety, but are
intended to facilitate and assist in focusing
on design practices which result in
development which sustain a positive rural
design character.
(e) To protect against the problem of
highway strip commercial development and
to encourage well-designed highway
clustered commercial development.
(f) To have a minimum number of
prescriptive standards and a maximum
number of performance standards to allow
flexibility in maintaining or enhancing rural
character with new development.
1. Performance Standards. Encourage
flexibility and innovation of design in which
more than one (1) solution is acceptable.
The proposals, however, must meet the
range of positive photo examples,
performance strategy for natural and cultural
resources and the criteria listed for each of
the relevant Design Review Standards.
2. Prescriptive Standards. Dictate a
specific type of design condition which is a
requirement that is deemed necessary to
meet rural character.
(g) To encourage landscape design
which compliments the natural landscape,
improves the general appearance of the
Village and utilizes locally native plant
species.
(h) To protect adjacent landowners from
adverse or inappropriate aesthetic impact
problems of new development which is not
consistent with rural design character.
(i) To establish a formal review process,
which includes appropriate criteria for
design review related to new or remodeled
buildings, site protection, landscaping and
site development.
(j) To maintain the appearance of design
approved developments throughout the
entire life of the development.
(3) Applicability.
(a) The provisions of this ordinance are
a furtherance of the land use and
development controls of land in the Village.
(b) All new commercial, multifamily,
and industrial development within the
Village is subject to design review. New
development includes one (1) or more of the
following types of development; building,
landscaping, signage, or parking areas.
Landscaping is subject to design review
when new buildings, exterior alterations,
signage or parking is proposed. New
development does not include landscaping
for minor additions to existing landscaping.
(c) Design review approval is required
prior to the issuance of a building permit for
new commercial, multifamily, and industrial
development or for exterior wall and roof
alterations to existing commercial,
multifamily, and industrial development not
previously subject to design review.
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 17 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
(d) Design review approval is required
for exterior wall and roof alterations to
existing commercial, multifamily, and
industrial development which had not
previously been subject to design review.
Painting and the replacement of roofing are
not considered design alterations if earth
tone colors are used.
(4) Design Review Standards.
(a) Performance Strategy for Natural
Resource Design Review. Natural resources
are significant in maintaining high quality
aesthetic character for the Village. The
Villages desired future condition for
commercial, multifamily, and industrial
development, is to locate and design new
development which respects sensitive
natural resources and places the
development within or visually related to a
forested or wetland setting in which the new
development visually compliments the
overall naturalness. This is contrasted by
development which dominates the setting
and appears inconsistent with Suamicos
rural character.
(b) Performance Strategy for Cultural
Resource Design Review. A range of
development types (buildings/parking) is
acceptable if they are sensitive to the
Villages natural resources and contribute to
the stated desirable living conditionsuncongested
living; beauty, peace, and
quiet; unspoiled rural atmosphere; lack of
commercialism; a close friendly community
feeling. There is not one (1) architectural
style or overall historic setting which always
needs to be met. However, the desired
future condition for new development is to
fit into the existing rural character through
building design and the use of materials,
colors, landscaping, and signage which
compliment naturalness, open space, a clean
appearance and maintain visual order.
In applying the standards and strategies,
the applicant has the burden of showing that
the proposed development contains the
necessary design qualities which will meet
the Natural and Cultural Resource Strategies
Design Standards while providing a
sustainable positive rural character.
(5) Open Space/Natural Resources
Design Standards. The intent of this
section is to ensure that adequate open space
and natural resources are incorporated into
design solutions to provide an overall
appearance of rural character.
(a) Where open space, natural
resources, or topographic patterns contribute
to the beauty and utility of the area, they
shall be incorporated into the design of the
new development.
(b) Minimum green space which is
required to be maintained on a given parcel
shall typically be thirty percent (30%).
However, its location and quality in which
the green space is incorporated into the
design of the development may allow
reduction of that to twenty-five percent
(25%). Combining of areas/parcels will be
considered in the overall green space
provided they are under the same ownership
and development is accruing on all parcels
or in the same planned development overlay.
(c) To the extent possible, existing
topographic grades will be incorporated into
the design. However, when grading or
contouring the site, the finished grades
should appear naturally to the site and
surrounding area, protect the natural
resources and adjacent properties.
(d) Roadside trees are very important to
the rural character of the community and
shall be incorporated into the site plan if at
all possible.
(e) Waterfront development needs to be
especially sensitive to water quality and
riparian vegetation management. The
design emphasis needs to demonstrate the
maximum protection of the natural shoreline
along with transition area forest
preservation. A minimum amount of
impervious development, along with a
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 18 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
minimum level of lawn area, would best
meet the environmental and aesthetic
qualities of rural character.
(6) Existing Built Environment
Design Standards. The intent is to
maintain the existing built environment
which respects the design review standards
and use these examples to serve as a base
from which appropriate design solutions are
proposed for commercial, multifamily, and
industrial development.
(a) Existing development can serve as a
justification for new development only to
the extent that the existing development
meets the Design Review Standards.
(b) Existing development which does
not meet the Design Review Standards is
encouraged to make changes towards the
approved standards. However, this
ordinance does not require changes unless
the existing development meets the
conditions in Section 16.35 (3).
(7) Relationship of Building to Site
Design Standards. The intent of this
section is to incorporate into a site plan the
design standards for commercial,
multifamily, and industrial development. In
particular, the site plan should integrate
natural resources, buildings, parking, and
landscaping into a functional and aesthetic
solution which respects desired rural
character.
(a) The areas of green space must be
located to provide resource protection,
transitions between adjacent sites and as a
visual transition between the public roads
and the building or parking lot.
(b) The arrangement of all functions,
uses, and improvements must be designed to
reflect positive rural characteristics.
(c) Where appropriate, the design
solution should incorporate existing natural
features such as forested areas, streams,
wetlands, and topography.
(d) The size, shape, scale, and location
of the structure(s) need to be architecturally
compatible with the existing site features.
(e) Where appropriate, the site design
needs to integrate the proposed
landscaping/open space into the adjacent
landscaping, open space or forested area.
(f) All mechanical equipment (HVAC,
exhaust fans, etc.) shall be shielded from
view by the use of fencing, landscaping, or
possibly matching paint on roof top units.
Other solutions may be considered.
(g) Place underground all newly
installed utility services and service
revisions necessitated by exterior alterations.
(h) Landscape buffers will be required
between all commercial and residentially
zoned properties. Buffers may consist of:
1. A twenty foot (20) wide area with a
variety of evergreen and deciduous trees and
shrubs.
2. A berm and fence with plantings.
3. A berm with hedge type plantings.
4. Other solutions as determined
appropriate by the committee.
(i) Parking areas need to be carefully
designated to fit the site and with sensitivity
to location, size, and perimeter screening.
This is especially critical if the Village is to
maintain rural character rather than an urban
community appearance. The Committee
will review parking area site design
performance which includes the following:
1. In cases where quality forestland
exists, existing trees are preserved between
the parking area and the right-of-way.
2. The location of the parking areas
relative to the public roads and buildings
should be placed at the side or rear of the
building and away from direct public view.
3. When options of side yard and rear
yard parking do not exist, front yard parking
(between the building and public road) will
require an effective landscape setback which
includes extensive landscaping.
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 19 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
4. Parking areas with ten (10) or more
spaces will require perimeter landscaping to
visually reduce the adverse parking area
impacts.
(j) New developments with large
parking space requirements will need to
demonstrate that they will not provide an
urban parking lot appearance. This will
require design attention which locates the
parking in the least visual impact area,
includes extensive perimeter landscaping,
interior plant islands, maintains existing
vegetation where appropriate and
incorporates several smaller parking areas to
meet parking space requirements.
Landscape islands shall be incorporated into
all parking areas in excess of ten thousand
(10,000) square feet. Required islands shall
be a minimum of ten percent (10%) of total
parking area.
(k) Trash receptacles shall be kept in
enclosures constructed of the same materials
as the main structure. Enclosures shall be
large enough to conceal trash from view.
(8) Building Design Standards. The
intent is to not restrict developments to a
predetermined architectural style. However,
for approval, new developments must meet
the design standards by clearly
demonstrating how the building design
maintains or enhances rural character. The
building design must avoid presenting an
appearance of either monotonous similarity
or excessive dissimilarity with appropriate
existing structures. The building standards
are intended to prevent these extremes.
(a) Architectural style is not restricted.
However, extremes of style which do not fit
rural character are to be avoided.
(b) Building architecture needs to
compliment, rather than dominate the rural
character setting of the Village, such as:
1. Wood, brick, stone, and other
natural materials are strongly preferred.
2. Earth tone colors are strongly
preferred and color accents must be visually
compatible.
3. Roofs with darker earth tone colors
are expected.
4. Buildings which maintain colors,
style, and setting of an earlier era will be
considered.
(c) All sides of a structure shall receive
full design consideration. A facade
unrelated to the rest of the building is not in
keeping with acceptable design.
(d) All visually pitched roofs shall have
a minimum of a six inch (6) fascia.
(e) All projections and mechanical
details such as louvers, exposed flashing,
flues, vents, gutters, and downspouts are to
be recognized as architectural features and
shall be treated to match the color of the
adjacent surface or an approved
complimentary color.
(f) The design must avoid a monolithic
(big box) appearance of frontages and
rooflines. The large box massing of such
a structure must be diminished by breaking
up building sections or by the use of such
elements as variable planes, projections,
bays, dormers, setbacks or changes in
roofline.
(g) If the project is likely to become a
Village landmark, or if it is in a visually
prominent area or if it is located so as to
become part of the Villages gateway, the
design must acknowledge the special impact
the project would have on the entire
community by addressing the design
solution in an exemplary manner.
(h) The signage and lighting fixtures
must be compatible with the architectural
design.
(i) The clustering of smaller, visually
compatible, commercial structures is desired
over singular large structures.
(j) In very limited situations, smaller
isolated retail buildings may contrast in
color (i.e., white) or style (English Tudor) or
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 20 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
theme (Christmas House) with the more
dominant rural character expectation.
However, in these limited situations, the
applicant must explain why these design
expressions are essential to their business
and demonstrate that the new development
will:
1. Include a landscaped backdrop or
become part of a rural setting.
2. Include well maintained landscaping.
3. Be visually separated from other
areas (i.e., not part of visually continuous
highway development pattern).
4. Be a very small structure and present
a cottage-like appearance.
(k) New building development must
avoid:
1. The look of franchise architecture.
2. Buildings which advertise by
appearance (i.e., storage buildings).
3. Buildings which demand visual
attention through the use of bold colors and
materials which are not found to be positive
in meeting rural character.
4. Buildings in commercial or industrial
areas with the appearance of large metal
buildings which lack design details or are
otherwise without the positive attributes of
rural character.
5. The appearance of the big box
visual character.
(9) Landscaping Design Standards.
The intent is to provide a landscape design
which preserves existing natural vegetation
and incorporates additional locally native
plants which compliment the plant
communities and ecosystem of the area.
The aesthetic intent is to improve the
appearance of all areas through
incorporating green space into the
development in ways that harmonize and
enhance the natural as well as the manmade
environment and respect the principles of
naturalistic landscaping. The design review
plan should indicate:
(a) A dominant visual character for the
landscape design which maintains or creates
a strong appearance of rural character. It
should avoid a design concept which creates
a suburban or urban visual character.
(b) The size, species, and location of
plant materials to be retained or placed on
the site.
(c) Areas to remain in natural state
shall be identified on the site plan. All other
areas shall be properly maintained as
designated on the plan.
(d) The percentage of the site which will
be maintained in green space and the green
space setback distance between the highway
property line and the building and/or parking
lot.
(e) As appropriate, planting concepts
which meet the needs of front yard
plantings, building entry plantings, building
corner plantings, larger parking lot interior
plantings, plantings related to signage and
buffer plantings at the property edge which
effectively screen within three (3) years
what the Committee deems incompatible
land uses.
(f) The planted size of shade trees
should be not less than one inch (1)
diameter (measured six inches (6) above
ground) and eight feet (8) in height;
conifers (evergreen trees) should be at least
four feet (4) in height. Shrubs should be of
good nursery stock and provide effective
landscape development within three (3)
years of planting.
(g) Plant material which provides
interest in structure, texture, color, and its
ultimate growth pattern. Trees and shrubs
which are exotic cultivars and provide
highly showy aesthetic patterns, such as red
or bronze summer foliage or variegated leaf
patterns, are to be avoided.
(h) Plants which are native to the area
and provide a rural appearance:

designer that the variety fits well with the
landscape design.
(10) Exterior Lighting Design
Standards. The intent of the exterior
lighting design standards are to provide the
necessary lighting which reflects rural
character by intensity, location, placement,
color, and overall design integration with the
total development, rather than lighting
which is typical of urban conditions.
(a) All exterior lighting should balance
onsite needs of safety, security, and aesthetic
affects, without adverse effect upon
neighborhood properties, especially
residential property.
(b) All exterior lighting shall be part of
the architectural and landscape design
concept in color, location, and type of
lighting.
(c) In general, the height of exterior
lighting fixtures shall not exceed the height
of the building to which it relates. Parking
lot lights shall not exceed twenty-five feet
(25) tall and would typically be of the sharp
cut-off type. All service wall packs shall be
shielded or directed downward.
(d) The height, location, and direction
of lighting must be designed and located
such a manner as to be shielded from the
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 23 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
direct view of the highway user and shielded
above to reduce night sky illumination.
(e) Sign lighting concepts which
provide direct illumination from a shielded
light source, rather than interior sign lighting
are preferred.
(11) Signage Design Standards. The
intent is to encourage creative, distinct, and
effective signs which are appropriate for the
individual proprietors, yet meet the
community design standards for rural
character and promote a positive signage
image. The design standards are intended to
foster signage which respects the residential,
rural, and scenic open space character of the
Village. Sign design review is limited to the
aesthetic and appropriateness of sign
appearance and is separate from the
conditions included in the Villages sign
ordinance. The following concepts and
standards will be used to review signs for
design approval:
(a) Identification of businesses from
moving cars must be balanced with the
visual impact of signs on the rural
landscape. Restraint in site design can aid in
identification. Since small, simple signs
identify business with less confusion,
limiting counterproductive sign competition
protects the quality of the landscape.
(b) Every sign shall be designed as an
integral architectural element of the building
and site to which it principally relates and
where appropriate to rural character, shall be
compatible with signs on adjoining premises
and not compete for attention.
1. Sign Type. The first (1st) step in site
design is selecting the most appropriate type
of sign. The three (3) most common types
of signs are wall signs, projecting signs, and
free standing signs. The choice of sign type
depends upon the surroundings and the
attention one desires to attract. For
example, free standing signs are best used in
situations where there is a large setback
from the road, where the attention of people
in fast-moving vehicles is being sought, or
where there are several uses in one (1)
building or complex. Projecting signs and
wall signs are best used where the attention
of people in slow-moving vehicles or
pedestrians is desired. Free standing style
signs are preferred and elevated free
standing signs are discouraged.
2. Sign Message. Whatever sign type is
used, simplicity is the key factor to good
design and readability. An effectively
designed sign utilizing bold, easilyrecognized
symbols and clear crisp lettering
will identify a business or activity efficiently
and attractively, enhance the area in which it
is located and compliment the general
appearance of the Village. Pictures and
symbols can add individuality and character
to signs in addition to making them easier to
read. The most common problems in
commercial areas are an overabundance of
signs that are often excessively large, all of
which contributes to sign overload. This
creates a visually chaotic situation in which
no one (1) sign gains the advantage, since
the competing signs tend to cancel each
other out in an unsuccessful bid to catch the
buyers eye.
3. Sign Color. Restraint should be
exercised when selecting colors. On most
signs, no more than three (3) colors should
be used; one (1) for background (preferably
dark), a contrasting color for the lettering
and a third (3rd) color perhaps for emphasis
(such as for borders, motifs, or shading
lettering to give it a three-dimensional look).
Exceptions occur when an illustration is
incorporated in the sign. In such cases, it is
important that complimentary colors be
used. In selecting the principle colors for a
sign, colors which compliment the general
tone of the building as needed.
4. Sign Materials. Signs made of wood
or other natural materials are preferred.
Bases of free standing signs shall be of like
materials to the building.
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 24 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
5. Signage Landscaping. Free standing
signs will generally require low and medium
height plants to provide a positive design
appearance for the sign and site appearance.
6. Master Sign Plan. When more than
one (1) sign is proposed for a parcel, the
applicant must submit for approval all of the
proposed and existing signage. The intent is
to develop and follow a coordinated sign
plan with regard to:
a. Color scheme.
b. Lettering or graphic style.
c. Lighting.
d. Location on each building or the site.
e. Signage material.
f. Sign proportions.
(12) Relationship to Adjacent Sites
Design Standards. The intent of this
section is to achieve design appearance
compatibility among separate individually
owned parcels which visually appear as one
(1) continuous development. The applicant
has the burden of clearly demonstrating how
the proposed project has the aesthetic
qualities to meet the visually continuous
compatibility test. Design solutions might
include:
(a) Proposing a building which is
similar, or compatible, in design style,
materials, color, and landscaping with the
adjacent development which meets the
intent of positive rural character.
(b) Situations in which the architectural
expressions are different and yet acceptable
to the standards, strive for a strong
landscape transition between properties
using trees and shrubs or existing natural
vegetation which reduces the visual
dominance of the buildings.
(c) Situations in which the land uses are
incompatible or the adjacent development is
below the minimum standards for rural
character. In this case, the new development
should develop a landscape plan or utilize
existing vegetation to fully buffer the
adjacent property from view.
(d) Project features which are judged to
have negative visual impacts upon adjacent
properties, such as parking lots, service
entrances, loading zones, mechanical
equipment, and storage areas, shall be
buffered from view of adjacent properties.
(13) Application, Appeal, Completion,
and Performance Assurance. The
applicant must obtain a copy of this
document and review the Design
Assessment Photos for both positive and
negative examples of rural development
character. The photos are available for
review at the Village Hall or as directed.
(a) Application Process.
1. Applicants must submit a completed
application and eight (8) copies of the
required information listed in Section 6 to
the Zoning Administrator fourteen (14) days
before the regularly scheduled public
meeting of the Committee.
2. The Committee has forty-five (45)
days from the time a completed application
is received to act on the application. A
completed application must respond to all of
the appropriate requirements of this
ordinance. Failure to approve/deny the
application in the required time will result in
the automatic design approval of the project
as submitted. However, the Committee may
elect to defer official action which goes
beyond thirty (30) days, if more information
is needed and the applicant agrees to the
extension.
3. The applicant must be available to
present and explain how the project meets
the design conditions of rural character. The
Committee reviews the materials and
approves as presented, approves it with
conditions, or denies the applicants project
proposal.
(b) Appeal Process. The intent is to
reach design review agreement between the
applicant and the Committee. In the event
that the applicant finds the decision or action
inappropriate, an appeal may be taken to the
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 25 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
Board. Such an appeal shall be initiated by
a written request to be placed on the Board
agenda for consideration. The appeal must
include the action being questioned and the
specific grounds upon which the appeal is
made. Such request must be received by the
Board no later than thirty (30) days after the
date of denial. The Board shall conduct a
review and within thirty (30) days make a
finding which either affirms, affirms with
conditions, reverses or reverses with
conditions. The finding by the Board shall
be final, subject to judicial review.
(c) Completion Requirement. The
applicant must begin, and substantially
complete, an approved project within two
(2) years from the date of final approval. If
the project is not completed within the
required time, the design review approval
expires.
(d) Performance Assurance.
1. Landscaping or other site
improvement required pursuant to an
approved design review plan shall be
installed prior to the issuance of Certificate
of Occupancy or final inspection, unless the
property owner submits a performance
assurance device, equal to ten percent (10%)
of construction costs, committing the
installation of landscaping or other site
improvement within nine (9) months. In no
case shall the property owner delay
completion for more than nine (9) months
from occupancy.
2. Performance assurance devices shall
take the form of one (1) of the following:
a. Cash.
b. An irrevocable letter of credit, the
form of which is approved by the Village
Board, from a financial institution stating
that the money is held for the purpose of
development of the landscaping or other
specified site improvements.
3. If a performance assurance device is
employed, the property owner shall provide
the Village with a non-revocable notarized
agreement granting the Village and its
agents the right to enter the property and
perform any required work remaining
undone at the expiration of the assurance
device.
4. If the property owner fails to carry
out provisions of the agreement and the
Village has reimbursable costs or expenses
resulting from such failure, the Village shall
call on the performance device for
reimbursement. If the amount of the
performance device exceeds the cost and
expense incurred by the Village, the
property owner shall be liable to the Village
for the difference.
5. The Committee may elect to require a
performance device prior to issuance of a
building permit in situations in which
extensive landscaping is needed, locations
are deemed visually sensitive or where there
is a poor history of compliance.
(14) Submission Requirements. The
intent of this section is to provide the
Committee with sufficient information to
make an informed design review decision
and maintain a clear record of the decision.
(a) Required Documents.
1. A completed application form
supplied by the Village.
2. As appropriate, drawings and other
documentation which illustrates in scale and
relationship to project components, the
features of the design. This must be
documented in a manner which can be
clearly understood by the Committee. The
determination of necessary documentation
will be established by the Committee.
3. A site plan and specifications are
required which contain the following
information (this may require a separate site
plan, landscape plan and architectural plan):
a. Scale (i.e. one (1) inch=twenty feet
(20) and north arrow.

p. Provisions for handicapped persons
under requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
q. Stormwater containment/detention.
4. Elevations. Complete exterior
elevations of all proposed buildings and

d. Designation of the type of material
and color to be used on the exterior.
5. Material samples need to be
presented at the Committee meeting,
including color and material type for walls
and roof.
(b) Discretionary Information. In some
situations, less information may be required
than indicated in Section 16.14 (13) (a).
However, in situations where developments
are large or complex, or are in
environmentally sensitive areas, or are in
visually sensitive areas, it will require
additional submission material to provide
the Committee with a complete
understanding of the nature of the proposed
project. This may include, but is not limited
to:
1. Site photographs depicting the site
and its relationship to adjoining sites.
2. A landscape plan showing all existing
natural land features, trees, forest cover, and
water sources, plus all proposed changes to
these features including size and type of
plant material. Water sources will include
ponds, lakes, streams, wetlands, floodplains,
and drainage retention/detention areas.
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 27 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
3. Sites with steep slopes or unique
natural features may require mapped
contours at two foot (2) intervals.
4. Location and species of trees and the
condition for forested areas undergoing new
development.
5. Architectural renderings of
preservations and elevations in full color.
(15) Relationship to Other
Ordinances. The intent of the Design
Review Standards Ordinance is to have full
support, cross-listing and integration among
the appropriate Village codes. This is
especially important among the
Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning
Ordinance.
(a) Nothing included in this ordinance
shall supplant, alter, replace, or amend in
any way existing zoning requirements, sign
requirements, construction codes, or other
criteria as established by the Village for
purposes of zoning, signage, and building
permit application.
(b) In the event of any changes,
alterations, or deviation from the projects
initial design review approval during the
state application process, or thereafter, such
changes must be resubmitted to the
Committee for design review
reconsideration and, as necessary, reapproval.
(16) Maintaining Approved Design
Conditions. The intent of the appropriate
design review elements of natural resources,
site design, building design, landscaping,
lighting, and signage is that they will be
maintained in a continued good appearance
to sustain an overall high quality rural
character. However, even the best initial
designs can be compromised by improper
and inadequate maintenance. Such
maintenance problems decrease property
values and provide negative impact on the
entire Village. Therefore, it is a necessary
function of design review to be concerned
about continuing maintenance. For some
design elements it will start with the
selection of appropriate materials which can
sustain the weather and low to moderate
levels of maintenance. For other design
elements, annual design maintenance will be
essential. For still others, such as landscape
plants, careful maintenance is essential and
with plant failure, it will be necessary to
replace dead trees and shrubs. The
accumulation of debris, trash, and rubbish
needs to be avoided.
Developments which receive design
approval are expected to continue to
maintain, or improve, the property
appearance as judged by the design review
criteria throughout the active life of the
development including: short-term,
seasonal, or long-term closure. It is within
the responsibilities of the Villages design
review authority to ensure the maintenance
of approved design conditions.
(17) Enforcement. The Zoning
Administrator, under the authority of the
Board, shall be the enforcing official. The
penalty for violating any portion of this
ordinance will be as approved from time to
time by resolution of the Board.
(18) Definitions. Unless specifically
defined elsewhere in the Design Review
Standards Chapter, definitions are provided
to clarify the following commonly used
terms:
(a) Appearance. The outward aspects
of the development which are visible to the
public and adjacent properties.
(b) Architectural Compatibility. The
aesthetic design of a building or group of
buildings which includes the site design,
landscape development, and signage which
meets the conditions of the rural character

present a large monolithic appearance of
frontages and rooflines and otherwise lack
the various planes, projections, bays,
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 28 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
dormers, setbacks, and rooflines to provide
pedestrian scale design for onsite users and
appropriate rural character.
(d) Buffer Plantings. An area of land
identified on a site plan in which
landscaping is used to provide a transition
between use areas to effectively reduce the
environmental, aesthetic, and other impacts
of one (1) type of land use upon another.
(e) Citizen-Based. A process of
decision-making in which citizens and
committee members decide what is
appropriate in determining rural character
design standards.
(f) Committee. Suamico Design Review
Committee.
(g) Clustered Highway Commercial. A
development pattern in which uses,
buildings, and parking are grouped or
clustered rather than spread evenly along
highways.
(h) Commercial Development. For the
purposes of this ordinance, it includes the
full range of uses identified under all
business, commercial, and public zonings.
(i) Design Assessment Photos. These
are citizen photos which illustrate positive
and negative design for architecture,
signage, landscaping, and natural features
and are approved as representative examples
of development that either contributes
towards or detracts from rural character.
(j) Design Review Standards. A series
of design activities, listed under Section 7,
which describe the standards by which new
development will be judged for
appropriateness in meeting rural character.
(k) Design Review Standards
Committee. A committee established by the
Board to conduct assigned responsibilities in
land use planning which includes design
review.
(l) Design Review Vocabulary. A
combination of photos and text which
communicates citizen design expectations
for new development.
(m) Forestland. The existing native
plant community which includes trees,
shrubs, and ground cover.
(n) Franchise Architecture. Buildings
which follow the prototypical corporate
design standards and present an appearance.
(o) Franchise Sign. Signs which adhere
to prototypical corporate design standards
and are expected to be the same for urban
and rural settings.
(p) Industrial Development. The full
range of industrial land uses recognized in

public support and the location and
identification of historic sites, historic
structures, and historic districts. The duties
of the Commission shall be as follows.
(a) Designation. Upon request of the
property owner, the Commission shall have
the power, subject to Section 16.40 (6),
below, to designate historic structures and
historic sites and to recommend designation
of historic districts within the Village limits.
Such designations shall be made based on
Section 16.40 (4) above. Historic districts
shall be approved by the Board. Once
designated, such historic structures, sites and
districts shall be subject to all the provisions
of this ordinance.
(b) Regulation of Construction,
Reconstruction, Alteration, and Demolition.
1. No owner or person in charge of a
historic structure, historic site or structure
within a historic district shall reconstruct,
alter or demolish all or any part of the
exterior of such property or construct any
improvement. Upon such designated
property or properties or cause or permit any
such work to be performed upon such
property to demolish such property unless a
Certificate of Appropriateness (C of A) has
been granted by the Historic Preservation
Commission. Also, unless such certificate
has been granted by the Commission, the
building inspector shall not issue a permit
for any such work.
2. Upon filing of any application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness with the
Commission, the Commission shall approve
the application unless:
a. In the case of a designated historic
structure or historic site, the proposed work
would detrimentally change, destroy or
adversely affect any exterior feature of the
improvement or site upon which said work
is to be done;
b. In the case of the construction of a
new improvement upon a historic site, or
within a historic district the exterior of such
improvement would adversely affect or not
harmonize with the external appearance
other neighboring improvements on such
site or within the district;
c. In the case of any property located in
a historic district, the proposed construction,
reconstruction exterior alteration or
demolition does not conform to the purpose
and intent of this section and to the
objectives and design criteria of the historic
preservation plan for said district;
d. The building or structure is of such
architectural or historical significance that
its demolition would be detrimental to the
public interest and contrary to the general
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 32 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
welfare of the people of the Village and
state;
e. The building or structure is of such
old and unusual or uncommon design,
texture, and/or material that it could not be
reproduced without great difficulty and/or
expense;
f. Except as provided herein, in the case
of a request for the demolition of a
deteriorated building or structure, any
economic hardship or difficulty claimed by
the owner is self-created or is the result of
any failure to maintain the property in good
repair. Upon the request for a demolition
permit for a structure determined to be unfit
for human habitation, occupancy, or use by
any unauthorized public official or agency,
the Commission may defer the granting of
approval for a period of up to six (6) months
from the time of such application, during
which time the Commission and the
property owner shall undertake serious and
continuing discussions for the purpose of
finding a method to save such property.
During such period, the property owner and
the Commission shall cooperate in
attempting to avoid demolition of the
property. At the end of this six (6) month
period, if no mutually agreeable method of
saving the subject property bearing a
reasonable prospect of eventual success is
under way, or if no formal application for
funds from and governmental unit or
nonprofit organization to preserve the
subject property is pending, the building
inspector may issue the permit to demolish
the subject property without the approval of
the Commission. If such mutually agreeable
method of for saving the subject property is
not successful or no such funds to preserve
the subject property have been obtained and
available for disbursement within a period of
two (2) months following the end of such six
(6) month period, the building inspector may
issue the permit to demolish the subject
property without the approval of the
Commission.
3. In addition, in determining whether to
issue a Certificate of Appropriateness, the
Commission shall consider and may give
decisive weight to any or all of the following
standards:
a. A property shall be used for its
historic purpose or be placed in a new use
that requires minimal change to the defining
characteristics of the building and its site
and environment.
b. The historic character of a property
shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of
features and spaces that characterize a
property shall be avoided.
c. Each property shall be recognized as
a physical record of its time, place, and use.
Changes that create a false sense of
historical development, such as adding
conjectural features or architectural elements
from other buildings, shall not be
undertaken.
d. Most properties change over time.
Those changes that have acquired historic
significance in their own right shall be
retained and preserved.
e. Distinctive features, finishes, and
construction techniques or examples of
craftsmanship that characterize a property
shall be preserved.
f. Deteriorated historic features shall be
repaired rather than replaced. Where the
severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new
feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where
possible, materials. Replacement of missing
features shall be substantiated by
documentary, physical, or pictorial
evidence.
g. Chemical or physical treatments, such
as sandblasting, that cause damage to
historic materials shall not be used. The
surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate,
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 33 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
h. Significant archeological resources
affected by a project shall be protected and
preserved. If such resources must be
disturbed, mitigation measures shall be
undertaken.
i. New additions, exterior alterations, or
related new construction shall not destroy
historic materials that characterize the
property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its
environment.
j. New additions and adjacent or related
new construction shall be undertaken in such
a manner that if removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the historic
property and its environment would be
unimpaired.
4. If the Commission determines that
the application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness and the proposed changes
are consistent with the character and features
of the property or district, it shall issue the
Certificate of Appropriateness. The
Commission shall make this decision within
forty-five (45) days of the filing of the
application. Failure of the Commission to
act upon a requestor a Certificate of
Appropriateness within forty-five (45) days
shall result in the issuance of such
certificate.
5. Agencies of the Village and all public
utility and transportation companies
undertaking projects affecting historic
structures, historic sites, or historic districts
shall be required to obtain a Certificate of
Appropriateness prior to initiating any
changes in the character of street paving,
sidewalks, utility installations, lighting,
walls, fences, structures, and buildings on
property, easements, or streets owned or
franchised by the Village.
6. The issuance of a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirement of obtaining
other permits and approvals required by the
Village, or any other governing agencies. A
building permit or other municipal permit
shall be invalid if it is obtained without the
presentation of the Certificate of
Appropriateness required for the proposed
work. Insofar as they are applicable to a
historic structure, historic site, or
improvement in a historic district designated
under this section, any provision of the
plumbing code, electrical code, or building
or housing of the Village shall apply unless
waived by the appropriate state or Village
officials. The Commission may support or
propose such waivers before the appropriate
state or Village appeals body.
7. Compliance with certificates of
appropriateness shall be started within
twelve (12) months after the issuance of the
certificate, and the work shall conform to the
provisions of the certificate. The Village
may inspect the work during and after
construction in order to assure compliance.
Failure to comply with a Certificate of
Appropriateness or failure to obtain a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall be a
violation of this section. In addition to other
penalties and remedies, the Village shall
issue a stop work order, and all work shall
cease on the designated property. No
additional work shall be undertaken as long
as such stop work order shall continue in
effect.
8. Ordinary maintenance and repairs
may be undertaken without a Certificate of
Appropriateness provided that the work
involves repairs to existing features of a
historic structure or site or the replacement
of elements of a structure with pieces
identical in appearance and provided that the
work does not change the exterior
appearance of the structure or site and does
not require the issuance of a building permit.

historic structure, historic site, or
improvement in a historic district designated
under this section, any provision of the
Universal Dwelling Code and Suamico
Building Code and outdoor signs and
outdoor advertising structures regulations of
the general ordinances may be varied or
Village of Suamico
16-Building Code Page 38 of 39 Adopted 1-21-08
waived, on application, by the appropriate
board having such jurisdiction over such
chapter or, in the absence of such board, by
the Zoning Administrator, provided such
variance or waiver does not endanger public
health or safety.
(9) Emergency Conditions. In any
case where the building inspector
determines that there are emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health, or
property affecting a historic structure, site,
or a property in a historic district, the
Village may order the remedying of these
conditions without the approval of the
Commission. The Village shall promptly
notify the Commission of the action being
taken. When the emergency conditions do
not require demolition, the Village shall
make every effort to carry out the intent of
this chapter and to use the design guidelines
of the Commission when remedying the
emergency conditions.
16.99 PENALTY, SEVERABILITY,
AND ENFORCEMENT.
(1) Penalty. Any person who violates,
or knowingly allows or permits any
violation of, any provision of this ordinance,
shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less

playground, school or other public use or
facility as indicated on any officially
adopted map or area development plan, such
space shall be suitably incorporated by the
developer into his or her subdivision plat
after the proper determination of its
necessity by the Village Planning and
Zoning Commission and/or the appropriate
body or public agency involved in the
acquisition and/or use of each site.
(b) If potential public accesses are
included within a plat, the Village Planning
and Zoning Commission shall refer the plat
to the public body concerned with the
acquisition for its consideration and report.
The Village Planning and Zoning
Commission may propose alternate areas for
such acquisition and shall allow the public
body concerned thirty (30) days for reply.
The reply of the public body, if affirmative,
shall include a map showing the boundaries
and areas of the parcel to be acquired and an
estimate of the time required to complete the
acquisition.
1. Upon receipt of an affirmative report,
the Village Planning and Zoning
Commission shall notify the property owner
and shall designate on the preliminary and
final plat that area proposed to be acquired
by the public body.
2. On preliminary and final plats in
which land is designated for acquisition by a
governmental unit or subdivision thereof,
the land owner shall give written notice of
its intent to develop such property to the
governmental unit. Such notice to the
governmental unit of intent shall be
accomplished by a sketch plan of the
proposed development and a tentative
schedule of construction. The governmental
unit shall have up to one (1) year from the
date of notice to obtain an accepted offer to
purchase agreement from the property
owner, or to initiate eminent domain
acquisition. Otherwise, the designation of
the property as to be acquired for public
purposes shall be removed from the plat
and the official map and the owner shall
then be free to develop said property.
Nothing herein shall prevent property on a
plat as being designated as dedicated if
accepted by the Village.
3. Whenever a preliminary plat includes
a proposed dedication of land to public use
and the Village Planning and Zoning
Commission finds that such land is not
required or not suitable for public use, the
Village Planning and Zoning Commission or
the Board may refuse to approve such
dedication.
4. When a final plat of a subdivision has
been approved by the Board and other
required public bodies and the plat is
recorded, that approval shall constitute
acceptance for the purpose designated on the
plat of all lands shown on the plat as
Village of Suamico
17-Subdivision Code Page 5 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
dedicated to the public including street
rights-of-way and common open space.
(4) Land Suitability.
(a) No land shall be divided for a use,
which is determined to be unsuitable based
upon Village, county, state and/or federal
law. Staff for the Village shall make initial
determinations of land suitability and shall
require documentation relative to the
suitability of land for development from the
developer based on Village, county, state
and/or federal law.
(b) If determined to be unsuitable, the
staff shall, in writing, state the facts upon
which its conclusion is reached. Appeals of
land suitability determinations shall be
brought before the Board, which may affirm,
modify, or withdraw the determination of
unsuitability.
(c) All lots proposed for development
must have a minimum developable area as
defined by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and/or the Board.
(d) Geotechnical engineering reports
may be required at staff discretion for all
structures to be built on, or within twenty
feet (20) of slopes twenty-five percent
(25%) or greater. Such reports will include
soil information and classification,
conclusions regarding slope stability with
structural surcharge, detailed slope
stabilization practices if applicable and
project erosion control practices.
Engineering reports are required to be
certified by a professional engineer licensed
in the State of Wisconsin.
(5) Erosion Prevention Requirements.
In addition to stormwater drainage
requirements contained elsewhere in this
chapter, when a proposed subdivision or
certified survey map is located in an area
having the potential to cause soil erosion
and sedimentation problems, the Village
may require that the subdivider prepare a
detailed erosion and sediment control plan.
(a) The plan shall detail all proposed
grading techniques, land division design,
landscaping, vegetative cover, berms,
sediment basins, and other storm drainage
and surface water runoff measures to reduce
erosion and sedimentation caused by surface
water runoff.
(b) Erosion and sediment control plans
shall be submitted to the Village Planning
and Zoning Commission who shall transmit
them, where appropriate, to the Brown
County Planning Department for review and
comment.
(c) Guidelines, standards and
specifications which should provide a
framework for the development, review and
implementation of erosion control, are
contained in the Wisconsin Construction
Site Best Management and Practice
Handbook.
(d) The Village may require that some
or all of the erosion and sediment control
measures, including those recommended by
Brown County, become a restrictive
covenant on the final plat or certified survey
map.
(e) In addition, a side and/or rear
building setback limit may be added when a
severe slope or unstable soil types exist on
the proposed land divisions.
17.03 CONSERVATION BY DESIGN
SUBDIVISIONS.
(1) Conservation by design subdivisions
are optional.
(2) Purpose. To conserve open space
by grouping of lots with reduced individual
lot sizes, provided that overall density
within the subdivision is maintained. The
remaining undeveloped area within the
subdivision provides open space and helps
preserve the scenic and natural qualities of
the land being divided, especially any
applicable environmentally sensitive area.
Grouping of residences will facilitate
common water and sewage disposal systems
Village of Suamico
17-Subdivision Code Page 6 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
and encourage the improved use of the land
respecting the preservation of natural
resources.
(3) Applicability. Any subdivision or
CSM where the total area of the land to be
developed is at least five (5) acres may
follow Conservation subdivision design.
Other land divisions with less than five (5)
acres may be considered for Conservation
subdivision design with special approval of
the Village.
(4) Site Analysis Plan. As a part of the
concept plan phase described under Section
17.04 a study of existing site features shall
be prepared and provided to the Village
prior to the onsite inspection. This site
analysis must include the following:
(a) A topographic map, based on a
U.S.G.S Quadrangle map or aerial
topography at not less than two foot (2)
contours;
(b) Soil boundaries as shown on the
Brown County Soil Survey maps published
by the Soil Conservation Service;
(c) The location of significant features
such as woodlands, tree-lines, open fields or
meadows, scenic views into or out from the
property, watershed divides and drainage
ways, fences or stone walls, rock outcrops,
and existing structures, easements, roads,
tracks and trails; and
(d) The site analysis plan shall identify
both primary conservation areas (floodways,
wetlands, and steep slopes, as defined in the
process for computing "adjusted tract
acreage") and potential secondary
conservation areas. The site analysis plan
shall form the basis for the conceptual
preliminary plan, which shall show the
tentative location of houses, streets, lot lines,
and greenway lands.
(5) General Requirements. Proposed
conservation subdivisions shall be platted in
accordance with the requirements and
procedures of this chapter and the following
requirements:
(a) Density. The maximum permitted
number of lots in such developments shall
be determined by dividing the total adjusted
tract acreage by the minimum lot size(s)
required in the Suamico Zoning Ordinance.
As an alternate method, the total number of
lots within a conservation subdivision may
be based upon a yield plan showing how
many lots could be attained if the land were
platted using the standard lot size and lot
width. Such yield plan shall be subject to
Village approval and every lot shall be
viable for development to be counted.
Greater density may be permitted based
upon Section 17.03 (5) (b) described below.
(b) Water and Sewer. Water supply and
sewage disposal shall meet the minimum
standards of all state, county, or Village
regulations.
(c) Design. The design standards, as
contained within this chapter, may, at the
discretion of the Board, be relaxed as an
incentive in developing conservation
subdivisions. Standards that can be relaxed
in order to permit more creative land
division design include, but are not limited
to, lot shape and depth, length of cul-de-sac
roads, and road right-of-way width.
However, the lots shall be of sufficient size
to provide buildable room for reasonable
development based on the intended use.
(d) Trail Connections. If pedestrian
trails are included within any conservation
subdivision, such trails may, at the
developers discretion, be connected to any
regional pedestrian trails established by the
Village, Brown County, any adjacent
community, or the State of Wisconsin,
subject to approval by the owner of the trail.
(6) Open Space Requirements.
(a) Open space required for
conservation subdivisions shall be based
upon the contour, character, and aesthetics
of the land being developed and may include
both primary and secondary conservation
areas.
Village of Suamico
17-Subdivision Code Page 7 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
(b) Minimum Open Space. In order to
receive relaxation of the design standards, as
described in Subsection 17.03 (4) (c) above,
permanent open space shall be designated on
the plat and shall be at least twenty-five
percent (25%) of the gross site area of the
tract being divided. In addition, as an
incentive for establishing greater open
space, the number of lots within the
subdivision may be increased above the
number prescribed in Subsection 17.03 (4)
(a) as follows:
1. The total amount of open space shall
be at least thirty percent (30%) of the gross
site area.
2. All of the primary conservation areas
shall be included within the permanent open
space to the extent practical.
3. Of the area gained as a result of
reduced right-of-way widths or lots less than
the normal minimum area, at least twothirds
(2/3) shall be included as additional
open space. The remaining one-third (1/3)
may be used for additional platted lots above
the density prescribed in Subsection 17.03
(4) (a) above.
(c) The minimum required open space
may include storm water management
facilities, active recreation facilities, and
manmade ponds. However, not more than
fifty percent (50%) of the required open
space shall consist of active recreation
facilities and permanent ponds.
(d) The required open space may be
used, without restriction, for underground
drainage fields for individual or community
septic systems, subject to the requirements
of the Brown County Private Sewage
System Ordinance.
(e) The required open space shall be
designated as undivided open space and
shall be protected by a permanent
conservation easement, prohibiting further
development and setting other standards
safeguarding the sites special resources.
Such conservation easement shall be in a
form acceptable to the Village and duly
recorded with the Brown County Register of
Deeds. A narrative describing the
ownership, use, and maintenance
responsibilities of the open space may be
required by the Village.
(f) Open space shall abut the largest
practical number of lots within the
conservation subdivision. The Village may
require safe and convenient pedestrian
access to the open space from all lots not
adjoining the open space.
(g) The design of open space should be
sufficient to allow for the intended use, such
as agriculture, natural resource protection,
recreation, stormwater management, etc.
(7) Evaluation Criteria. The Village
Planning and Zoning Commission and
Board shall evaluate proposed conservation
subdivisions to determine whether the
proposed conceptual preliminary plan
effectively meets the following criteria:
(a) The conservation subdivision design
should identify and, to the extent possible,
preserve all environmentally sensitive areas.
(b) The design should create sufficient
buffer areas to minimize conflicts between
residential and other uses.
(c) The development should be visually
buffered from existing public roads, such as
by placing lots at the far edges of fields or
by a planting screen consisting of a variety
of trees, shrubs, and wildflowers.
(d) The conservation subdivision design
should recognize and preserve where
possible existing hedgerows and tree lines
between fields or meadows, and should
minimize impacts on large woodlands
(greater than five (5) acres), especially those
containing many mature trees or a
significant wildlife habitat. When any
woodland is developed, great care shall be
taken to situate all disturbed areas (for
buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal
fields, etc.) in locations where there are no
Village of Suamico
17-Subdivision Code Page 8 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the
fullest extent practicable.
(e) The conservation subdivision design
should leave scenic views and vistas
unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as
seen from public thoroughfares. In wooded
areas where the sense of enclosure is a
feature that should be maintained, a deep
"no-build, no-cut" buffer should be provided
to preserve existing vegetation.
(f) The conservation subdivision design
should respect and preserve sites of historic,
archaeological, or cultural significance, and
their environs, insofar as needed to
safeguard the character of the feature,
including stone walls, barn foundations,
cellar holes, earthworks, and burial grounds.
(g) The conservation subdivision should
protect rural roadside character and promote
public safety and roadway carrying capacity
by avoiding development fronting directly
on or taking access onto collector or arterial
roads.
(h) If the conservation subdivision
design includes a pedestrian circulation
system, it should be designed to assure
pedestrian safety, and consideration should
be given to providing a connection to
adjoining properties or pedestrian trail
systems.
(i) The conservation subdivision design
should provide open space that is in a
reasonably contiguous configuration.
Fragmentation of open space should be
minimized and not divided into numerous
small parcels located in various parts of the
development. To the greatest extent
practical, open space should be designed as
a single block with logical, smooth-flowing
boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation
land shall be avoided, unless the area
needing conservation is linear or unless such
configuration is necessary as a trail
connection or similar corridor.
(j) Wherever possible, the open space
should generally abut or connect with
existing or potential open space land on
adjacent parcels (such as in other
subdivisions, public parks, or properties
owned by or leased to private land
organizations). Such open space may be
designed as part of a larger contiguous and
integrated parkway or system of trails.
(8) Ownership of Open Space.
(a) Ownership Options. Different
ownership and management options may
apply to the permanently protected open
space created by the development. The open
space shall remain titled as undivided
interest in ownership and may be owned and
managed by any of the following options:
1. Private individual or entity such as
the original landowner.
2. Duly established homeowners
association or condominium association for
the development approved by the Village.
3. Recognized land trust or organization
approved and acceptable to the Village.
4. Village, Brown County, or other
public entity or agency, subject to
acceptance by the applicable unit of
government.
(b) Dedications and Easements. If open
space is proposed to be dedicated to the
public it shall first be offered to the Village,
and if the Village does not accept, then to
Brown County. The Village may, but shall
not be required to, accept a dedication of
open space. Such dedication shall take the
form of a fee simple ownership and there
shall be no cost of acquisition other than any
costs incidental to the transfer of ownership
such as title insurance. Land proposed for
dedication shall be accessible to the
residents of the Village.
1. The Village may, but shall not be
required to, accept easements for public use
of any portion or portions of undivided open
space land. The Village may require a
public land dedication, easement, or
combination thereof, through designated
open space to facilitate trail connections.

17-Subdivision Code Page 9 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
(c) Transfer of Ownership or Easement
to a Private Organization. An owner may
transfer open space lands or conservation
easements to a private, nonprofit
organization, among whose purposes it is to
conserve open space and/or natural
resources, provided that:
1. The organization is acceptable to the
Village and is a bona fide private
organization with perpetual existence;
2. The conveyance contains appropriate
provisions for proper reverter or retransfer in
the event that the organization becomes
unwilling or unable to continue carrying out
its functions; and
3. The developer and the organization
enter into a maintenance agreement
acceptable to the Village.
(d) Failure to adequately maintain the
undivided open space in reasonable order
and condition constitutes a violation of this
chapter. The Village is hereby authorized to
give notice, by personal service or by United
States mail, to the owner and/or easement
holder, of any violation, directing the owner
to remedy the same within thirty (30) days.
In the event of repeated violations, the
Board may determine it is necessary to take
on maintenance responsibilities for any
common open space established through this
chapter and pursuant to Wisconsin statutes
levy a special assessment on the property for
the costs associated with maintaining the
open space.

any manmade or natural drainage way so
that such obstruction impedes the natural
flow of water and/or diminishes the natural
aesthetic quality of the drainage way.
(b) Lot boundaries shall be made to
coincide with new and/or pre-existing
manmade and natural drainage ways to
avoid the creation of lots that can be built
upon by altering such drainage ways.
(c) Surface water shall not be regarded
as unduly retained or diverted if:
1. The retention or diversion results
from a technique, practice or device
deliberately installed as part of an approved
sedimentation or stormwater runoff control
plan.

system on or near the proposed land
division, the subdivider shall make
reasonable efforts to connect the proposed
development with the sanitary sewer system.
(b) In areas where a sanitary sewer
system is not available, onsite sewage
disposal systems utilizing soil absorption
fields will be permitted only when soil tests
conducted in accordance with Chapters
COMM 85 and/or 83, Wis. Adm. Code,
indicate the systems will function
adequately. Such systems must be in
compliance with all Village, county and
state regulations.
(5) Dedication and Reservation of
Parkland.
(a) Whenever a tract of land to be
subdivided embraces all or any part of a
street or other public way which has been
designated in adopted regional, county or
Village comprehensive plans or adopted
plan components, such public way shall be a
part of the plat and either dedicated or
reserved by the subdivider in the locations
and dimensions indicated on such plan as
agreed to by the Village and subdivider at
platting.
(b) Whenever a proposed park,
playground, public access, open space site or
other public land other than streets which
has been designated in adopted regional,
county or Village comprehensive plans or
adopted plan components is embraced, all or
in part, in a tract of land to be subdivided,
such proposed public lands shall be made a
part of the plat and shall either be dedicated
to the public or be reserved for acquisition at
fair market value land costs for a period not
to exceed one (1) year from the date of
recordation, unless extended by mutual
agreement between the subdivider and the
public agency having jurisdiction. If the
reserved land is not acquired by such public
agency within the above time limit, the land
shall be released to the owner.
(c) In order that adequate land be
dedicated, reserved, and preserved for the
development of public parks, recreation, and
open space and to provide for the proper
location such sites as the Village develops,
the following provisions shall be
established:
1. The number, size, and location of all
dedications shall be subject to approval by
the Planning and Zoning Commission, who
shall ascertain that the proposed sites are
suitable for the proposed uses. Such
Commission shall retain the right to refuse
any dedication of land found to be
unsuitable.
2. Where the dedication is incompatible
or for other reasons is infeasible as
determined by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the subdivider shall, in lieu
thereof, pay to the Village according to the
zoning classification intended for each
dwelling unit in the land division as

17.07 DESIGN STANDARDS.
(1) Street Arrangements. The
subdivider shall dedicate land for and
improve streets as provided herein. Streets
Village of Suamico
17-Subdivision Code Page 17 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
shall conform to any applicable official map
ordinance in effect. In areas for which an
official map has not been completed, the
street layout shall recognize the functional
classification of various street types and
shall be developed and located in proper
relation to existing and proposed streets,
utilities, land uses and public convenience
and safety. The land division shall be
designed so as to provide each lot with
satisfactory access to a public street as
provided herein. The following conditions
shall apply for street arrangement in all
proposed land divisions:
(a) Arterial Street. Arterial streets shall
be arranged so as to provide ready access to
centers of employment, high-density
residential areas, centers of government
activity, community shopping area,
community recreation and points beyond the
boundaries of the community. They shall
also be properly integrated with and related
to the existing and proposed system of major
streets and highways and shall be, insofar as
is practicable, continuous and in alignment
with existing or planned streets with which
they are to connect.
(b) Collector Streets. Collector streets
shall be arranged so as to provide collection
of traffic from residential areas and
conveyance of this traffic to the major street
and highway system and shall be properly
related to special traffic generators, such as
schools, churches and shopping centers and
other concentrations of population and to the
major streets into which they feed.
(c) Minor Streets. Minor streets shall be
arranged to conform to the topography,
discourage use by through traffic, permit the
design of efficient storm and sanitary
sewerage systems and require the minimum
street area necessary to provide safe and
convenient access to abutting property.
(d) Proposed Street. Proposed streets
shall extend to the boundary lines of the
tract being divided, unless prevented by
topography or other physical conditions or
unless, in the opinion of the Board, such
extension is not necessary or desirable for
the coordination of the layout of the land
division or for the advantageous
development of adjacent land tracts. Such
streets shall terminate with a temporary turnaround
of sixty-five feet (65) right-of-way
radius and a roadway pavement of not less
than forty-five feet (45) in radius.
(e) Arterial Street and Highway
Protection. Whenever the proposed land
division contains or is adjacent to a major
street or highway, adequate protection of
residential properties, limitation of access
and separation of through and local traffic
shall be provided by reversed frontage, with
screen planting contained in a non-access
reservation along the rear property line or by
the use of frontage streets.
(f) Reserve Strips. Reserve strips
controlling access to streets or alleys shall
be prohibited, except where their control is
under the jurisdiction of Brown County
Highway Department.
(g) Alleys. Alleys may be required in
commercial and industrial districts to
provide for off-street loading and service
access, but shall not be approved in
residential districts unless required by
unusual topography or other exceptional
conditions.
(h) Street Names. Street names shall
not duplicate or be similar to existing street
names; existing street names shall be
projected or continued wherever possible.
Brown County Planning Department shall
determine the acceptability of proposed
street names.
(2) Limited Access Highway and
Railroad Right-of-Way Treatment.
Whenever the proposed land division
contains or is adjacent to a limited access
highway or railroad right-of-way, the design
shall provide the following treatment:
Village of Suamico
17-Subdivision Code Page 18 of 21 Adopted 1-21-08
(a) When residential lots within the
proposed land division back upon the rightof-
way of an existing or proposed limited
access highway or railroad, the following
restriction shall be placed on the face of the
plat or certified survey map: "Direct
vehicular access to (name of road) from lots
abutting such road is prohibited".
(b) Commercial and industrial districts
should provide on each side of the limited
access highway or railroad a street
approximately parallel to and at suitable
distance from such highway or railroad for
the appropriate use of the land between such
streets and highway or railroad, but not less
than one hundred fifty feet (150).
(c) Streets parallel to a limited access
highway or railroad right-of-way, when
intersecting a major street and highway or
collector street which crosses such railroad
or highway, shall be located at a minimum
distance of two hundred fifty feet (250)
from such highway or railroad right-of-way.
Such distance, where desirable and
practicable, shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance
required for the future separation of grades
by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(3) Street Design Standards.
(a) Minimum Right-of-Way. The
minimum right-of-way of all proposed
streets shall be as specified on any
applicable street plan officially adopted by

follows:
Type of Street Minimum Right-of-Way
Arterial Streets 100 feet
Collector Streets 80 feet
Minor Streets 70 feet
Frontage Streets 50 feet in addition
to the street it adjoins.
(b) Minimum Roadway and Surface
Widths. Minimum roadway width and
surface width of all new roads shall comply
with the Village road standards contained in
Wis. Stats. §86.26, unless adopted Village
road standards require a greater width.
(c) Cul-de-sacs designed to have one (1)
end permanently closed shall not normally
exceed one thousand feet (1,000) in length.
Such streets shall terminate in a circular
turn-around having a minimum right-of-way
radius of sixty-five feet (65) and a
minimum roadway radius of forty-five feet
(45).
(d) Street Grades:
1. Unless necessitated by exceptional
topography subject to the approval of the
Board, the minimum centerline grade of any
street or public way shall not exceed the
following:
a. Arterial Streetsix percent (6%)
b. Collector Streeteight percent (8%)
c. Minor Street and Frontage Streetten
percent (10%)
d. Pedestrian Waystwo percent (2%),
unless steps of acceptable design are
provided.
e. Maximum GradeThe grade of any
street shall in no case exceed twelve percent
(12%) or be less than five tenths percent
(0.5%).
2. Street grades shall be established,
whenever practicable, so as to avoid
excessive grading, the promiscuous removal
of ground cover and tree growth and general
leveling of the topography.
(e) Radii of CurvatureWhen a
continuous street centerline deflects at any
one (1) point by more than ten degrees
(10°), a circular curve shall be introduced
having a radius of curvature on such
centerline of not less than the following:
1. Arterial Streets and Highwaysthree
hundred feet (300).
2. Frontage and Collector Streetstwo
hundred feet (200).
3. Minor Streetsone hundred feet
(100).

and collector streets.
(g) Half-Streets. Half-streets shall be
prohibited, except where the other half has
already been dedicated or its alignment is
shown on an officially adopted street plan.
(4) Street Intersections. Streets shall
intersect each other as nearly as possible at
right angles and not more than two (2)
streets shall intersect at one (1) point, unless
approved by the Board.
(a) Number of intersections along major
streets and highways shall be held to a
minimum.
(b) Street jogs with centerline offsets of
less than one hundred twenty-five feet
(125) shall not be approved.
(5) Blocks. The widths, lengths, and
shapes of blocks shall be suited to the
planned use of the land, zoning
requirements, need for convenient access,
control and safety of street traffic and the
limitations and opportunities of topography.
(a) Length. Blocks in residential areas
should not, as a general rule, be less than
seven hundred fifty feet (750) nor more
than one thousand five hundred feet (1,500)
in length, unless otherwise dictated.
(b) Pedestrian Ways. Pedestrian ways
of not less than ten feet (10) in width may
be required near the center and entirely
across any block over nine hundred feet
(900) in length where deemed essential by
the Board to provide adequate pedestrian
circulation or access to schools, shopping
centers, churches, or transportation facilities.
(c) Width. Blocks shall have sufficient
width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, except where otherwise
required to separate residential development
from through traffic or where lots abut a
lake or stream. Width of lots or parcels
reserved or laid out for commercial or
industrial use shall be adequate to provide
for off-street service and parking required by
the use contemplated and the area zoning
provisions for such use.
(d) Utility Easements. All utility lines
for electric power, cable television, and
telephone service shall be placed
underground, except where lots abut a lake
or stream or where such a location is
deemed unfeasible for reasons of
groundwater or soils by the utility
companies involved.
(6) Lots. The size, shape, and
orientation of lots shall be appropriate for
the location of the subdivision and for the
type of development and use contemplated.

architectural setting for the building
contemplated.
(a) Lot Lines. Side lot lines should be at
right angles to straight street lines or radial
to curved street lines on which the lots face.
Lot lines shall follow municipal boundary
lines rather than cross them.
(b) Double and Reversed Frontage Lots.
Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be prohibited, except where necessary
to provide separation of residential
development from through traffic or to
overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
(c) Access. Every lot shall front or abut
a public street and have direct vehicular
access to that public street for a distance set
by the minimum requirements of the
Villages Zoning Code of Ordinances.
Direct access does not include the use of
easements.
(d) Lot Area and Dimensions. Area and
dimensions of lots shall conform to the
Village Zoning Ordinance and in areas not
served by public sewer shall, in addition,
conform to the requirements of the State
Division of Health. Whenever a tract is
divided into parcels with area in excess of

adequate building setback from both streets.
(7) Building Setback Lines. Building
setback lines shall conform to the
requirements established in the Village
Zoning, Shoreland and Floodplain Zoning
Ordinances. Setbacks stated on a recorded
plat take precedence over any Suamico
Zoning Ordinance change put in place after
the recorded date of the plat, except if there
is a change of use in the property.
(8) Easements. Where a land division
is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way
or stream, an adequate drainage way or
easement may be required to handle
stormwater runoff. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall approve the
location, width, alignment and improvement
of the drainage way or easement.
17.08 INSPECTIONS AND PERMITS.

existing structures.
(c) To minimize visual impact on
surrounding properties, particularly
residential.
(d) To encourage the location of towers
in nonresidential areas and minimize the
total number of towers within the Village.
(2) Applicability. The requirements of
this section shall apply to all
telecommunication towers and antennas,
except that towers and antennas that are
under seventy feet (70) in height and are
owned and operated by federally-licensed
amateur radio station operators or are
receive-only antennas shall be exempt from
this section.
(3) Antennas.
(a) Permitted Use. Installing an antenna
on an existing structure (including a tower)
shall be a permitted use in all zoning
districts provided the antenna adds no more
than twenty feet (20) to the height of the
existing structure.
(b) Design. If an antenna is installed on
a structure other than a tower, the antenna
and supporting equipment must be of a
neutral color that is identical, or closely
compatible with, the color of the supporting
structure in order to limit visual impact.
(4) Telecommunication Towers.
(a) Permitted Uses.
Telecommunication towers which do not
Village of Suamico
18-Zoning Code Page 56 of 81 Adopted 1-21-08

conditional use permit for a new
telecommunication tower shall not be
granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that the telecommunications equipment
planned for the new tower cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved
tower or structure. Such demonstration may
include one (1) or more of the following
reasons:
1. No existing towers or structures are
located within the geographic area required
to meet the applicants engineering
requirements.
2. Existing towers or structures are not
of sufficient height to meet applicants
engineering requirements.
3. Existing towers or structures do not
have the structural capacity to support the
applicants proposed antenna and related
equipment and the existing tower or
structure cannot be reinforced, modified, or
replaced to accommodate planned
equipment at a reasonable cost.
4. The planned equipment would cause
interference affecting the usability of other
existing or planned equipment at the tower
or the existing antennas would cause
interference with the applicants proposed
antenna and the interference cannot be
prevented at a reasonable cost.

by this section shall bring such towers and
antennas into compliance with the revised
standards and regulations within six (6)
months of the effective date of such
standards and regulations, unless a more
stringent compliance schedule is mandated
by the controlling federal agency. Failure to
bring towers and antennas into compliance
with revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the
tower or antenna by the governing authority
at the owners expense.
(f) Construction. All
telecommunication towers constructed,
erected, or located within the Village shall
comply with all applicable state and local
building codes and the applicable standards

and is referred to as PDD.
(4) Uses Permitted.
(a) Basic Zoning Uses. The following
uses are permitted in a Planned
Development District upon obtaining all
necessary approvals required under this
ordinance:
1. All uses permitted under the basic
zoning regulations applicable to the zoning
district in which the particular property is
located.
2. Where a building site is situated in
more than one (1) use district, all uses
permitted under basic zoning regulations of
one (1) district may be extended into the
adjacent district, but only under the
condition that the maximum area of such
extension shall not exceed an area computed
to be fifty percent (50%) of the smaller of
the areas of the portion of the property
located in either district.
3. Recreational, commercial, and
institutional uses may be included to serve
the residents of the PDD and/or residents of
the surrounding area, provided such uses can
be supported by the residents as indicated by
an appropriate market study provided by the
developer. Also, parking, signage, and any
additional use restrictions for the uses shall
be addressed in the code adopted that
authorizes and establishes the proposed
PDD development.
(b) Building Restrictions. Requirements
for building height, size, and floor area, lot
size, setbacks (front, side, rear, and corner
side), density and open space shall be
delineated in the final development plan and
the code adopted that authorizes and
establishes the proposed PDD. In no case
shall these requirements be less than stated
in other sections of the PDD ordinance and
shall be found to not be hazardous, harmful,
offensive, or otherwise adverse to the
environment, property values, or the
character of the proposed development,
surrounding neighborhood or community or
adverse to the health, safety, and welfare of
the residents of the PDD and/or community
as a whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the final development plan does not
address a specific zoning requirement (the
Non-addressed Requirement), the
provisions of the Suamico Zoning
Ordinance shall apply to the development
plan to the extent of the non-addressed
requirements.
(5) General Provisions.
(a) Engineering Design Standards.
Normal standards or operational policy
regarding right-of-way widths, provisions of
sidewalks, street lighting and similar
environmental design criteria shall not be
mandatory in a planned development, but
precise standards satisfactory to the Village,
pursuant to the criteria as set forth in Section
18.22 (6) shall be made a part of the
approval plan and shall be enforceable as
part of the code.
1. Unless approved by the Village, all
sewer and water utility extensions shall
remain public.
(b) Approvals. The developer shall
develop the site in accordance with the
terms and conditions of development
presented to and approved by the Board.
Any changes or additions to the original
approved development site, structures, or
plans of operation shall require resubmittal
Village of Suamico
18-Zoning Code Page 64 of 81 Adopted 1-21-08
and recommendation by the Planning &
Zoning Commission and approval by the
Board.
(c) Rescinding Approval. Failure to
comply with conditions, commitments,
guarantees, or the recommendations
established in the approval of such
development project shall be cause for
rescinding the approval of the same. Upon
notice given by the Building Inspector, the
developer then shall be required to appear
before the Board at its next public meeting
to explain any such failure to comply. The
Board at such hearing shall determine
whether or not the developer shall have
failed to comply, and if there has been such
a failure, may either:
1. Rescind its approval, whereupon such
recession and cessation of all rights and
privileges of the developer and owner,
including the right to complete construction
or to construct any building or other
structure or improvement, shall become
effective on the thirty-first (31st) day
following mailing by certified mail to the
developer at his or her last known address of
a written notice of such decision; or
2. Adjourn such hearing for a period not
to exceed sixty-five (65) days to enable the
developer to comply; whereupon, if the
developer is then in substantial compliance
and has then established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Board that there will be
compliance in the future, the rights and
privileges of the developer and owner shall
continue for such period of time that there
be such compliance, or does not establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that
there will be compliance in the future, the
Board will proceed in accordance with
Section 18.22, 1.
(6) Criteria for Approval. As a basis
for determining the acceptability of a PDD
proposal, the following criteria shall be
applied to the development proposal, with
specific considerations as to whether or not
it is consistent with the spirit and intent of
this code, has been prepared with competent
professional advice and guidance and
produces significant benefits in terms of
environmental design:
(a) Character and Intensity of Land
Use. The uses proposed and their intensity
and arrangement on the site shall be a visual,
aesthetic, and operational character which:
1. Is compatible to the physical nature
of the site, with particular concern for
preservation of natural features, tree growth,
and open space.
2. Would produce an attractive
environment of sustained aesthetic and
ecologic desirability, economic stability, and
functional practicality compatible with the
general development plans as established by
the community.
3. Would not adversely affect the
anticipated provision for school, sewer,
water, snow removal, garbage pickup, fire
protection, or other municipal services.
4. Would provide sufficient and
accessible off-street parking and loading
facilities. The parking requirements shall be
determined in the specific approval of the
preliminary and final development plans and
delineated in the code adopted that
authorizes and establishes the proposed
PDD. However, the Villages off-street
parking requirements shall be used as a
guide to determine adequate off-street
parking provision. Creativity in addressing
the provision of parking is encouraged.
Alternate parking arrangements may be used
(such as exterior or interior satellite parking
lots, provision of mass transportation, etc.)
to provide adequate parking within the
requirements of the PDD code.
(b) Landscaping of Parking Areas. The
parking site shall be planned to provide a
desirable transition from the streetscape and
to provide for adequate landscaping,
pedestrian movement, and parking areas. In
Village of Suamico
18-Zoning Code Page 65 of 81 Adopted 1-21-08
keeping with this purpose, the following
design standard shall be set forth:
1. Where natural or existing topographic
features contributed to the beauty and utility
of a development, consideration shall be
given to this preservation. Modification to
topographic features should only occur
where it contributes to good appearance.
2. Plant material shall be selected for
interest in its ultimate growth. Further, it is
recommended that native materials be
employed for their ability to tolerate the
prevailing adverse conditions.
3. In locations where plant materials
will be susceptible to injury by pedestrians
and/or motor vehicles; appropriate curbs,
tree guards or other protective devices shall
be employed.
4. Parking areas shall be arranged so as
to prevent through traffic to other parking
areas.
5. Parking areas shall be screened from
adjacent structures, roads and traffic arteries
with hedges, dense planting, earth berms,
changes in grade, or walls except where
parking areas are designed as an intricate
part of the street.
6. All parking areas shall be adequately
lighted. All such lighting shall be so
arranged as to direct the light away from the
adjoining residences.
7. All off-street loading and unloading
areas shall be paved, and the design thereof
approved by the Planning & Zoning
Commission.
8. All parking areas and off-street
loading and unloading areas shall be graded
and drained so as to dispose of all surface
water without erosion, flooding, and other
inconveniences.
(c) Engineering Design Standards. The
width of rights-of-way, width and location
of street or other paving, requirements for
outdoor lighting, location of sanitary and
storm sewer and water lines, and provision
for drainage and other similar environmental
engineering considerations shall be based
upon a determination as to the appropriate
standards necessary to implant the specific
function in the specific situation; provided,
however, that in no case shall construction
standards be less than necessary to ensure
the public safety and welfare.
(d) Preservation and Maintenance of
Open Space. Adequate provisions shall be
made for the permanent preservation and
maintenance of common open space and
rights-of-way either by private reservation
or dedication to the public.
1. In the case of private reservation, the
open area to be reserved shall be protected
against building development by conveying
to the Village, as part of the conditions for
project approval, an open space easement
over such open areas restricting the areas
against any further building or use except as
is consistent with that of providing
landscaped open spaces for aesthetic and
recreational satisfaction of the surrounding
residences. Buildings or uses for
noncommercial recreational or cultural
purposes compatible with the open space
objective may be permitted only where
specifically authorized as part of the
development plan, or, subsequently, with the
express approval of the Board following the
recommendation of site and operational
plans by the Planning & Zoning
Commission.
2. In the case of roadways and other
rights-of-way which are not dedicated to the
public, as part of the conditions for project
approval there shall be granted to the
Village such easements over the same as
may be necessary to enable the Village to
provide suitable and adequate fire
protection, sanitary and storm sewer water,
and other required municipal services to the
project area.
3. The care and maintenance of such
open space reservations and rights-of-way
shall be assured either by establishment of
Village of Suamico
18-Zoning Code Page 66 of 81 Adopted 1-21-08
an appropriate management organization for
the project or by agreement with the Village
for establishment of a special service district
and levy the cost thereof as a special
assessment on the tax bill of properties
within the project area. In any case the
Village shall have the right to carry out, and
levy an assessment for the cost of any
maintenance which it feels necessary if it is
not otherwise taken care of to the
satisfaction of the Village. The manner of
assuring maintenance and assessing such
cost to individual properties shall be
determined prior to the approval of the final
project plans and shall be included in the
title of each property. The developer shall
submit a landscape maintenance schedule
with the final plan for approval by the
Village that satisfies the above requirements.
4. Ownership and tax liability of private
open space reservations and rights-of-way
shall be established in a manner acceptable
to the Village and made a part of the
conditions of plan approval.
(e) Accommodation of Pedestrian
Traffic.
1. Sidewalks and/or other walkways and
bicycle paths shall be provided where
necessary for the boundaries. Special
attention shall be given to connections
accommodating pedestrian movement
between the dwelling units, common open
space, recreation facilities, commercial
establishments, and parking facilities or
areas.
2. Walkway widths and surface
treatments of all walkways shall be
designated with regard to their function and
the anticipated manner of usage. The
natural feature of the area traversed by the
walkway system and suitable lighting in
scale with the project shall also be
considered.
3. Utilization of pedestrian ramps shall
be encouraged where necessary to either
resolve conflicts with vehicular traffic or
facilitate the movement of elderly and/or
children.
(f) Setback Requirements. Setbacks for
parking areas and structures shall be
established by the conditions governing the
particular Planned Commercial District so as
to ensure compatibility with adjoining
developments, uses, and zoning but no
parking area or structure shall be permitted
within:
1. Fifteen feet (15) from any county
highway or Village arterial street right-ofway;
2. Ten feet (10) of the right-of-way line
of a collector or local street.

18.23 TCOD  TOWN CENTER
OVERLAY DISTRICT.
(1) Purpose of the Town Center
Overlay District (TCOD).
(a) The TCOD is intended to permit
developments that will, over a period of
time, be enhanced by coordinated area site
planning, diversified location of structures
and/or mixing of compatible uses. Such
developments are intended to provide a safe
and efficient system for pedestrian and
vehicular traffic; to create more active social
places; to provide an opportunity for
Village of Suamico
18-Zoning Code Page 71 of 81 Adopted 1-21-08
developers to create economic activities that
serve the needs of Village residents; to
provide attractive recreation, green spaces,
town squares and plazas, and public activity
spaces as integral parts of the development;
to enable economical design of utilities and
community facilities; and to ensure adequate
standards of construction and planning. The
TCOD under this section will allow for
flexibility of overall development design,
with benefits from such flexibility intended
to be derived by both the developer and the
community, while at the same time
maintaining, where judged appropriated by
the Board, other standards or use
requirements as set forth in the underlying
base zoning district. The TCOD shall be
applicable only within the district as
depicted in the accompanying map within
the Town Center Plan (TCP).
(b) The unified and planned
development of a site in a single,
partnership, or corporate ownership or
control or in common ownership under the
Unit Ownership Act set for in Wis. Stats.
Ch. 703 (condominiums) may be permitted
by the Village upon specific petition, with
such development encompassing one (1) or
more principal uses or structures and related
accessory uses or structures, when all
regulations and standards as set forth in this
section have been met.
(2) Area Requirements for TCOD
Project. Areas designated as a TCOD
project shall be under single or corporate
ownership or control and shall contain a
minimum development area of either one
half (½) acres or the size of the lots and
parcels existing as of the adoption date of
this TCOD.
(3) Uses, Structures, Lot Area and
Dimensions, Density, Parking,
Landscaping, Heights, Setback Yards,
and Other Requirements. Uses, structures,
individual lot sizes, densities, setbacks,
yards, dimensional requirements,
landscaping requirements, parking
requirements, height requirements, and other
requirements required by the underlying
base use district may be modified and shall
be considered as permitted uses if, in the
judgement of the Planning & Zoning
Commission, Design Review Commission,
and Board, the proposed project is
compatible with the site design, illustrations,
guidelines, and related features as shown in
the TCP.
(4) Procedure.
(a) Pre-Petition Conference. Prior to
official submittal of the petition for approval
of a proposed project or development for the
TCOD, the owner or his or her agent making
such petition shall meet with the Village
Staff to discuss the scope and proposed
nature of the contemplated development.
Subsequent to such meeting, all costs for
Village Staff and consultants associated with
the proposed project shall be borne by the
owner or his or her agent by agreement with

19.01 STATUTORY
AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF
FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE,
TITLE, AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.
(1) Statutory Authorization. This
ordinance is adopted pursuant to the
authorization in Wis. Stats. §61.35, §62.23
and the requirements in Wis. Stats. §87.30.
(2) Finding of Fact. Uncontrolled
development and use of the floodplains and
rivers of this municipality would impair the
public health, safety, convenience, general
welfare and tax base.
(3) Statement of Purpose. This
ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain
development to:
(a) Protect life, health and property;
(b) Minimize expenditures of public
funds for flood control projects;
(c) Minimize rescue and relief efforts
undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;
(d) Minimize business interruptions and
other economic disruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities
in the floodplain;
(f) Minimize the occurrence of future
flood blight areas in the floodplain;
(g) Discourage the victimization of
unwary land and homebuyers;
(h) Prevent increases in flood heights
that could increase flood damage and result
in conflicts between property owners; and
(i) Discourage development in a
floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or
structure outside of the floodplain.
(4) Title. This ordinance shall be known
as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the
Village of Suamico, Wisconsin.
(5) General Provisions.
(a) Areas to be Regulated. This
ordinance regulates all areas that would be
covered by the regional flood or base flood
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) or other maps approved by the
DNR. Base flood elevations (BFE) are
derived from the flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE,
A1-A30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other
regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO
Village of Suamico
19-Floodplain District Page 2 of 28 Adopted 2-17-14
zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may
be derived from other studies. If more than
one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive shall apply.
(b) Official Maps & Revisions. The
boundaries of all floodplain districts are
designated as A, AE, AH, AO, or A1-30 on
the maps based on the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the
base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes
to the boundaries of the floodplain or
floodway in the in the FIS or on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be
reviewed and approved by the DNR and
FEMA through the Letter of Map Change
process (see s. 19.08 Amendments) before it
is effective. No changes to RFEs on non-
FEMA maps shall be effective until approved
by the DNR. These maps and revisions are
on file in the office of the Zoning
Administrator, Village of Suamico. If more
than one map or revision is referenced, the
most restrictive information shall apply.
Official Maps: Based on the Brown
County Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated
(March 17, 2014), volume numbers
(55009CV001B, 55009CV002B, and

with the corresponding profiles that are
based on the FIS. Approved by: The DNR
and FEMA.
Official Maps: Based on other studies.
1. Floodplain Study Appendix: Any
maps referenced in this section must be
approved by the DNR and be more
restrictive than those based on the FIS at the
site of the proposed development.
a. The Hidden Lake Dam, Dam Failure
Analysis and all associated Inundation map,
Floodway data table & profiles.
(c) Establishment of Districts. The
regional floodplain areas are divided into
three (3) districts as follows:
1. The Floodway District (FW) is the
channel of a river or stream and those
portions of the floodplain adjoining the
channel required to carry the regional
floodwaters and are contained within AE
Zones as shown on the FIRM.
2. The Floodfringe District (FF) is that
portion of the floodplain between the
regional flood limits and the floodway and
displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
3. The General Floodplain District
(GFP) is those areas that may be covered by
floodwater during the regional flood and
does not have a BFE or floodway boundary
determined, including A, AH, and AO zones
on the FIRM.
(d) Locating Floodplain Boundaries.
Discrepancies between boundaries on the
official floodplain zoning map and actual
field conditions shall be resolved using the
criteria in Section 19.01 (5) (d) 1 or 2 below.
If a significant difference exists, the map
shall be amended according to
Section 19.08. The Zoning Administrator
can rely on a boundary derived from a profile
elevation to grant or deny a land use permit,
whether or not a map amendment is
required. The Zoning Administrator shall be
responsible for documenting actual predevelopment
field conditions and the basis
upon which the district boundary was
determined and for initiating any map
amendments required under this section.
Disputes between the Zoning Administrator
and an applicant over the district boundary
line shall be settled according to
Section 19.07 (3) (c) and the criteria in
Village of Suamico
19-Floodplain District Page 3 of 28 Adopted 2-17-14
Section 19.01 (5) (d) 1 and 2 below.
1. If flood profiles exist, the map scale
and the profile elevations shall determine the
district boundary. The regional or base flood
elevations shall govern if there are any
discrepancies.
2. Where flood profiles do not exist, the
location of the boundary shall be determined
by the map scale.
(e) Removal of Lands from Floodplain.
Compliance with the provisions of this
ordinance shall not be grounds for removing
land from the floodplain unless it is filled at
least two feet (2) above the regional or base
flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land
outside the floodplain, and the map is
amended pursuant to Section 19.08.
Note: This procedure does not remove the
requirements for the mandatory purchase of
flood insurance. The property owner must
contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map
Change (LOMC).
(f) Compliance. Any development or
use within the areas regulated by this
ordinance shall be in compliance with the
terms of this ordinance, and other applicable
local, state, and federal regulations.
(g) Municipalities and State Agencies
Regulated. Unless specifically exempted by
law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties
are required to comply with this ordinance
and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats.
13.48(13), applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of
state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin
Department of Transportation is exempt
when Wis. Stats. §30.2022 applies.
(h) Abrogation and Greater
Restrictions.
1. This ordinance supersedes all the
provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance
enacted under Wis. Stats. §61.35 or §87.30,
which relate to floodplains. If another
ordinance is more restrictive than this
ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in
full force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
2. This ordinance is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed
restrictions, covenants or easements. If this
ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(i) Interpretation. In their interpretation
and application, the provisions of this
ordinance are the minimum requirements
liberally construed in favor of the governing
body and are not a limitation on or repeal of
any other powers granted by the Wisconsin
statutes. If a provision of this ordinance,
required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is
unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in
light of the standards in effect on the date of
the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on
the date of the most recent text amendment
to this ordinance.
(j) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The flood protection standards in this
ordinance are based on engineering
experience and scientific research. Larger
floods may occur or the flood height may be
increased by man-made or natural causes.
This ordinance does not imply or guarantee
that non-floodplain areas or permitted
floodplain uses will be free from flooding and
flood damages. This ordinance does not
create liability on the part of, or a cause of
action against, the municipality or any officer
or employee thereof for any flood damage
that may result from reliance on this
ordinance.
(k) Severability. Should any portion of
this ordinance is declared unconstitutional or
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected.
(l) Annexed Areas for Cities and
Villages. The Brown County floodplain
zoning provisions in effect on the date of
annexation shall remain in effect and shall be
enforced by the municipality for all annexed
areas until the municipality adopts and
Village of Suamico
19-Floodplain District Page 4 of 28 Adopted 2-17-14
enforces an ordinance which meets the
requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code and 44 CFR 59-72 National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed
lands are described on the municipality's
official zoning map. County floodplain
zoning provisions are incorporated by
reference for the purpose of administering
this section and are on file in the office of the
Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats
or maps of annexation shall show the
regional flood elevation and the location of
the floodway.
(m) General Development Standards.
The community shall review all permit
applications to determine whether proposed
building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding. If a proposed building site is in a
flood-prone area, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall be designed
or modified and adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be
constructed with materials resistant to flood
damage; be constructed to minimize flood
damages; to ensure that utility & mechanical
equipment is designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for
compliance with the above standards. All
subdivision proposals (including
manufactured home parks) shall include
regional flood elevation and floodway data
for any development that meets the
subdivision definition of this ordinance and
all other requirements in 19.07(1) (b).
Adequate drainage shall be provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards and all
public utilities and facilities, such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems are located
and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damages.

19-Floodplain District Page 25 of 28 Adopted 2-17-14
remain capable of being towed or carried,
including park model homes, do not fall
within the definition of "mobile recreational
vehicles."
(52) Model, Corrected Effective. A
hydraulic engineering model that corrects
any errors that occur in the Duplicate
Effective Model, adds any additional cross
sections to the Duplicate Effective Model, or
incorporates more detailed topographic
information than that used in the current
effective model
(53) Model, Duplicate Effective. A
copy of the hydraulic analysis used in the
effective FIS and referred to as the effective
model.
(54) Model, Effective. The hydraulic
engineering model that was used to produce
the current effective Flood Insurance Study.
(55) Model, Existing (Pre-project) A
modification of the Duplicate Effective
Model or Corrected Effective Model to
reflect any man made modifications that have
occurred within the floodplain since the date
of the effective model but prior to the
construction of the project for which the
revision is being requested. If no
modification has occurred since the date of
the effective model, then this model would
be identical to the Corrected Effective Model
or Duplicate Effective Model.
(56) Model, Revised (Post-project) A
modification of the Existing or Pre-project
Conditions Model, Duplicate Effective
Model or Corrected Effective Model to
reflect revised or post-project conditions.

Vertical Datum. Elevations referenced to
mean sea level datum, 1929 adjustment.
(60) New Construction. For floodplain
management purposes, "new construction"
means structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the
effective date of floodplain zoning
regulations adopted by this community and
includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures. For the purpose of
determining flood insurance rates, it includes
any structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after
December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and
includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
(61) Nonconforming Structure. An
existing lawful structure or building which is
not in conformity with the dimensional or
structural requirements of this ordinance for
the area of the floodplain which it occupies.
(For example, an existing residential
structure in the floodfringe district is a
conforming use. However, if the lowest
floor is lower than the flood protection
elevation, the structure is nonconforming.)
(62) Nonconforming Use. An existing
lawful use or accessory use of a structure or
building which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance for the area of
the floodplain which it occupies (Such as a
residence in the floodway).
(63) Obstruction to Flow. Any
development which blocks the conveyance of
floodwaters such that this development alone
or together with any future development will
cause an increase in regional flood height.

aquatic vegetation, or other easily
recognized characteristic.
(67) Person. An individual or group of
individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, municipality or state agency.
(68) Private Sewage System. A
sewage treatment and disposal system
serving one (1) structure with a septic tank
and soil absorption field located on the same
parcel as the structure. It also means an
alternative sewage system approved by the
Department of Commerce, including a
substitute for the septic tank or soil
absorption field, a holding tank, a system
serving more than one (1) structure or a
system located on a different parcel than the
structure.
(69) Public Utilities. Those utilities
using underground or overhead transmission
lines such as electric, telephone and
telegraph, and distribution and collection
systems such as water, sanitary sewer and
storm sewer.
(70) Reasonably Safe from Flooding.

the land or damage structures to be removed
from the special flood hazard area and that
any subsurface waters related to the base
flood will not damage existing or proposed
buildings.
(71) Regional Flood. A flood
determined to be representative of large
floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin.
A regional flood is a flood with a one
percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year, and if depicted
on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the
BFE.
(72) Start of Construction. The date
the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within
one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include
land preparation, such as clearing, grading
and filling, nor does it include the installation
of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the
main structure. For an alteration, the actual
start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
(73) Structure. Any manmade object
with form, shape and utility, either
permanently or temporarily attached to,
placed upon or set into the ground, stream
bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to,

storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.
(74) Subdivision. Has the meaning
given in Wis. Stats. §236.02(12).
(75) Substantial Damage. Damage of
any origin sustained by a structure, whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged
condition would equal or exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the equalized assessed
value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
(76) Substantial Improvement. Any
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or improvement of a building or structure,
the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the equalized assessed value of
Village of Suamico
19-Floodplain District Page 27 of 28 Adopted 2-17-14
the structure before the improvement or
repair is started. If the structure has
sustained substantial damage, any repairs are
considered substantial improvement
regardless of work performed. The term
does not, however, include either any project
for the improvement of a building required to
correct existing health, sanitary or safety
code violations identified by the building
official and that are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions; or any
alteration of a historic structure provided
that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a
historic structure.
(77) Unnecessary Hardship. Where
special conditions affecting a particular
property, which were not self-created, have
made strict conformity with restrictions
governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height
or density unnecessarily burdensome or
unreasonable in light of the purposes of the
ordinance.
(78) Variance. An authorization by the
Board of Adjustment or Appeals for the
construction or maintenance of a building or
structure in a manner which is inconsistent
with dimensional standards (not uses)
contained in the floodplain zoning ordinance.
(79) Violation. The failure of a
structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the floodplain zoning
ordinance. A structure or other development
without required permits, lowest floor
elevation documentation, floodproofing
certificates or required floodway
encroachment calculations is presumed to be
in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
(80) Watershed. The entire region
contributing runoff or surface water to a
watercourse or body of water.
(81) Water Surface Profile. A
graphical representation showing the
elevation of the water surface of a
watercourse for each position along a reach
of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A
water surface profile of the regional flood is
used in regulating floodplain areas.
(82) Well. Means an excavation
opening in the ground made by digging,
boring, drilling, driving or other methods, to
obtain groundwater regardless of its intended
use.

20.01 STATUTORY
AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF
FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE,
AND TITLE.
(1) Statutory Authorization. This
ordinance is adopted pursuant to the
authorization in Wis. Stats. §59.69, §59.692,
§59.694, and §281.31 and NR 115 Wis.
Adm. Code. These rules and laws shall
apply until amended and then shall apply as
amended.
(2) Finding of Fact. Uncontrolled use
of the shorelands and pollution of the
navigable waters of the Village of Suamico
would adversely affect the public health,
safety, convenience, and general welfare and
impair the tax base. The legislature of
Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to
the counties to further the maintenance of
safe and healthful conditions; prevent and
control water pollution; protect spawning
grounds, fish and aquatic life; control
building sites, placement of structures and
land uses; and to preserve shore cover and
natural beauty. This responsibility is hereby
recognized by the Village of Suamico,
Brown County, Wisconsin.
(3) Purpose. For the purpose of
promoting the public health, safety,
convenience and welfare, this ordinance has
been established to:
(a) Further the Maintenance of Safe and
Healthful Conditions and Prevent and
Control Water Pollution through:
1. Limiting structures to those areas
where soil and geological conditions will
provide a safe foundation.
2. Establishing minimum lot sizes to
provide adequate area for private sewage
disposal facilities.
3. Controlling filling and grading to
prevent serious soil erosion problems.
(b) Protect Spawning Grounds, Fish,
and Aquatic Life through:
1. Preserving Wetlands and other fish
and aquatic habitat.
2. Regulating pollution sources.
Village of Suamico
20-Shoreland-Wetlands Page 2 of 20 Adopted 4-03-06
3. Controlling shoreline alterations,
dredging, and lagooning.
(c) Control Building Sites, Placement of
Structures, and Land Uses through:
1. Separating conflicting land uses.
2. Prohibiting certain uses detrimental
to the shoreland area.
3. Setting minimum lot sizes and
widths.
4. Regulating side yards and building
setbacks from waterways.
(d) Preserve Shore Cover and Natural
Beauty through:
1. Restricting the removal of natural
shoreland cover.
2. Preventing shoreline encroachment
by structures.
3. Controlling shoreland excavation and
other earth moving activities.
4. Regulating the use and placement of
boathouses and other structures.
(4) Title. Shoreland Zoning Ordinance
for the Village of Suamico, Brown County,
Wisconsin.
20.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
(1) Areas to be Regulated. Areas
regulated by this ordinance shall include all
the lands (referred to herein as shorelands)
in the Village of Suamico which are:
(a) Within one thousand feet (1,000) of
the ordinary high water mark of navigable
lakes, ponds, or flowages. Lakes, ponds, or
flowages in the Village of Suamico shall be
presumed to be navigable if they are listed in
the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources publication, Surface Water
Resources of Brown County or are shown
on United States Geological Survey
quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps.
(b) Within three hundred feet (300) of
the ordinary high water mark of navigable
rivers or streams, or to the landward side of
the floodplain, whichever distance is greater.
Rivers and streams in the Village of
Suamico shall be presumed navigable if they
are designated as continuous waterways or
intermittent waterways on United States
Geological Survey quadrangle maps. Flood
hazard boundary maps, flood insurance rate
maps, flood boundary-floodway maps,
county soil survey maps, or other existing
county floodplain zoning maps shall be used
to delineate floodplain areas.
(c) Determinations of navigability and
ordinary high water mark location shall
initially be made by the Zoning
Administrator. When questions arise, the
Zoning Administrator shall contact the
appropriate district office of the Department
for a final determination of navigability or
ordinary high water mark.
(d) Under Wis. Stats. §Ch. 281.31 (2m)
notwithstanding any other provision of law
or administrative rule promulgated
thereunder, this shoreland zoning ordinance
does not apply to any of the following:
1. Lands adjacent to farm drainage
ditches if all of the following apply;
a. The lands are not adjacent to a natural
navigable stream or river
b. Those parts of the drainage ditches
adjacent to these lands were nonnavigable
streams before ditching.
2. Lands adjacent to artificially
constructed drainage ditches, ponds, or
stormwater retention basins that are not
hydrologically connected to a natural
navigable water body.
3. Lands adjacent to an impoundment
described under s. 30.10(2)(b) that does not
discharge directly into a natural navigable
waterway.
(2) Shoreland Zoning Maps. The
maps designated below are hereby adopted
and made part of this ordinance. They are
on file in the office of the Zoning
Administrator for the Village of Suamico.
(a) United States Geological Survey
Quadrangle Maps for the Village of
Suamico (most recent).
Village of Suamico
20-Shoreland-Wetlands Page 3 of 20 Adopted 4-03-06
(b) Wetlands on the DNR Surface
Water Data Viewer.
(c) Floodplain zoning maps indicated in
Chapter 19.
(3) Compliance. The use of any land or
water, the size, shape, and placement of lots,
the use, size, type, and location of structures
on lots, the installation and maintenance of
water supply and waste disposal facilities,
the filling, grading, lagooning, dredging of
any lands, the cutting of shoreland
vegetation, and the subdivision of lots shall
be in full compliance with the terms of this
ordinance and other applicable local, state,
or federal regulations. (However, see
Section 20.09 for standards applicable to
non-conforming uses.) Buildings, signs, and
other structures shall require a permit unless
otherwise expressly excluded by a provision
of this ordinance. Property owners,
builders, and contractors are responsible for
compliance with the terms of this ordinance.
(4) Municipalities and State Agencies
Regulated. Unless specifically exempted
by law, all cities, villages, towns, and
counties are required to comply with this
ordinance and obtain all necessary permits.
State agencies are required to comply when
Wis. Stats. §13.48(13), applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance,
and repair of state highways and bridges by
the Wisconsin Department of Transportation
are exempt when Wis. Stats. §30.12(4)(a),
applies.
(5) Abrogation and Greater
Restrictions. The provisions of this
ordinance supersede all the provisions of
any county zoning ordinance adopted under
Wis. Stats. §59.692, which relate to
shorelands. However, where an ordinance
adopted under a statute other than Wis.
Stats. §59.692 is more restrictive than this
ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in
full force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions but not otherwise.
(a) This ordinance is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing deed
restrictions, covenants, or easements.
However, where this ordinance imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this
ordinance shall prevail.
(b) The following provisions of the
Village of Suamico Zoning Ordinance are
hereby incorporated by reference; these
provisions shall only apply to the shoreland
area where they impose greater restrictions
than this ordinance otherwise imposes.
(6) Interpretation. In their
interpretation and application, the provisions
of this ordinance shall be held to be
minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the Village and shall
not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any
other powers granted by Wisconsin Statutes.
Where a provision of this ordinance is
required by a standard in Ch. NR 115, Wis.
Adm. Code, and where the ordinance
provision is unclear, the provision shall be
interpreted in light of the Ch. NR 115
standards in effect on the date of the
adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the
date of the most recent text amendment to
this ordinance.
(7) Severability. If any portion of this
ordinance is adjudge unconstitutional or
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected.
20.03 LAND DIVISION REVIEW AND
SANITARY REGULATIONS.
(1) Land Division Review. The
Village shall review, pursuant to Wis. Stats.
§236.45, all land divisions in shoreland
areas which create three (3) or more parcels
or building sites of five (5) acres each or less
within a five (5) year period. In such
review, the following factors shall be
considered:
(a) Hazards to the health, safety, or
welfare of future residents.
Village of Suamico
20-Shoreland-Wetlands Page 4 of 20 Adopted 4-03-06
(b) Proper relationship to adjoining
areas.
(c) Public access to navigable waters, as
required by law.
(d) Adequate storm drainage facilities.
(e) Conformity to state law and
administrative code provisions.
(2) Limited Rezoning to Achieve
Reduced Lot Sizes and Setbacks.
(a) Purpose. In some instances where
an individual lot or small tract of land has
unique characteristics, such as unique
terrain, which would result in unnecessary
hardship as defined in Section 20.13 (2) (n),
if the owner were required to comply with
one (1) or more of the requirements for
minimum lot sizes, width, and setback, the
Board of Appeals may grant a variance. In
other instances where larger areas are
involved, the appropriate method for seeking
a relaxation of the same minimum standards
is by rezoning to establish a Planned
Development District overlay. The Planned
Development District is intended to permit
smaller lots and setbacks where the physical
layout of the lots is so arranged (often by
setting them back farther from navigable
water) as to better assure the control of
pollution and preservation of ground cover
than would be expected if the lots were
developed with the normal lot sizes and
setbacks and without special conditions
placed upon the Planned Development
District at the time of its approval. A
condition of all Planned Development
Districts is the preservation of certain open
space, preferably on the shoreland, in
perpetuity.
(b) Requirements for Planned
Development Districts. The Board may at
its discretion, upon its own motion or upon
petition, approve a Planned Development
District either by approving first (1st) an
overlay district and then a plat or by
approving only a plat for the specific
planned residential project upon finding,
after a public hearing, that all of the
following facts exist:
1. Area. The area proposed for the
Planned Residential Unit Development is at
least forty (40) acres in size.
2. Pollution Control. The location and
nature of the septic systems, which will
serve the home sites individually or
collectively, will assure that effluent from
the septic systems will not reach the ground
or surface waters in a condition which
would contribute to health hazards, taste,
odor, turbidity, fertility, or impair the
aesthetic character of navigable waters.
3. Preservation of Ground Cover. The
location of home sites and the dedication of
part of the land for use by the public or
residents of the Planned Development
District will preserve the ground cover of
the shoreland and scenic beauty of the
navigable waters, prevent erosion, and other
pertinent factors. Land not used for lots and
streets shall be dedicated in perpetuity to
remain in open space. This may be
accomplished by conveyance in common to
each of the owners of lots in the
development or to a corporation formed by
them, or by dedication to the county, town,
or municipality. Lands dedicated to the
public must be accepted by action of the
governing body of the accepting unit of
government. If the land is to be conveyed to
owners of lots in the development, a
homeowners association or similar legally
constituted body shall be created to maintain
the open space land. Any restriction placed
on platted land by covenant, grant of
easement, or any other manner which was
required by a public body or which names a
public body as grantee, promisee, or
beneficiary, shall vest in the public body the
right to enforce the restriction at law or in
equity against anyone who has or acquires
an interest in the land subject to the
restriction.
Village of Suamico
20-Shoreland-Wetlands Page 5 of 20 Adopted 4-03-06
4. Density. The number of platted home
sites shall not exceed those which would
have been possible if the same land were
platted in accordance with the minimum lot
sizes, setbacks, and widths provided by the
applicable provisions of the zoning
ordinance. This figure shall be determined
by dividing the total area of the subdivision,
excluding streets, by the minimum lot sizes
required by Section 20.04 of this ordinance.
5. Lot Sizes, Widths, Setbacks, and
Tree-Cutting. The lot sizes, widths, and
setbacks shall not be less than those
provided for in current status Ch. H85, Wis.
Adm. Code, and shall not be so small as to
cause pollution or erosion along streets or
other public ways and waterways or so small
as to substantially depreciate the property
values in the immediate neighborhood.
Shore cover provisions in Section 20.06
shall apply except that maximum width of a
lake frontage opening shall be one hundred
feet (100).
(c) Procedure for Establishing a
Planned Development District. The
procedure for establishing limited rezoning
in the form of a Planned Development
District shall be as follows:
1. Petition. A petition setting forth all
of the facts required in Section 20.03 (2) (b)
shall be submitted to the Clerk with
sufficient copies to provide for distribution
by the Clerk as required by Section 20.03
(2) (c) 2.
2. Review and Hearing. The petition
shall be submitted to the Village Zoning
Agency established as required by Wis.
Stats. §59.97(3)(d), which shall review and
forward for a public hearing and action to
the Village Board as required by law.
Copies of the petition and notice of the
hearing shall also be sent to the appropriate
district office of the Department as
described in Section 20.11 (2) of this
ordinance. The Village Zoning Agencys
report to the Village Board shall reflect the
recommendations of any federal, state, or
local agency with which the Village Zoning
agency consults. If a petition seeks approval
of a Planned Development District plat
without first (1st) seeking the granting of an
overlay district, a hearing shall be held on
such plat as in any regular amendment to the
Zoning Ordinance. If, however, a hearing is
first (1st) held on the overlay for a Planned
Development District, a second (2nd) public
hearing need not be held in connection with
the approval of a subsequent plat or plats
which comply with the overlay district as
approved.
3. Findings and Conditions of Approval.
The Board shall make written findings as to
the compliance or non-compliance of the
proposed overlay district with each of the
applicable requirements set forth in Section
20.03 (2) (b). If the petition is granted in
whole or part, the Board shall attach such
written conditions to the approval as are
required by and consistent with Section
20.03 (2) (b). The conditions of approval
shall in all cases establish the specific
restrictions applicable regarding minimum
lot sizes, width, setbacks, and the location of
septic systems and the preservation of
ground cover and open space.
4. Planning Studies. A landowner or
petitioner may at his or her own expense
develop the facts required to establish
compliance with the provisions of Section
20.03 (2) (b) or may be required to
contribute funds to the Village to defray all
or part of the cost of such studies being
undertaken by the Village or any agency or
person with whom the Village contracts for
such work.
(3) Sanitary Regulations. The Village
shall have no jurisdiction over sanitary
regulations for the protection of health and
preservation and enhancement of water
quality. Brown County shall be the
approving authority for all regulations.
Village of Suamico
20-Shoreland-Wetlands Page 6 of 20 Adopted 4-03-06
(a) Where public water supply systems
are not available, private well construction
shall be required to conform to Ch. NR 112,
Wis. Adm. Code.

and treatment system is not available, design
and construction of private sewage disposal
systems shall be governed by a private
sewage system ordinance adopted by the
county under Wis. Stats. §59.065.

evaluate the effect of the proposed use upon:
1. The maintenance of safe and
healthful conditions.

to existing or future access roads.
6. The need of the proposed use for a
shoreland location.

preferred;
b. Uses not inherently a source of
pollution within an area shall be preferred
over uses that are or may be a pollution
source;
c. Use locations within an area tending
to minimize the possibility of pollution shall
be preferred over use locations tending to
increase that possibility.
(c) Conditions Attached to Special
Exceptions. Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board of Appeals
shall attach such conditions, in addition to
those required elsewhere in this ordinance,
as are necessary to further the purposes of
this ordinance. Violations of any of these
conditions shall be deemed a violation of
this ordinance. Such conditions may include
specifications for, without limitation
because of specific enumeration: type of
shore cover; specific sewage disposal and
water supply facilities; landscaping and
planting screens; period of operation;
operational control; sureties; deed
restrictions; location of piers, docks, parking
and signs; and type of construction. To
secure information upon which to base its
determination, the Board of Appeals may
require the applicant to furnish, in addition
to the information required for a zoning
permit, the following information:
1. A plan of the area showing surface
contours, soil types, ordinary high water
marks, ground water conditions, subsurface
geology, and vegetative cover.
2. Location of buildings, parking areas,
traffic access, driveways, walkways, piers,
open space, and landscaping.

application for a special exception permit,
the Board of Appeals shall hold a public
hearing. Notice of such public hearing,
specifying the time, place, and matters to
come before the Board, shall be given as a
Class 2 notice under Wis. Stats. Ch. 985.
Such notice shall be provided to the
appropriate district office of the department
at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.
The Board shall state in writing the grounds
for granting or refusing a special exception
permit.
(e) Recording. When a special
exception permit is approved, an appropriate
record shall be made of the land use and
structures permitted and such permit shall be
applicable solely to the structures, use, and
property so described. A copy of any
decision on a special exception permit shall
be provided to the appropriate district office
of the Department within ten (10) days after
it is granted or denied.
(f) Revocation. Where the conditions of
a special exception permit are violated, the
special exception permit shall be revoked by
the Board of Appeals.
(6) Variances. The Board of Appeals
may grant upon appeal a variance from the
dimensional standards of this ordinance
where an applicant convincingly
demonstrates that:
1. Literal enforcement of the provisions
of the ordinance will result in unnecessary
hardship on the applicant;
2. The hardship is due to special
conditions unique to the property; and
3. Such variance is not contrary to the
public interest.
(a) No Use Variance. A variance shall
not grant or increase any use of property
which is prohibited in the zoning district.

following procedure shall be followed to
create or amend an ordinance in the Village.
(1) Proposed Village ordinances should
be:
(a) prepared in writing.
(b) carefully drafted, edited and revised,
if possible, by the appropriate Village
committee, the appropriate Village officers
and finally the Board. If necessary, the
Village Attorney should be asked by the
Board to review, draft, edit, and comment
upon the proposed ordinance.
(c) enacted in open session of the Board
and in full compliance with the open
meeting law. Two (2) readings of the
ordinance at successive meetings shall be
required unless a properly noticed public
hearing was held to apprise the public that
an ordinance change was being
contemplated by the Board. In the case of
an ordinance noticed by a public hearing, the
Board may dispense with the required
second (2nd) reading. In the case of an
emergency, this dual reading requirement
may be waived by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of
the Board, thus dispensing with the second
(2nd) reading.
(d) enacted by a majority vote of a
quorum of the Board present and voting at
the time of the enactment of the ordinance.
If certain Board members abstain from a
vote, the record should note the abstention
and the reasons for abstention, if any.
(e) enacted by a motion to enact, a
second (2nd) to the motion, discussion on the
ordinance, and then a roll call vote of the
Board. Amendments to the ordinance
Village of Suamico
25-General Provisions Page 2 of 7 Adopted 1-21-08
should be in written form and should be
offered for enactment of the final ordinance.
(2) at the time of enactment, the
ordinance should advisably contain:
(a) the title of the ordinance;
(b) an intent or proper clause describing
the intent or purpose of the ordinance;
(c) a statutory authority clause
describing the general or specific statutory
authority for the Board to enact the
ordinance;
(d) a definition section;
(e) the body of the document, including
exceptions to coverage under the ordinance,
including the procedural process to be
followed under the ordinance and including
any applicability provision that describe
specific items covered by the ordinance;
(f) the enforcement and penalties
provision;
(g) the effective date and the
termination date, if any; and
(h) the date of publication or posting.
(3) The Village ordinance, once
enacted,
(a) shall be signed by the President and
signed, attested, certified, and dated by the
Clerk.
(b) shall be published or posted by the
Village pursuant to Wis. Stat. §61.50 or
§66.0103.
(c) shall have the affidavit of
publication or posting attached to it.
(d) shall be recorded in the Ordinance
Record Book, pursuant to Wis. Stats.
§889.04.
(4) The Village ordinance, once
enacted, pursuant to Wis. Stats. §61.50,
(a) shall be effective the day after
publication or the day after posting or at a
later date, if the later date is expressly so
provided in the ordinance.
(b) once enacted by the Board, if the
ordinance imposes a forfeiture, shall be
published and not posted pursuant to Wis.
Stats. §61.50.
(c) The Village ordinance, once enacted,
if the ordinance is posted, the Clerk shall
sign an affidavit attesting that the item was
posted as required by Wis. Stats. §61.50 and
the affidavit shall state the date and places of
posting. This affidavit shall be filed with
other records under the jurisdiction of the
Clerk.
(5) Failure to follow all of the forgoing
steps in creating or amending an ordinance
shall not render the ordinance invalid
providing a good faith effort was made to
comply with this ordinance when creating or
changing an ordinance.
25.02 CONSTRUCTION OF
ORDINANCES. In the construction of the
ordinances of the Village, the following
rules shall be observed unless such
construction would be inconsistent with the
manifest intent of the ordinance.
(1) General Rule. All words and
phrases shall be construed and understood
according to common and approved usage of
the language; but technical words and
phrases and such others as may have
acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning
in the law shall be construed and understood
according to such peculiar and appropriate
meaning.

the word "person" extends and applies to
natural persons, firms, corporations,
associations, or partnerships or other bodies
politic and corporate and to all entities
capable of being sued.
(3) Tense. The use of any verb in the
present tense shall include the future, when
applicable.
(4) Shall Have Been. The words "shall
have been" include past and future cases.
(5) Acts by Agents. When an
ordinance requires an act to be done which
may be done by an agent as by the principal,
such requirement shall be construed to
Village of Suamico
25-General Provisions Page 3 of 7 Adopted 1-21-08
include all such acts when done by an
authorized agent.
(6) Reasonable Time. In all cases
where any ordinance requires any act to be
done in reasonable time or notice or
reasonable notice to be given, such
reasonable time or notice shall be deemed to
mean time only as may be necessary for the
prompt performance of such duty or
compliance with such notice.
(7) Time, How Computed. When
expressed in days, the time within which an
act is to be done as provided in any
ordinance or in any order issued pursuant to
any ordinance shall be computed by
excluding the first (1st) day and including
the last, provided if the last day is Sunday it
shall be excluded; and when any such time
is expressed in hours, the whole of Sunday,
from midnight (12 a.m.) to midnight (12
a.m.), shall be excluded.
(8) Week. The word "week" shall be
construed to mean seven (7) days; but
publication in a newspaper of any notice or
other matter indicated to be for a stated
number of weeks shall be construed to mean
one (1) insertion in each week unless
specifically stated to be for each day of the
week or for more than one (1) day in each
week; and all publications heretofore made
in accordance with the terms of this
subsection are hereby validated.

ordinance which contains express provision
excluding such construction or when the
subject matter or context of such ordinance
may be repugnant thereto.
25.04 EFFECT TO REPEAL. When any
ordinance repealing a former ordinance,
clause, or provision shall be itself repealed,
such repeal shall not be construed to revive
such former ordinance, clause, or provision,
unless it shall be expressly so provided.
25.05 CLERK TO FILE DOCUMENTS
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.
Whenever in this code any standard, rule,
regulation, or other written or printed matter
is adopted by reference, it shall be deemed
incorporated in this code as if fully set forth
herein and the Clerk shall file, deposit and
keep in his or her office a copy of the code,
standard, rule, regulation, or other written or
printed matter as adopted. Materials so
filed, deposited, and kept shall be public
records open for examination with proper
care by any person during the Clerk's office
hours, subject to such orders or regulations
which the Clerk may prescribe for their
preservation.
25.06 PENALTY; PENALTY WHERE
NO PENALTY PROVIDED. In any case
where there shall be a violation of any
Village ordinance for which no penalty is
provided, the person violating the same shall
be subject to a forfeiture of not less than ten
dollars ($10) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500) for each offense. In addition,
upon failure to pay said forfeiture and costs,
a person may be confined in the Brown
County Jail for a period not to exceed ninety
(90) days or until said forfeiture and costs
are paid. Except as provided in the
following subsections:

section of an ordinance of the Village shall
not provide a greater penalty for a second
(2nd) or subsequent conviction for a violation
thereof, any person violating the same who
Village of Suamico
25-General Provisions Page 4 of 7 Adopted 1-21-08
shall previously have been convicted of a
violation thereof shall be subject to a
forfeiture of not less than ten dollars ($10)
nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000)
for each offense; except where the penalty
provided by any such ordinance or section
for a first (1st) violation thereof shall be
larger than the penalty herein provided, such
larger penalty shall be applicable.
(2) No violation of any ordinance of the
Village shall be or shall be construed to be a
misdemeanor, nor shall imprisonment be
imposed as a punishment for violation of
any ordinance of the Village except for
failure of the defendant to pay the forfeiture
imposed by the court, any other provision of
the general ordinances of the Village to be
contrary notwithstanding.
25.07 OFFENSES COMMITTED AND
PENALTIES INCURRED PREVIOUS
TO REPEAL. No offense committed and
no penalty of forfeiture incurred previous to
the time when any of the ordinances
aforesaid shall be affected by such repeal;
provided when any punishment, forfeiture,
or penalty shall have been mitigated by the
provisions of these general ordinances, such
provision shall apply to and control any

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Village of Suamico Stormwater
Reference Guide (Reference Guide) has
been created to act as a companion to the
Village of Suamico Model Construction Site
Erosion Control Ordinance (Ordinance).
The Ordinance cites the Reference Guide as
the resource for details that were omitted
from the model Ordinance due to the
potential for variations in each
municipalitys permitting process and level
of expertise in regard to the Ordinance.
Items in the Reference Guide can be
changed without the public hearing process
as the changes are typically administrative
and/or technical and do not affect the
Ordinances intent and requirements. The
Reference Guide is organized similar to the
Construction Site Erosion Control
Ordinance for ease of relating the comments
in the Reference Guide to the appropriate
sections in the Ordinance.

NRCS, and several other states to develop a
Windows version of RUSLE2 for
construction site erosion control. Until this
software is available for statewide use,
BMPs shall be designed using the technical
standards listed in S.06. The Wisconsin
Department of Commerce (COMM) is using
the RUSLE2 spreadsheet developed by
Dane County until the new RUSLE2
software is available. Use of the spreadsheet
is not required by COMM but is encouraged
(http://commerce.wi.gov/sb/SBSoilErosionControlProgram.
html).
Design Clarifications:
Erosion Control Practices  Erosion control
practices are used to prevent sediment
particles from becoming dislodged and
suspended in runoff. Erosion control
practices include land application of
polyacrylamide, mulching, seeding, and
erosion mats. Grading practices can be used
to supplement these practices.
Village of Suamico
Appendix D Page 4 of 9 5-7-08
Sediment Control Practices  Sediment
control practices are used to remove
sediment particles that are suspended in
runoff and being transported. Sediment
control practices used for sheet flow
conditions include vegetative buffers,
sediment bale barriers (non-channel), and
silt fence. Sediment control practices used
for concentrated flow conditions include
storm drain inlet protection (< one (1) acre),
ditch checks (< one (1) acre), sediment traps
(< five (5) acres), sediment basins (< one
hundred (100) acres), and polymers.
Sediment control practices used for lakes,
rivers, and streams include turbidity barriers
and silt curtains.
Construction Site Diversions  Construction
site diversions are used to divert clear water
runoff away from disturbed areas.
Construction site diversions are also
designed to convey sediment-laden runoff
from disturbed areas to sediment control
practices such as ditch checks, sediment
traps, and sediment basins.
Dust Control Practices  Dust control
practices are used to prevent wind erosion.
De-Watering  De-watering practices are
used to remove sediment from ponding
surface water or groundwater. A DNR
permit is required for pumping seventy (70)
gpm or more
(http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/dwg/hicap.html
). The discharge must be sampled in
accordance with DNR requirements.
Non-Erosive Flows  Velocity dissipation
devices shall be placed at outfall locations
and along the length of any channel, as
necessary, to provide a non-erosive flow so
that the natural, physical, and biological
characteristics and functions are maintained
and protected. Velocity dissipation devices
could include erosion mat (channel), riprap,
drop structures, stilling basins, and other
energy dissipation devices.
Maximum Permissible Velocities for Channels
Channel Cover Slope Range % Erosion-Resistant Soils Easily Eroded Soils
Bare Soil 0-5 3-6 fps* 1.5-2 fps*

0-5 3.5 fps 2.5 fps
Use on slopes steeper than 5% is not recommended.
*Maximum permissible velocities depend on specific soil properties and shear stress. Typically, the maximum velocity for sand = 1.5 fps, silt
and loam = 1.7 to 2.5 fps, fine gravel = 2.5 fps, clay = 3.7 fps, coarse gravel = 4.0 fps, cobbles = 3.7 to 5.0 fps, and shale/hard pan = 6.0 fps.

Exam, Ninth Edition
Materials  No sediment or solid materials,
including building materials, may be
discharged in violation of the following
federal, state, and local regulations:
? Navigation, Dams, & Bridges
(Chapter 30 and 31, Stats.)
? Wetland Water Quality Standards
(NR 103)
? Wetlands (U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Section 404 regulations)
? Shoreland Management (NR 115,
NR 117, & local regulations)
? Floodplain Management (NR 116 &
local regulations).
Wetland Delineations  Wetland
delineations shall be performed by a
professional soil scientist, professional
hydrologist, or other qualified individual
approved by the administering authority.
The individual performing the delineation
shall classify the wetland as a less
susceptible wetland, highly susceptible
wetland, exceptional resource water, or
outstanding resource water.
Protective Areas  Protective areas may be
disturbed as part of a construction project, if
necessary. Disturbed areas must be
stabilized from erosion and restored with
self-sustaining vegetation. Best
management practices (ponds, swales, etc.)
may be located in protective areas.
Type of Vegetation  It is recommended that
seeding of non-invasive vegetative cover be
used in the protective areas. Vegetation that
is flood and drought tolerant and can
provide long-term bank stability because of
an extensive root system is preferable.
Vegetative cover can be measured using the
line transect method described in the
University of Wisconsin Extension
publication number A3533, titled
Estimating Residue Using the Line
Transect Method.
Adjacent Property Owners  If a stream or
channel is permanently placed or relocated
along a property line, an easement or letter
of permission is required from any property
owners impacted by the protective areas
new location. Also, if a stormwater facility
or structure is proposed within an onsite
stream or channel, one hundred (100) year
flood elevations shall be evaluated to
determine if offsite property owners are
impacted by backwater or a flood elevation
increase. An easement or letter of
permission is required from any property
owners impacted by backwater. Changes to
a stream, wetland, or channel should be
discussed during the pre-design meeting.
Changes to a navigable stream, wetland or
other waters of the state will require permits
from the DNR, Army Corps of Engineers,
and local municipality.
Agricultural Activity Areas  Agricultural
activity areas (i.e. farm fields and other
cropland areas) are exempt from the
ordinance.
Agricultural Production Areas 
Agricultural production areas (i.e. farm
buildings, structures, and other impervious
surfaces) are exempt if the disturbed area is
less than one (1) acre. Sites where the land
disturbance is one (1) acre or more shall
meet the requirements of this ordinance.
Sites where the disturbance is less than one
(1) acre shall have a drainage plan prepared
that is appropriate for the site. The County
Land Conservation Department (LCD) may
be available to prepare erosion and sediment
control plans for farm structures and
disturbances in the non-cropland areas.
Construction of farm structures and
disturbances in non-cropland areas one (1)
acre or greater must also be covered by an
NR 216 permit.
(b) Sites with less than One (1) Acre of
Land Disturbance. Pursuant to 1.07(5) of
Village of Suamico
Appendix D Page 6 of 9 5-7-08
the ordinance, the municipality may
establish erosion control requirements more
stringent than those set forth in this section
if the municipality determines that an added
level of protection is needed.
Design Clarifications:
For a construction site with less than one (1)
acre of land disturbance, the applicant shall
install best management practices to prevent
or reduce all of the following:
1. Tracking of sediment onto streets by
vehicles.
2. Discharge of sediment into stormwater
inlets.
3. Discharge of sediment into abutting
waters of the state.
4. Discharge of sediment from drainage
ways that flow off the site.
5. Discharge of sediment by de-watering
activities.
6. Discharge of sediment from soil
stockpiles existing for more than seven (7)
days.
7. Properly use, store and dispose of
building materials, chemicals, cement,
concrete truck washout, litter, sanitary
waste, and other compounds and materials
used on the construction site.
8. Construction sites also regulated by the
Wisconsin Department of Commerce are
required to achieve a forty percent (40%)
sediment reduction for sites with less than
one (1) acre of land disturbance. See
COMM 60.20(3)(c) and COMM
21.125(3)(c) for specific requirements.
(4) Location. A regional wet detention
pond (post-construction site) may be used as
a sediment basin (construction site) until
final stabilization of the wet detention pond
and expiration of the erosion control permit
associated with construction of the regional
wet detention pond. While regional
stormwater management facilities are
appropriate for control of post-construction
pollutants, they should not be used for
construction site sediment removal at other
construction sites located within the wet
detention ponds watershed.
(5) Alternate Requirements.
1.08 PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS,
PROCEDURES, AND FEES.
(1) Permit Required.
(2) Permit Application and Fees.
(3) Review and Approval of Permit
Application. Meetings between the permit
applicant, designer, and plan reviewer are
encouraged during the pre-design, design,
and plan review process. The meetings are
used to educate each other about regulatory
requirements, environmentally sensitive
areas, and design challenges. The number
of meetings held is typically commensurate
with the size and complexity of the project.
Meetings can be face-to-face or via
telephone.
A pre-construction conference is encouraged
before the start of all construction projects.
For sites with one (1) acre or more of land
disturbance, a pre-construction conference is
required. The permit applicant, designer,
plan reviewer, contractor, and inspector are
encouraged to attend. The purpose of the
meeting is to exchange contact information,
review the erosion and sediment control
plan, and identify individuals responsible for
permit compliance, plan amendments, and
weekly inspection reports.
(4) Surety Bond. Construction sites
with one (1) acre or more of land
disturbance are required to have a financial
guarantee. The financial guarantee includes
the cost associated with erosion and
sediment control BMPs, site inspections,
project administration, and contingencies.
Construction sites with less than one (1) acre
of land disturbance are not typically required
to have a financial guarantee.
Portions of the financial guarantee may be
released as the construction project
Village of Suamico
Appendix D Page 7 of 9 5-7-08
progresses. The last portion of the financial
guarantee is not released until the municipal
inspector performs a final inspection and the
permit applicant pays final inspection fees.
(5) Permit Requirements. The permit
applicant is required to post the Certificate
of Permit Coverage in a conspicuous place
at the construction site.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The VILLAGEOF SUAMICO Stormwater Reference Guide (Reference Guide) has been created to act as
a companion to the VILLAGE OF SUAMICO Model Post-Construction Stormwater Management
Ordinance (Ordinance). The Ordinance cites the Reference Guide as the resource for details that were
omitted from the model Ordinance due to the potential for variations in each municipalitys permitting
process and level of expertise in regard to the Ordinance. Items in the Reference Guide can be changed
without the public hearing process as the changes are typically administrative and/or technical and do not
affect the Ordinances intent and requirements. The Reference Guide is organized similar to the Post-
Construction Stormwater Management Ordinance for ease of relating the comments in the Reference
Guide to the appropriate sections in the ordinance.

(3) EXCLUSIONS
The Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) has entered into a memorandum
of understanding with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources that satisfies s.
281.33 (2), Wis. Stats., such that activities directed and supervised by WisDOT are
exempt from this Ordinance.
Activities directed and supervised by the local municipality are covered by this Ordinance.
S.05 DEFINITIONS
Biofiltration system means a bioretention system which does not qualify for any infiltration credit
pursuant to S.07(3)(c) of the Post-Construction Stormwater Management Ordinance.
Structural height means the difference in elevation in feet between the point of lowest elevation of
the top of the embankment before overtopping and the lowest elevation of the downstream toe of
embankment.
S.06 TECHNICAL STANDARDS
Below is a list of technical standards and guidance documents that shall be used to satisfy
performance standards contained in the ordinance. Technical standards specify the minimum criteria
for a best management practice (BMP). Guidance documents contain recommendations and
additional how to guidance. Performance standards take precedence over technical standards and
technical standards take precedence over guidance documents.
(a) Technical Standards: The following are applicable Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) Conservation Practice Standards or Technical Standards:
? 1001 Wet Detention Basin
? 1002 Site Evaluation for Stormwater Infiltration
? 1003 Infiltration Basin
? 1004 Bioretention for Infiltration
? 1005 Vegetated Infiltration Swale
? 1006 Method for Predicting the Efficiency of Proprietary Stormwater
Sedimentation Devices
? 1100 Interim Turf Nutrient Management
These standards may be found on the DNR website at
http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/wm/nps/stormwater/techstds.htm
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 4 of 33
(b) Local Modifications to Technical Standards: The following are local requirements which
are intended to supplement, clarify, or supersede DNR technical standards.
1001 - Wet Detention Basin
Dry Detention Basin-
Dry detention ponds shall be designed to meet requirements in Technical
Standard 1001, except criteria contained in Sections V.A.2, V.B., and V.C.
Dry detention ponds shall be designed to meet the local modifications provided
below for Technical Standard 1001, except permanent pool and extended
detention volume criteria.
Dry detention ponds shall not receive any water quality or TSS credit, unless
written approval is obtained from the DNR. The approval letter must specifically
indicate the amount of TSS credit provided by the dry pond.
Dry detention pond shall have a minimum bottom slope to the principal outlet of
one percent (1%). The applicant may request a waiver if site characteristics
create a hardship.
As part of the operation & maintenance plan, sediment accumulation in the dry
pond shall be monitored. Accumulated sediment shall be removed when five
percent (5%) to ten percent (10%) of the storage volume is lost for the two (2)
year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm.
Pond Watershed-
Wet ponds are not recommended for small watersheds (< fifteen (15) acres in
clay soil). A wet pond located in a small watershed may develop stagnation
problems and become a public nuisance. Public acceptance of stormwater
BMPs is important to the success of a local stormwater program. Dry ponds,
biofiltration, proprietary devices, and other BMPs are recommended for small
watersheds.
One Hundred (100) Year Floodplain-
Wet and dry detention ponds shall not be located in a one hundred (100) year
floodway or one hundred (100) year flood storage area unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic study is conducted in accordance with NR 116. Easements will be
required if the flood study indicates the one hundred (100) year floodway or flood
storage area is impacted by the pond or its embankment. Ponds shall not
impede one hundred (100) year flood conveyance along navigable streams and
non-navigable channels.
Permanent Pool-
Pool Shape  A minimum length to width ratio of three to one (3:1) is required
between the principal inlet and principal outlet. The applicant may request a
waiver if site characteristics create a hardship. Redevelopment and pond retrofit
projects may be eligible for a waiver. Typically, new development is not eligible
for a waiver.
Liner  If soils are more permeable than a saturated hydraulic conductivity of
1x10-5 cm/sec, a liner is needed to maintain permanent pool levels. If soils are
tighter than a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1x10-7 cm/sec, no liner is
needed (e.g. sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or
clay). A risk analysis shall be conducted if soils are between a saturated
hydraulic conductivity of 1x10-5 cm/sec and 1x10-7 cm/sec. The risk analysis
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE

shall include proximity to public wells (four hundred feet (400)) and private wells
(one hundred feet (100), depth to groundwater and bedrock, and source
pollutants (Tier 1 & Tier 2 Industries, fueling and maintenance areas). Liner
materials can be soil, bentonite or synthetic.
Aerators  Generally, aerators are not allowed unless written approval is
obtained from the Wisconsin DNR. The approval letter must specifically state the
proposed aerators are acceptable.
Extended Detention Volume-
Disregard Section V.A.2.b(2) of Technical Standard 1001. If the wet ponds
pollutant removal is not determined with SLAMM or P8, the one (1) year, twentyfour
(24) hour design storm shall be released from the wet pond using the
following formula:
Qoutflow = Vs * SA
Qoutflow = maximum allowable one (1) year discharge rate (cfs)
Vs = 5.12 x 10-5 ft/sec settling velocity
SA = surface area of permanent pool (square feet)
Peak Flow Control-
Do not use Table 2 in Technical Standard 1001. Use the maximum predevelopment
runoff curve numbers contained in the Post-Construction
Stormwater Management Ordinance.
It is recommended that the developer and designer contact the local municipality
to discuss peak discharge requirements for the site early in the design process.
The local municipality may have adopted alternative peak discharge
requirements for the site which are different than the Post-Construction
Stormwater Management Ordinance. At a minimum, the peak discharge
requirements contained in NR 151 shall be met.
Inflows-
Pipe inlets shall be protected from soil washouts due to seepage along the pipes
granular bedding and backfill. Riprap or other protection shall be placed around
the entire pipe perimeter.
Other inflow points shall be protected from scour and erosion.
Principal Outlet-
All flows shall pass through the principal outlet during the two (2) year and ten
(10) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storms. The principal outlet shall consist
of one (1) or more flow control structures and discharge pipes.
Pipes  Generally concrete, PVC, or CMP are the preferred pipe materials.
Corrugated PE will tend to jack-up due to frost heave and flotation. The
minimum recommended pipe diameter is twelve inches (12).
Orifices  Orifices smaller than four inches (4) are not recommended due to the
potential for clogging. Consider using a six-inch (6) perforated drain pipe and
restrictor plate (refer to Section V.B.8 of Technical Standard 1004 for guidance).
The total opening area of all perforation holes combined shall be sufficient to
allow the drain pipe to discharge at full capacity, as would occur if there were no
orifice restriction. Backfilling the drain pipe with one-inch (1) washed stone
provides protection from clogging.
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 6 of 33
Trash racks or other equivalent litter control devices are required for all outlet
openings that control the two (2) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm. The
maximum bar spacing shall be less than two inches (2) and less than one-half
(½) the smallest opening dimension, whichever is more restrictive. The minimum
surface area for the trash rack shall be five (5) to ten (10) times the outlets cross
sectional area to prevent clogging. Trash racks keep litter and debris in the pond
and prevent it from discharging into streams, rivers, and lakes.
Trash racks are also required for other outlet openings that have a width, height,
or diameter less than twelve inches (12). The maximum bar spacing shall be
less than one-half (½) the smallest opening dimension. The minimum surface
area for the trash rack shall be at five (5) to ten (10) times the outlets cross
sectional area to prevent clogging.
Reverse-sloped pipes and other underwater outlets may impact a wet ponds
TSS removal efficiency. Outlets that draw water from below the permanent
pools surface elevation reduce the effective surface area and depth of the
permanent pool. If reverse-sloped pipes and other underwater outlets are used,
special consideration is required for SLAMM & P8 modeling to ensure accurate
water quality results. Also, underwater outlets may freeze during winter.
Flap Gates-
Flap gates are required if the two (2) year or ten (10) year, twenty-four (24) hour
design storm flows backward through the principal outlet. Backwater from a
down slope conveyance system may impact a ponds water quality and/or flood
control performance.
Flap gates are not required if the permanent pools water surface elevation is
higher than the ten (10) year water elevation at the pond outlet (i.e. tailwater).
Flap gates may be required if the permanent pools water surface elevation is
lower than the ten (10) year water elevation at the pond outlet (i.e. tailwater). If
hydrographs are available for the tailwater condition, an evaluation can be
performed to determine if flap gates are required due to backwater. If
hydrographs are not available, flap gates are required.
Flap gates shall not impede flow in down slope channels or streams.
Ice accumulation within the down slope conveyance system shall be considered
during flap gate and principal outlet design.
Tailwater-
Tailwater conditions shall be evaluated at the pond outlet.
Tailwater conditions along lakes, rivers, and streams may be obtained from
available one hundred (100) year floodplain studies.
Tailwater conditions may require that two (2), ten (10), and/or one hundred (100)
year, twenty-four (24) hour runoff volumes be held in the pond, without release,
until the down slope hydrograph allows the pond and flap gate to discharge flow.
It is recommended that the designer contact the local municipality to discuss
tailwater conditions early in the design process. The local municipality may have
information available to assist with the tailwater evaluation.
Emergency Spillway-
The routed two (2) year and ten (10) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm
may not pass through the emergency spillway. The routed one hundred (100)
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 7 of 33
year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm may not pass through the emergency
spillway if the pond is designed to have a:
? Structural height > six feet (6) and flood storage capacity > fifty (50)
acre-feet, or
? Structural height > twenty-five feet (25) and flood storage capacity >
fifteen (15) acre-feet.
Backwater from a down slope conveyance system may not pass through the
emergency spillway during the two (2) year or ten (10) year, twenty-four (24) hour
design storm. Also, backwater may not pass through the emergency spillway
during the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour design storm, unless a
hydrologic and hydraulic evaluation indicates the sites peak discharge
requirements are still satisfied, despite the backwater.
When feasible, the emergency spillway should not be constructed on an
embankment or over fill material. Spillways constructed on an embankment or
over fill material are more prone to failure.
The emergency spillway shall be constructed of permanent materials (i.e. poured
concrete, grouted riprap, articulated concrete block, etc.) if the spillway is
constructed on an embankment. The permanent material shall extend from the
top of embankment to the down slope toe of embankment. The permanent
material shall be shaped to contain flows and reduce potential for erosion and
embankment failure.
Topsoil & Seeding-
Topsoil is required in the safety shelf to encourage wetland plant growth (twelveinch
(12) minimum thickness).
When feasible, install a wetland seed mix or mature plants in the safety shelf to
improve pond safety, reduce wave erosion along the shoreline, improve pollutant
removal, and discourage geese residence. Use non-invasive species.
When feasible, maintain a high grass buffer around the permanent pools
perimeter. The high grass buffer will further improve pond safety and geese
control. Also, the perimeter of the permanent pool is typically the most difficult
area to mow due to saturated soil conditions.
Record Drawings-
Surveyed record drawings certified by a Professional Engineer shall be submitted
upon completion of construction of all wet and dry ponds. As part of the record
drawings, the Professional Engineer may need to verify BMP performance using
computer modeling. Refer to record drawing checklist for requirements.
1002 - Site Evaluation for Stormwater Infiltration
A site layout should not be developed until Step B is complete. Information
obtained from Step B is used to:
? Identify soil textures within the site.
? Identify infiltration exclusions and exemptions.
? Develop a site layout and identify potential infiltration device locations.
For Step B, the minimum number of initial test pits or soil borings required for a
new development area are as follows:
? Two (2) for the initial ten (10) acres, plus one (1) per ten (10) acres
thereafter.
? One (1) per soil unit. Soil units are depicted on NRCS Soil Survey Maps.
? Example calculations:
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 8 of 33
o Four (4) acres with one (1) soil unit = min. of two (2) test pits or
soil borings
o Twenty (20) acres with two (2) soil units = min. of three (3) test
pits or soil borings.
o Twenty (20) acres with five (5) soil units = min. of five (5) test pits
or soil borings.
o Thirty-four (34) acres with three (3) soil units = min. of four (4)
test pits or soil borings.
Upon completion of Step B, it is recommended that the developer and designer
meet with the municipality to discuss infiltration requirements for the development
to avoid redesign during permit submittal.
Information obtained from Step C is used to design each infiltration device. As
part of Step C, a second (2nd) set of test pits or soil borings are required. Refer
to Table 1, Technical Standard 1002 for test pit or soil boring requirements.
1003 - Infiltration Basin
Record Drawings  Surveyed record drawings certified by a Professional
Engineer shall be submitted upon completion of construction of all infiltration
basins. As part of the record drawings, the Professional Engineer may need to
verify BMP performance using computer modeling. Refer to record drawing
checklist for requirements.
1004 - Bioretention for Infiltration
Biofiltration systems shall be designed to meet requirements in Technical
Standard 1004, except for the storage layer and sand/native soil interface layer.
Also, the engineered soil planting bed may be reduced to a thirty-inch (30)
thickness.
Rain gardens shall be designed to meet requirements in Technical Standard
1004, except for the engineered soil planting bed, storage layer, underdrain, and
sand/native soil interface layer. Rain gardens are typically used in residential
areas. Rain gardens are primarily intended for roof runoff, but may also be used
for lawn, sidewalk and driveway runoff.
SLAMM, P8 or an equivalent methodology shall be used to evaluate the TSS
reduction associated with a bioretention, biofiltration, or rain garden BMP.
Record Drawings  Surveyed record drawings certified by a Professional
Engineer shall be submitted upon completion of construction of all bioretention
and biofiltration facilities. As part of the record drawings, the Professional
Engineer may need to verify BMP performance using computer modeling. Also,
as part of the record drawings, the contractor shall certify the bioretention or
biofiltration device was constructed in accordance with the approved construction
plans and that the installed engineered soil complies with the material
specifications. Refer to record drawing checklist for requirements.
1005  Vegetated Infiltration Swale
Grass swales shall meet the following design criteria if the applicant plans to take
credit for TSS reductions calculated by SLAMM or P8.
Bottom Width Trapezoid or parabolic shape with max. 6 ft. width
Side Slopes 4:1 or flatter for triangular shaped swales (waiver
is needed if steeper)
3:1 or flatter for trapezoidal channels (waiver is
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 9 of 33
needed if steeper)
Longitudinal Slope 4% maximum (waiver is needed if steeper)
Flow Velocity 1.5 fps or less for 2-year storm. The vegetation
type, mowing height, depth of flow, and O&M Plan
must be consistent with the selected Mannings n
value.
? The grass swale infiltration rate used in SLAMM or P8 shall be obtained
from Table 2, Technical Standard 1002. The design infiltration rate shall
be based on the most confining soil layer within five feet (5) of the grass
swales bottom elevation.
? Minimum longitudinal slope for a grass swale is one percent (1%). The
applicant may request a waiver if site characteristics create a hardship.
? Grass swales shall be designed for a two-inch (2) lawn height. If an
alternative height is desired, it is recommended that the developer and
designer contact the local municipality early in the design process to
obtain approval. The local municipality may have ordinances or other
design criteria which dictate the allowable mowing height.
? Driveway culverts shall be considered when the swale length (density) is
determined for purposes of SLAMM or P8 modeling. The maximum
allowable culvert length for each lot shall be specified on the plans.
? Minimize or mitigate soil compaction during grading activities.
? Grassed swales shall be designed for the proper drainage area.
Generally, it will be best to have one (1) or two (2) sizes to be used
wherever needed throughout the development. The design shall be
based on the largest drainage area served.
? Grassed swales shall be designed according to the planned vegetation
type and maintenance that will be provided. Generally, grassed
channels will be designed to have stable velocities when the vegetation
is shortest and adequate capacity when the vegetation is longest.
1006 - Method for Predicting the Efficiency of Proprietary Stormwater
Sedimentation Devices
The DNR is currently developing Technical Standard 1006 for proprietary
devices. Until this technical standard is complete, proprietary devices shall
comply with DNR guidance developed as part of the Meeting New State
Regulations: Post-Construction Stormwater Management Workshops.

(d) Local Easement Requirements:
Easements are typically required for BMPs and conveyance systems that serve more
than one (1) property owner or lot. Conveyance systems include storm sewers, grass
swales, channels, streams, and overland relief paths. Easement widths will vary.
An ingress/egress easement or direct access to a public street is typically required for
BMPs that serve more than one (1) property owner or lot.
It is recommended that the developer and designer contact the local municipality early in
the design process to discuss easements and width requirements.
S.07 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
(1) RESPONSIBLE PARTY
(2) PLAN
(3) REQUIREMENTS
(a) TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS
Post-construction sites with twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. or more of
impervious surface disturbance and post-construction sites with one (1) acre or
more of land disturbance are required to meet the ordinances numeric
performance standards. All other post-construction sites are not required to meet
these numeric performance standards. BMP design guidance is provided below
in Section (h) for sites with less than twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. of
impervious surface disturbance.
Computer Models:
Pollutant loading models such as SLAMM, DETPOND, P8 or an approved
equivalent methodology may be used to evaluate the efficiency of the design in
reducing total suspended solids. Information on how to access SLAMM and P8
is available at http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/wm/nps/models/SLAMM.htm or contact
the stormwater coordinator in the runoff management section of the bureau of
watershed management at (608) 267-7694.
Use the most recent version of SLAMM, DETPOND and P8. The applicant may
request a waiver of this requirement.
Design Clarifications:
No Controls  No Controls is the baseline condition for each site. No TSS
credit is provided for meeting the baseline condition. The baseline condition is
defined as follows:
Assume site is stabilized (no erosion).
Assume proposed impervious surfaces are in place. Impervious surface
reductions (e.g. reduced street width) cannot be used to claim TSS
credit; however, impervious surface reductions will lower runoff volumes
which will reduce the required size for stormwater management BMPs.
Assume no stormwater management BMPs.
Assume curb and gutter/storm sewer drainage system in fair condition.
If the applicant intends to claim TSS credit for disconnecting an
impervious surface, the No Controls condition shall be based on the
typical percent connected impervious values established by the DNR:

Disconnection  TSS credit is provided for runoff volume reductions associated
with disconnecting impervious surfaces beyond the typical percent connected
impervious values established by the DNR. In order to consider an impervious
surface as disconnected, the following criteria shall be met:
Residential Roofs: Discharge runoff over a minimum twenty-foot (20)
long pervious surface that is in good condition and graded for sheet flow.
Other Impervious Surfaces:
? Source area flow length may not exceed seventy-five feet (75).
? Source area and pervious area must be graded for sheet flow.
? Pervious area must be in good condition, have a slope less than
eight percent (8%), and have a flow length at least as long as the
contributing impervious areas length (but never less than twenty
feet (20)).

Street Sweeping & Catch Basin Cleaning  No TSS credit is provided for street
sweeping, catch basin cleaning, or other management type BMPs in new
development areas.
If Parking Lot: 50 feet long (must have sheet flow)
Conveyance
Then grass: At least 50 feet long, sheet flow
good condition, slope not to exceed 8%
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 12 of 33
Infiltration Rate  The design infiltration rate for a BMP shall be based on the
most confining soil layer within five feet (5) of the BMPs bottom elevation.
Infiltration rates shall be obtained from Table 2, Technical Standard 1002.
Grass Swale  The grass swale infiltration rate used in SLAMM or P8 shall be
obtained from Table 2, Technical Standard 1002. For SLAMM, the typical swale
geometry shall be entered in lieu of using the Wetted Width option. SLAMM will
calculate the Wetted Width for each rain event based on the typical swale
geometry.
Uncontrolled Areas  The performance standard for TSS is a site standard, not a
BMP standard. Often, a site contains uncontrolled areas that do not flow through
a BMP (e.g. wet pond, grass swale). Typically, it is necessary to increase the
TSS reduction provided by other onsite BMPs in order to offset or over
compensate for these uncontrolled areas.
Routine Maintenance Areas  No performance standard or TSS reduction is
required for routine maintenance areas. However, the applicant is responsible
for proper performance of onsite BMPs. In order to ensure proper BMP
performance, the applicant has two (2) options:
Divert the routine maintenance area around onsite BMPs, or
Include runoff volumes from the routine maintenance area in onsite BMP
calculations. However, no TSS credit is provided for the routine
maintenance area unless it is reclassified as redevelopment.
Offsite Drainage Areas  The applicant is not responsible for satisfying TSS
performance standards for offsite areas that drain into the project site. However,
the applicant is responsible for proper performance of onsite BMPs. In order to
ensure proper onsite BMP performance, the applicant has two (2) options:
Divert offsite runoff around onsite BMPs, or
Include offsite runoff volumes in onsite BMP calculations. The amount of
onsite TSS credit is determined by multiplying the BMPs percent TSS
reduction by the base TSS load for the onsite area.
Example Calculations:
The development site currently contains thirty (30) acres of institutional land uses
and seventy (70) acres of agricultural land uses. The entire one hundred (100)
acre site will be disturbed as part of the proposed project. Within the one
hundred (100) acre site, the developer plans to:
Redevelop twenty (20) acres (existing institutional) into a new
commercial area.
Conduct routine maintenance on ten (10) acres of existing asphalt
parking lot (existing institutional). Parking lot will be part of new
commercial area.
Develop seventy (70) acres (existing agriculture) into a new residential
area.
The No Controls or base TSS load is computed as follows:
Commercial area = twenty (20) acres x six hundred (600) lbs./acre =
twelve thousand (12,000) lbs.
Residential area = seventy (70) acres x four hundred (400) lbs./acre =
twenty-eight thousand (28,000) lbs.
No Controls TSS Load = forty thousand (40,000) lbs.
The TSS Reduction Required is computed as follows:
Commercial area = twelve thousand (12,000) lbs. x forty percent (40%)
(redevelopment) = four thousand eight hundred (4,800) lbs.
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 13 of 33
Residential area = twenty-eight thousand (28,000) lbs. x eighty percent
(80%) (new development) = twenty-two thousand four hundred (22,400)
lbs.
TSS Reduction Required = four thousand eight hundred (4,800) +
twenty-two thousand four hundred (22,400) / forty thousand (40,000)
= sixty-eight hundredths (0.68) or sixty-eight
percent (68%)
A wet pond is proposed for the site. The pond achieves an eighty percent (80%)
TSS reduction for its one hundred thirty (130) acre watershed. The one hundred
thirty (130) acre watershed includes twenty (20) acres of commercial area, ten
(10) acres of commercial parking lot, sixty (60) acres of residential area, and forty
(40) acres of offsite residential area.
Commercial area = twelve thousand (12,000) lbs. x eighty percent (80%)
(wet pond) = nine thousand six hundred (9,600) lbs.
Commercial parking lot = eight thousand (8,000) lbs. x eighty percent
(80%) (wet pond) = six thousand four hundred (6,400) lbs.
Residential area (sixty (60) acres) = twenty-four thousand (24,000) lbs. x
eighty percent (80%) (wet pond) = nineteen thousand two hundred
(19,200) lbs.
Offsite residential area = sixteen thousand (16,000) lbs. x eighty percent
(80%) (wet pond) = twelve thousand eight hundred (12,800) lbs.
Pond TSS Reduction = (nine thousand six hundred (9,600) + six
thousand four hundred (6,400) + nineteen thousand two hundred
(19,200) + twelve thousand eight hundred (12,800) / sixty thousand
(60,000)
= eight-tenths (0.8) or eighty percent (80%)
The TSS Reduction Provided is computed as follows:
Commercial area = twelve thousand (12,000) lbs. x eighty percent (80%)
(wet pond) = nine thousand six hundred (9,600) lbs.
Residential area (sixty (60) acres) = twenty-four thousand (24,000) lbs. x
eighty percent (80%) (wet pond) = nineteen thousand two hundred
(19,200) lbs.
Residential area (ten (10) acres) = four thousand (4,000) lbs. x zero
percent (0%) (uncontrolled) = zero (0) lbs.
TSS Reduction Provided = (nine thousand six hundred (9,600) +
nineteen thousand two hundred (19,200) + zero (0)) / forty thousand
(40,000) = seventy-two hundredths (0.72) or seventytwo
percent (72%)
Seventy-two percent (72%) > sixty-eight percent (68%), therefore the
TSS requirement is satisfied.
In the example, the ten (10) acre commercial parking lot could have been
included in the TSS Reduction Required and TSS Reduction Provided
calculations if it was reclassified as redevelopment, as opposed to routine
maintenance. The reclassification would have allowed the applicant to plan for
future reconstruction of the ten (10) acre commercial parking lot.
In the example, the forty (40) acre offsite residential area could have been
included in the TSS Reduction Required and TSS Reduction Provided
calculations if it was a regional pond, as opposed to an onsite pond. A regional
pond would have allowed the owner of the forty (40) acre offsite residential area
to take credit for the TSS reduction provided by the wet pond.
(b) PEAK DISCHARGE
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 14 of 33
Post-construction sites with twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. or more of
impervious surface disturbance and post-construction sites with one (1) acre or
more of land disturbance are required to meet the ordinances numeric
performance standards. All other post-construction sites are not required to meet
these numeric performance standards. BMP design guidance is provided below
in Section (h) for sites with less than twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. of
impervious surface disturbance.
Computer Models:
Peak discharge rates shall be evaluated using TR-55 methodology and a
computer model. NRCS recently released a new Windows version of TR-55
referred to as WinTR-55. Unfortunately, WinTR-55 has some unacceptable
restrictions in computing Tc and the computations for outlet structures are too
approximate to be useable. Therefore, WinTR-55 is not acceptable software.
Other software packages are acceptable if they match the results and
methodology of TR-55 (DOS version). There are multiple hydrology/pond routing
computer programs available. They must be approved by the administering
authority. Examples of common computer programs are HEC-HMS, XPSWMM,
HydroCAD, HydraFlow, PondPack, etc.
Each pre-development watershed shall be evaluated for peak discharge. It is not
accurate or necessary to link all of the pre-development watersheds to
determine the ultimate allowable discharge for the site. The allowable discharge
for each outfall shall be determined based on the individual pre-development
watershed as discussed more in depth below in TR-55 Methodology
Clarifications.
TR-55 Methodology Clarifications:
Time of Concentration (Tc)-
Pre-Development Requirements
The Tc route shall be the route that takes the longest time to reach
the outfall and not necessarily the furthest point in the watershed.
The Tc route shall be shown to scale on the pre-development
contours with each flow segment labeled.
The pre-development Tc should typically be at least thirty (30)
minutes in NE Wisconsin. This may not apply to small sites.
A Mannings n value of twenty-four hundredths (0.24) shall be used
for sheet flow meadow conditions. For redevelopment areas,
assume impervious surfaces do not exist.
The sheet flow length before development in NE Wisconsin is usually
two hundred fifty feet (250) to three hundred feet (300). This may
not apply to small sites.
For shallow concentrated flow, unpaved or paved shall be used to
represent vegetated swales and paved swales, respectively.
Post-Development Requirements
The Tc route shall incorporate and represent the development. If the
development is large, consider dividing the development into multiple
watersheds.
Tc will almost always be shorter after development.
The Tc route shall be shown to scale on the post-development
drainage plan with each flow segment labeled.
The sheet flow length after development will seldom be greater than
fifty feet (50) to one hundred feet (100) due to the grading around
homes and buildings. A sheet flow length of greater than one
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 15 of 33
hundred feet (100) requires approval from the reviewing authority
(except for large paved parking areas).
A Mannings n value of twenty-four hundredths (0.24) is appropriate
for sheet flow lawn conditions.
The minimum sheet flow slope shall be two percent (2%) for
residential lawns.
For shallow concentrated flow, unpaved or paved shall be used to
represent vegetated swales and paved swales, respectively.
The Tc flow path stops when it reaches the inflow of a wet or dry
detention basin.
The post-development Tc is important for determining the correct
storage volume required. See the Storage Volume for Detention
Basins section below.
Runoff Curve Numbers (CN)-
Pre-Development Requirements
The following curve numbers shall be used for meadow conditions:
Maximum Pre-Development Runoff Curve Numbers (meadow)
Hydrologic Soil Group A B C D
Curve Number 30 58 71 78
Existing concentrated wooded areas shall be modeled as Woods,
Good Hydrologic Condition with curve numbers of thirty (30), fiftyfive
(55), seventy (70), and seventy-seven (77) for hydrologic soil
groups A, B, C, and D, respectively.
Soil units can be found in the applicable County Soil Survey (or, if
provided, on the Municipalitys website.)
The appropriate hydrologic soil groups are located at the following
website: http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/County.aspx?State=WI

3. Select the appropriate soils for the site (hold the ctrl key for
multiple).
4. Select the report type (RUSLE2 Related Attributes or Water
Features) below to get the Hydrologic Group(s) for the site.
5. Select the Generate Report button.
**Notice that a number of soils have different hydrologic soil
groups than those shown in the original County USDA Soils
book. The Internet groups are the ones to use.
Post-Development Requirements
The runoff curve number for lawns shall be used for developed areas
that will be vegetated. Woods, wetland, or prairie areas preserved
with a recorded document may be modeled as such.
Pre/Post-Development Curve Number Determination for Permeable Soils
Refer to the Site Evaluation for Infiltration Report to verify that soils
mapped in hydrologic groups A or B are well drained. If not well
drained use the County USDA Soils Books hydrologic group
explanation to determine the appropriate hydrologic group.
If the existing site consists of multiple hydrologic groups, especially a
combination of highly permeable and non-permeable, consideration
shall be given to the proposed site balance cut/fill. See Appendix A
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 16 of 33
of TR-55 for discussion on disturbed soil profiles as a result of
urbanization.
Example: The site consists of thirty percent (30%) Hydrologic Group
A soils and seventy percent (70%) Hydrologic Group C soils. The
following scenarios shall be handled as noted:
1. If the site earthwork does not balance within the respective
Hydrologic Group and it is anticipated that the C soils will
be filled on the A soils, the C soil RCN shall be used.
2. If the site earthwork balances within each respective
Hydrologic Group and it is anticipated that offsite fill will be
required to achieve the desired dwelling elevations, the C
soil RCN shall be used.
3. If the site balances within each respective Hydrologic Group
and no or minimal fill is anticipated on the A soils,
compaction mitigation shall be provided.
Drainage Area-
Pre-Development Requirements
Determine the total contributing drainage area to the development,
including offsite properties.
If the pre-developed site consists of multiple drainage basins, each
outfall shall be evaluated for peak discharge.
Example:
The pre-development site shown below is forty (40) acres and consists of
two (2) drainage basins, each twenty (20) acres. Each outfall has a peak
discharge of four (4), eight (8), and twelve (12) cfs for the two (2), ten
(10), and one hundred (100) year design storms, respectively.
The post-development site shown below is the same forty (40) acres;
however, Outfall 1 now has thirty (30) acres draining to it and Outfall 2,
ten (10) acres.
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 17 of 33
The post-development discharges for Outfall 2 are three (3), six (6), and
nine (9) cfs for the two (2), ten (10), and one hundred (100) year design
storms, respectively. Outfall 2 meets the peak discharge requirements of
the Ordinance because the post-development peak discharges are
below the pre-development discharges for Outfall 2.
The post-development discharges for Outfall 1 are twelve (12), twentyfour
(24), and thirty-six (36) cfs for the two (2), ten (10), and one hundred
(100) year design storms, respectively. Outfall 1 does not meet the peak
discharge requirements of the Ordinance. Stormwater facilities have to
be installed to lower the post-development peak discharges to the predevelopment
discharges of four (4), eight (8), and twelve (12) cfs for the
two (2), ten (10), and one hundred (100) year design storms,
respectively.
Below is an example of appropriate Stormwater Management Plan
summary tables as required:
Pre-Development Peak Discharges
Design Storm 2-year 10-year 100-year
Outfall 1 4 cfs 8 cfs 12 cfs
Outfall 2 4 cfs 8 cfs 12 cfs

3.6 cfs
(12 cfs)
7.5 cfs
(24 cfs)
10.9 cfs
(36 cfs)
Outfall 2 3 cfs 6 cfs 9 cfs
Post-Development Requirements
The design of stormwater runoff control facilities shall be based on
the total contributing drainage area, not just the area being
developed. Any offsite drainage area must be included in the plan
facilities or safely diverted around the planned facilities.
Offsite contributing areas that are not diverted must use the meadow
condition runoff curve number for pre-development flow
computations whether the offsite area is presently developed or not.
Offsite contributing areas that are diverted shall use the highest
anticipated runoff curve number for the offsite area for a safe design.
Also, the diversion shall provide three-tenths (0.3) of a foot of
freeboard and assume ten percent (10%) settlement for the one
hundred (100) year flow. The conveyance shall be contained within
an easement. The discharge location for the diversion shall be at the
pre-developed outfall or at a stable location.
If more than thirty percent (30%) of the drainage area will be
impervious, it will often be necessary to divide the drainage area into
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 18 of 33
a pervious sub-area and impervious sub-area for correct
computation of peak flow.
Peak Discharge Method-
For Wisconsin, use the Type II, twenty-four (24) hour rainfall
distribution for design storms.
Natural depressions shall be evaluated or considered when
determining peak discharge rates for the predevelopment condition.
Storage Volume for Detention Basins (TR-55)-
The approximate storage-routing curves should not be used if the
adjustment for ponding (discussed above in the peak discharge
section) is used.
This manual method is good for determining quick estimates of the
effects of temporary detention on peak discharges. Computer
programs that utilize TR-20 provide more accurate methods of
analysis and routing.
The procedure should not be used to perform final design if an error
in storage of twenty-five percent (25%) cannot be tolerated. Figure
6-1 may significantly overestimate the required storage capacity.
When the peak outflow discharge is too close to post-development
peak inflow discharge, parameters that affect the rate of rise of a
hydrograph become especially significant.
Design Clarifications:
It is recommended that the developer and designer contact the local municipality
to discuss peak discharge requirements for the site early in the design process.
The local municipality may have adopted alternative peak discharge
requirements for the site which are different than the Post-Construction
Stormwater Management Ordinance. At a minimum, the peak discharge
requirements contained in NR 151 shall be met.
Outfalls  Performance standards for peak discharge shall be satisfied at each
outfall associated with the site. Written approval is required from down slope
property owners if post-development peak discharge rates are not less than or
equal to pre-development peak discharge rates at each outfall.
Disconnection  Disconnecting impervious surfaces can help achieve the peak
discharge requirement. Disconnecting impervious surfaces not only reduces
runoff volumes, but also increases time of concentrations. In order to consider
an impervious surface as disconnected, the following criteria shall be met:
Residential Roofs: Discharge runoff over a minimum twenty foot (20)
long pervious surface that is in good condition and graded for sheet flow.
Other Impervious Surfaces:
? Source area flow length may not exceed seventy-five feet (75).
? Source area and pervious area must be graded for sheet flow.
? Pervious area must be in good condition, have a slope less than
eight percent (8%), and have a flow length at least as long as the
contributing impervious areas length (but never less than twenty
feet (20)).
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE

Source: DNR Post-Construction Stormwater Management Workshops
Uncontrolled Areas  The performance standard for peak discharge is an outfall
standard. Often, a site contains an uncontrolled area for each outfall that does
not flow through a BMP (e.g. wet pond). Typically, it is necessary to increase the
peak discharge control provided by the onsite BMP in order to offset or over
compensate for the uncontrolled area.
Routine Maintenance Areas  No performance standard or peak discharge
reduction is required for routine maintenance areas. However, the applicant is
responsible for proper performance of onsite BMPs. In order to ensure proper
BMP performance, the applicant has two (2) options:
Divert the routine maintenance area around onsite BMPs, or
Include runoff volumes from the routine maintenance area in onsite BMP
calculations. For the predevelopment condition, routine maintenance
areas shall be modeled as a meadow land use. For the postdevelopment
condition, routine maintenance areas shall be modeled
using the actual site conditions.
(c) INFILTRATION
Post-construction sites with twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. or more of
impervious surface disturbance and post-construction sites with one (1) acre or
more of land disturbance are required to meet the ordinances numeric
performance standards. All other post-construction sites are not required to meet
these numeric performance standards. BMP design guidance is provided below
in Section (h) for sites with less than twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. of
impervious surface disturbance.
Computer Models:
A model that calculates runoff volume, such as RECARGA, SLAMM, P8, TR-55,
or an approved equivalent methodology may be used to evaluate the efficiency of
the infiltration design. Information on how to access RECARGA, SLAMM, or P8
is available at http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/wm/nps/models/index.htm or contact
the stormwater coordinator in the runoff management section of the bureau of
watershed management at (608) 267-7694.
Use the most recent version of RECARGA, SLAMM, and P8. The applicant may
request a waiver of this requirement.
Depending on the type of infiltration device, groundwater mounding may need to
be evaluated. Refer to Table 1, Technical Standard 1002 for groundwater
If Parking Lot: 50 feet long (must have sheet flow)
Conveyance
Then grass: At least 50 feet long, sheet flow

mounding requirements. A model that calculates groundwater mounding is
available at http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/wm/nps/models/guidance/index.htm or
contact the stormwater coordinator in the runoff management section of the
bureau of watershed management at (608) 267-7694.
Design Clarifications:
Maximum required Effective Infiltration Area (EIA) is calculated as follows:
For residential land uses, the EIA cap is one percent (1%) of the project
site. For residential, the project site is defined as the area of land
disturbance.
For non-residential land uses, the EIA cap is two percent (2%) of the
project site. For non-residential, the project site is defined as the portion
of land disturbance dedicated to rooftops and parking lots.
Excluded and exempted areas are included in the EIA cap calculation.
The maximum required EIA cap may be voluntarily exceeded.
Exclusions  Infiltration from source areas or at locations identified in section
S.07(3)(c)8 of the ordinance is not prohibited. Rather, credit will not be given
toward achieving the infiltration requirement. Runoff from excluded areas does
not have to be included in calculating the infiltration goal. However, if runoff from
an excluded area flows through an infiltration BMP, the following is required:
Use caution. These source areas and locations are excluded from the
ordinances infiltration requirement due to groundwater contamination
concerns. The municipality is not responsible for the applicants decision
to infiltrate this runoff. The applicant is solely responsible for NR 140
compliance and groundwater protection.
The BMP design must take runoff from excluded areas into account to
assure the device can safely handle the additional flow and volume.
Exemptions  Infiltration from source areas or at locations identified in section
S.07(3)(c)9 of the ordinance is not required. Despite the ordinance, the applicant
may choose to infiltrate exempted runoff. If exempted runoff is infiltrated, credit
will be given toward achieving the infiltration requirement. Runoff from exempted
areas does not have to be included in calculating the infiltration goal. However, if
runoff from an exempted area flows through an infiltration BMP, the BMP design
must take it into account to assure the device can safely handle the additional
flow and volume.
Groundwater Protection  It is the applicants sole responsibility to protect
groundwater. Compliance with Preventative Action Limits (PAL) contained in NR
140 must be maintained. Also, infiltration system discharges must remain below
Enforcement Standards (ES) contain in NR 140. DNR Technical Standards
should meet these groundwater protection requirements.
Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP):
Definition takes into consideration best available technology, costeffectiveness,
natural resource protection, historic preservation, human
safety and welfare, and site conditions (see ordinance).
Topography  To achieve the infiltration requirement, maximum extent
practicable should not be interpreted to require significant topography
changes that create an excessive financial burden. Two feet (2) or less
of elevation change is considered reasonable and to the MEP.
Pumping  To achieve the infiltration requirement, maximum extent
practicable should not be interpreted to require stormwater pumping.
Roof Runoff  To minimize potential groundwater impacts, it is desirable to
infiltrate the cleanest runoff. To achieve this, a design may propose greater
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 21 of 33
infiltration of runoff from low pollutant sources such as roofs, and less from higher
pollutant source areas such as parking lots.
Disconnection  Disconnection of impervious surfaces can be used to help
achieve the infiltration requirement. However, disconnection is not considered to
be part of an infiltration system. Therefore, disconnected areas do not count
toward the maximum effective infiltration area calculation. In order to consider an
impervious surface as disconnected, the following criteria shall be met:
Residential Roofs: Discharge runoff over a minimum twenty foot (20)
long pervious surface that is in good condition and graded for sheet flow.
Other Impervious Surfaces:
? Source area flow length may not exceed seventy-five feet (75).
? Source area and pervious area must be graded for sheet flow.
? Pervious area must be in good condition, have a slope less than
eight percent (8%), and have a flow length at least as long as the
contributing impervious areas length (but never less than twenty
fee (20)).
Source: DNR Post-Construction Stormwater Management Workshops
Routine Maintenance Areas  No performance standard or infiltration
requirement is provided for routine maintenance areas. However, the applicant
is responsible for proper performance of onsite BMPs. In order to ensure proper
BMP performance, the applicant has two (2) options:
Divert the routine maintenance area around onsite BMPs, or
Include runoff volumes from the routine maintenance area in onsite BMP
calculations. The applicant will receive credit for infiltrating runoff from
the routine maintenance area provided it is not an excluded area.
Offsite Drainage Areas  The applicant is not responsible for satisfying infiltration
performance standards for offsite areas that drain into the project site. However,
the applicant is responsible for proper performance of onsite BMPs. In order to
ensure proper onsite BMP performance, the applicant has two (2) options:
Divert offsite runoff around onsite BMPs, or
Include offsite runoff volumes in the onsite BMP calculations. The
amount of onsite credit is determined by prorating the infiltration volume.
The applicant will not receive credit for infiltrating offsite runoff, unless
the BMP is a regional facility.
Alternative Uses  The volume of runoff used for alternative uses will be credited
towards the infiltration requirement. Alternative uses may include toilet flushing,
laundry, and irrigation (e.g. cisterns, rain barrels, green roofs). In addition to the
stormwater benefits, these alternative uses may also reduce municipal invoices
for drinking water.

Example Calculations:
The site is currently one hundred (100) acres of cropland. Following
development, the site will be thirty (30) acres medium residential, twenty (20)
acres commercial, and fifty (50) acres cropland. Native soils in the area to be
developed are sandy loams, silt loams and silty clay loams. Hydrologic soil
groups are B and C with an average pre-development curve number of seventyfive
(75). A site investigation using Step B of the DNR Technical Standard 1002,
Site Evaluation for Stormwater Infiltration, determined that ten (10) of the acres to
be developed into medium residential have an infiltration rate of one-tenth (0.10)
in/hr and are therefore exempt from the infiltration requirements. The site
investigation also determined that ten (10) acres to be developed into
commercial are excluded from the infiltration requirements. The postdevelopment
curve number for the pervious portions of the residential and
commercial components will be eighty (80), based on TR-55. The residential
component will be forty percent (40%) impervious. The commercial component
will be eighty percent (80%) impervious.
The residential and commercial components will meet the infiltration
requirements using two (2) infiltration basins. Upon completion of a preliminary
site layout, two (2) locations were chosen for investigation using Step C of
Technical Standard 1002. The first location investigated was in the residential
area that is not exempt from the infiltration requirements. The soil texture at the
residential infiltration basin site is a sandy loam with a design infiltration rate of
five-tenths (0.5) in/hr. The second location investigated was in the commercial
area that is not excluded from the infiltration requirements. The soil texture at the
commercial infiltration basin site is a loamy sand with a design infiltration rate of
one and sixty-three hundredths (1.63) in/hr.

of twelve thousand one hundred ninety-seven (12,197) sq. ft. needs to

Using Technical Standard 1003, the preliminary effective infiltration area
of two thousand six hundred fourteen (2,614) sq. ft. needs to be adjusted
(depth, slope, cell configuration) to determine the final effective infiltration
area. Groundwater mounding also needs to be checked. The maximum
EIA cap does not appear to impact the infiltration basins size (two

hundred twenty-six (11,326) sq. ft.).
(d) PROTECTIVE AREAS
All post-construction sites are required to meet the ordinances protective area
performance standards.
Design Clarifications:
Adjacent Property Owners  If a stream or channel is placed or relocated along a
property line, an easement or letter of permission is required from any property
owners impacted by the protective areas new location. Also, if a stormwater
facility or structure is proposed within an onsite stream or channel, one hundred
(100) year flood elevations shall be evaluated to determine if offsite property
owners are impacted by backwater or a flood elevation increase. An easement
or letter of permission is required from any property owners impacted by
backwater.
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 25 of 33
Wetland Delineations  Wetland delineations shall be performed by a
professional soil scientist, professional hydrologist, or other qualified individual
approved by the administering authority. The individual performing the
delineation shall classify the wetland as a less susceptible wetland, highly
susceptible wetland, exceptional resource water, or outstanding resource water.
Disturbances  Protective areas may be disturbed as part of a project, if
necessary. Disturbed areas must be stabilized from erosion and restored with
self-sustaining vegetation.
Type of Vegetation  It is recommended that seeding of non-invasive vegetative
cover be used in the protective areas. Vegetation that is flood and drought
tolerant and can provide long-term bank stability because of an extensive root
system is preferable. Vegetative cover can be measured using the line transect
method described in the University of Wisconsin Extension publication number
A3533, titled Estimating Residue Using the Line Transect Method.
Best Management Practices-
BMPs may be located in protective areas (ponds, swales, etc.)
Other state and local regulations may apply to BMPs located in
protective areas and waters of the state, including the following:
? Navigation, Dams, & Bridges (Chapter 30 and 31, Stats.)
? Wetland Water Quality Standards (NR 103)
? Wetlands (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 404
regulations)
? Shoreland Management (NR 115, NR 117, & local regulations)
? Floodplain Management (NR 116 & local regulations).
For purposes of section S.07(3)(d)6.d of the ordinance, a vegetated
protective area to filter runoff pollutants from post-construction sites is
not necessary since runoff is not entering the surface water at that
location. Other practices, necessary to meet the requirements of this
section, such as a swale or basin, will need to be designed and
implemented to reduce runoff pollutants before the runoff enters a
surface water of the state.
(e) FUELING AND VEHICLE MAINTENANCE AREAS:
All post-construction sites are required to meet the ordinances no visible
petroleum sheen performance standard.
Design Clarifications:
The following BMPs are recommended to meet the performance standards
contained within section S.07(3)(e) of the ordinance:
Enclose vehicle maintenance areas in a building or under a roof.
Install a roof or canopy over fueling areas.
Divert runoff away from fueling and vehicle maintenance areas.
Keep adsorbent spill cleanup materials onsite at all times.
Install an oil/water separator and/or biofiltration device.
Post the spill response phone numbers in conspicuous onsite locations.
The municipalitys Illicit Discharge Ordinance requires reporting of
hazardous spills. The local municipalitys spill response phone number
is 911 and the DNRs twenty-four (24) hour spill response phone number
is 1-800-943-0003.
(f) SWALE TREATMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
Post-construction sites with twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. or more of
impervious surface disturbance and post-construction sites with one (1) acre or
VILLAGE OF SUAMICO POST-CONSTRUCTION REFERENCE GUIDE
Page 26 of 33
more of land disturbance are required to meet the ordinances numeric
performance standards. All other post-construction sites are not required to meet
these numeric performance standards. BMP design guidance is provided below
in Section (h) for sites with less than twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. of
impervious surface disturbance.
Design Clarifications:
For purposes of section S.07(3)(f)1.a of the ordinance, it is preferred that tall and
dense vegetation be maintained within the swale due to its greater effectiveness
at enhancing runoff pollutant removal. However, the local municipality may have
ordinances or other design criteria which dictate the allowable mowing height for
grass swales.
For purposes of section S.07(3)(f)1.b of the ordinance, check dams may be
included in the swale design to slow runoff flows and improve pollutant removal.
Transportation facilities with continuous features such as curb and gutter,
sidewalks or parking lanes do not comply with the design requirements of section
S.07(3)(f)1.b of the ordinance. However, a limited amount of structural measures
such as curb and gutter may be allowed as necessary to account for other
concerns such as human safety or resource protection.
For purposes of section S.07(3)(f)2 of the ordinance, the Department of Natural
Resources regional stormwater staff can determine if additional BMPs, beyond a
water quality swale, are needed.
(g) EXEMPTIONS FOR S.07(3) PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Projects that consist of only the construction of bicycle paths or pedestrian trails
generally meet the exception found under section S.07(3)(g)3.d of the ordinance,
as these facilities have minimal connected imperviousness.
(h) SITES WITH LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND (20,000) SQ. FT. OF
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE DISTURBANCE
Pursuant to S.07(6) of the ordinance, the municipality may establish stormwater
management requirements more stringent than those set forth in this section if
the municipality determines than an added level of protection is needed.
Design Clarifications:
For a post-construction site with less than twenty thousand (20,000) sq. ft. of
impervious surface disturbance, the applicant shall comply with the protective
area requirements in section S.07(3)(d) of the ordinance, petroleum sheen
requirements in section S.07(3)(e) of the ordinance, and one (1) of the two (2)
requirements provided below. It is recommended that the developer and
designer contact the local municipality early in the design process to discuss
which requirement must be complied with:
1. Disconnect impervious surfaces. Ninety percent (90%) or more of disturbed
impervious surfaces must be disconnected. In order to consider an
impervious surface as disconnected, the following criteria shall be met:
Roofs: Discharge runoff over a minimum twenty foot (20) long pervious
surface that is in good condition and graded for sheet flow.
Other Impervious Surfaces:

stormwater runoff to lawn or other pervious areas when feasible. Rain
barrels are also encouraged at roof downspouts to store water for
irrigation and watering landscaped areas (reduces municipal water
invoice).
Create depressions in lawn areas and other landscape areas to
temporarily store and treat stormwater runoff from roofs, parking lots,
driveways and sidewalks when feasible. Grass swales, biofiltration
devices, bioretention devices, and rain gardens are also encouraged
when feasible.
Filter baskets shall be installed in parking lot catch basins when feasible.
Preserve wooded areas, trees, shrubs, and other native vegetation that
are in good condition when feasible.

(4) CONSIDERATIONS FOR ONSITE/OFFSITE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
MEASURES
All proposed land development activities should be planned, designed, and implemented:
1. In a manner that best fits the terrain of the site, avoiding steep slopes and other
environmentally sensitive areas;
2. According to the unique resource conditions at, around, and downstream from a
given site;
3. According to the principles of Low Impact Development. Use source controls rather
than end-of-pipe treatment. Reduce, prevent and mitigate the adverse impacts of
development by maintaining infiltration, reducing frequency and volume of
discharges, reducing peak flows, and maintaining groundwater recharge. These
goals can be accomplished by using:
Reduced impervious surfaces
Functional grading to slow runoff and thereby lengthen the time of concentration
Vegetated channels rather than paving or pipes
Disconnection of impervious surfaces; drain to vegetated areas
Bioretention (rain gardens) and filtration (buffer) landscape areas
Any other techniques that reduce the runoff curve number (RCN) or increase the
time of concentration (Tc)
Use wet detention basins after all source area practices and techniques have
been employed
Overall, the goal is to design the site as an integral, living part of the environment
with careful use of principles and practices that are both low impact on runoff and
simple for people to maintain and live with.
4. To maintain groundwater recharge areas and the infiltration capacity of native soils
by avoiding the unnecessary filling of large natural depressions or compaction of
upper soil horizons by construction equipment;
5. To maintain soil infiltration by keeping all topsoil onsite;
6. To provide the protective area, shoreland, wetland, and environmentally sensitive
area setback along all water courses; and
7. According to the sequence in the Treatment Train:
a. First do source controls:
Reduce impervious areas to the maximum extent possible
Maintain undisturbed soil
Maintain existing trees, shrubs and vegetation
b. Next do lot controls
Grade lots to create long areas of overland flow rather than channels
Minimize directly connected impervious areas by such practices as directing
roof water to vegetated areas and draining driveways to grass rather than the
street
Include rain gardens (undrained areas that will pond water)
c. Then do site controls
Use grassed waterways and diversions rather than paved channels
Maintain wetlands
Use vegetated road ditches rather than curb and gutter
Use wet detention basins. They can have pools five (5) or more feet deep or
may be designed as wetlands, but existing wetlands cannot be incorporated
into stormwater facilities.
Use offline detention basins
d. Finally, do Regional controls such as regional detention basins.
