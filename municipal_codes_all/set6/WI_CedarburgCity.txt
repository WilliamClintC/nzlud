Index
INDEX TO CODE
(References are to section numbers)
USE OF INDEX: This index is designed for user ease. To locate information found in the code,
formulate a specific question. The key words in that question then become guides for using the
index. In the event you do not locate the desired information on your first attempt, the following
checklist may help.
(1) Cross-references (when needed) are always located at the beginning of entries. Have you
overlooked any?
(2) Frequently initial questions are too general. Reformulating a more specific question may
help.
(3) Information on officials can be found two ways. The entry for an official's name contains
general duties as well as conditions of his office, such as compensation and tenure. Duties
assigned to him by ordinances on specific subjects will be found under those subjects.
(4) Definitions can be located under the "DEFINITIONS" main heading or in specific subject
areas through the subheading "Definitions of terms."

corporations, partnerships, associations, bodies politic or any other entity of any kind which
is capable of being sued.

repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive the prior ordinance or any part thereof,
unless expressly so provided.

shall also be construed to apply to several persons or things, and every word in these
Ordinances referred to a plural number shall also be construed to apply to one (1) person or
thing.

The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be
independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made
in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office is not to be used for personal
gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these

employees whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of Council as well as
boards, committees and commissions of the City (City agencies). The purpose of this Ethics Code is
to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting

by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in
matters affecting the City.
SEC. 2-5-2 RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICE.
Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the
public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this
State and carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and municipality, to observe in their
official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office
regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their prime
concern.
SEC. 2-5-3 DEDICATED SERVICE.
(a) Officials and employees should adhere to the rules of work, professionalism and performance
established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority.
(b) Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to

unless prohibited from so doing by law or by officially recognized confidentiality of their
48
work.

profit.

departmental programming, equipment, or capital projects, which may occur subject to
Council approval and all provisions of this Code and the State Statutes, the following
shall be prohibited:

or city equipment for the purpose of fundraising.

employee for private or public fundraising. (Ord. 2015-13)

treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen.

(a) Financial and Personal Interest Prohibited. No official or employee, whether paid or
unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall act in regard to financial or other

official duties in the public interest contrary to the provisions of this Chapter or which would
tend to impair independence of or action in the performance of official duties.
(b) Definitions.
(1) Financial Interest. Any interest which shall yield, directly or indirectly, a monetary or
other material benefit to the officer or employee or to any person employing or
retaining the services of the officer or employee.

close business or political associations, whether or not any financial interest is
involved.
(3) Person. Any individual or legal entity.
(c) Specific Conflicts Enumerated.

independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties, unless
otherwise permitted by law.

government or affairs of the City, nor shall such information be used to advance the
financial or other private interests of the official or employee or others.
49

herself, for his or her immediate family, or for an organization with which he
or she is associated.
b. No person may directly or indirectly offer or give "anything of value" to a
local public official or employee if it could reasonably be expected to
affect that official's vote, official action or judgment, or if it could be
construed as a reward for any official action or inaction on the part of the
local public official or employee. No local public official or employee may
accept "anything of value" tendered under such circumstances. "Anything of
value" is defined as "money or property, favor, service, payment, advance,

family, was a City official or employee. This includes any discount on the
price of admission, parking, or use of a box at a stadium that is tax exempt
from general property taxes. Participation in celebrations, grand openings,
open houses, informational meetings and similar events are excluded from
this prohibition. This paragraph further shall not be construed to prevent
candidates for elective office from accepting hospitality from citizens for the
purpose of supporting the candidate's campaign.
c. No local public official or employee may take any official action that affects a
matter in which the public official or employee, a member of his or her
immediate family, or an organization with which the official or employee is
associated has a substantial financial interest.
d. No local public official or employee may use his or her office or position in
any way that produces or assists in producing a substantial benefit, either
directly or indirectly, for the official or employee, any members of his or her
immediate family, or an organization with which the official or employee is
associated.
(4) Representing Private Interests Before City Agencies or Courts. No officer or
employee shall appear on behalf of any private person (other than him or herself, his
or her spouse or minor children) before any City agency. However, members of the
Common Council may appear before City agencies on behalf of constituents in the
course of their duties as representatives of the electorate or in the performance of
public or civic obligations.

employee, participates in the making of a contract in which he has a private pecuniary
interest, direct or indirect, or performs in regard to that contract with some function requiring

Chapter and shall be deemed the Ethics Board pursuant to Section 19.59 (3)(d) Wis. Stats.

statement of the final cost of the work, service or improvement in lieu of an estimate

SEC. 3-3-5 ACCESS PROCEDURES.
(a) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be
deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information
requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject
matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A
request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the
request is commenced under Sec. 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request
may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state
the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by
mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 3-3-4(f)(6). A requester may be
required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private
residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
(b) Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay,
either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the
request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring
with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time
consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in
a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
(c) A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 3-3-6. If a request is made
orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the
reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral
denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written
statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall
inform the requester that, if the request for the record was made in writing, then the
determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Sec. 19.37(1),
Wis. Stats., or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.

not limited to, the following:

made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made
public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before

and shall follow the guidance of the City Attorney when separating out the exempt material.
If, in the judgment of the custodian and the City Attorney, there is no feasible way to
separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably
jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from
disclosure.

physical characteristics of the item(s); the amount of time, effort, administration and
expense required for the method relative to the potential value received; and the
public benefits and/or liabilities associated with the method.

If any person fails to timely file a return, as required by this Chapter, the treasurer shall make an
estimate of the amount of the gross receipts upon which the tax is determined. Such estimate shall
be made for the period for which such person failed to make a return and shall be based upon any
information which is in the treasurer's possession or may come into his or her possession or such
other information as may have a bearing upon the determination of gross receipts. On the basis of
this estimate the treasurer shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the City,
adding to the sum thus arrived at a penalty equal to ten percent thereof. Such determination may be
made for each quarterly period for which no return is filed. Such penalty shall be due upon written
notice to the business entity or person owing the tax and shall not be in lieu of the tax due hereunder.

The intent of this Chapter is to prevent carelessness, improper maintenance or any other cause which
results in false police and/or fire alarms from privately owned alarm systems. Such false alarms

SEC. 5-6-1 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The city finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. Given the high
rate of recidivism for sex offenders, the city believes that in addition to the protections afforded
by state law near schools, day care centers and other places children frequent, reducing
opportunity and temptation is appropriate to minimizing the risk of re-offence to better protect
the children in these public places. This chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the
health and safety of children in the City of Cedarburg from the risk that convicted sex offenders
may re-offend in locations close to their residences where children tend to congregate or be
regularly present. It is the intent of this chapter not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to
serve the city’s compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the city by creating safety zones around locations where children
regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual
predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence and wherein access
by certain sexual offenders and sexual predators shall be restricted and excluded.
SEC. 5-6-2 DEFINITIONS.
As used in this chapter and unless the context otherwise requires:
A sexual violent offense shall have the meaning as set forth in Wis. Stats. 980.01(6) as amended
from time to time.
A crime against children shall mean any of the following offenses set forth within the Wisconsin
Statutes, as amended, or the laws of this or any other state or the federal government, having like
elements necessary for conviction, respectively:

are backfilled, graded and paved and parkways which are seeded in accordance with
the specifications as set forth by the City Engineer. Sidewalks shall be constructed
on at least one side in an M-1 Limited Industrial District and M-2 General Industrial
District. Sidewalks may be required to be located on both sides of the street in those

planning considerations.
(2) The sidewalk requirement of Section 6-2-2 shall not apply to properties along streets
in RM-2 zoning districts wherein said property is owned by a condominium
development association and the condominium development association fronts both
sides of the subject street and wherein the requirement of the construction of
sidewalks on both sides of a street in said condominium area would cause a hardship
upon the owners of said condominiums. In such a case, the Plan Commission may, by
a three-fourths (3/4) vote, recommend to the Common Council that the requirements
for installation of sidewalks on both sides of the street be waived and that the Council
only require the installation of a sidewalk on one (1) side of the street. The Common
Council, to approve such a proposal, shall determine by a three-fourths (3/4) vote, on
the basis of hardship, to waive the installation of sidewalks on one (1) side of the
street only.
(3) The sidewalk requirements of Section 6-2-2 shall not apply to properties along streets
in RS-1, RS-7 and RS-8 zoning districts except in those instances in which the Plan
City of Cedarburg
Public Works

Commission recommends to the Council and the Council approves on a case-by-case
basis the need for sidewalk. In such a case, the Plan Commission may, by threefourths
(3/4) vote, recommend to the Common Council that the requirements for
installation of sidewalks on both sides of the street be waived and that the Common
Council not require the installation of a sidewalk on either side of the street. The
Common Council, to approve such a proposal, shall determine by a three-fourths
(3/4) vote, to waive the installation of sidewalks on one (1) side of the street only.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section the sidewalk requirements of Section 6-
2-2 shall apply to arterial streets, regardless of zoning district classification. In those
cases where sidewalks on both sides of arterial streets are impractical due to unique
site conditions, existing grades or structural and environmental features that would be
unduly disrupted, the board of Public Works may, by three-fourths (3/4) vote,
recommend to the Common Council that the requirements for installation of
sidewalks on both sides of said arterial street be waived. The Common Council, to
approve such a proposal, shall determine by a three-fourth (3/4) vote, to waive the
installation of sidewalks one (1) side of the street only.
(5) The cost of the improvements are to be assessed pursuant to the City's special
assessment policies and ordinances.

be a continuation of the Mequon numbering system.
(d) Block Numbers.
(1) One hundred numbers shall be assigned to each invisible block, regardless of
discrepancies in block sizes. Properties on the north and east sides of streets shall
bear even numbers and properties on the south and west sides of streets shall bear
odd numbers.
(2) The number assigned to each property shall be composed of two (2) parts. The first part, or
street designation, shall be composed of a directional letter, "N" or "W," followed by the
number of the appropriate block line expressed by a multiple of ten and represented by two

the period of thirty (30) days to duly attach and maintain the proper number on such
premises, the Building Inspector shall serve upon him a notice requiring such owner or
occupant to properly number the premises. If the owner or occupant neglects to do so after
City of Cedarburg
Public Works
24
service of such notice and a period of ten (10) days elapses, he shall be deemed to have

Dutch Elm disease fungus, other deleterious tree diseases or the insect pests or
vectors known to carry such diseases.
(2) Whenever the City Forester after inspection or examination shall determine that a
public nuisance as herein defined exists on public property in the City, he shall
immediately abate or cause the abatement of such nuisance in such manner as to
destroy or prevent as fully as possible the spread of Dutch Elm disease, other
deleterious tree diseases, or the inspect pests or vectors known to carry such disease
fungus.
(3) a. When the City Forester shall determine with reasonable certainty that a public
nuisance exists upon private premises, he shall immediately serve or cause to
be served personally or by registered mail upon the owner of such property, if
he can be found, or upon the occupant thereof, a written notice of the
existence of such nuisance and of a time and place for a hearing, not less than
fourteen (14) days after service of such notice, on the abatement action to be
taken. Such notice shall describe the nuisance and recommend procedures for

the practicality of obtaining timely removal services, the City Forester may
extend the removal period to sixty (60) days. If such owner or occupant does
not abate said nuisance within the time permitted, the City Forester shall
cause the same to be abated. No damage shall be awarded to the owner for

has been in contact with a rabid animal. If a quarantine cannot be imposed because
the dog or cat cannot be captured, the officer may kill the animal. The officer shall
attempt to kill the animal in a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage
to the animal's head.
(2) Sacrifice of other animals. An officer may order killed or may kill an animal other

owner's expense, by a licensed veterinarian within the City. Thereafter, the dog or
domestically owned animal shall be confined and isolated for a period of ten (10)
days by a licensed veterinarian within the City of Cedarburg, at the owner's expense,
to determine whether or not the dog or domestically owned animal is infected with
rabies. If the owner of the animal cannot be determined, the expense of the
examination and confinement will be borne by the City. The dog or other

only after determination that it is free from rabies. Any dog or other animal found to
be infected with rabies shall be surrendered to the Police Department upon demand.

quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal bit a person, the
custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal under strict
isolation under the supervision of a veterinarian for at least ten (10) days after the
incident occurred. In this paragraph, "supervision of a veterinarian" includes, at a
minimum, examination of the animal on the first day of isolation, on the last day of
isolation and on one (1) intervening day. If the observation period is not extended and
if the veterinarian certifies that the animal has not exhibited any signs of rabies, the
animal may be released from quarantine at the end of the observation period.
(3) Risk to animal health.
a. If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe
that the animal has been exposed to a rabid animal and if the dog or cat is not
currently immunized against rabies, the custodian of an isolation facility or
the owner shall keep the animal leashed or confined for one hundred eighty
(180) days. The owner shall have the animal vaccinated against rabies
between one hundred fifty-five (155) and one hundred sixty-five (165) days

that the animal has been exposed to a rabid animal but if the dog or cat is
immunized against rabies, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner
shall keep the animal leashed or confined for sixty (60) days. The owner shall
have the animal revaccinated against rabies as soon as possible after exposure

that a dog or cat exhibits symptoms of rabies during the original or extended
observation period, the veterinarian shall notify the owner and the officer who
ordered the animal quarantined and the officer or veterinarian shall kill the animal in
a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage to the animal's head. If the

package the head of the animal in a manner to minimize deterioration, arrange for delivery by
the most expeditious means feasible of the head of the animal to the State Laboratory of
Hygiene and dispose of or arrange for the disposal of the remainder of the carcass in a
manner which minimizes the risk or exposure to any rabies virus. The Laboratory of Hygiene
shall examine the specimen and determine if the animal was infected with rabies. The State
Laboratory of Hygiene shall notify the City, the veterinarian or local health department which
prepared the carcass and, if the animal is suspected to have bitten a person, that person or the
person's physician.
(g) Cooperation of Veterinarian. Any practicing veterinarian who is requested to be involved
in the rabies control program by an officer is encouraged to cooperate in a professional
capacity with the City, the Laboratory of Hygiene, the local health department, the officer
involved and, if the animal is suspected to have bitten a person, the person's physician.
(h) Responsibility for Quarantine and Laboratory Expenses. The owner of an animal is
responsible for any expenses incurred in connection with keeping the animal in an isolation
facility, supervision and examination of the animal by a veterinarian, preparation of the
carcass for laboratory examination and the fee for the laboratory examination. If the owner is
unknown, the county is responsible for these expenses.

(a) 1997 Wisconsin Act 27, effective December 1, 1997, established a new
alcohol beverage license called a Retail Reserve “Class B” Liquor License,
and required that all who are granted such a license pay an initial license fee
of $10,000 in addition to the regular Class “B” and “Class B” license fees.
The number of Retail Reserve “Class B” licenses available to a municipality
is determined by a series of calculations described in Wis. Stat. 125.51(4).
The Common Council finds that businesses such as restaurants, hotels and
taverns make important contributions to the City’s economy and serve
important public purposes, including, but not limited to, increasing the City’s
property tax base, providing employment and promoting tourism. The
Common Council also finds that the new initial fees for a Retail Reserve
“Class B” Liquor License far exceeds the actual cost of licensing the activity,
and that the excessive license fee deters new business and is contrary to the
City of Cedarburg
Licensing and Regulation
27
above-stated public purposes. It is the purpose of this ordinance to utilize the
excess revenue generated by 1997 Wisconsin Act 27 to assist new Retail
Reserve “Class B” licensees in order to achieve the important public purposes
identified herein.
(b) The Common Council may provide a grant to a Retail Reserve “Class B”
licensee if the following conditions are met:
1. A Retail Reserve “Class B” Liquor License is granted to the licensee;
and
2. The Retail Reserve “Class B” Liquor License applicant properly
completes and submits an application to the Common Council for a
grant on a form provided by the City Clerk at the same time the
applicant submits the completed application for a Retail Reserve
“Class B” Liquor License.
3. The Retail Reserve “Class B” Liquor licensee pays the initial $10,000
fee to the City in addition to the regular fees for Class “B” and “Class
B” licenses.
(c) In making its determination whether to award any grant to a Retail Reserve
“Class B” Liquor licensee under this ordinance, the Common Council shall
make such findings and establish such conditions as it deems necessary to
ensure that any funds awarded hereunder further the important public
purposes identified in Sec. 7-2-5(b)(9)(a). (Ord 98-41)
(c) Cancellation for Failure to Pay Fee. The City Clerk shall issue each license approved by
the Common Council and shall make the same available at the City Clerk's office in City
Hall. Any licenses for which the license fee is not paid within fifteen (15) days of approval of
the application by the Common Council shall be returned to the Common Council for
cancellation or other disposition.
SEC. 7-2-6 APPLICATION FOR LICENSE.

qualified under Section 125.04(5), Wis. Stats., as amended, for a restaurant in which the sale
of alcohol beverages accounts for less than 50 percent of gross receipts and which does not
have a barroom if the City's quota prevents it from issuing a Class "B" license to that person.
For purposes of this section, a "barroom" means a room that is primarily used for the sale or
consumption of alcohol beverages. A "Class C" license may not be issued to a foreign
corporation or a person acting as agent for or in the company of another.
(k) Connecting Premises. Except in the case of hotels, no person may hold both a Class "A"

SEC. 7-2-8 INVESTIGATION.
(a) The City Clerk shall notify the Chief of Police, Fire Inspector, Health Officer and Building
Inspector of each new or renewal application, and these officials shall inspect or cause to be
inspected each application and the premises, together with such other investigation as shall
be necessary to determine whether the applicant and the premises sought to be licensed
comply with the regulations, ordinances and laws applicable thereto, including those
governing sanitation in restaurants, and whether the applicant is a proper recipient of a
license. The Police Department shall conduct an investigation of the applicant, including, but
not limited to, requesting information from the State, surrounding municipalities, and/or any
community where the applicant has previously resided concerning the applicant's arrest and
conviction record. These officials shall furnish to the City Clerk in writing, who shall
forward to the Common Council, the information derived from such investigation,
accompanied by a recommendation as to whether a license should be granted or refused. No
license shall be renewed without a re-inspection of the premises and report as originally
required.
(b) If the inspecting officials recommend the denial of the application, the applicant shall be
notified by the City Clerk at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Council meeting at which the
application is to be considered. The notice shall set forth the basis for such recommendation
and inform the applicant of the opportunity to appear before the Common Council and to
provide evidence as to why the application should be approved. In addition, the applicant
City of Cedarburg
Licensing and Regulation

shall be notified that the consideration of the application shall be held in closed session,
pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(b) of the Wisconsin Statutes, unless the applicant requests such

conviction record of the applicant, subject to the limitations imposed by Sections 111.321,
111.322 and 111.335 of the Wisconsin Statutes, financial responsibility of the applicant, the
appropriateness of the location and premises where such licensed business is to be
conducted, and generally the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed. An application
may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has
been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually been a
law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been a law offender" is
generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two (2) offenses which are
substantially related to the licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding
the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right
granted solely to the Common Council, the Common Council reserves the right to consider
the severity and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the determination to
grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the Council at its discretion, may, based upon an
arrest or conviction record of two (2) or more offenses which are substantially related to the
licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license
for a period of one (1) year or more.
(d) (1) If the Common Council denies the license, the applicant shall be notified in writing,
by registered mail or personal service, of the reasons for the denial. The notice shall
also inform the applicant of the opportunity to appear before the Common Council
and to provide evidence as to why the denial should be reversed. In addition, the
notice shall inform the applicant that the reconsideration of the application shall be
held in closed session, pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(b) of the Wisconsin Statutes, unless
the applicant requests such reconsideration be held in open session and the Common
Council consents to the request. Such written notice shall be mailed or served upon
the applicant at least ten (10) days prior to the Common Council meeting at which the
application is to be reconsidered.
(2) If, upon reconsideration, the Council again denies the application, the City Clerk
shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons therefor. An applicant who is
denied any license upon reconsideration of the matter may apply to Circuit Court
pursuant to Sec. 125.12(2)(d), Wis. Stats., for review.
SEC. 7-2-9 APPROVAL OF APPLICATION.
(a) In determining the suitability of an applicant, consideration shall be given to the moral
character and financial responsibility of the applicant, the appropriateness of the location and
premises proposed and generally the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed. (Ord. 91-17)

City of Cedarburg
Licensing and Regulation
32
taxes or assessments or other financial claims of the City are delinquent and unpaid.

granting of any license. Upon the approval of the applicant by the Common Council, the City Clerk
shall issue to the applicant a license, upon payment by the applicant of the license fee to the City.
The full license fee shall be charged for the whole or fraction of any year.
SEC. 7-2-11 TRANSFER AND LAPSE OF LICENSE.
(a) In accordance with the provisions of Section 125.04(12), Wis. Stats., a license shall be
transferable from one premises to another if such transfer is first approved by the Common
Council. An application for transfer shall be made on a form furnished by the City Clerk.
Proceedings for such transfer shall be had in the same form and manner as the original
application. The fee for such transfer is Ten Dollars ($10.00). Whenever a license is
transferred, the City Clerk shall forthwith notify the Wisconsin Department of Revenue of
such transfer. In the event of the sale of a business or business premises of the licensee, the
purchaser of such business or business premises must apply to the City for reissuance of said
license and the City, as the licensing authority, shall in no way be bound to reissue said
license to said subsequent purchaser. (Ord. 91-17)
(b) Whenever the agent of a corporate holder of a license is for any reason replaced, the licensee
shall give the City Clerk written notice of said replacement, the reasons therefor and the new
appointment. Until the next regular meeting or special meeting of the Common Council, the
successor agent shall have the authority to perform the functions and be charged with the
duties of the original agent. However, said license shall cease to be in effect upon receipt by
the City Clerk of notice of disapproval of the successor agent by the Wisconsin Department
of Revenue or other peace officer of the municipality in which the license was issued. The
corporation's license shall not be in force after receipt of such notice or after a regular or
special meeting of the Common Council until the successor agent or another qualified agent

SEC. 7-2-18 REVOCATION AND SUSPENSION OF LICENSES; NON-RENEWAL.
(a) Procedure. Whenever the holder of any license under this Chapter violates any portion of
this Chapter or Title 11, Chapter 5, of this Code of Ordinances, proceedings for the
revocation of such license may be instituted in the manner and under the procedure
established by this Section.
(b) Minimum Open Hours Required. (Ord. 2016-23)
(1) Definitions.
In this section:
a. “Open to the public for business” means that any member of the public is
able to enter the licensed premises and engage in the licensee’s principal
activity or activities, including but not limited to the purchase of alcohol
beverages. Factors to consider in determining whether a licensee is “open to
the public for business” include, but are not limited to:
i. Whether the licensee’s doors are unlocked;
ii. Whether the licensee’s interior lights are on;
iii. Whether the licensee’s exterior lights are on during hours of darkness;
iv. Whether the licensee publishes open hours in any form of public
communication, including but not limited to websites and
advertisements;
v. Whether the licensee has the necessary staff on site to operate the
licensee’s advertised business.
b. “Day” means the period from 6:00 a.m. on one calendar day to the next
statutory closing hour as set forth in Wis. Stat. s. 125.68(4)(c). A day which
falls within two calendar months shall be deemed to fall within the calendar
month of the month preceding 12:00 midnight. For example, the time period
of 6:00 a.m. on Thursday, March 31 to 2:00 a.m. on Friday, April 1 shall be
counted as one “day” under this section, and shall be deemed to fall within
the calendar month of March.
c. “Extraordinary circumstances” means an unforeseen and undesired event
which completely precludes the business from being open to the public at any
time, including but not limited to fire, flooding, other weather-related
damage, or utility interruption. Staffing shortages or economic difficulty are
not “extraordinary circumstances.”
City of Cedarburg
Licensing and Regulation
39
(2) Minimum Open Hours Required.
a. Each licensee holding a “Class B” license shall be open to the public for
business for not less than 15 days each calendar month. On each of such 15
days each calendar month, each licensee holding a “Class B” license shall be
open to the public for business for not less than 240 consecutive minutes.
(3) Enforcement.
a. Upon a report that a licensee is not in compliance with section (2)(a), the City
Clerk shall send the licensee a warning letter via certified mail reminding the
licensee of the requirements of this subsection and directing the licensee to
submit a response within 14 days setting forth the licensee’s reasons for
noncompliance with section (2)(a) and the licensee’s plans for becoming
compliant.
b. After the 14 day warning period set forth in section (3)(a), a licensee’s
continued noncompliance with section (2)(a) is grounds for suspension,
revocation, or non-renewal of the “Class B” license.
(4) Exemptions.
a. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any licensee which is a tax-exempt nonprofit
organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be
exempt from section (2)(a).
b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any licensee which is a tax-exempt veteran’s
organization under Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be
exempt from section (2)(a).
c. A licensee may file a petition with the City Clerk requesting a 60-day
exemption from section (2)(a) due to extraordinary circumstances. The City
Clerk shall require the licensee to appear before the Common Council in
support of the petition. If the licensee fails to appear, the petition shall be
denied. If the licensee appears, the Common Council may take testimony
and/or other evidence from the licensee on the petition. The Common
Council shall find whether the licensee has shown good cause for a 60-day
exemption due to extraordinary circumstances and grant or deny the petition.
If an extraordinary circumstance continues, the licensee must file a new
petition seeking an additional 60-day exemption.
(c) License Revocation or Suspension.
(1) Notice and Hearing. Whenever a person holding a license to sell alcoholic beverages
has failed to maintain the premises according to standards prescribed for sanitation,
or in whose premises persons are permitted to loiter for purposes of prostitution, or
when the licensee has not observed and obeyed any lawful order of the Common
Council or police officers of the City, has violated City Ordinances, or for any other
good reason, the Common Council shall issue a summons, to be signed by the City
Clerk commanding the licensee complained of to appear before the Common Council
on a day and time and at a place named in the summons to show cause why the
City of Cedarburg
Licensing and Regulation
40
license should not be revoked or suspended. In addition, any resident may file a
sworn, written complaint with the City Clerk. Such summons shall be served not less
than three (3) and not more than ten (10) days before the time at which the licensee is
commanded to appear and may be served personally upon the licensee or the agent of
the licensee or upon the person in charge of the licensed premises. The complaint
shall be served with the summons and shall set forth the offense allegedly committed,
the date and place of said offence and the facts constituting the alleged offense. If
such licensee shall not appear as required by the summons, the complaint shall be
taken as true, and if the Common Council deems its allegations sufficient, the
Council shall recommend revocation or suspension of the license as provided herein.
(2) Procedure on Hearing Effect of Revocation.
a. The Mayor or, in his absence, the Council President shall conduct the
hearing, administer oaths to all witnesses and may issue subpoenas. So far as
practicable, the rules of evidence provided in Sec. 227.08, Wis. Stats., shall
be followed. The complainant shall have the burden of proving the charges to
a preponderance of the evidence. The licensee and the complainant may be
represented by counsel, may call and examine witnesses and cross-examine
witnesses of the other party. All proceedings and testimony shall be recorded
on tape. If either party requests a stenographic recording and transcription, the
City shall make the necessary arrangements, but the expenses shall be borne
by the requesting party. The City Clerk shall serve as secretary to the Council
and shall make and receive all exhibits admitted into the record. The
Common Council, upon the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing,
shall determine by simple majority vote of those present whether the charges
are true or not. If the vote is to suspend the license, it shall be for a period of
not less than ten (10) days or more than ninety (90) days. Following the
procedure above, the recommendation may be to revoke the license. If the
Council determines that the charges are not substantiated, the complaint shall
be dismissed without cost to either party. The Council's action shall be
recorded by the Clerk.
b. If the complaint is found to be true, the licensee shall pay to the City the
actual cost of the proceedings. If the complaint is found by the Common
Council to be malicious and without probable cause, the complainant shall
pay the cost of the proceedings in the same amount.
c. When a license is revoked, it shall be so entered of record by the City Clerk,
and no other license shall be granted to such licensee or for such premises for
a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the revocation, nor shall any
part of the money paid as application fee for any license so revoked be
refunded.
(d) Other Provisions. Any license issued pursuant to this Chapter shall be subject to such
further regulations and restrictions as may be imposed by the Common Council by
City of Cedarburg
Licensing and Regulation
41
amendment to this Section or by the enactment of new ordinances. If any licenses shall fail or
neglect to meet the requirements imposed by such new restrictions and regulations his license
may be revoked in accordance with this Section. In case of revocation of any license or any
violation of any provision of this Chapter in accordance with this Section or by the court or
for any reasonable cause except the imposition of new restrictions, no refund shall be made
of any part of the license fee.

listed in the Office of the City Assessor, who are owners of the property situated
wholly or in part within three hundred (300) feet of the boundaries of the properties
for which the application is made. If within fifteen (15) calendar days of mailing the
copies of the complete application to the neighboring property owners the City
receives written objections from fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the neighboring
property owners, the City Clerk shall immediately deny the application. Neighboring
property owners shall be defined as all those property owners who are located within
three hundred (300) feet of the proposed natural lawn site.
(2) If the property owner's application is in full compliance with the Natural Lawn
Management Plan requirements and less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the
neighboring property owners provide written objections, the City Clerk shall issue
permission to install a natural lawn.
(d) Application For Appeal. The property owner may appeal the Clerk's decision to deny the
natural lawn permit request to the Common Council at an open meeting. All applications for
appeal shall be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days of the notice of denial of the
Natural Lawn Management Plan. The decision rendered by the Common Council shall be
final and binding.
(e) Safety Precautions For Natural Grass Areas.
(1) When, in the opinion of the Fire Chief, the presence of a natural lawn may constitute
a fire or safety hazard due to weather and/or other conditions, the Fire Chief may
order the cutting of natural lawns to a safe condition. As a condition of receiving
approval of the natural lawn permit, the property owner shall be required to cut the
natural lawn within the three (3) days upon receiving written direction from the Fire
Chief.
(2) Natural lawns shall not be removed through the process of burning unless stated and
approved as one of the management and maintenance techniques in the Lawn
Management Plan. The Fire Chief shall review all requests to burn natural lawns and
City of Cedarburg
Health and Sanitation
6
shall determine if circumstances are correct and all applicable requirements have
been fulfilled to insure public safety. Burning of natural lawns shall be strictly
prohibited unless a written permit to burn is issued by the Fire Chief. The Fire Chief
shall establish a written list of requirements for considering each request to burn
natural lawns, thereby insuring the public safety. In addition, the property owner
requesting permission to burn the natural lawn shall produce evidence of property
damage and liability insurance identifying the City as a party insured. The minimum
amount of acceptable insurance shall be as prescribed by the City's Schedule of
Insurance Requirements.
(f) Revocation Of An Approved Natural Lawn Management Plan Permit. The Common
Council, upon the recommendation of the Weed Commissioner, shall have the authority to
revoke an approved Natural Lawn Management Plan Permit if the owner fails to maintain the
natural lawn or comply with the provisions set forth in this Section. Notice of intent to
revoke an approved Natural Lawn Management Plan Permit shall be appealable to the
Common Council. All applications for appeal shall be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar
days of receipt of the written Notice of Intent to revoke the approved Natural Lawn
Management Plan. Failure to file an application for appeal within the fifteen (15) calendar
days shall result in the revoking of the Natural Lawn Management Plan Permit. The
Common Council in an open meeting shall review all written applications for appeal filed
within the fifteen (15) calendar day requirement. The decision rendered by the Common
Council shall be final and binding.
(g) Public Nuisance Defined - Abatement After Notice.
(1) The growth of a natural lawn as defined in this Section shall be considered a public
nuisance unless a Natural Lawn Management Plan has been filed and approved and a
permit is issued by the City as set forth in this Section. Violators shall be served with
a notice of public nuisance by certified mail to the last-known mailing address of the
property owner.
(2) If the person so served with a notice of public nuisance violation does not abate the
nuisance within ten (10) days, the Common Council may proceed to abate such
nuisance, keeping an account of the expense of the abatement, and such expense shall
be charged to and paid by such property owner. Notice of the bill for abatement of the
public nuisance shall be mailed to the owner of the premises and shall be payable
within ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof. Within sixty (60) days after such
costs and expenses are incurred and remain unpaid, the City Clerk shall enter those
charges onto the tax roll as a special tax as provided by State statute.
(3) The failure of the City Clerk to record such claim or to mail such notice or the failure
of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to place the City expense
on the tax rolls for unpaid bills for abating the public nuisance as provided for in this
Section.
(h) Penalty.
(1) Any person, firm or corporation which does not abate the nuisance within the
City of Cedarburg

subject to the general penalty found in Section 1-1-7.
(2) In addition to any penalties herein provided, the City may issue stop work orders
upon owners of lots where work is unfinished under a previously issued building
permit for any violation of this Section.
SEC. 8-1-7 REGULATION OF LENGTH OF LAWN AND GRASSES. (Ord. 2014-06)
(a) Purpose. This Section is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated with
lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow to excessive length in the City of
Cedarburg.
(b) Public Nuisance Declared. The Common Council finds that lawns, grasses and noxious
weeds on lots or parcels of land which exceed eight (8) inches in length adversely affect the
public health and safety of the public in that they tend to emit pollen and other discomforting
bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris can be hidden in the
grass, interferes with the public convenience and adversely affects property values of other
land within the City. For that reason, any lawn, grass or weed on a lot or other parcel of land
which exceeds eight (8) inches in length is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. An
exception to the height requirement will be allowed for property located in designated
floodplain areas, drainageways and/or wetland areas or where the lawn, grass or weed is part
of a natural lawn approved pursuant to Section 8-1-6 above.
(c) Nuisances Prohibited. No person, firm or corporation shall permit any public nuisance as
defined in Subsection (b) above to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him
within the City.
(d) Inspection. The Weed Commissioner or his designee shall inspect or cause to be inspected
all premises and places within the City to determine whether any public nuisance as defined
in Subsection (b) above exists.
(e) Abatement of Nuisance.
(1) If the Weed Commissioner shall determine with reasonable certainty that any public
nuisance as defined in Subsection (b) above exists, he shall immediately cause
written notice to be served that the City proposes to have the lot grass or lawn cut so
as to conform with this Section and Section 8-1-5.
(2) The notice shall be served at least seven (7) days prior to the date of the City's date of
action to have the grass or lawn cut and shall be mailed or served on the owner of the
lot or parcel of land or, if he is not known and there is a tenant occupying the
property, then to the tenant, of the time and place at which the hearing will be held.
(f) Due Process Hearing. If the owner believes that his grasses or weeds are not a nuisance, he
may request a hearing before the Common Council. The request for said hearing must be
made in writing to the City Clerk's office within the seven (7) days set forth in the Weed
Commissioner's notice. Upon application for the hearing, the property owner must deposit a
$25.00 bond. If a decision is rendered in the property owner's favor, the $25.00 will be
City of Cedarburg
Health and Sanitation
8
returned to the property owner. If the property owner fails to appear for the hearing or if the
decision is rendered against the property owner, the deposit shall be forfeited and applied to
the cost of City personnel abating the nuisance, if necessary. When the owner of the property
requests a hearing, a hearing by the Common Council shall be held within fourteen (14) days
from the date of the owner's request. The City will not mow the property in question until
such time as the Council holds the hearing. At the hearing, the owner may appear in person
or by his attorney, may present witnesses in his own behalf and may cross-examine witnesses
presented by the City as well as subpoena witnesses for his own case. At the close of the
hearing, the Common Council shall make its determination in writing specifying its findings,
facts, and conclusions. If the Common Council determines that a public nuisance did exist,
the Council shall order the Weed Commissioner to mow the property in question unless the
property has been mowed by the owner within forty-eight (48) hours of the Common
Council's decision. If the owner does not abate the nuisance within the described forty-eight
(48) hours, the Weed Commissioner shall cause the same nuisance to be abated and cost in
excess of the forfeited fee assessed accordingly.
(g) City's Option To Abate Nuisance. In any case where the owner, occupant or person in
charge of the property shall fail to cut his lawn, grass or weeds as set forth above, then, and
in that event, the City may elect to cut said lawn, grass or weeds as follows:
(1) The written notice required in Subsection (e) shall inform said person that in the
event of his failure to abate the nuisance within the prescribed time, the City shall
abate the same and the cost thereof shall be assessed to the property owner as a
special charge.
(2) The City shall cut or cause to be cut all grass and weeds from the subject's property
and shall charge the expenses of so doing at a rate as established by resolution by the
Common Council. The charges shall be set forth in a statement to the City Clerk
who, in turn, shall mail the same to the owner, occupant or person in charge of the
subject premises. If said statement is not paid in full within thirty (30) days
thereafter, the City Clerk shall enter the charges in the tax roll as a special tax against
said lot or parcel of land, and the same shall be collected in all respects like other
taxes upon real estate, or as provided under Sec. 66.615(3)(f), Wisconsin Statutes.
SEC. 8-1-8 REGULATION OF SMOKING. (Ord. 2010-11)

within one (1) year to the available sewer and water mains of the systems.
"Available" shall be defined as City sewer and water service being available in front
of the property or in an easement adjacent to the property.
(2) Whenever sewer and water service becomes available to any building already in
existence and used for human habitation, the Building Inspector shall notify in
writing the owner, agent or occupant thereof to connect all facilities thereto required
by the Building Inspector. If such person to whom the notice has been given shall fail
to comply for more than ten (10) days after the notice, the Building Inspector shall
cause the necessary connections to be made and the expense thereof shall be assessed
as a special tax against the property pursuant to Sec. 144.06, Wis. Stats.

and shall be abated upon ten (10) days' written notice for such abatement by the Building
City of Cedarburg
Health and Sanitation
11
Inspector. If not so abated, the Building Inspector shall cause the same to be done and the
cost thereof assessed as a special tax against the property.
(c) Extension of Time. The Sewage Commission may extend the time for connection hereunder
or may grant another temporary relief where strict reinforcement would work an unnecessary
hardship without corresponding public or private benefit.
(d) Sewer Connection Charge.
(1) Before the required connection is made for an existing or new building used or to be
used for human habitation, a sewer connection charge will be imposed on all such
connections and levied as a special assessment. The charges to be assessed are as

SEC. 8-1-10 DISPOSAL OF STORM AND OTHER CLEAR WATER WASTES.
(a) Prohibition on Disposition. No person shall connect or continue the connection of any
premises with any main sanitary sewer by a drain or sewer through which rain or surface
water, foundation footing drainage, garage drainage or other clear water wastes may be
discharged into the sanitary sewer system. All such existing connections must be
disconnected within thirty (30) days of the date of notice to the owner of the property by the
Building Inspector or his designee. The Sewage Commission may grant variances with
respect to the time within which disconnection must be completed upon a showing of undue
hardship.
(b) Required Connections. Storm and other clear water wastes shall discharge to a storm sewer
system where available. Where no storm sewer system is available or is not adequate to
receive the anticipated flow, the storm and clear water wastes shall be disposed of by means
of a sump pump and drain on the premises. Drainage shall be controlled so as to minimize
the flow of such storm and clear water wastes onto streets, sidewalks and adjoining
properties.
(c) Compliance.
(1) General Inspections. The Building Inspector, or his designee, bearing proper
City of Cedarburg
Health and Sanitation
12
credentials and identification, shall make such inspections of individual disposal
systems as are necessary to insure compliance with this Section. In those cases in
which the City lacks an easement for the purpose of making such inspections and the
owner or other occupant of the premises refuses voluntary access to the premises, the
Building Inspector is authorized to seek a special inspection warrant under Sec.
66.122, Wis. Stats.
(2) Change of Ownership Inspection. Prior to a change in ownership of premises used for
residential purposes, whether or not such use is exclusive, the Building Inspector
shall inspect the premises to determine whether the disposal of storm and other clear
water wastes is in compliance with the provisions of this Section.
(3) Certificate of Compliance. Upon an inspection under Subsection (c)(1) or (2) above
that shows that the premises inspected comply with the requirements of this Section,
a Certificate of Compliance shall be issued to the owner. Except as hereinafter
provided, no change in ownership of any such property shall take place unless the
Building Inspector has issued a Certificate of Compliance with the provisions of this
Section within three (3) months prior to the time such change in ownership takes
place. For purposes of this Section, the date the new owner acquires legal title or the
right to possession, subject to rights of tenants, shall be deemed the date on which the
change in ownership takes place. If a change in ownership occurs prior to the
issuance of a Certificate of Compliance, the new owners shall be under a continuing
duty to obtain said Certificate of Compliance.
(4) Written Notice of Violation. A person found to be violating any provision of this
Section shall be served by the City with a written notice stating the nature of the
violation and providing a reasonable time for the satisfactory correction thereof The
person committing the violation shall, within the period stated within such notice,
correct the situation and permanently cease all violations.
(5) Escrow. In the event no inspection of the premises has been made prior to the change
in ownership or in the event an inspection of the premises prior to the change in
ownership discloses noncompliance with the provisions of this Section and
insufficient time remains to effect compliance prior to such change in ownership,
then in either event the sum of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) shall be withheld from
the proceeds of the transaction and shall be placed in escrow with an agent agreeable
to the parties, or with the new owners in the absence of such an agreement, to insure
compliance with the provisions of this Section. The parties to a change in ownership
shall cause the premises to come into compliance and shall obtain a Certificate of
Compliance within thirty (30) days after the change in ownership. After issuance of a
Certificate of Compliance and after payment of all labor and materials provided, any
balance remaining in the escrow fund shall be released to the former owner of the
premises.
(d) Penalty. Every person, firm or corporation who is a party to a change in ownership which
takes place prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance and who has not established
City of Cedarburg
Health and Sanitation
13
an escrow as stated previously, who refuses to comply with a special inspection warrant
issued pursuant to Sec. 66.122, Wis. Stats., or violates this Section in any other manner, shall
be subject to the penalties set forth in Section 1-1-7. Imposition of a penalty shall not
abrogate the requirement that a Certificate of Compliance be issued after a change in
ownership takes place or that any violation be corrected. Every day that elapses until said
Certificate is issued shall constitute a separate violation of this Section.
(e) Liability. Any person violating any provisions of this Section shall be liable to the City for
any expense, loss or damage to the City which results from such violation.
(f) Appeal. Any person adversely affected by the enforcement of this Section may file with the
Sewage Commission within ten (10) days of the date of the enforcement action a written
request for reconsideration, setting forth in detail the facts supporting such request. The
Commission shall render a decision within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request.
Decisions of the Commission may be appealed to the Common Council. The Council shall
hear the appeal within forty-five (45) days of filing the appeal from the decision of the
Sewage Commission and render its decision on appeal within twenty (20) days of its hearing.
A fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) shall be paid to the City Clerk at the time of filing any
appeal to the Common Council under this Section. This fee may be refunded by the Common
Council if the appeal is sustained in favor of the appellant.
(g) Fees. A fee of fifty ($50.00) dollars shall be paid to the City Treasurer prior to inspection of
the subject premises pursuant to Subsection (c) above. If additional inspection(s) are
required to assure compliance with the provisions of this Section and the issuance of a
Certificate of Compliance, an additional fee of forty-five ($45.00) dollars shall be paid to the
City Treasurer prior to each such inspection. (Ord. 90-02) (Ord. 90-36) (Ord. 91-37)
(h) Disclaimer. A Certificate of Compliance indicates that, so far as can be reasonably
determined by a visual inspection of the premises and a review of City records, the premises
meets the requirements of this Section. Neither the City of Cedarburg nor the Building
Inspector assumes any liability in the inspection or issuance of a Certificate of Compliance
and, by the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance, does not guarantee or warrant the
condition of the premises inspected.

(a) Basis for Sewer Service Charges. The sewer service charge shall be based on the sewer use
charge. If any user of the sewer system procures any part or all of his water from sources
other than the Water Utility, the user shall furnish, install and maintain, at his expense, water
meters of a type approved by the Water Utility for the purpose of determining the volume of
sewage discharged to the sewer system as described in Section 9-2-13. A meter reading
charge shall be charged to those users who procure water from other sources than the Water
Utility and who install a water meter for determining sewer user charges. At the discretion of
the Sewage Commission, a user procuring water from other sources than the Water Utility
may be assigned a Residential Equivalent Connection (REC) to be used as a basis of the
sewer use charge as determined by Section 9-2-19. If, in the opinion of the Director of
Engineering and Public Works, the information in Section 9-2-19 does not accurately reflect
the users' wastewater discharge to the sewerage system, then the Director of Engineering and
Public Works may assign a REC to the user. Refer to Section 9-2-5(c) for maintenance of
service charge. (Ord. 96-04)
(b) Sewer User Charge.
(1) a. A sewer user charge is hereby imposed upon all users of the sewer system.
The sewer user charge shall have a component for recovering the operation,
maintenance, and replacement cost and a portion or all of the debt cost of the
sewerage system. On or before September 1 of every year, the Director of
Engineering and Public Works shall compute the sewer user charge per one
thousand (1,000) gallons of water used. The operation, maintenance,
replacement, and debt service portion of the sewer user charge shall be
computed by allocating the proposed net yearly operation, maintenance, and
replacement budget to the appropriate use factors. The cost-per-use factor
shall be divided by the City in conjunction with the use factor to determine
the unit cost ($/1,000 gallons $/#), per use factor. The flow use factor will be
determined by the City in conjunction with the Water Utility. The BOD,
Total Suspended Solids, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, and Phosphorus use factors
will be determined from the concentration assigned to domestic wastewater
plus surcharge user data. The flow use factors will be determined by the
Director of Engineering and Public Works, considering actual data for the
previous twelve (12) month period from the Wastewater Treatment Facility
and surcharge user data. The residential water consumption of sprinkling as
determined by the Water Utility and any water credit meters for any
refrigeration, air conditioning system, or industrial cooling water not entering
the sewer system shall not be used in computing the sewer use charge. The
Common Council is further authorized to adjust the sewer user charge by
means of adoption of an ordinance setting sewer rates from time to time as
circumstances require to recover the operation, maintenance, and replacement
costs and a portion of all of the debt costs of the sewerage system. This
authority shall be in addition to the annual revision set forth above.
(b) The sewer user charges and rates set forth in the annual sewer department
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
22
budget.
(2) Users with domestic wastewater connected to the sewer system who derive all or part
of their water discharged to the sewer system from other sources than the Water
Utility and who do not have these other water sources metered will be charged for
operation, maintenance and replacement costs based upon their assigned number of
residential equivalent connections. The flow per residential equivalent connection
will be computed by the Water Utility or the Director of Engineering and Public
Works on or before September 1 of every year and shall equal the water used by
residential customers minus sprinkling credits divided by the number of residential
water customers.
(3) The principal and interest debt recovery for the Wastewater Treatment Facility
(WWTF) shall be recovered by a special assessment for a fixed portion of the
WWTF and on a use basis for the remaining portion of the debt. On or before
September 1 of every year, the yearly debt cost for use will be computed by the
Director of Engineering and Public Works by subtracting the special assessment
payments for the upcoming year from the total debt cost projected for the upcoming
year for the WWTF. The debt cost for use will be allocated to the appropriate use
factors. The cost per use factor will be divided by the use factor to determine the unit
cost ($1,000 gallons, $/#) per use factor. The use factors shall be the same as
determined for the recovery operation, maintenance and replacement costs. The flow
use factor will be determined by the City in conjunction with the Water Utility. All
other use factors will be determined by the Director of Engineering and Public
Works in a similar manner as the use factors for operation and maintenance costs.
(4) Users with domestic wastewater connected to the sewerage system who derive all or
part of their water discharged to the Sewerage System from other sources than the
Water Utility and who do not have these other water sources metered will be charged
for the debt cost for use associated with the WWTF based upon their assigned
number of residential equivalent connections as determined by the Director of
Engineering and Public Works.
(c) Sewer Connection Fee
A connection charge is imposed to fund collection system oversizing associated with new
development and all newly annexed lots. This includes all lots created by land division,
subdivision or condominium plats. The charge is not applicable to individual existing single
vacant lots which are within the City. It does apply to newly annexed individual lots.
(1) The Sewer Connection Fee Schedule is as follows:
$1,477.58 per single-family dwelling
$981.36 per unit for multi-family
$1,477.58 per residential equivalent for commercial, industrial and institutional
(2) The connection fee imposed under this section shall be adjusted annually each
December, with any adjustment to be effective on January 1 of the following year.
The annual adjustment will be based on the Construction Cost Index (CCI) published
in the Engineering News Record. Said percentage shall be calculated on the ENR 20
city average. Periodic adjustments to reflect actual and planned development density
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
23
corrections may be necessary.
(d) Rehabilitation and Other Collection System Capital Improvements. The debt cost
associated with the rehabilitating and capital improvements of the collection system may be
collected City-wide through a mill tax or user charges. A fund may be collected each year
through a City-wide mill tax or user charges for the capital improvement of the collection
system. This annual fund shall be reviewed by the City every four (4) years for
appropriateness to meet the financial needs. A separate account is to be established for this
fund.
(e) Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) Replacement Fund. A charge shall be imposed
upon the users of the sewer system for the purpose of capital improvements of the WWTF
and for purposes of establishing a replacement fund as required by Section NR 128.02(18),
Wis. Adm. Code. The WWTF replacement fund will be collected on the same basis as the
use factors for the operation and maintenance budget. The City shall review the
appropriateness of this fund every two (2) years. A separate account is to be established for
this fund.
(f) Industrial and Commercial Charges for Other Than Domestic Wastewater.
(1) Charges for wastewater other than domestic wastewater shall be based on flow,
BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus, nitrogen and such other constituents which
affect the cost of the collection and treatment. All persons discharging wastes into the
Sewerage System are subject to a surcharge, in addition to any other wastewater
service charge, if their wastewater has a concentration greater than domestic
wastewater concentrations. The volume of flow used for computing waste surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption, or the actual volume of waste as determined
by a sampling and metering manhole or a discharge monitoring station. The amount
of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the City in removing BOD, suspended
solids, phosphorus, nitrogen and other pertinent constituents. The surcharge shall be
computed on the basis of Model No. 2 contained on page 5270 of the Federal
Register, Volume 39, No. 29, February 11, 1974.
Surcharge = [Bc (B) + Sc (S) + Pc (P) + Nc (N)] Vu
Bc = O&M, replacement and debt costs for treatment of a unit of biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD)
B = Concentration of BOD from a user above the base level
Vu = Volume contribution from a user per unit of time Sc, S, Pc, P, Nc, N =
Same definition as above for the parameters suspended solids, phosphorus
and nitrogen.
(g) Septate Charge.
(1) Charges for septate discharges shall be based on flow, BOD, suspended solids,
phosphorus, nitrogen and such other constituents which affect the cost of the
collection and treatment. All persons discharging septate which has concentrations
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
24
greater than domestic wastewater are subject to a surcharge. The volume of flow
used for computing the septate charge will be the volume of septate discharged. The
amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the City in removing BOD,
suspended solids, phosphorus, nitrogen and other pertinent constituents. The
surcharge shall be computed in the same manner as described in Section 9-2-5(h).
(2) Unless sampled, the characteristics of septate shall be as follows:
Residential Residential
Septic Tank Holding Tank
BOD 7,000 mg/l 800 mg/l
TSS 15,000 mg/l 1,800 mg/l
Phosphorus 250 mg/l 24 mg/l
Nitrogen 70 mg/l 45 mg/l
(3) The surcharge shall be based upon these parameters and the volume of septate
discharged unless the septate is sampled. All costs associated with sample collection,
storage, analysis and administration shall be paid for by the septate hauler.
(4) The minimum user charge rate for septate shall be the same as that for a residential
holding tank using the wastewater characteristics listed above. The septate charge
shall include a service charge for maintenance of the septate receiving station and
administration of the septate receiving program.
(h) Special Rates. It is understood, however, that the approving authority may, at any time
hereafter, set special rates for any large commercial service, industrial use, extraterritorial
areas, contract users or any other unique user that does not readily fit into other categories of
users.
SEC. 9-2-7 ANNUAL BUDGET AND METHOD OF PAYMENT OF CHARGES.
(a) Budget. Annually before November 1st, the City shall prepare a budget for the following
fiscal year which shall be separated into sections, the first for operation and maintenance and

(f) Debt Service Expenditures. Expenditures for the debt service budget shall include
principal, interest, premiums, paying agency fees and other expenses related to debt.
(g) Coverage of Debt Service Requirements.
(1) The budget shall provide for the satisfaction of any debt service coverage
requirements imposed by bond resolutions or ordinances relating to Sewerage
System Revenue Bonds issued by the City, pursuant to Sec. 66.066, Wis. Stats.
Unless otherwise provided in the bond resolution or ordinance, the budget shall
provide that projected net revenues of the sewerage system (i.e., all revenues derived
from operation of the system minus the costs of operation and maintenance of the
system) shall be in an amount equal to no less than one hundred twenty-five percent
125%) of the principal and interest due in the fiscal year on all outstanding revenue
bonds.
(2) The budget may also include amounts to be deposited into the debt service account(s)
for general obligation bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness issued by the City
to finance costs of the Sewerage System, in order to abate the taxes levied by the
City to pay principal and interest on such bonds, notes, or certificates of
indebtedness. The amount included in the budget to provide for payment of such
general obligation debt shall equal the amount of the debt service taxes levied
pursuant to the resolution authorizing the debt for the fiscal year to which the budget
relates, reduced by any amount of such tax which the City intends to carry on the tax
rolls in that fiscal year.
(h) Payment of Charges. Sewer service charges may be billed monthly and shall be payable at
the Water Utility office or at any other officially designated location. Statements for such
charges and assessments levied and assessed in accordance with this Chapter shall become
due and payable within twenty (20) days from and after the date of the statement. In the
event that any such statement or statements are not paid within twenty (20) days of issuance,
a charge of not more than one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month will be added to the
bill. This late payment charge shall be applied to the total unpaid balance for sewer service
charges. This charge is applicable to all customers.
(i) Billing. The property owner is held responsible for all sewer bills on premises that he owns.
All sewer bills and notices of any nature, relative to the sewer service, will be addressed to
the owner and/or occupant and delivered to the addressee by first-class mail.
(j) Failure to Receive Bill No Penalty Exemption. Every reasonable care will be exercised in
the proper delivery of sewer bills. Failure to receive a sewer bill, however, shall not relieve
any person of the responsibility for payment of sewer rates within the prescribed periods, nor
exempt any person from any penalty imposed for delinquency in the payment thereof.
(k) Delinquent Bills. The Water Utility will attempt to collect delinquent sewer bills and, if
unsuccessful, the balance will be placed on the tax rolls as a lien on the property pursuant to
Sec. 66.60(16), Wis. Stats.

SEC. 9-3-4 GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
(a) Grant. In the event the City shall grant to a Grantee or renew a nonexclusive, revocable
franchise to construct, operate, maintain and reconstruct a cable system within the franchise
area, said franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the service of a
cable system as required by this Chapter and by the terms of the Franchise Agreement.
(b) Franchise Required. Subject to federal and state law, no cable operator shall be allowed to
occupy or use the streets within the incorporated limits of the City without a franchise
granted in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
(c) Franchise Nonexclusive. Any franchise granted under this Chapter shall be revocable and
nonexclusive. The City reserves the right to grant a similar franchise to any person at any
time.
(d) Revisions. Any franchise granted under this Chapter is hereby made subject to any revisions
of this Chapter and the general ordinances of the City, provided that such revisions do not
materially and adversely alter the Grantee’s obligations or impair the Grantee’s rights set out
in any Franchise Agreement.
(e) Term. The term of any new or renewal franchise granted under this Chapter shall be
established in the Franchise Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall any
franchise granted under this Chapter exceed the term of fifteen (15) years.
(f) Mortgage or Pledge of System. Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to prohibit a
Grantee from mortgaging or pledging of its system or any part thereof. However, any such
mortgage or pledge shall be subject to and subordinate to the right of the City under this
Chapter, any Franchise Agreement or applicable laws.
(g) Previous Rights Abandoned. The franchise shall be in lieu of any and all other rights,
privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities owned, possessed, controlled or exercisable
by the Grantee or any successor pertaining to the construction, operation, maintenance or
reconstruction of a cable system in the City. The acceptance of the franchise shall operate, as
between the Grantee and the City, as an abandonment of any and all of such rights,
privileges, powers, immunities and authorities within the City. All construction, operation,
maintenance and reconstruction by the Grantee of any cable system in the City shall be under
this Chapter and the Franchise Agreement and not under any other right, privilege, power,
immunity or authority.

times during the life of the franchise be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power by

telephone companies, or others maintaining poles or conduits in the streets of the City,
whenever the Grantee finds it necessary to make use of such poles or conduits.

franchise shall not impart to the Grantee any right of property in or on City-owned property.
(k) Use of Grantee’s Facilities. The City shall have the right to install and maintain, free of
charge, upon the poles and within the underground pipes and conduits of the Grantee, any
wires and fixtures desired by the City to the extent that such installation and maintenance
does not interfere with existing and future operations of the Grantee.

provisions of this Chapter shall be binding upon the Grantee, its successors, lessees or
assignees.

Chapter, reevaluate the needs of the community for cable service, and review the

the renewal request.
(b) Renewal Criteria Where Cable Act Applies. To the extent applicable, the Cable Act shall
govern the procedures and standards for renewal of any franchise awarded pursuant to this
Chapter. Accordingly, the City shall renew or extend a franchise unless it finds that:

Chapter, the Franchise Agreement, or with applicable law, or its officers have
been convicted of a felony;
(2) The quality of the Grantee’s service, including signal quality, response to
consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix or
quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been

Public Utilities
45
(3) The Grantee lacks the legal, technical, or financial ability to provide the
services, facilities, and equipment it proposes to provide;

refuse to renew the franchise or unreasonably condition the renewal. The conditions the City
may place on its approval shall include, but are not limited to: remedy of historical or
existing violations of the franchise or ordinance; payment of all fees and penalties owed by
the Grantee at the time of the renewal; acceptance of any updated ordinance; and acceptance

SEC. 9-3-7 REVOCATION.
(a) City’s Right to Revoke and Grounds Therefore. In addition to all other rights which the

occur, each of which shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise:
(1) The Grantee violates any material provision of this franchise or its Franchise
Agreement with the City; or

fourteen (14) days for any reason within the Grantee’s control or abandons the
management and/or operation of the system; or
(6) The Grantee materially misrepresents a fact in the application for or negotiation of,
or renegotiation of, or renewal of, its franchise.
(b) Notice and Opportunity to Cure Prior to Revocation. In the event that the City
determines that the Grantee has committed a material breach of the franchise, the City may
make a written demand on the Grantee that the Grantee cure such breach and inform the
Grantee that continued breach may be cause for revocation. If the breach is not cured to the
satisfaction of the City within thirty (30) days following such demand, the City may revoke
the Grantee’s franchise and terminate the Franchise Agreement pursuant to the revocation
procedures set out in Section 8.
(c) Notice and Opportunity for Hearing. The City shall not revoke any franchise without
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
46
giving the Grantee reasonable notice and opportunity for a public hearing before the City
Council.
(d) Revocation Resolution. In the event that the City determines to revoke a Grantee’s

SEC. 9-3-8 PROCEDURES ON REVOCATION OR TERMINATION.
(a) Removal of Facilities/Continued Operation. In the event that a Grantee’s franchise is
revoked, expires, or is otherwise terminated, the City may order the Grantee to remove its
facilities from the franchise area within ninety (90) days of the date of such order, or the City
may require the Grantee to continue operating its cable system for a period not to exceed
twenty-four (24) months as indicated in Subsection (d) below.
(b) Restoration of Property. In removing its facilities from the franchise area, the Grantee
shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation it makes and shall leave all public ways and
places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to the Grantee’s removal of its facilities
without affecting the electrical or telephone cables, wires, or attachments. The Grantee’s
insurance, indemnity obligations, performance bond(s) and security fund(s) required by this
Chapter and by the Franchise Agreement shall continue in full force and effect during the
period of removal and until full compliance by the Grantee with the terms and conditions of
this Section.
(c) Restoration by City, Reimbursement of Costs. If the Grantee fails to complete any work
required by Subsections (a) and/or (b) above, or any other work required by the City within
thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice, and to the satisfaction of the City, the City
may cause such work to be done and the Grantee shall reimburse the City for the cost thereof
within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs, or the City may recover
such costs through the security fund or bonds provided by Grantee. The City shall be
permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this Section.
(d) Extended Operation. Subject to federal, state and local law, upon either the expiration or
revocation of a franchise, the City may require the Grantee to continue to operate the cable
system for a defined period of time not to exceed twenty-four (24) months from the date of
such expiration or revocation. The Grantee shall, as trustee for its successor in interest,
continue to operate the cable system under the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the
Franchise Agreement and to provide the regular cable service and any of the other services
that may be provided at that time.
SEC. 9-3-9 OTHER REMEDIES.
(a) Lesser Remedies. Nothing shall prohibit the City from invoking lesser remedies than
revocation for violations of the provisions of this Chapter or the Franchise Agreement,
including imposing monetary damages as set out in Subsection (c) below.
(b) Notice and Opportunity to Cure Prior to Imposition of Monetary Damages. In the event
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
47
that the City determines that the Grantee has failed to perform any material obligation under
this Chapter or the Franchise Agreement, the City may make a written demand on the
Grantee that the Grantee cure such breach and inform the Grantee that continued breach may
be cause for the imposition of monetary damages. If the breach is not cured to the
satisfaction of the City within thirty (30) days following such demand, the City may impose
monetary damages on the Grantee as set out in Subsection (c) with an aggregate maximum
penalty of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
(c) Monetary Damages. If after notice to the Grantee and opportunity for hearing, the City
determines that the Grantee has failed to perform any material obligation under this Chapter
or the Franchise Agreement, or fails to do so in a timely manner, the City may at its option,
and in its sole discretion assess monetary damages against the Grantee as provided in this
Subsection (c). This provision for assessment of damages is intended to be separate and
apart from the City’s right to enforce the provisions of the construction and performance
bonds provided for in this Chapter and is intended to be in addition to any other remedies.
This provision is intended to provide compensation to the City for actual damages.
(1) For failure to substantially complete Cable System upgrade in accordance with this
Ordinance and the Franchise Agreement unless the City approves the delay, or unless
such delay was unavoidable under Section 44(f), the amount shall be five hundred
dollars ($500) per day.
(2) For failure to obtain a permit where construction, reconstruction, or relocation of the
Cable System or its components within the rights-of-way of the City is undertaken,
the amount shall be fifty dollars ($50) per day.
(3) For failure to comply with construction, operation, or maintenance standards, the
amount shall be one hundred dollars ($100) per day.
(4) For failure to provide customer services as stated in Section 20 of this Ordinance, the
amount shall be one hundred dollars ($100 per day.
(5) For failure to test, analyze, and report on the performance of the Cable System
following a request by the City, the amount shall be one hundred dollars ($100) per
day.
(6) For failure to provide data, documents, reports, or information, or to cooperate with
the City during a performance review of the Cable System or during a Franchise Fee
audit or agreed upon procedures evaluation, the amount shall be fifty dollars ($50)
per day.
(7) For failure to submit timely reports as required under this Ordinance or the Franchise
Agreement, the amount shall be fifty dollars ($50) per day until such reports are
received by the City.
(8) For failure to comply with the material provisions of this Ordinance for which an
amount is not otherwise specifically provided for pursuant to this Section, the
amount shall be one hundred dollars ($100) per day.
SEC. 9-3-10 PURCHASE OF SYSTEM BY CITY.
(a) Purchase of System by City on Revocation. If the City revokes the franchise for cause, the
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
48
Grantee shall first offer the system for sale to the City at an equitable price under the
following procedures:
(1) If the determination of an equitable price cannot be negotiated or determined by the
City and the Grantee, the price shall be determined by an impartial appraisal
procedure pursuant to Ch. 788, Wis. Stats., wherein the Grantee and the City shall
each choose an appraiser, and the appraisers chosen shall choose a third appraiser
and the price determined by such appraisers shall be considered the equitable price at
which the system will be offered to the City. The determination of the price of the
system shall be decreased by the amount of any and all damages sustained by the
City in connection with revocation, including without limitation, payment made by
the City to another person or entity to operate the system for a temporary period after
revocation. The cost of the appraisal procedure shall be shared equally by the City
and the Grantee.
(2) The City shall have ninety (90) days commencing on the day the equitable price of
the system is determined either through negotiation or the appraisal procedure to
exercise its option to purchase. If the City does not exercise its option to purchase,
and the system is not sold to another operator who has obtained a franchise from the
City, the Grantee, upon request by the City, shall promptly remove all its facilities
from the franchise area. While transfer of the system and franchise is being
negotiated, arranged or ordered, the Grantee may be required to continue service to
the public.
(b) Purchase of System by City on Nonrenewal. If the City determines not to renew a
Grantee’s franchise, the Grantee shall first offer the system for sale to the City at fair market
value, determined on the basis of the system valued as a going concern but with no value
allocated to the franchise itself. The following procedures shall be followed:
(1) If the determination of fair market value cannot be negotiated or determined, the
value shall be determined by an impartial appraisal procedure pursuant to Ch. 788,
Wis. Stats., wherein the Grantee and the City shall each choose an appraiser and the
appraisers chosen shall choose a third appraiser and the valuation determined by such
appraisers shall be considered the fair market value at which the system will be
offered to the City. The determination of the value of the system shall be decreased
by the amount of any damages sustained by the City in connection with nonrenewal,
including without limitation, payment made by the City to another person or entity to
operate the system for a temporary period after nonrenewal. The cost of the
appraisal procedure shall be shared equally by the City and the Grantee.
(2) The City shall have ninety (90) days commencing on the day the fair market value of
the system is determined either through negotiation or the appraisal procedure to
exercise its option to purchase. If the City does not exercise its option to purchase,
and the system is not sold to another operator who has obtained a franchise from the
City, the Grantee, upon request by the City, shall promptly remove all its facilities.
While transfer of the system and franchise is being negotiated, arranged or ordered,
the Grantee may be required to continue service to the public.

held for the benefit of the public. Any franchise so granted cannot, in any event, be sold,
transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of by any method, including, but not limited to,

cancellation unless and until the City shall have consented in writing to the acquisition or
transfer. The City shall give or deny consent no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
after receiving written notice of the acquisition or transfer. The City's consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer or acquisition of control, the City may inquire into the qualifications of the
prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall assist the City in any such inquiry.

terms.
(e) Effect of City’s Consent to Transfer. The consent or approval of the City to any transfer
by the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the
streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of
any franchise. The Grantee shall not be released from its obligations under this Chapter and
the Franchise Agreement without the express written consent of the City.

A Grantee’s franchise area shall be the territorial limits of the City of Cedarburg as they may exist
now and in the future.
SEC. 9-3-13 EXTENSION OF SERVICE.
(a) Mandatory Extension of Service. The Grantee shall, at its expense, extend its system to
serve new customers within the franchise area pursuant to the following requirements:
(1) The Grantee shall extend and make cable television service available to any
households or areas existing or added to the franchise territory during the term of the
franchise. This service shall be extended within one (1) year wherever density

television service available to any dwelling unit in all unserved, developing areas
within three hundred (300) feet of existing cable plant.
(b) Non-Mandatory Extension of Service. In areas not meeting the requirements for
mandatory extension of service under Subsection (a), the Grantee shall provide to any
potential subscriber desiring service an estimate of the cost to extend service to the potential
subscriber. The Grantee shall extend service upon request of the potential subscriber. The
Grantee shall cooperate with the potential subscriber in reaching a cost-sharing agreement,
which shall provide that the Grantee will pay one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of the
first three hundred (300) feet of the extension and that the Grantee will pay sixty percent
(60%) and the potential subscriber forty percent (40%) of the cost of the next three hundred
(300) feet of the extension, up to a maximum of six hundred (600) feet. For that part of an
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
51
extension that is longer than six hundred (600) feet, the Grantee may charge the potential
subscriber for the Grantee’s actual cost of that portion of the extension. Within one (1) year,
any amount paid by a subscriber for an extension under this subsection shall be refundable to
that subscriber in the event the area subsequently meets the requirements for mandatory
extension under Subsection (a). In no event, shall the amount of the refund exceed the
amount paid by the subscriber for the extension.
(c) New Subdivisions.

City will forward to the Grantee an approved engineering plan of each project.
Subject to the density requirements set out above in Subsection (a)(i), the Grantee
shall commence the design and construction process upon receipt of the plan.
(2) In a new subdivision where utility and cable facilities are to be placed underground,
the City shall give the Grantee at least thirty (30) days advance written notice of the
date on which trenching will be available for the Grantee’s installation of conduit,
pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at the Grantee’s expense. The
Grantee shall provide specifications as needed for trenching and shall place its
facilities in the trenches on the date specified in the notice. Costs of trenching and
easements required to bring cable service to the new subdivision shall be
non-discriminatory and shall be paid by the Grantee. As used herein, “trenching”
shall include all means of installation of conduit, whether by excavation, plowing,
trenching or directional boring.
(d) Special Agreements. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the Grantee from
serving areas not covered under this Section upon agreement with developers, property
owners, or residents, provided that five (5) percent of the gross revenues derived from such
service within the franchise area are returned to the City as required under Section 19 of this
Chapter.
SEC. 9-3-14 ACCEPTANCE AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF FRANCHISE.
(a) Effective Date. Any franchise awarded under this Chapter shall take effect thirty (30) days
after the effective date of the Franchise Agreement between the City and the Grantee

requirement of this Chapter or its regulation or from the City's exercise of its
authority to grant additional franchises.
(2) Acceptance of Power and Authority of City. The Grantee expressly acknowledges
that in accepting the franchise it has relied upon its own investigation and
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
52
understanding of the power and authority of the City to grant this franchise.
(3) Inducements Not Offered. The Grantee acknowledges by acceptance of the
franchise that it has not been induced to enter into this franchise by any
understanding or promise or other statement, whether verbal or written, by or on
behalf of the City concerning any term or condition of this franchise that is not
included in this Chapter.
(4) Grantee Accepts Terms of Franchise. The Grantee acknowledges by the
acceptance of the franchise that it has carefully read its terms and conditions and it is
willing to and does accept all the obligations of such terms and conditions and further
agrees that it will not set up as against the City the claim that any provision of this
Chapter as adopted, is unreasonable, arbitrary, invalid or void, but shall be required
to accept the validity of the terms and conditions of the franchise in their entirety.
SEC. 9-3-15 RATE REGULATION.
(a) City Reserves Right of Rate Regulation. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (b),
below, the Grantee shall establish rates for its services which shall be applied on a
nondiscriminatory basis in the franchise area. Pursuant to federal law, the City reserves the
right to assume regulation of rates paid by cable subscribers; such rate regulation shall be
performed by the City Council in accordance with FCC Rules and Regulations “Part 76,
Subpart N.” As specified by the FCC’s Rules (Part 76, Subpart N), such rate regulation shall
cover basic service rates and customer premises installations and equipment rates (including
charges for, but not be limited to, converter boxes, remote control units, connections for
additional television receivers and other cable home wiring). The City reserves the right to
further regulate rates pursuant to any additional powers granted it by either the FCC or
federal or state law.
(b) Service Disconnection. A subscriber shall have the right to have its service disconnected
without charge, except for actual costs incurred by the Grantee or other charges that are
allowable under FCC regulations, which shall include the removal of any equipment owned
by the Grantee from the subscriber’s residence. Such disconnection shall be made as soon as
practicable and in no case later than thirty (30) days following written notice to the Grantee
of same. No Grantee shall enter into any agreement with a subscriber which imposes any
charge following disconnection of service, except for reconnection and subsequent monthly
or periodic charges, and those charges shall be no greater than charges for new customers.
This Section shall not prevent a Grantee from refusing service to any person because of the
Grantee’s prior accounts with that person which remain due and owing.
SEC. 9-3-16 RATE REGULATION PROCEDURES.
(a) Notice of Certification. In the event that the City assumes rate regulatory powers, the City
shall notify the Grantee of the City’s FCC Certification. Upon receipt of such notification by
the Grantee, basic service rate regulation shall become effective.
(b) Initial Rate Filing. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the City's notice of certification,
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
53
the Grantee shall file for review by the City the Grantee's rates for basic service, installation
and equipment and supporting documentation on the appropriate FCC forms.
(c) Subsequent Rate Filings. Once the Grantee's initial rates for basic service, installation, and
equipment have been established, based on the City's review of the Grantee's initial rate
filing, the Grantee shall not file to change such rates more often than allowed under
applicable federal law. The Grantee shall file all requests to change rates for basic service,
installation, and equipment using the appropriate FCC forms and give written notice of such
filing to all subscribers at least thirty (30) days before the Grantee desires the change to take
effect. The notice shall state the precise amount of any rate change and briefly explain the
reasons for the rate change. The Grantee shall not increase its rates for basic service,
installation and equipment without the approval of the City Council.
(d) Review of Initial and Subsequent Rate Filings.
(1) Expedited Determination. If the City Council is able to determine expeditiously
that the rates proposed in an initial or subsequent rate filing are reasonable as
determined under FCC regulations, the City Council shall: (1) afford interested
persons an opportunity to express their views on the proposed rates; and (2) adopt a
resolution approving the proposed rates within thirty (30) days from the date the
Grantee submitted its rate filing to the City. If the City Council takes no action
within thirty (30) days from the date the Grantee submitted its rate filing to the City,
the proposed rates will go into effect.
(2) Extended Review Period. If the City Council is unable to determine within thirty
(30) days from the date the Grantee submitted its rate filing to the City whether the
proposed rates are reasonable, as determined under FCC regulations based on the
material submitted by the Grantee, the City Council shall, by resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
(1) ninety (90) days if the City Council needs more time to ensure that the proposed
rates are reasonable; and (2) one hundred fifty (150) days if the Grantee has
submitted a cost-of-service showing.
(3) Rate Increase Tolled. A proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
(4) Delayed Determination. If the City Council has not made a decision within the
additional ninety- (90) or one hundred fifty- (150) day period, the City Council shall
issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the Grantee to keep an
accurate account of all amounts received by reason of any proposed rate increase and
on whose behalf the amounts are paid. The Grantee may put the proposed rates into
effect, subject to subsequent refund if the City Council later issues a written order
disapproving any portion of the proposed rates.
(5) Public Hearing. During the extended review period, and before taking action on the
proposed rates, the City Council shall hold at least one (1) public hearing at which
interested persons may express their views and record objections. Said public
hearing shall be announced by written notice published in a newspaper of general
circulation at least ten (10) days before the date of hearing. An interested person
who wishes to make an objection to the proposed rates may request the City to record
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
54
the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the rate order is issued. In order for an objection to be made part of
the record, the objector must provide the City with the objector's name and address.
(6) Notice and Opportunity to Comment. The City Council shall not disapprove any
portion of the proposed rates without giving the Grantee notice and an opportunity to
comment.
(7) Refunds. As specified in the FCC regulations, the City Council may order the
Grantee to refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates which have
been found to be unreasonable. Before ordering the Grantee to refund previously
paid rates to subscribers, the City Council shall give the Grantee notice and
opportunity to comment. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate
thereon shall be in accordance with FCC regulations.
(8) Written Decision and Public Notice. The City Council's decision concerning a
requested rate increase shall be by written decision. If the rate increase proposed by
the Grantee is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other
parties to the proposed rate increase, the written decision shall state the reasons for
the decision and the City Council shall give public notice of its decision. Public
notice will be given by advertisement once in the official newspaper of the City of
Cedarburg.
(e) Proprietary Information. To aid in the evaluation of the Grantee’s proposed rates, the City
Council may require the production of proprietary information, and in such cases will apply
procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of such information which are consistent with
applicable federal and state law.
(f) Appeal. The City Council's decision concerning rates for basic service, installation, and
equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations.
SEC. 9-3-17 PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.
(a) Discriminatory Practices Prohibited.
(1) A Grantee shall not refuse cable television service or otherwise discriminate against
any person or organization who requests such service on the basis of race, color,
religion, national origin, creed or sex. A Grantee shall not make or grant any
unreasonable preference or advantage, nor subject any person to any prejudice or
disadvantage, as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules, regulations or in any other
respect. The Grantee shall comply at all times with the Cable Act and all other
applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and all executive and
administrative orders relating to non-discrimination which are hereby incorporated
and made part of this Chapter by reference.

commercial subscribers at rates different from those charged residential subscribers,
which shall include, but not be limited to, charges for installation on a time and
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
55
material basis. The Grantee may also enter into separate contracts with multiple
dwelling unit buildings and may charge discounted rates for services based upon
single point billing or other contractual considerations.
(b) Fairness and Equal Access. A Grantee’s system shall be operated in a manner consistent
with the principles of fairness and equal access to its facilities, equipment, channels, studios
and other services for all citizens, businesses, public agencies or other entities having a
legitimate use for the system and no one shall be arbitrarily excluded from its use.
Allocation of use of such facilities shall be made according to the rules or decisions of
regulatory agencies affecting the same, and where such rules or decisions are not effective to
resolve a dispute between conflicting users or potential users, the matter shall be submitted
for resolution by the City.
(c) Equal Employment. A Grantee shall strictly adhere to the equal employment opportunity
requirements of federal, state and local laws and regulations in effect on the date of the
franchise grant, and as amended from time to time.
(d) Discontinuation of Service. If a subscriber fails to pay any proper fee or charge for any
service provided by the Grantee, the Grantee may discontinue said service, provided that the
unpaid bill is at least forty-five (45) days past due and the subscriber has been given at least
ten (10) business days prior notice of the intention to discontinue service. If the Grantee
receives payment of all outstanding fees and charges, including any late charges, before any
service has been discontinued, then the Grantee shall not discontinue said service. After any
service has been discontinued, upon request of the subscriber accompanied by payment in
full of all fees or charges due the Grantee and the payment of an appropriate reconnection
charge, if any, the Grantee shall promptly reinstate said service. Subscribers shall retain the
right to deactivate their terminals, but shall continue to be responsible for charges until the
Grantee is notified to terminate service. The subscriber shall not be charged any fee for the
cancellation or downgrading of cable service, except in accordance with applicable FCC
regulations.
(e) Rights of Residents.
(1) An owner or operator of an apartment building, condominium, nursing home, mobile
home park, or any other rental facility may not interfere with or charge a fee for the
installation of cable system facilities for the use of a lessee of said property or
premises, except that such owner or operator may require: (1) installation to conform
to reasonable conditions necessary to protect the safety, appearance and functioning
of the premises; (2) the Grantee, occupant, or tenant to pay for the installation,
operation, or removal of such facilities; and (3) the Grantee, occupant, or tenant to
agree to indemnify the owner or operator for any damages caused by the installation,
operation or removal of such facilities.
(2) It shall be unlawful for the Grantee to compensate or offer to compensate any person,
or for any person to demand or receive compensation from the Grantee, for the
placement upon the premises of such person of Grantee's facilities necessary to
connect such person's premises to the distribution lines of Grantee to provide cable
service to said premises.
(3) Except where there is a bulk rate agreement between a landlord and the Grantee, a
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities

landlord may not discriminate in the amount of rent charged to tenants or occupants
who receive cable service and those who do not.

the Franchise Agreement. Such franchise fee shall not be less than five percent (5%) of the
Grantee's gross revenues, or such other maximum amount as allowed by law. In the event
that a change in either state or federal law would allow the City to increase the franchise fee
above five percent (5%) of the Grantee's gross revenues, the Grantee shall not be liable for
such increase until the City shall give Grantee written notice of its desire to increase the
franchise fee, provided that the Grantee shall have notified the City in writing of such change
in the law before the change in the law took effect. The franchise fee payment shall be in
addition to any other payment owed to the City by the Grantee and shall not be construed as
payment in lieu of municipal property taxes or other state, county or local taxes.

August 15 and November 15 of each calendar year, Grantee shall pay to the City an amount
equal to five percent (5%) of the annual gross revenues for the preceding calendar year, as
reflected in the certified audited statement provided pursuant to Subsection 19(c), below (or
any independent audited statement obtained by the City pursuant to Subsection 19(c)). On
February 15 of each year, Grantee shall pay to the City an amount calculated by subtracting:
(1) the sum of the quarterly franchise fee payments made on the immediately preceding May
15, August 15 and November 15 from: (2) five percent (5%) of the annual gross revenues
for the immediately preceding calendar year, as reflected in the certified audited statement
provided with such payment, pursuant to Subsection 19(c), below.
(c) Financial Statement to be Provided by Grantee. With each February 15 franchise fee
payment, Grantee shall furnish to the City an audited statement certified by an independent

the Grantee’s records, and if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of five
percent (5%) or more, the Grantee shall assume all reasonable costs of such audit.
(d) Interest on Delinquent Payments. If any payment is not made as required, interest on the
amount due shall accrue from the date of the required submittal at an annual rate of twelve
percent (12%). The Grantee shall pay an additional compensation to the City if the payment
is late by forty-five (45) days or more. Such additional compensation shall be equal to an
City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities
57
additional six percent (6%) per annum in order to defray those additional expenses and costs
incurred by the City by reason of the delinquent payment.
(e) Acceptance by the City. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall be construed as a
release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or
additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this Chapter or for the performance of any
other obligation of the Grantee.
City of Cedarburg

the City, at least annually. In addition, the City may evaluate the quality of service at any time,

those complaints. Upon determining that service quality is inadequate, the City may order the
Grantee to cure the inadequacies. The Grantee shall commence corrective action within thirty (30)
days after receipt of written notice such order. Failure to do so shall be deemed to be a material

performance bond and/or security fund provided for in this Chapter to remedy any such franchise
breach.
SEC. 9-3-33 OPEN BOOKS AND RECORDS.

for service and other like materials of the Grantee relating to the operation of the franchise. If any
such books or records are not kept in the regional office, and if the City shall determine that an

amount of $10,000 and shall run to the City, who may be entitled to damages as a result of
any occurrence in the operation of or termination of the cable system operated under this
Chapter and the Franchise Agreement. The bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful
performance of the Grantee of all terms and conditions of the franchise granted under this
Chapter. The rights reserved to the City with respect to the bond or other security are in
addition to all other rights the City may have under this Chapter or any other law.

construction bond in the amount specified in the Franchise Agreement in favor of the City
and any other person who may claim damages as a result of the breach of any duty by the
Grantee assured by said bond. Such construction bond shall be in the form approved by the
City and issued by a company approved by the City. In no event shall the amount of such
construction bond be construed to limit the liability of the Grantee for damages. The City
may waive this requirement or permit consolidation of the construction bond with the
performance bond specified above in Subsection (a).
SEC. 9-3-36 SECURITY FUND.
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the franchise, the Grantee may be required to

responsibility of the Grantee. All provisions of any franchise shall apply to any subcontractor or
others performing any work or services pursuant to the provisions of the franchise. Nothing in this
Section shall be construed as allowing the transfer of any rights or responsibilities of the Grantee
without written approval of the City.

indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its officers, boards, commissions, agents, and

attorneys fees in any way existing out of or through or alleged to arise out of or through: (1)
the act of the City in granting the franchise; (2) the acts or omissions of Grantee, its servants,
employees, or agents including, but not limited to, any failure or refusal by Grantee, its
servants, employees or agents to comply with any obligation or duty imposed on Grantee by
this Chapter or the Franchise Agreement; or (3) the exercise of any right or privilege granted

counsel reasonably acceptable to the City or other indemnified party. Provided, however,

such claims at Grantee’s sole expense, and in such event, such participation shall not relieve
the Grantee from its duty to defend against liability or to pay any judgment entered against
such party. Grantee shall not agree to any settlement of claims without the City’s approval.
(d) City’s Negligence. The Grantee shall not be required to indemnify the City for negligence

otherwise.
SEC. 9-3-40 WAIVER OF CHARGES.
During the term of a franchise and upon request by the City, the Grantee shall provide free basic and

and materials. Premium channels shall be available to the City at their retail cost.
SEC. 9-3-41 PROTECTION OF NON-SUBSCRIBERS.

Chapter, the Franchise Agreement or state or federal law.

City of Cedarburg
Public Utilities

the Grantee.
(b) No Tampering. It shall be unlawful for any person, without the Grantee’s consent, to

SEC. 9-3-44 GENERAL.

regulation of any governing authority or agency having jurisdiction, including but not limited

provisions hereof shall be superseded by any such valid law, rule or regulation to the extent
that the provisions hereof are in conflict and contrary to any such law, rule or regulation.
(b) Conflicting Ordinances Repealed. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with
this Chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of any such conflict.
(c) Severability. Should any word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, or portion of this
Chapter or a franchise be declared to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
adjudication shall not affect the validity of this Chapter and the franchise as a whole, but
shall only affect the portion thereof declared to be invalid; and the City Council hereby
expressly states and declares that it would nonetheless have passed this Chapter and granted
the franchise had it known that any such word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or portion
of said Chapter or franchise were invalid.
(d) Waiver or Exemption. The City reserves the right to waive provisions of this Chapter or
exempt a Grantee from meeting provisions of this Chapter, if the City determines that such
waiver or exemption is in the public interest.
(e) Nonenforcement. Subject to the provisions of the Cable Act, a Grantee shall not be relieved
of any obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter, the Franchise
Agreement, or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated by the City by
reason of any failure of the City or its officers, agents or employees to enforce prompt
compliance nor shall such be considered a waiver thereof.
(f) Force Majeure. Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance or the Franchise
Agreement, whenever a period of time is provided for, either for the City or the Grantee to do
or perform any act or obligation, neither party shall be liable for any delays due to war, riot,
insurrection, rebellion, strike, lockout, unavoidable casualty or damage to personnel,
materials, or equipment, fire, flood, storm, earthquake, tornado, orders of a court of
competent jurisdiction, any act of God, failure of a utility provider to provide pole

attachments on reasonable terms or conditions therefor, or any cause beyond the control of
said party. In such event, said time period shall be extended for the amount of time said
party is so delayed. An act or omission shall not be deemed to be beyond a Grantee’s control
if committed, omitted, or caused by a corporation or other business entity which holds a
controlling interest in the Grantee, whether directly or indirectly. In the case of a vendor
caused equipment delay, the burden of proof will be on the Grantee to show that the delay
was solely the fault of the vendor and that the vendor was an established equipment provider
at the time the order was placed. Further, the failure of a Grantee to obtain financing, or to
pay any money due from it to any person, including the City, for whatever reason, shall not
be an act or omission which is beyond the control of the Grantee.

cooperation with the Public Works Department, shall have the authority to restrict
the turning or movement of heavy traffic and to impose special weight limitations on

of not more than one (1) stall following expiration of the period allowed shall be and
constitute a violation of this Chapter.

with the consent of the Council, may suspend the parking time limitations upon notification
to the Chief of Police. In the event there does not exist sufficient time to notify the Common
Council of his desire to do so because of untimely notice or advance information or request
to the Mayor, said Chief Executive is then authorized to take such action without approval of
the Council.

Section is intended to regulate exclusive use of municipally-owned parks, park facilities,
park shelters or parts thereof in the City to the end that the general welfare of the City is
protected.
(b) Reservation of Park Space. A person or group, firm organization, partnership or
corporation may reserve the use of a park facility or a park shelter by written application filed
with the Parks and Recreation Department for a permit for exclusive use of the same. The
Parks and Recreation Department shall issue permits for exclusive use of a portion of a park
or park shelter and permits for the exclusive use of City parks. Park facilities are reserved on
a first-requested, first-reserved basis.

(c) Application. Applications shall be filed with the Parks and Recreation Department at least
thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the exclusive use of the entire park is requested, or
at least three (3) days prior to the date on which a park shelter or a portion of a park is to be
used, and shall set forth the following information regarding the proposed exclusive use:
(1) The name, address and telephone number of the applicant.
(2) If the exclusive use is proposed for a group, firm, organization, partnership or
corporations the name, address and telephone number of the headquarters of the same
and the responsible and authorized heads or partners of the same.
(3) The name, address and telephone number of the person who will be responsible for
the use of the said park, area or facility.
(4) The date when the exclusive use is requested and the hours of the proposed exclusive
date.
(5) The anticipated number of persons to use the said park, area or facility. Any
additional information which is deemed reasonably necessary to a fair determination
as to whether a permit should be issued.
(d) Reservation Fees and Deposits. Subject to the provisions of Subsection (h), all applicants
for reservation of park space or park buildings for which a permit is required shall pay fees
and security deposits as set forth in Policy PR-1, Park Reservations, as the same from time to
time may be amended. (Ord. 90-20) (Ord. 90-25) (Ord. 90-29)
(e) Action on Application. The Park and Forestry Board or appropriate committee thereof shall
act promptly on all applications for permits for exclusive park use (not shelter use) after
consulting with the applicant, if necessary.
(f) Reasons for Denial. Applicants may be denied for any of the following reasons:
(1) If it is for a use which would involve a violation of Federal or State law or any
provision of this Code.
(2) If the granting of the permit would conflict with another permit already granted or for
which application is already pending.
(3) If the application does not contain the information required by Subsection (c) above.
(4) The application is made less than the required days in advance of the scheduled
exclusive use.
(5) If it is for a use of the park or park facility at a date and time when, in addition to the
proposed use, anticipated nonexclusive use by others of the park or park facility is
expected and would be seriously adversely affected.
(6) If the law enforcement requirements of the exclusive use will require so large a
number of persons as to prevent adequate law enforcement to the park, park facility
or shelter area involved or of the rest of the City.
(7) The exclusive use will reasonably create a substantial risk of injury to persons or
damage to property.
(8) The exclusive use is so poorly organized that participants are likely to engage in
aggressive or destructive activity.
(g) Indemnification. Prior to granting any permit for exclusive use of the park, the City may
City of Cedarburg
Parks and Navigable Waters
7
require the permittee to file evidence of good and sufficient sureties, insurance in force or
other evidence of adequate financial responsibility, running to the City and such other third
parties as may be injured or damaged, in an amount depending upon the likelihood of injury
or damage as a direct and proximate result of the exclusive use sufficient to indemnify the
City and such third parties as may be injured or damaged thereby, caused by the permittee, its
agents or participants.
(h) Permit Not Required For City Activity. A permit is not required for exclusive use of the
park or a park facility sponsored by the City.
(1) A permit is not required for exclusive use of the park or a park facility where such use
is sponsored by the City. (Ord. 90-29)
(2) The Common Council shall have the authority to grant a variance to or waiver of fees
required under this ordinance and Policy PR-1, Park Reservations, for such
community events as it deems appropriate. (Ord. 90-29)
(i) Permit Revocation. The Common Council, Park and Forestry Board and/or Chief of Police
after granting a permit may revoke a permit already issued if it is deemed that such action is
justified by an actual or potential emergency due to weather, fire, riot, other catastrophe or
likelihood of breach of the peace or by a major change in the conditions forming the basis of
the issuance of the permit.
(j) Form of Permit. Each permit shall be in a form prescribed by the City and shall designate
the park, park facility or shelter area involved, date, hours of the exclusive use, purpose of
the exclusive use and the name of the person, group, firm, organization, partnership or
corporation to which the permit is issued.
(k) Class B Fermented Malt Beverage. When fermented malt beverages are sold at any event
authorized by this Section, a valid Fermented Malt Beverage license shall be obtained and
the provisions of Sections 7-2-11 and 11-5-1 shall be fully complied with. Said license must
be held by the person who filed the original license and shall be presented to any law
enforcement officer upon request.
Cross Reference: Sections 7-2-11 and 11-5-1.

Introduction
SEC. 13-1-1 AUTHORITY.
This Chapter is adopted under the authority granted by Sections 62.23(7), 62.231, 62.2345, 87.30,
and 144.26 of the Wisconsin Statutes and amendments thereto.
SEC. 13-1-2 TITLE.
This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cedarburg,
Wisconsin" and is hereinafter referred to as the "Ordinance" or "Chapter."
SEC. 13-1-3 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Zoning Ordinance is to promote the comfort, health, safety, morals, prosperity,
aesthetics, and general welfare of the City of Cedarburg, Wisconsin, and its residents.
SEC. 13-1-4 INTENT.
It is the general intent of this Zoning Ordinance to regulate and restrict the use of all structures,
lands, and waters with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most
appropriate use of land. Such regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan
and shall be designed to regulate lot coverage, size, and location; population density and distribution;
parking, loading, and access and uses of land, structures, and water in order to:
(a) Prevent and eliminate overcrowding of land and undue concentration of population.
(b) Provide adequate sunlight and air.
(c) Facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, drainage, schools, parks,
and other public services.
(d) Lessen congestion in the streets and promote safe and efficient use of streets and highways.
(e) Secure safety from fire, panic, flooding, pollution, contamination, and other hazards.
(f) Stabilize and protect property values.
(g) Preserve the beauty of the City of Cedarburg.
(h) Provide for a variety of suitable commercial and industrial sites.
(i) Prevent and control erosion, sedimentation, and pollution of the surface and subsurface
waters.
(j) Prevent flood damage to persons and property and minimize the costs of flood relief and
flood control projects.
(k) Aid in the implementation of municipal, county, watershed, and regional comprehensive
plans, or components of such plans, adopted by the City of Cedarburg.
(l) Maintain safe and healthful water conditions.
City of Cedarburg
Zoning

(m) Provide for the administration and enforcement of this Chapter and provide penalties for the
violation of this Chapter.
SEC. 13-1-5 INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION.
The interpretation and application of this Chapter shall be as follows:
(a) Construction. This Chapter shall be liberally construed in favor of the City of Cedarburg
and shall not be deemed a limitation on any power possessed by the City of Cedarburg.
(b) Administrative Standards. This Chapter shall be considered minimum requirements
adopted for the purposes set forth above. Whenever in the course of administration and
enforcement of this Chapter it is necessary or desirable to make any administrative decision,
the decision shall be made so that the result will not be contrary to the spirit and purpose of
this Chapter or injurious to the surrounding neighborhood, unless other standards are
expressly provided in this Ordinance.
(c) Conflict with Other Laws. Whenever the regulations in this Chapter are either more or less
restrictive than regulations or restrictions imposed by statute, other ordinances of the City of
Cedarburg or other regulations, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose
higher standards or requirements shall govern.
(d) Application. No structure shall be constructed, erected, placed, or maintained and no land
or water use commenced or continued within the City of Cedarburg, except as specifically or
by necessary implication, authorized by this Chapter.
SEC. 13-1-6 REPEAL
All other ordinances or parts of ordinances of the City inconsistent or conflicting with this Chapter,
to the extent of the inconsistency only, are hereby repealed.
SEC. 13-1-7 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of flood protection provided by the Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering experience and scientific methods of study. On rare occasions,
larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as
ice jams or bridge openings restricted by debris. Therefore, this Chapter does not imply that areas
outside of the delineated floodplain or land uses permitted within the floodplain will be totally free
from flood and associated flood damages. Nor shall this Chapter create a liability on the part of or a
cause of action against the City of Cedarburg or any office or employee thereof for any flood
damages that may result from reliance on this Chapter.
SEC. 13-1-8 SEVERABILITY.
City of Cedarburg

If any Section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby. If
any application of this Chapter to a particular structure, land, or water is adjudged unconstitutional or
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not be applicable to any other
structure, land, or water not specifically included in said judgment.
SEC. 13-1-9 MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply
with this Chapter and obtain all required permits. State agencies are required to comply if Sec.
13.48(13) of the Wisconsin Statutes applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and
repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt
from compliance when Sec. 30.12(4)(a) of the Wisconsin Statutes applies.

SEC. 13-1-25 ANTENNAS.
The City of Cedarburg recognizes that the development of various antennas, including earth station
dish antennas, and their increasing uses by members of the public poses questions of regulation not
previously contemplated by the municipal zoning code. In implementing appropriate regulation, the
interest of the antenna owner in the use of the device must be balanced with the interest of adjoining
landowners and the general public so as to protect the health and safety of all citizens, as well as the
aesthetic values embodied in this Zoning Code. To this end, the following regulations are adopted.
Antennas are permitted as accessory uses subject to the following regulations:
(a) Installation. All antennas, and the construction and installation thereof, shall conform to
applicable City Building Code and Electrical Code regulations and requirements or U.L.
code, as may be applicable.
(b) Size. Earth station dish antennas shall not exceed ten (10) feet in diameter.
(c) Construction and Location Standards.
(1) All freestanding antennas shall be located in rear yards in any residential district and
in the side and rear yards in any business, industrial, and institutional or park district,
but not until their principal structure is present or under construction and provided
that all applicable requirements of this Chapter are met. In the event the property
owner of a parcel located in a residential district believes that the placement of an
antenna in a rear yard would prevent its use for its intended purpose, the property
owner may apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a variance to allow the
installation of the antenna in a side yard or roof location. Owners of parcels of land
within three hundred (300) feet of the site of any such freestanding antenna for which
a variance is requested shall be notified of the date and time of the Zoning Board of
Appeals meeting at which the application for a variance will be considered.
(2) Freestanding and roof-mounted terrestrial antennas used for residential purposes
shall meet the height requirements for the district in which they are located. Earth
station dish antennas shall not exceed ten (10) feet in height. Commercial, industrial,
or institutional antennas shall comply with the height requirements of Section
13-1-100(d) of this Chapter. (See Illustration No. 1.)
(3) Freestanding and roof-mounted terrestrial antennas shall be set back from any lot line
one (1) foot for each one (1) foot of antenna height above surrounding grade. Earth
station dish antennas shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from any lot line.
(See Illustration No. 1.)
(4) Not more than one (1) terrestrial antenna structure and one (1) earth station dish per
dwelling unit shall be permitted on a lot or parcel of land in a residential zoning
district.
(5) Antennas shall be located and designed to minimize their visual impact on the
surrounding properties. No form of advertising or identification may be displayed on
the dish or framework other than the customary manufacturer's identification plates.
(6) Antennas shall be constructed and mounted in accordance with the manufacturer's
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
16
specifications. All such installations shall be constructed of noncombustible and
corrosive-resistant materials.

reception on adjacent properties shall be governed in accordance with the Federal
Communication Commission's rules and regulations.
(8) The storage of antennas shall not be permitted on public property, public street
rights-of-way, or in the street yard of any business district. Display for sale of
antennas shall be permitted in the street yard of any business district only upon the
granting of a conditional use permit for such use. Such permit shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
(9) Portable or trailer-mounted antennas are not allowed, with the exception of
temporary installation for on-site testing and demonstration purposes for a period not
to exceed seven (7) days at any one (1) location.
SEC. 13-1-26 DISPLAY OF VEHICLES FOR SALE.
Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person or entity to display
for sale purposes any motor vehicle, recreational vehicle, or item of recreational equipment on
property located within the City of Cedarburg. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to the
display of no more than one (1) motor vehicle, recreational vehicle, or item of recreational
equipment at any one (1) time, provided such vehicle or equipment is owned by the owner or
occupant of the real property on which it is displayed or by an immediate family member of the
owner of the real property who shall reside on the premises on which the vehicle is displayed for
sale.
SEC. 13-1-27 SITE RESTRICTIONS.
(a) Site Suitability. No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is unsuitable for
such use or structure by reason of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage,
adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or low bearing strength, erosion
susceptibility or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity,
aesthetics, and general welfare of this community. The City Plan Commission, in applying
the provisions of this Section, shall, in writing, recite the particular facts upon which it bases
its conclusion that the land is not suitable for certain uses. The applicant shall have an
opportunity to present evidence contesting such unsuitability if he so desires. Thereafter, the
City Plan Commission may affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.
(b) Public Street Frontage. All lots shall abut upon a public street, and each lot shall have a

from which the required dedication has not been secured.
(e) Nonresidential Lots Abutting More Restrictive District. Nonresidential lots abutting
more restrictive boundaries shall provide side and rear yards not less than those required in
the more restrictive abutting district. The setbacks on the less restrictive district shall be
modified for a distance of not more than sixty (60) feet from the district boundary line so as
to equal the average of the street yards required in both districts.
SEC. 13-1-28 REDUCTION OR JOINT USE.
No lot, yard, parking area, driveway, building area, or other space shall be reduced in area or
dimension so as not to meet the provisions of this Chapter. No part of any lot, yard, parking area,

"Zoning Map -- City of Cedarburg, Wisconsin," and "Supplementary Floodland Zoning
Map -- City of Cedarburg, Wisconsin," both maps which accompany and are herewith made a
part of this Chapter. Such boundaries shall be construed to follow: corporate limits; U.W. Public
Land Survey lines; lot or property lines; centerlines of streets, highways, alleys, easements, and
railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended unless otherwise noted on the Zoning Map.
(c) Boundaries of the FW Cedar Creek Floodway District shall be determined by use of the scale
contained on the Supplementary Floodland Zoning Map. The boundaries of the FPC

Cedarburg, Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, published by the Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) and dated May 15, 1980. The information contained in the flood insurance study is
further illustrated in FIA Floodway and Flood Boundary Map and Flood Insurance Rate
Map, both maps dated May 16, 1980. Where a conflict exists between the floodland limits as

use of the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Maps for the City of Cedarburg dated May 10,
1989, and stamped "FINAL", and include, but are not limited to, all shoreland wetlands, five
(5) acres or greater in area, shown on these maps. Section 62.231 of the Wisconsin Statutes

determined by the location of the former public street or alley centerline where applicable.
(f) Annexations to or consolidations with the City subsequent to the effective date of this
Chapter shall be placed in the Rs-1 Single-Family Residential District, unless the annexation
ordinance temporarily places the land in another district. Within one (1) year, the City Plan
Commission shall evaluate and recommend a permanent zoning district classification to the
Common Council. Annexations containing shorelands shall comply with Sec. 59.971(7) of
the Wisconsin Statutes. Annexations containing floodlands and shorelands shall be governed
in the following manner:
(1) Annexations containing floodlands shall be governed by the provisions of the
Ozaukee County Floodplain Zoning Ordinance until such time that the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) certifies that amendments to the City of
Cedarburg Zoning Ordinance meet the requirements of Chapter NR 116 of the
Wisconsin Administrative Code.
(2) Annexations containing shorelands. Pursuant to Sec. 59.971(7) of the Wisconsin
Statutes, any annexation of land after May 7, 1982, which lies within shorelands, as

SEC. 13-1-66 GFP GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (Ord. 2007-02) (Ord. 2007-27)
(a) Applicability
The provisions for this district shall apply to all floodplains for which flood profiles are
not available or where flood profiles are available but floodways have not been
delineated. Floodway and floodfringe districts shall be delineated when adequate data is
available.
(b) Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Statement of Purpose, Title and General
Provisions
(1) Statutory Authorization
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in ss. 61.35 and 62.23, for
villages and cities; 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694 for counties; and the requirements
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
86
in s. 87.30, Stats.
(2) Finding of Fact
Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this
municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare
and tax base.
(3) Statement of Purpose
This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
(a) Protect life, health and property;
(b) Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
(c) Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the
taxpayers;
(d) Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
(f) Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
(g) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
(h) Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and
result in conflicts between property owners; and
(i) Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
(c) Title
This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for The City of
Cedarburg, Wisconsin.
(d) General Provisions
(1) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or
base flood.
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies.
Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-Zones on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones
on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Cedarburg Floodplain
Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and
approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional
flood elevations (RFE's) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by
the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the City Engineer,
City of Cedarburg, W63 N645 Washington Avenue. If more than one map or
revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.

corresponding flood profiles, titled “Dambreak Hazard Profile”, dated
October 4, 2007, and Floodway data table dated October 4, 2007 and titled
“Floodway Data”.
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA
(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
a. The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those
portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the
regional floodwaters.
b. The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the
regional flood limits and the floodway.
c. The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or
may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.
(4) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual
field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (a) or (b) below. If
a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to s. 13-1-66(j).
The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to
grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The
zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development
field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and
for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the
zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled
according to s.13-1-66(i)(c)(3) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below.
a. If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall
determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations
shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
b. Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be
determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any
information provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood
elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
88
pursuant to s. 8.1 (6).
(5) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for
removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the
regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the
floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to s. 13-1-66(j)(a)(6).
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory
purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a
Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
(6) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in
compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and
federal regulations.
(7) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are
required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State
agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the
Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when s. 30.2022, Stats.
applies.
(8) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
a. This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning
ordinance enacted under ss. 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; s. 62.23
for cities; s. 61.35 for villages; or s. 87.30, Stats. which relate to
floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance,
that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
b. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(9) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the
minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are
not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in
effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the
most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(10) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
89
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering
increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or
guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from
flooding and flood damages. Nor does this ordinance create liability on the part
of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(11) SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected.
(12) ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES AND VILLAGES
The Ozaukee County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of
annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all
annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which
meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the
municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are
incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on
file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of
annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the
floodway.
(13) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed
building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to
flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so
as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the
above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks)
shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that
meets the subdivision definition of this ordinance.
(e) General Standards Applicable to All Floodplain
(1) Hydraulic and Hydrologic Analyses
(a) Except as allowed in par. (3) below, no floodplain development
shall:
1. Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the
conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development,
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
90
increasing regional flood height; or
2. Increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost,
which equals or exceeds 0.01 foot.
(b) The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed
development will obstruct flow or increase regional flood heights 0.01 foot or
more, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the
provisions of sub. (3) are met.
(c) Obstructions or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be
permitted if amendments are made to this ordinance, the official
floodplain zoning maps, floodway lines and water surface profiles, in
accordance with s. 13-1-66(j).
Note: This section refers to obstructions or increases in base flood
elevations as shown on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map.
Any such alterations must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the
DNR.
(2) Watercourse Alterations
No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall
be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities,
the Department and FEMA regional offices and required the applicant to secure
all necessary state and federal permits. The flood carrying capacity of any altered
or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the
watercourse alteration or relocation, the zoning administrator shall notify FEMA
of the changes by submitting appropriate technical or scientific data in accordance
with NFIP guidelines that shall be used to revise the FIRM, risk premium rates
and floodplain management regulations as required.
(3) Chapter 30, 31, Wis. Stats., Development
Development which requires a permit from the Department, under chs. 30 and 31,
Wis. Stats., such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and
navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and
amendments to the floodway lines, water surface profiles, BFEs established in the
FIS, or other data from the officially adopted FIRM, or other floodplain zoning
maps or the floodplain zoning ordinance are made according to s. 13-1-66(j).
(f) Nonconforming Uses
(a) General
(1) APPLICABILITY
If these standards conform with s. 59.69(10), Stats., for counties or
s. 62.23(7)(h), Stats., for cities and villages, they shall apply to all
modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to
the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
91
of this ordinance or any amendment thereto.
(2) The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance may continue subject to
the following conditions:
a. No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure
shall be permitted unless they comply with this ordinance. The
words "modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to,
any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding
or replacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory
structure or use. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered
an extension, modification or addition; these include painting,
decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows and
other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or
replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or
connections to public utilities. Ordinary maintenance repairs do
not include any costs associated with the repair of a damaged
structure.
The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet
and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is
not an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the
structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide
safe ingress and egress to the principal structure.
b. If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is
discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted
and any future use of the property, and any structure or building
thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this
ordinance;
c. The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming
uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed
value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been
permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value
those modifications represent;
d. No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any
structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the
structure would exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed
value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently
changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in
compliance with the applicable requirements of this ordinance.
Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and
commercial uses in compliance with s. 13-1-68(c)(1). The costs of
elevating a nonconforming building or a building with a
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
92
nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded
from the 50% provisions of this paragraph;
1. Except as provided in subd. 2., if any
nonconforming structure or any structure with a
nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially
damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt
unless the use and the structure meet the current ordinance
requirements. A structure is considered substantially
damaged if the total cost to restore the structure to its predamaged
condition exceeds 50% of the structure’s present
equalized assessed value.
2. For nonconforming buildings that are damaged or
destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or
reconstruction of any such nonconforming building may be
permitted in order to restore it after the nonflood disaster,
provided that the nonconforming building will meet all of
the minimum requirements under applicable FEMA
regulations (44 CFR Part 60), or the regulations
promulgated thereunder.
e. A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the alteration
will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic
structure, the alteration will comply with s. 13-1-67(c)(1), flood
resistant materials are used, and construction practices and
floodproofing methods that comply with s. 13-1-66(i)(e) are used.
(g) Floodway Areas
(1) No modification or addition shall be allowed to any nonconforming structure of
any structure with a nonconforming use in a floodway area, unless such
modification or addition:
a. Has been granted a permit or variance which meets all ordinance
requirements;
b. Meets the requirements of s. 13-1-66(g)(1);
c. Will not increase the obstruction to flood flows or regional flood height;
d. Any addition to the existing structure shall be floodproofed, pursuant to s.
13-1-66(i)(e), by means other than the use of fill, to the flood protection
elevation;
e. If any part of the foundation below the flood protection elevation is
enclosed, the following standards shall apply:
1. The enclosed area shall be designed by a registered architect or
engineer to allow for the efficient entry and exit of flood waters
without human intervention. A minimum of two openings must be
provided with a minimum net area of at least one square inch for
every one square foot of the enclosed area. The lowest part of the
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
93
opening can be no more than 12 inches above the adjacent grade;
2. The parts of the foundation located below the flood protection
elevation must be constructed of flood-resistant materials;
3. Mechanical and utility equipment must be elevated or floodproofed
to or above the flood protection elevation; and
4. The use must be limited to parking or limited storage.

municipal ordinances and chs. NR 811 and NR 812, Wis. Adm. Code.
(h) Floodfringe Areas
(1) No modification or addition shall be allowed to any nonconforming structure or
any structure with a nonconforming use unless such modification or addition has
been granted a permit or variance by the municipality, and the modification or
addition shall be placed on fill or floodproofed to the flood protection elevation in
compliance with the standards for that particular use in s. 13-1-68(c), except
where s. 13-1-66(h)(2) is applicable.
(2) Where compliance with the provisions of par. (1) would result in unnecessary
hardship and only where the structure will not be used for human habitation or be
associated with a high flood damage potential, the Board of Adjustment/Appeals,
using the procedures established in s. 13-1-66(i)(c), may grant a variance from
those provisions of par. (1) for modifications or additions, using the criteria listed
below. Modifications or additions which are protected to elevations lower than
the flood protection elevation may be permitted if:

hardship demonstrated by the applicant in the case of a
variance, clearly stated in the recorded minutes of the
Board proceedings.
(3) BOUNDARY DISPUTES
The following procedure shall be used by the Board in hearing disputes
concerning floodplain district boundaries:
a. If a floodplain district boundary is established by approximate or
detailed floodplain studies, the flood elevations or profiles shall
prevail in locating the boundary. If none exist, other evidence may
be examined.
b. In all cases, the person contesting the boundary location shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to present arguments and technical
evidence to the Board.

to petition the governing body for a map amendment according to
s. 13-1-66(j).
(4) VARIANCE
a. The Board may, upon appeal, grant a variance from the standards
of this ordinance if an applicant convincingly demonstrates that:
1. Literal enforcement of the ordinance provisions will cause
unnecessary hardship;
2. The hardship is due to adoption of the floodplain ordinance
and unique property conditions, not common to adjacent
lots or premises. In such case the ordinance or map must be
amended;
3. The variance is not contrary to the public interest; and
4. The variance is consistent with the purpose of this
ordinance in s. 13-1-66(b)(3).
b. In addition to the criteria in par. (a), to qualify for a variance under
FEMA regulations, the following criteria must be met:
1. The variance may not cause any increase in the regional
flood elevation;
2. Variances can only be granted for lots that are less than
one-half acre and are contiguous to existing structures
constructed below the RFE;
3. Variances shall only be granted upon a showing of good
and sufficient cause, shall be the minimum relief necessary,
shall not cause increased risks to public safety or nuisances,
shall not increase costs for rescue and relief efforts and
shall not be contrary to the purpose of the ordinance.

SEC. 13-1-69 PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (Ord. 2015-08)
(a) Purpose.
(1) The PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District is intended to permit
developments that will, over a period of time, be enhanced by coordinated area site
planning, diversified location of structures and/or mixing of compatible uses. Such
developments are intended to provide a safe and efficient system for pedestrian and
vehicle traffic, to provide attractive recreation and open spaces as integral parts of the
development, to enable cost effective design in the location and use of public and
private utilities and community facilities, and to ensure adequate standards of
construction and planning. The PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District
under this Ordinance will allow for flexibility in overall development design to
accommodate development, redevelopment and rehabilitation of property that will
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
116
serve the best interests of the City. The use of the PUD District shall be subject to
regulatory standards as necessary to be consistent with the direction set forth in the
City of Cedarburg Smart Growth Comprehensive Land Use Plan – 2025, and
components thereof.
(2) The unified and planned development of a site in a single, partnership, or corporate
ownership or control, or in common ownership under the Unit Ownership Act set
forth in Chapter 703 of the Wisconsin Statutes (condominiums) may be permitted by
the City upon specific petition, with such development encompassing one (1) or
more principal uses or structures and related accessory uses or structures when all
regulations and standards as set forth in this Section of the Chapter have been met.
(b) Permitted, Accessory and Conditional Uses. Any use permitted in the underlying basic
use district or other overlay districts.
(c) Minimum Area Requirements. Areas designated as PUD Planned Unit Development
Overlay Districts shall be under single or corporate ownership or control and shall contain a
minimum development area as follows:
Principal Uses Minimum Area of PUD
Residential PUD 1 acres
Commercial PUD 1 acres
Industrial PUD 10 acres
Mixed Compatible Use 0 acres (no minimum)
(d) Density Requirements. Only one of three possible levels of residential density shall be
allowed in specific PUD Districts:
(1) The number of dwelling units allowed as a permitted use in the underlying zoning
district; or
(2) The number of residential dwelling units allowed as a conditional use in the
underlying zoning district; or
(3) The number of residential dwelling units allowed where an increased density is
allowed in recognition of a project of exceptionally high overall quality as provided
below.
(e) Increased Density Justification.
(1) If, notwithstanding dimensional differentials, a proposed project uniformly contains
exterior and interior materials, design details, workmanship and features of an
exceptionally high quality that emulates the historic character of Cedarburg and/or
the immediate neighborhood, an “increased density” for residential dwelling units
may be recommended by the Plan Commission and approved by the Common
Council as part of the original PUD District approval process.
(2) If granted, the increased density level of a residential use shall be in lieu of any other
possible residential density.
(3) An increased density shall constitute a discretionary number of residential units
based on the following criteria for consideration/recommended by the Plan
Commission and approved by the Common Council:
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
117
(a) Whether the project will provide better utilization of the land than would
otherwise be realized if the site were developed with the density requirements
of the underlying district or as a PUD without an increased density.
(b) Whether the project makes adequate provisions such that an increase in
residential density will not have an unreasonable adverse effect on
neighboring properties, existing and/or proposed public rights-of-way and/or
municipal and other public services as a result of the type, intensity and
frequency of the use(s) associated with the proposed project.
(c) Whether the structures proposed for the project are harmonious with existing
nearby structures and land uses.
(d) Whether building materials have been selected and are proposed to be
utilized in a manner that is harmonious with the natural environment and the
general character of other buildings and structures in the vicinity of the
proposed development.
(e) Whether the proposed project will result in the construction or upgrading of
specific public infrastructure improvements that will benefit the public at no
cost to the City.
(f) Whether the proposed project will enhance an existing structure that is
deemed beneficial to the character of the neighborhood where it is situated.
(f) Lot Area and Width.
The lot area and lot width requirements of the underlying base zoning district may be
modified if deemed appropriate by the Common Council following recommendation by the
Plan Commission, provided that lot sizes are adequate to accommodate all proposed
buildings and site features.
(g) Building Height and Area.
(1) The Common Council following recommendation by the Plan Commission may
allow an increase in allowable building heights if it is determined that such an
increase is warranted to support the public benefit likely to result from the proposed
development.
(2) The floor area ratio (F.A.R.) and lot coverage percentage (L.C.P.) for the principal
buildings and accessory buildings shall be established on a case-by-case basis as an
element of a residential PUD Planned Unit Development project at the time of the
final plat approval.
(h) Setback and Yards.
Setbacks and yards required by the underlying base use zoning district may be modified in
PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay Districts if deemed appropriate by the Common
Council following recommendation by the Plan Commission.

(a) Purpose. The C-4 Upland Conservancy Overlay District is intended to preserve, protect,
enhance, and restore all significant woodlands, wildlife habitat areas, areas of rough
topography, and related scenic areas located within upland portions of the primary
environmental corridor. Regulation of these areas will serve to control erosion and
sedimentation and will promote and maintain the natural beauty of the City.
(b) Permitted Uses. The following are permitted as a matter of right:
(1) Any use of land, except development involving structures, that is permitted in the
underlying basic use district, providing that such development does not destroy the
natural resource features protected by the C-4 District.
(2) Forest and game management.
(3) Park and recreation areas.
(4) Preservation of scenic, historic, and scientific areas.
(5) Recreational trails.
(c) Conditional Uses. (Also see Section 13-1-226.) Any Permitted Use, Permitted Accessory
Use, or Conditional Use permitted in the underlying basic district, including structural uses,
providing that the development will serve to implement the purpose and intent of the C-4
District and foster the preservation of woodland, wildlife habitat, rough topography, and
scenic areas. To this end, the City Plan Commission may permit the transfer of densities
within the property boundaries of a given project. Individual lot sizes and per-unit lot areas
may be reduced, provided that the density of the project does not exceed the maximum
density permitted in the underlying basic use district. The City Plan Commission shall
require appropriate legal measures to ensure that the open spaces and natural resource
elements preserved by the transfer of density will be inviolate.
(d) Tree Cutting and Shrubbery Clearing Only by Permit in Accord with a Cutting Plan
with Certain Exceptions. A Tree Cutting and Clearing Permit is required for tree cutting
and shrubbery clearing on all wooded lands within the C-4 Upland Conservancy Overlay
District. An application for a Tree Cutting and Clearing Permit shall include a cutting plan
of the lot or aerial photo showing the location of trees and/or shrubbery to be removed.
Notice of the application for such permit shall be mailed to owners of all lands located within
three hundred (300) feet of the subject property. The cutting plan shall be reviewed by the
City Forester prior to being submitted for review by the Plan Commission as part of the
permit process. The Common Council shall have final approval of the permit. Such
removals may include the creation of sites for a residence, accessory buildings or other
accessory uses, driveways, or view corridors facing adjacent waterways. Removals may also
be done for forestry management purposes. The proposed cutting plan shall not cause undue
erosion or destruction of scenic beauty. The cutting plan shall consider retaining some visual
screening from waterways of any dwelling, accessory structures, and parking areas. The
cutting plan may include replacement of removed trees and shrubbery with groundcover
plantings to minimize erosion. The proposed tree cutting plan shall comply with the Tree
Preservation requirements of the Cedarburg Municipal Code. A maximum of 30 feet removal

SEC. 13-1-83 ADJUSTMENTS TO REQUIRED PARKING.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to allow adjustments to the minimum number of
parking spaces required to avoid constructing unneeded and excessive off-street parking
facilities. Reducing the amount of excess off-street parking facilities is intended to provide
for more cost-efficient site development, to eliminate constructing more impervious surface
than necessary, to minimize stormwater runoff, to avoid construction of unnecessarily large
stormwater management facilities, and to provide more landscape areas and open space on
commercial and industrial sties. To achieve these purposes, the Plan Commission may
reduce the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces in specific cases as
described in this Section.
(b) Adjustments. In all commercial and industrial districts, the minimum number of required
parking spaces may be adjusted by the Plan Commission on a case-by-case basis. The
petitioner for such an adjustment shall show to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission that
adequate parking will be provided for customers, clients, visitors, and employees. The
following provisions and factors shall be used as a basis to adjust parking requirements:
(1) Evidence that Actual Parking Demands will be Less than Ordinance Requirements.
The petitioner shall submit written documentation and data to the satisfaction of the
Plan Commission that the operation will require less parking than the Ordinance
requires.
(2) Availability of Shared Parking. The petitioner shall submit written documentation to
the satisfaction of the Plan Commission that off-site shared parking spaces are
available to satisfy the parking demand. When a reduction of parking spaces
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
158
attributable to shared parking is requested, the petitioner shall submit written
verification that such parking is available and shall include copies of any contracts,
joint lease agreements, purchase agreements, and other such documentation to show
that such shared parking can be accomplished. The City Attorney shall provide an
opinion designating the method by which the required shared parking shall be
provided. The off-site shared parking spaces shall be clearly posted for the Joint use
of employees, and/or tenants, or customers of each respective use those spaces.
(3) Use of On-Street Parking for Visitors. Available nearby on-street parking may be
counted toward visitor parking needs. This may only be allowed when on-street
parking is permitted in a specific location, and then only when such on-street parking
spaces are within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the entrance they are intended to
serve.
(4) Use of Alternative Transportation. Upon demonstration to the Plan Commission that
effective alternative transportation to the automobile will occur, the Plan
Commission may reduce parking requirements. Alternative transportation may
include, but is not limited to, bus transit, van pool operations, car pool/ride sharing,
and bicycles. Parking management plans/operations may also be used as a basis to
reduce required parking. Parking management plans may include, but are not limited
to, flexible working hours, or shifts, preferential parking for car pools/van pools,
transit/van pool fare subsidy, imposition of a charge for parking, and establishment
of a transportation coordinator to implement car pool, van pool, and transit programs.
Proposals for adjustments of parking requirements under this Section shall show how
the alternative transportation modes will be implemented, the permanency of such
modes, extent of the program, the number of vehicles the mode will replace, and
other pertinent information.
(c) Space to be Set Aside for Reduced Parking. The site plan for the commercial or industrial
use shall be designed to provide sufficient open space on the subject site to accommodate the
additional parking spaces otherwise required by this Ordinance. Such open space shall be in
addition to required yards, setbacks, driveways, private streets, loading, and service areas.
Sufficient open space shall be provided which, if converted to parking spaces, would provide
off-street parking to meet the full requirements of this Chapter at the time of application.
(d) Changes in Occupancy or Use. When the use of a building, structure, or land is changed to
another use or occupant that requires more parking spaces than required for the use existing
immediately prior to such change, additional parking spaces shall be constructed for the new
use or occupant in the amount necessary to conform to this Chapter.
(e) Changes in Intensity of Use. When the intensity of use of a building, structure or land is
increased by an addition of employees, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of
measurement, additional parking spaces shall be constructed for such additions in the amount
necessary to conform to this Chapter.

Site Plan and Architectural Review
SEC. 13-1-120 PURPOSE OF SITE PLAN AND ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW.
For the purpose of promoting compatible development, stability of property values, fostering the
attractiveness and functional utility of the community as a place to live and work, preserving the
character and quality of the built environment by maintaining the integrity of those areas which have
a discernible character or are of a special historic significance, protecting certain public investments
in the area, and raising the level of community expectations for the quality of its environment, this
Section requiring site plan and architectural review is intended.
SEC. 13-1-121 SITE PLAN REVIEW PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS.
To implement the purposes set forth in Section 13-1-120, the City Plan Commission shall review the
site, existing and proposed structures, neighboring uses, utilization of landscaping and open space,
parking areas, driveway locations, loading and unloading (in the case of commercial and industrial
uses), highway access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, sewerage and water systems, and
the proposed operation. The City Plan Commission will approve said site plans only after
determining that:
(a) The proposed use(s) conform(s) to the uses permitted in that zoning district.
(b) The dimensional arrangement of buildings and structures conform to the required area, yard,
setback, and height restrictions of this Chapter.
(c) The proposed use conforms to all use and design provisions and requirements (if any) as
found in this Chapter for the specified uses.
(d) There is a proper relationship between the existing and proposed streets and highways within
the vicinity of the project in order to assure the safety and convenience of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic.
(e) The proposed on-site buildings, structures, and entryways are situated and designed to
minimize adverse effects upon owners and occupants of adjacent and surrounding properties
by providing for adequate design of ingress/egress, interior/exterior traffic flow, stormwater
drainage, erosion, grading, lighting, and parking, as specified by this Chapter or any other
codes or laws.
(f) Natural features of the landscape are retained where they can enhance the development on
the site, or where they furnish a barrier or buffer between the project and adjoining properties
used for dissimilar purposes or where they assist in preserving the general safety, health,
welfare, and appearance of the neighborhood.
(g) Adverse effects of the proposed development and activities upon adjoining residents or
owners are minimized by appropriate screening, fencing, or landscaping, as provided or
required in this Chapter.
(h) Land, buildings, and structures are readily accessible to emergency vehicles and the
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
167
handicapped.
(i) The site plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of this Chapter, which is to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare, to encourage the use of lands in accordance
with their character and adaptability, to avoid the overcrowding of population, to lessen
congestion on the public roads and streets, to reduce hazards of life and property, and to
facilitate existing community development plans.
(j) The site plan is consistent with the public goals, objectives, principles, standards, policies,
and urban design criteria set forth in the City's adopted community master plan or
components thereof.
SEC. 13-1-122 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW PRINCIPLES, STANDARDS AND
PROCEDURES. (Ord. 2002-09)
Architectural review and standards are required for all new principal buildings proposed for
construction on all new lots created by a subdivision plat, by Certified Survey Map and on all infill
lots. Architectural style is not restricted; however, structures must be compatible with the
surrounding area. To provide criteria for the implementation of the purposes set forth in Section
13-1-120, the following architectural review principles, criteria, and procedures are established:
(a) Building Scale and Mass. The relative proportion of a building to its neighboring existing
buildings, to pedestrians or observers, or to other existing buildings shall be maintained or
enhanced when new buildings are built or when existing buildings are remodeled or altered.
New buildings and additions to existing buildings shall harmonize and correspond to the
existing character of the immediate neighborhood. In approving infill projects, the FAR
standard for the zoning district in which the building is located shall not govern the building
size, but rather, building size will be established, on a case-by-case basis, to reflect the
existing character of the neighborhood. (Ord. 2004-15)
(b) Building Rooflines and Roof Shapes. The visual continuity of roofs and their contributing
elements (parapet walls, coping, cornices, etc.) shall be maintained in building development
or redevelopment.
(c) Materials. Material selection for architectural design shall be based upon the prevailing
material already used on existing buildings in the area. No building shall be permitted where
any exposed facade is constructed or faced with a finished material which is aesthetically
incompatible with other building facades in the area and which presents an unattractive
appearance to the public and surrounding properties.
(d) Colors. Since the selection of building colors has a significant aesthetic and visual impact
upon the public and neighboring properties, color shall be selected in general harmony with
the existing neighborhood buildings.
(e) Building Location. No building shall be permitted to be sited in a manner which would
unnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the beauty of the area, particularly insofar as it
would adversely affect values incident to ownership of land in the area or which would
unnecessarily have an adverse effect on the beauty and general enjoyment of existing
structures on adjoining properties.
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
168
(f) Historic Structures. Any construction, rehabilitation and/or restoration of any landmark or
historic building or structure within the Washington Avenue Historic District and proposed
for any locally designated historic building shall conform to all the requirements of this
Chapter and with the terms and conditions outlined by the Landmarks Commission and
included in the City’s Building/Historic Code.
(g) Infill Lot. An infill lot is a single vacant lot located in a predominately built-up area, which
is bounded on two or more sides by existing development. In addition any lot which
contains an existing building, which will be removed and replaced with a new building, shall
also be considered an infill lot. The infill status of a lot shall continue until building plans
have been approved by the Plan Commission, a building permit acquired and the building
constructed in accordance with the approved plans and an occupancy permit issued. Once
the occupancy permit is issued, the status of the lot shall change to non-infill and any
additions or modifications thereafter shall be processed under normal procedures in
accordance with Article F. (Ord. 2006-25)
(h) Application of Standards and Review Procedures.
(1) Architectural standards for new buildings on lots created by a subdivision plat or by
Certified Survey Map shall be submitted as covenants or deed restrictions to the Plan
Commission and Council at the time of an approval of the Certified Survey Map or
preliminary and final plat. The Plan Commission and Council shall apply the above
principles and either approve, approve conditionally or reject the architectural
standards.
(2) On infill lots, architectural plans and data in accord with Section 13-1-124 shall be
submitted to the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall apply the above
principles and either approve, approve conditionally or reject the architectural plans.
SEC. 13-1-123 COMPLIANCE FOR MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL
STRUCTURES (Ord. 2002-09)
(a) Compliance for Multiple-Family Residential and Non-Residential Structures. No use or
structure [except single-family and two (2) family dwellings] shall hereafter be erected,
moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, altered, or changed until the City Plan
Commission has reviewed and approved plans for the site or structure. The City Plan
Commission shall not approve any plans unless they find after viewing and study of the
application that the use or structure, as planned, will not violate the intent and purposes of
this Chapter, as well as the principles set forth in Sections 13-1-121 and 13-1-122.
SEC. 13-1-124 APPLICATIONS FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
Sixteen (16) copies of all site plan data shall be submitted to the City Clerk seventeen (17) days prior

diversity, and maintain environmental corridors in their natural state to the extent
practical.
(4) To preserve scenic views by minimizing views of new development from existing
roads.
(5) To provide buffering between residential development and non-residential uses.
(b) Definition of Conservation Subdivision. A Conservation Subdivision is a housing
development characterized by extensive open space where natural features of the land are
maintained in their natural state to the extent practical. Residential dwellings in such
subdivisions are located on portions of the site with lower quality natural features and should
be adjacent to or overlook open space.
(c) Platting Methods and Applicability of Other Regulations. Conservation Subdivisions
may be created by platting methods including Certified Survey Maps, subdivision plats, or
condominium plats. All of the City’s Land Development regulations applying to each of the
platting methods shall be applicable to a Conservation Subdivision, except as noted in this
Section.
(d) Density and Lot Size Standards. The density and lot size standards of a Conservation
Subdivision shall be as required in the underlying Zoning District.

Subdivision.
(3) The ownership, maintenance, and stewardship of Common Open Space shall be
accomplished by a Homeowners Association and/or Condominium Association in
accord with Chapter 703 of Wisconsin Statutes. The subdivision applicant shall
provide the City a description of the bylaws of the proposed association, and all
documents governing the ownership, maintenance, and use restrictions for common
facilities. The Association shall be established by the owner or the subdivision
developer prior to the sale of any lots or dwelling units in the development. All
documents to establish such Associations shall be approved by the City Attorney
prior to their use by the developer.
(4) No such Owners’ Association shall be allowed to default and result in the Common
Open Space being owned and maintained by the public.
(5) Any amendments to the common open space documents after their initial approval
City of Cedarburg
Zoning
182
shall be reviewed and approved by the City Attorney prior to such amendments
taking effect.
(6) The following uses are permitted in Common Open Space land areas:

field, or managed meadow).
b. Silviculture, in keeping with established standards for selective harvesting
and sustained-yield forestry.
c. Neighborhood open space uses such as common areas, picnic areas,
community gardens, trails, and similar low-impact passive recreational uses
specifically excluding motorized off-road vehicles, rifle ranges, and other
uses similar in character and potential impact as determined by the Plan
Commission.
d. Active non-commercial recreation areas, such as playing fields, playgrounds,
courts, and bikeways, provided such areas do not encroach on
environmentally sensitive areas. Playing fields, playgrounds, and courts shall
not be located within 50 feet of abutting properties. Parking facilities for the
same shall also be permitted.

designed, landscaped, and available for use as an integral part of the open
space.
g. Easements for drainage, access, sewer or water lines, or other public
purposes.
h. Underground utility rights-of-way and street rights-of-way may traverse
conservation areas but shall not count toward the minimum required open
space land.
i. Public use of Common Open Space may be allowed if agreed to by the
developer and the City.
(g) Required Improvements and Design Standards. Required improvements and design
standards related to Conservation Subdivisions may be reduced to create a lower impact on
the natural environment and provide a greater degree of environmental protection.
Infrastructure requirements and modifications shall be reviewed on an individual
development basis to determine the appropriate infrastructure based on each site’s unique
attributes. Modifications to infrastructure design standards may include, but are not limited
to, the following:
(1) Reduced street pavement width.

FCO Floodplain Conservancy District, or the FFO Floodplain Fringe Overlay
District would result.

District boundary where an apparent discrepancy exists between the City's Final Wetland
Inventory Map and actual field conditions, the City shall contact the Wisconsin Department
of Natural Resources (DNR) to determine if the wetland inventory map is in error. If the

specifications due to remodeling, the Zoning Administrator may require the use of
the alternative minimum accessibility requirements provided for under the State
Historic Building Code, § 101.121, Wis. Stats. and regulations thereunder.
(6) The Zoning Administrator may issue a building permit that waives specified zoning
ordinance requirements if the Zoning Administrator determines that the waiver of the
zoning ordinance is the minimum necessary for a public place of accommodation or
amusement or a commercial facility to comply with the handicapped accessible
requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act or the Wisconsin Open Housing
Law, and will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of a Qualified Historic
Property.
(7) The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a building permit that waives zoning
ordinance requirements if the waiver of the zoning ordinance will threaten or destroy
the historic significance of a Qualified Historic Property. In such cases, the Zoning
Administrator shall work with the property owner, the Landmarks Commission, and
the Plan Commission to determine alternative accommodations which will provide
handicapped accessibility to the maximum extent possible without threatening or
destroying the historic significance of a Qualified Historic Property.
(8) The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a building permit or waive zoning
ordinance requirements for a Qualified Historic Property until the Landmarks
Commission and the Plan Commission have, in accordance with Sections 13-1-70,
15-1-14, or 15-1-15 of the City’s land use codes, reviewed the application or petition
and have recommended approval or approval with conditions.
(9) Where needed to protect the historic significance of a Qualified Historic Property, the
Zoning Administrator may attach to the building permit the condition that the
building addition or other structure (such as entrance ramps) that is authorized by the
permit must be constructed in such a way that it can easily be removed when the
handicapped or disabled person no longer occupies the Qualified Historic Property or
when the Qualified Historic Property is no longer used as a public place of
accommodation or amusement or a commercial facility. If such a condition is
attached to the permit, the property owner is required by this Ordinance to notify the
Zoning Administrator no later than 30 days after the handicapped or disabled person
vacates the Qualified Historic Property or after the Qualified Historic Property ceases
to be used as a place of public accommodation or amusement or a commercial
facility. In cases where the Zoning Administrator issues such a conditional permit,
the permit shall not become effective until the owner of the property signs an
affidavit giving notice of the conditional nature of the permit, and records the
affidavit at the Ozaukee County Register of Deeds Office.
(10) If the Zoning Administrator issues a building permit to a dwelling to be occupied by
a handicapped or disabled person, or the owner of a public place of accommodation or
amusement or commercial facility or covered multifamily housing, that waives
City of Cedarburg

certain specified zoning requirements, the permit shall state that issuance of the
permit is required by the Federal Fair Housing Act, the Wisconsin Open Housing
Law, or the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Adoption; Introduction
SEC. 14-1-1 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE. (Ord. 2006-38)
(a) Introduction. In accordance with the authority granted by Sec. 236.45 of the Wisconsin
Statutes and for the purposes listed in Sections 236.01 and 236.45 of the Wisconsin Statutes,
the Common Council of the City of Cedarburg, Wisconsin, does hereby ordain as follows:
(1) The provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted to
promote the health, safety, morals, comfort, prosperity and welfare of the City of
Cedarburg.
(2) This Chapter shall not repeal, impair or modify private covenants or public
ordinances, except that it shall apply whenever it imposes stricter restrictions on land
use.
(b) Purpose. This Chapter applies to subdivisions, land divisions, and also to condominiums
because the impact of density of development and the need for planning is the same
regardless of the method of ownership. The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate and
control the division of land or creation of a condominium that results in the division of land
within the corporate limits of the City of Cedarburg, Wisconsin, and within the
extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the City in order to promote the public health,
safety, convenience and general welfare of the community. The regulations are designed to
lessen congestion in the highways and streets; to foster the orderly layout and use of land; to
secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air, including
access to sunlight for solar collectors and to wind for wind energy systems; to discourage
overcrowding of the land; to protect the community's agriculture base; to facilitate adequate
provision for housing, transportation, public water and sewerage, schools, parks,
playgrounds and other public necessities; to secure safety from flooding, water pollution,
disease and other hazards; to prevent flood damage to persons and properties and minimize
expenditures for flood relief and flood control projects; to prevent and control erosion,
sedimentation and other pollution of surface and subsurface waters; to preserve natural
vegetation and cover and promote the natural beauty of the community; to restrict building
sites in areas covered by poor soils or in other areas poorly suited for development; to
facilitate the further division of larger tracts into smaller parcels of land; to ensure adequate
legal description and proper survey monumentation of subdivided land; to provide for the
administration and enforcement of this Chapter; to provide penalties for its violation; to
implement those municipal, county, watershed or regional comprehensive plans or their
components adopted by the City and, in general, to facilitate enforcement of City
development standards as set forth in the adopted regional, county and local comprehensive
plans, neighborhood plans, adopted plan components, City Zoning Ordinance, and City
Building Code of the City of Cedarburg, Wisconsin; and to facilitate the further division of
large tracts of land into smaller parcels. The regulations are made with the reasonable
consideration of, but not limited to, the present character of the City and its environs, with
City of Cedarburg
Subdivision Regulations

the objectives of conserving the value of the land and improvements placed thereon,
providing the most appropriate environment for human habitation, encouraging commerce
and industry, protecting farming and open spaces, and providing for the most appropriate use
of land in the City of Cedarburg.
State Law Reference: Chapter 236, Wis. Stats.
SEC. 14-1-2 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing
easements, covenants, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued
pursuant to law. However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
Chapter shall govern.
SEC. 14-1-3 INTERPRETATION.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City of Cedarburg and shall not be
deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.
SEC. 14-1-4 SEVERABILITY.
If any section, portion or provision of this Chapter is invalid or unconstitutional, or if the application
of this Chapter to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid or unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the other provisions or
applications of this Chapter which can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional
provision or application.
SEC. 14-1-5 REPEAL.
All other ordinances or parts of ordinances of the City inconsistent or conflicting with this Chapter,
to the extent of the inconsistency only, are hereby repealed.
SEC. 14-1-6 TITLE. (Ord. 2006-08)
This Chapter shall be known as, referred to, or cited as the "City of Cedarburg Land Division and
Subdivision and Condominium Chapter."
SEC. 14-1-7 JURISDICTION.

part-time municipal police and fire protection and community administration;
additional public streets and highways; neighborhood parks and playgrounds;
neighborhood schools; local libraries; public sanitary sewer facilities, public water
supply facilities and public solid waste removal; and street maintenance. Such
development may be expected to alter or require the altering of land and land cover

development occurs when residential development is at densities of from 0.2 to 2.17
dwelling units per gross acre.
(10) Development (Urban). Residential, commercial, industrial, governmental and
development in sufficient concentrations or densities to require a variety and high

intent of this Chapter to protect all established easements so as to assure proper grade, assure
maintenance of the established grade, prohibit construction of permanent fences or retaining
walls over underground installation and prevent the planting of trees in the easement area.
(b) Drainage Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream:
(1) There shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming
substantially to the lines of such watercourse and such further width or construction,
or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and as may be necessary to comply with
this Section; or
(2) The watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream may be relocated in such a manner
that the maintenance of adequate drainage will be assured and the same provided
with a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming to the lines of the
relocated watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be
adequate for the purpose and may be necessary to comply with this Section.
(3) Wherever possible, it is desirable that drainage be maintained by an open channel
with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume flow. In
all cases, such water course shall be of a minimum width established at the
high-water mark or, in the absence of such specification, not less than thirty (30) feet.
If, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the easement will be for a major drainage
swale, the easement shall be of sufficient width to contain a one hundred (100) year
frequency storm. If the drainage easement is located in an established floodway or
flood fringe district, the entire floodplain area shall be included within the drainage
easement.
(c) Easement Locations. Such easements shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide, or wider where
recommended by the City Engineer, and may run across lots or alongside of rear lot lines.
Such easements should preferably be located along rear lot lines. Evidence shall be furnished
the Plan Commission and Common Council that easements and any easement provisions to
be incorporated in the plat or in deeds have been reviewed by the individual utility
companies or the organization responsible for furnishing the services involved.

be required to reserve land, dedicate land or fees in lieu of land for park or other public uses.
Each subdivider of land in the City of Cedarburg shall, at the discretion and direction of the
Plan Commission, either dedicate open space lands designated on the City Comprehensive
Plan or plan component, or reserve such open space lands and pay a public site fee, or, where
no open space lands are directly involved, pay a public site fee. The Plan Commission shall,
at the time of reviewing the preliminary plat or certified survey map, select the land
dedication option, fees in lieu of land option, or reservation of additional land option and
record such selection in the minutes of the meeting at which the preliminary plat is presented
for approval.
(b) General Design In the design of a subdivision, land division, certified survey map, planned
unit development or development project, provision shall be made for suitable sites of
adequate area for schools, parks, playgrounds, open spaces, drainage-ways and other public
purposes. Such sites are to be shown on the Preliminary Plat and Final Plat, and shall comply
with the City Master Plan or component of said Plan. Consideration shall be given to the
preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams,
watercourses, watersheds, ravines and woodlands, prairie and wetlands, and plant and animal
communities, as recommended by the City Planner and approved by the Plan Commission.
SEC. 14-1-81 LAND DEDICATION.
(a) Dedication of Site Option. Whenever a proposed playground, park or other public open
space land designated on the City's comprehensive plan, neighborhood unit development
plan or other comprehensive plan component is encompassed, all or in part, within a tract of
land to be subdivided, the public lands shall be made a part of the plat and shall be dedicated
to the public by the subdivider at the rate of one (1) acre for each thirty (30) proposed or
potential dwelling units, and any such proposed public lands in excess of the rate established
herein shall be reserved for a period not to exceed three (3) years, unless extended by mutual
agreement, for purchase by the public agency having jurisdiction at undeveloped land prices.
If the lands in excess of the established rate are not acquired within the three (3) year period
as set forth herein, the land will be released from reservation to the owner. Drainageways,
wetlands or areas reserved for streets shall not be considered as satisfying land dedication
requirements.

S. 14-2-01 AUTHORITY.
(1) This ordinance is adopted by the City of Cedarburg under the authority granted by s. 62.234
Wis. Stats. This ordinance supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted
under s. 62.23, Wis. Stats., that relate to storm water management regulations. Except as
otherwise specified in s. 62.234 Wis. Stats., s. 62.23, Wis. Stats., applies to this ordinance
and to any amendments to this ordinance.
(2) The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers
of the same governing body.
(3) The City of Cedarburg hereby designates the City of Cedarburg Department of Engineering
and Public Works to administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance.
(4) The requirements of this ordinance do not pre-empt more stringent storm water management
requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
(a) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or
approvals including those authorized under ss. 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
City of Cedarburg
Subdivision Regulations
58
(b) Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under s. NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
S. 14-2-02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
(1) PURPOSE. The purpose of this ordinance is to establish long-term, post-construction runoff
management requirements and criteria that will prevent and control water pollution, diminish
the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment due to runoff of
stormwater from development and redevelopment. Specific purposes are to:
(a) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
(b) Prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water; prevent and control soil
erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and
aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve
ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth.
(c) Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving
water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; and control increases in the scouring
and transportation of particulate matter.
(d) Minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to
protect the waters of the state.
(2) INTENT. It is the intent of the City of Cedarburg that this ordinance regulates postconstruction
storm water discharges to waters of the state. This ordinance may be applied on
a site-by-site basis. The City of Cedarburg recognizes, however, that the preferred method of
achieving the storm water performance standards set forth in this ordinance is through the
preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level storm water management
plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale.
Such plans may prescribe regional storm water devices, practices or systems, any of which
may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the
state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under
s. 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional storm water management measures and have been
approved by the City of Cedarburg, it is the intent of this ordinance that the approved storm
water management plan be used to identify post-construction management measures
acceptable for the community.

S. 14-2-07 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
(1) RESPONSIBLE PARTY. The responsible party shall comply with this section.
(2) STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN. A written storm water management plan in
accordance with S. 14-2-09 shall be developed and implemented for each post-construction site.
(3) MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT. For redevelopment sites where the redevelopment will be
replacing older development that was subject to post-construction performance standards of NR
151 in effect on or after October 1, 2004, the responsible party shall meet the total suspended
solids reduction, peak flow control, infiltration, and protective areas standards applicable to the
older development or meet the redevelopment standards of this ordinance, whichever is more
stringent.
(4) REQUIREMENTS. The storm water management plan required under sub. (2) shall include the
following:
(a) TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS. BMPs shall be designed, installed and maintained
to control total suspended solids carried in runoff from the post-construction site as
follows:
City of Cedarburg
Subdivision Regulations
65
1. BMPs shall be designed in accordance with Table 1. or to the maximum
extent practicable as provided in subd. 2. The design shall be based on an
average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls.
Table 1. TSS Reduction Standards
Development Type TSS Reduction
New Development 80 percent
In-fill development 80 percent
Redevelopment 40 percent of load from parking areas and roads
2. Maximum Extent Practicable. If the design cannot meet a total suspended
solids reduction performance standard of Table 1., the storm water
management plan shall include a written, site-specific explanation of why the
total suspended solids reduction performance standard cannot be met and
why the total suspended solids load will be reduced only to the maximum
extent practicable.
3. Off-Site Drainage. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP from
off-site shall be taken into account in determining the treatment efficiency of
the practice. Any impact on the efficiency shall be compensated for by
increasing the size of the BMP accordingly.
(b) PEAK DISCHARGE.
1. By design, BMPs shall be employed to:
a. For the 1-year, 24-hour; and the 2-year, 24-hour design storms, BMPs
shall be designed so that post-construction peak runoff discharge
rates are maintained or reduced compared to the 1-year, 24-hour; and
the 2-year, 24-hour pre-development peak runoff discharge rates
respectively, or to the maximum extent practicable.
b. The post-development storm water runoff rate associated with the
100-year, 24-hour design storm, shall not exceed the pre-development
10-year 24-hour design storm runoff rate, for new development sites.
The runoff curve numbers in Table 2. shall be used to represent the actual
pre-development conditions. Peak discharges shall be calculated using TR-55
runoff curve number methodology, Atlas 14 precipitation depths, and the
appropriate NRCS Wisconsin MSE3 or MSE4 precipitation distribution. On a
case-by-case basis, City of Cedarburg Department of Engineering and Public
Works may allow the use of TP-40 precipitation depths and the Type II
distribution.

(d) PROTECTIVE AREAS.
1. Definition. In this section, “protective area” means an area of land that
commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the
City of Cedarburg
Subdivision Regulations
70
delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following
widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated
wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this section,
“protective area” does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream
enclosed within a pipe or culvert, so that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at
this location.
a. For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, 75
feet.
b. For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a U.S. Geological
Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, or a county soil survey
map, whichever is more current, 50 feet.
c. For lakes, 50 feet.
d. For wetlands not subject to par. e. or f., 50 feet.
e. For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands
include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, open
and coniferous bogs, low prairies, coniferous swamps, lowland
hardwood swamps, and ephemeral ponds.
f. For less susceptible wetlands, 25 feet. Less susceptible wetlands
include: degraded wetland dominated by invasive species such as
reed canary grass; cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel pits, or
dredged material or fill material disposal sites that take on the
attributes of a wetland.
g. In pars. d. to f., determinations of the extent of the protective area
adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and
runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards
and criteria in s. NR 103.03.
h. Wetland boundary delineation shall be made in accordance with s.
NR 103.08 (1m). This paragraph does not apply to wetlands that have
been completely filled in compliance with all applicable state and
federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been
partially filled in compliance with all applicable state and federal
regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation
after a fill has been placed. Where there is a legally authorized
wetland fill, the protective area standard need not be met in that
location.
i. For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130
acres, 25 feet.
j. Notwithstanding pars. a. to i., the greatest protective area width shall
apply where rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands are contiguous.
2. Applicability. This section applies to post-construction sites located within a
protective area, except those areas exempted pursuant to subd. 4.
3. Requirements. The following requirements shall be met:
City of Cedarburg
Subdivision Regulations
71
a. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area entirely or
to the maximum extent practicable. If there is no practical alternative
to locating an impervious surface in the protective area, the storm
water management plan shall contain a written, site-specific
explanation.
b. Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective
area, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or
greater shall be established and maintained where no impervious
surface is present. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative
cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of
fish habitat, and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow
areas under sheet flow conditions. Non-vegetative materials, such as
rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent
erosion such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur.
c. BMPs such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention ponds, that are
designed to control pollutants from non-point sources, may be located
in the protective area.
4. Exemptions. This section does not apply to any of the following:
a. Except as provided under S. 14-2-07 (3), redevelopment postconstruction
sites.
b. In-fill development areas less than 5 acres.
c. Structures that cross or access surface water such as boat landings,
bridges, and culverts.
d. Structures constructed in accordance with s. 59.692 (1v), Stats.
e. Areas of post-construction sites from which the runoff does not enter
the surface water, including wetlands, without first being treated by a
BMP to meet the local ordinance requirements for total suspended
solids and peak flow reduction, except to the extent that vegetative
ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability.
(e) FUELING AND MAINTENANCE AREAS. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas
shall have BMPs designed, installed, and maintained to reduce petroleum within
runoff, so that the runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum
sheen, or to the maximum extent practicable.
(5) GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT MEASURES.
The following considerations shall be observed in on-site and off-site runoff management:
(a) Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural
depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater recharge areas
shall be preserved and used, to the extent possible, to meet the requirements of this

the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process.
(2) APPLICABILITY. This ordinance shall apply to all water entering the storm drain system
generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by an
authorized enforcement agency.
(3) RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION. The City of Cedarburg Department of
Engineering and Public Works shall be deemed the authorized enforcement agency, as that
term is used herein, for purposes of administering, implementing, and enforcing the
provisions of this ordinance. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the authorized
enforcement agency may be delegated by that agency to persons or entities acting in the
beneficial interest of or in the employ of the City.
City of Cedarburg
Subdivision Regulations
80
(4) ILLICIT DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS
(a) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm sewer
system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited, to pollutants or
waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable
water quality standards, other than stormwater.
(b) Exemptions. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to
the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
1. The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established
by this ordinance: water line flushing or other potable water sources,
landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated
pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not including active
groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning
condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian
habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less
than one PPM chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source
not containing Pollutants.
2. Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as
being necessary to protect public health and safety.
3. Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the
authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test.
4. The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted
under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
(5) ILLICIT CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS. The construction, use, maintenance, or
continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This
prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or
prevailing at the time of connection.
(6) SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS
(a) Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The authorized
enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge,
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment,
or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If
the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
City of Cedarburg
Subdivision Regulations
81
or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize
danger to persons.
(b) Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the
MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement
agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and
hearing.
(7) MONITORING OF DISCHARGES
(a) The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this ordinance.
(b) Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by
state and federal law.
(c) Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
ordinance.
(d) If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search
warrant or special inspection warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(8) REQUIREMENTS. Requirement to Prevent, Control, and Reduce Stormwater Pollutants by
the Use of Best Management Practices. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any
person responsible for a property or premise, may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
(9) WATERCOURSE PROTECTION. Every person owning property through which a
watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the
watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other
City of Cedarburg
Subdivision Regulations
82
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through
the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned
structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a
hazard to the use function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
(10) NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any
person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which
are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the
storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said person, shall take all necessary steps to ensure
the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone
or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be
confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement agency
within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken
to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
S. 14-2-13 FEE SCHEDULE.
The fees referred to in other sections of this ordinance shall be established by the City of Cedarburg
Department of Engineering and Public Works and may from time to time be modified by resolution
of the Common Council of the City of Cedarburg. A schedule of the fees established by the City of
Cedarburg Department of Engineering and Public Works shall be available for review in City Hall.
S. 14-2-14 ENFORCEMENT.

shall constitute a separate offense.
(10) Every violation of this ordinance is a public nuisance. Compliance with the provisions of this
ordinance may also be enforced by injunction in any court with jurisdiction. It shall not be
necessary to prosecute for forfeiture or a cease and desist order before resorting to
injunctional proceedings.
(11) When the City of Cedarburg Department of Engineering and Public Works determines that
the holder of a permit issued pursuant to this ordinance has failed to follow practices set forth
in the storm water management plan, or has failed to comply with any other terms of said
storm water management plan, the City of Cedarburg Department of Engineering and Public
Works or a party designated by the City of Cedarburg Department of Engineering and Public

Building/Historic Code
SEC. 15-1-1 BUILDING CODE ESTABLISHED.
(a) Title. This Chapter shall be known as the "Building, Electrical and Plumbing Codes of the
City of Cedarburg" and will be referred to in this Chapter as "this Code," "this Chapter" or
"this Ordinance."
(b) Purpose. This Chapter provides certain minimum standards, provisions and requirements
for safe and stable design, methods of construction and uses of materials in buildings and/or
structures hereafter erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, repaired, moved, converted to
other uses or demolished, and regulates the equipment, maintenance, use and occupancy of
all such building and/or structures. Its purpose is to protect and foster the heath, safety, and
well-being of persons occupying or using such buildings and the general public.
(c) Scope. New buildings erected in, or any building hereafter moved within or into, the City
shall conform to all the requirements of this Chapter except as they are herein specifically
exempted from part of all of its provisions. Any alteration, enlargement or demolition of an
existing building and any installation therein of electrical, gas, heating, plumbing or
ventilating equipment which affects the health or safety of the users thereof of any other
persons, is a "new building" for the purposes of this Chapter whenever it is used for dwelling,
commercial or industrial purposes unless it was being used for such purpose at the time this
Chapter was enacted. Rehabilitation and/or restoration of any Landmark or historic
building or structure within a historic preservation district shall conform to all the
requirements of this Chapter and with the terms and conditions of a Certificate of
Appropriateness (see Sect. 15-1-18-C). The provisions of this Chapter supplement the laws
of the State of Wisconsin pertaining to construction and use and the Zoning Code of the City
and amendments thereto to the date this Chapter was adopted and in no way supersede or
nullify such laws and the said Zoning Code.
SEC. 15-1-2 BUILDING PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS.

of substandard type of construction, which involves either beams, girders,
column, bearing, or other walls, room, heating and air conditioning systems,
arrangement, light and ventilation, changes in location of exit stairways or
exits, or any or all of the above, then such existing construction shall be made
to conform to the minimum requirements of this Chapter applicable to such
occupancy and use and given type of construction. In any event, if alterations
or repairs in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of an
existing building are made to any existing building within any period of
twelve (12) months, the entire building shall be made to conform to the
requirements given herein for new buildings.
b. Construction of Additions. The Wisconsin Uniform Dwelling Code is the
standard and requirements for the construction of any addition on any one (1)
or two (2) family dwelling, regardless of the applicability of the Wisconsin
Uniform Dwelling Code to the dwelling.
c. Repairs. Repairs for purposes of maintenance, or replacements in any
existing building or structure or which do not affect room arrangement, light
and ventilation, access to or efficiency of any exit stairways, or exits, fire
protection, or exterior aesthetic appearance and which to not increase a given
occupancy or use, shall be deemed minor repairs. Minor repairs and changes
no covered by this Section may be made with the same materials of which the
building is constructed, provided not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of
the roof covering of any building shall be replaced in any period of twelve
(12) months (see d. below).
d. Roofing.
1. Residential. A permit is required if any structural work on the roof
support system is to be done; or if a third layer of shingles are to be
applied (engineer's calculations shall also be submitted).
2. Commercial (including apartments). A permit is needed for any
roofing except minor repairs.
e. Alterations When Not Permitted. Except for historical structures, when any
existing building or structure, which for any reason whatsoever does not
conform to the regulations of this Chapter, has deteriorated from any cause
whatsoever to an extent greater than fifty percent (50%) of the equalized
City of Cedarburg
Building Code
6
value of the building or structure, no alterations or moving of such building
or structure shall be permitted. Any such building or structure shall be
considered a menace to public safety and welfare and shall be ordered
vacated and thereafter demolished and debris removed from the premises.
f. Alterations and Repairs Required. When any of the structural members of
any building or structure have deteriorated from any cause whatsoever to less
than their required strength, the owner of such a building or structure shall
cause structural members to be restored to their required strength; failing in
which the building or structure shall be considered a menace to public safety

determination that the proposed landscaping of said building site, or the absence of
landscaping as the case may be, will not cause the general exterior appeal, functional
plan or setting of such building or accessory structure to be so at variance with or so
identical or similar to the exterior landscaping appeal of the landscaping already
planted or grown, or in the course of being planted in the immediate neighborhood,
as to cause a substantial depreciation in the property value of said neighborhood
wherein said building is proposed to be located. Within thirty (30) days of its receipt
of the application, the Commission shall authorize the Building Inspector to issue or
refuse a building permit.
(3) Site Plan. A site plan shall be submitted and reviewed pursuant to the City Zoning
Code.
(d) Dedicated Street and Approved Subdivision Required. No building permit shall be
issued unless the property on which the building is proposed to be built abuts a street that has
been dedicated for street purposes. No building permits shall be issued until the subdivision
and required improvements are accepted by the City Engineer and/or the Common Council.

the payment of the required fee. Every such permit issued by the Building Inspector
for the moving of a building shall designate the route to be taken, the conditions to be
complied with, and shall limit the time during which said moving operations shall be
continued.
(2) A report shall be made by the Building Inspector with regard to possible damage to
trees or the required movement of any public utilities and/or improvements. The
estimated cost of trimming, removing and replacement of public trees, or the required
movement of any public utilities shall be determined by the Building Inspector and
shall be paid to the City prior to issuance of the moving permit.
(3) Issuance of a moving permit shall further be conditioned on approval of the moving
route by the Chief of Police and a representative of the Public Works Department.
(b) Continuous Movement. The movement of buildings shall be a continuous operation during
all the hours of the day, and at night, until such movement is fully completed. All of such
operations shall be performed with the least possible obstruction to thoroughfares. No
building shall be allowed to remain overnight upon any street crossing or intersection, or so
near thereto as to prevent easy access to any fire hydrant or any other public facility. Lights
shall be kept in conspicuous places at each end of the building during the night.
(c) Street Repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall, within one (1) day
after said building reaches its destination, report that fact to the Building Inspector who shall,
with a representative of the Public Works Department, inspect the streets, highways, and
curbs and gutters over which said building has been moved and ascertain their condition. If
the removal of said building has caused any damage to any street or highway, the person to
whom the permit was issued shall forthwith place them in as good repair as they were before
the permit was granted. On the failure of the said permittee to do so within ten (10) days
thereafter to the satisfaction of the Public Works Department, the city shall repair the damage
done to such streets and hold the person obtaining such permit and the sureties on his bond
responsible for the payment of same.
City of Cedarburg
Building Code
23
(d) Conformance With Code. No permit shall be issued to move a building within or into the
City and to establish it upon a location within the said City until the Building Inspector has
made an investigation of such building at the location from which it is to be moved, and is
satisfied from such investigation that said building is in a sound and stable condition and of
such construction that it will meet the requirements of this Building Code in all respects. A
complete plan of all further repairs, improvements and remodeling with reference to such
building shall be submitted to the Building Inspector, and he shall make a finding of fact to
the effect that all such repairs, improvements and remodeling are in conformity with the
requirements of this Building Code, and that when the same are completed, the building as
such will so comply with said Building Code. In the event a building is to be moved from
the City to some point outside the boundaries thereof, the provisions with respect to the
furnishing of plans and specification for proposed alterations to such building may be
disregarded.
(e) Bond.
(1) Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way in the city, the
party applying therefor shall give a bond to the City of Cedarburg in a sum to be
fixed by the Building Inspector and which shall not be less than Five Thousand
Dollars ($5,000.00); said bond to be executed by a corporate surety or two (2)
personal sureties to be approved by the Building Inspector or designated agent
conditioned upon, among other things, the indemnification to the City for any costs
or expenses incurred by it in connection with any claims for damages to any person
or property, and the payment of any judgment together with the costs and expenses
incurred by the city in connection therewith, arising out of the removal of the
building for which the permit is issued.
(2) Unless the Building Inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to be a fact that the
excavation exposed by the removal of such building from its foundation shall not be
so close to a public thoroughfare as to permit the accidental falling therein of
travelers or the location, nature and physical characteristics of the premises and the
exposed excavation, such as to make intrusion upon the premises and the falling into
such excavation of children under twelve (12) years of age unlikely, the bond
required by Subsection (e)(1) shall be further conditioned upon the permittee erecting
adequate barriers and within forty-eight (48) hours, filling in such excavation or
adopting and employing such other means, devices or methods approved by the
Building Inspector and reasonably adopted or calculated to prevent the occurrences
set forth herein.
(f) Insurance. The Building Inspector shall require in addition to said bond above indicated,
public liability insurance covering injury to one person in the sum prescribed in the City's
Schedule of Insurance requirements. The City shall be named as a third-party insured on the
policy.

SEC. 15-1-14 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE RESTORATION AND/OR
REHABILITATION OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES DESIGNATED BY
THE LANDMARKS COMMISSION (Ord. 2015-02)
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish requirements to ensure the
protection and preservation of historic properties.
(b) Applicability. This Section shall apply to the restoration and/or rehabilitation of historic
buildings or structures identified by the City’s Landmarks Commission. Such buildings
or structures may be located either inside or outside of the Washington Avenue historic
Preservation District (WAHPD). This Section shall also apply to the restoration and/or
rehabilitation of existing non-contributing buildings in the Washington Avenue Historic
Preservation District.
(c) General Guidelines for Restoration, Rehabilitation and New Construction. The
Landmarks Commission is available for consultation to assist owners of affected
properties to preserve and enhance existing structures and implement these guidelines.
(1) General. In considering proposed changes to historic affected properties, the
Landmarks Commission shall consider the following:
a. Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a
property which requires minimal alteration of the exterior of a building,
structure or site and its environment.
b. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or
site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration
of any historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be
avoided when possible.
c. Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of
the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its
environment. Changes which may have acquired design or construction
significance in their own right shall be recognized and weighed as a factor.
d. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which
characterize a building, structure and site must be treated with sensitivity.
City of Cedarburg
Building Code
31
e. Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced,
wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material
should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color,
texture, size and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features shall be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical and pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different elements from other
buildings or structures.
f. The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest
means possible. Chemical or physical treatments that cause damage to
historic building materials are not permitted. The Landmarks Commission
shall approve any methods before cleaning. Test spot areas are to be done
and approved by the Building Inspector or his designee and a Landmarks
Commission member before the major work is to begin.
g. Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
h. Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties
shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, district, neighborhood or environment.
i. Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
accomplished in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to
be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure
would be unimpaired.
(d) Standards for the Restoration and/or Rehabilitation of Historic Building Exteriors
and Additions.
The standards used for the restoration and/or rehabilitation of historic building exteriors
and additions thereto shall be the Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for Restoration”
and/or “Standards for Rehabilitation”, hereinafter referred to as the current “SOI
Standards”. See Attachment A for the summary of some key SOI Standards.
(1) Height. Alterations which create more than a one story difference between a
building and those on either side would be subject to review by the Landmarks
Commission based on past photos and history of the original building.
(2) Major Facade.
a. Shop fronts.
1. Shop fronts shall be restored relying on historic photographs,
original drawings, physical evidence and other documents and shall
be rehabilitated in keeping with or sympathetic to the architectural
style of the building.
City of Cedarburg
Building Code
32
2. Shop fronts shall fit inside the original shop front opening and shall
not extend beyond the original opening.
3. Display windows shall be restored to their original appearance
based on photos and any other documentation in keeping with the
architectural era. Small paned 18th century windows shall not be
used nor shall solid or translucent materials be used in place of
window glass.
b. Windows.
1. All windows shall be restored to their original appearance based on
photos and any other documentation or be rehabilitated to fit the
original frame.
2. Round or segmentally-arched windows shall contain window
frames and panes which follow the exterior configuration. A less
desirable alternative of partial blocking to form a rectangular
opening may occur but, if proposed, shall block up the least
possible amount of the opening to preserve to the greatest extent
possible of the original proportions of the window.
3. Windows shall not be blocked up.
4. Shutters may be used if there is evidence that they were in the
original building design and shall be proportionate to windows.
5. Regarding storm windows, mill finish aluminum storm windows
shall not be used. Wood is recommended. Storms shall be painted
to match window trim.
6. If a window is deteriorated beyond repair, replacement windows
should be sought which will duplicate the detailing of the original
windows as closely as possible. Windows of wood construction
are preferred. Subject to approval by the Landmarks Commission,
aluminum clad exterior windows may be used to replace wood
windows beyond repair provided they fully comply with SOI
Standards.
c. Porches, Trim and Ornamentation. Retain porches and steps visible from
the public right-of-way which are historically and architecturally
appropriate to the building. Avoid altering porches and steps by enclosing
open porches or replacing wooden steps with cast concrete steps or by
removing original architectural features, such as hand rails, balusters,
columns or brackets.
d. Trim and Decorative Ornamentation. Retain original copings, cornices,
cresting, finials, railings, balconies, oriels, pilasters, columns, chimneys,
bargeboards or decorative panels which are essential to the maintenance of
the building's historic character and appearance.
e. Roof Shape.

1: The roof shape of the front of a building or structure shall not be
altered except to restore it to the original documentable appearance
or to add a dormer or dormers in a location and shape compatible
with the architectural design of the building and similar in location
and shape to original dormers on buildings of the same vintage and
style within the district. Alterations of the roof shape of the sides
or back of a building or structure shall be visually compatible with
the architectural design of the existing building.
2: Mansards, pents, gables, gambrels or other exotic roof shapes not
characteristic of the architectural area shall not be allowed.
3: Roof material.
aa: If the existing roof of a building or structure is tile, slate, or
other material that is original to the building or structure
and/or contributes to its historic character all repairs thereto
shall be made using the same materials. In addition, in all
cases any such roof must be repaired rather than replaced,
unless the documented cost of repair exceeds the
documented cost of reroofing with a substitute material that
approximates the appearance of the original roofing
material as closely as possible will be approved by the
Landmarks Commission.
bb: If the existing roofing material is asphalt shingles, sawn
wood shingles or a non-historic material, such as fiberglass,
all repairs shall match in appearance the existing roof
material; however, if any such roof is covered or replaced,
reroofing must be done using rectangular sawn wood
shingles or rectangular shingles that are similar in width,
thickness and apparent length to sawn wood shingles, for
example, 3-in-1 tab asphalt shingles and dimensional
asphalt/fiberglass are recommended.
cc: Rolled roofing, tar and gravel and other similar roofing
materials are prohibited except that such materials may be
used on flat or slightly sloped roofs which are not visible
from the ground.
f. Doors.
1. Original exterior doors should be retained whenever possible. If it
is deteriorated beyond repair, a new door should be chosen which
closely resembles the original.
2. Storm/Screen Doors. If possible, the original main exterior door
should be weatherstripped so a storm door is not needed; however,
if a storm door is desired, one should be chosen which reveals as
City of Cedarburg
Building Code
34
much as possible of the door behind it. Material of storm/screen
door shall be wood and painted to harmonize the main door.
g. Terminating Element. Most buildings have a terminating element at the
roof line such as corbelled masonry, wood coping, and cut stone. This
shall not be altered but restored only.
h: Fences. Construct and/or retain fences in the Historic District which are
visible from the public right of ways in a historically and architecturally
appropriate manner in relationship to the adjoining buildings. Chain link
fences are not allowed along public right of ways. Setbacks from right of
ways and height restrictions are per the City Ordinance. A Certificate of
Appropriateness is required for any renovation and/or construction of
fences in the Washington Avenue Historic Preservation District.
(3) Materials.
a. Materials used in original construction shall also be used in restoration and
rehabilitation; materials shall have the same visual appearance as existing
original parts of the building. Generally, in Cedarburg, this is either brick
or dressed stone but in some cases clapboard, board and batten, or stucco
may be in keeping with original construction. Brick and other materials
used in restoration shall be selected to conform to the dimensions of
existing, original materials. Brick shall also conform in color, texture and
surface treatment to existing, original brick. Other materials shall
coordinate in color, texture and surface treatment with nearby buildings.
b. Exterior Wall Materials and Siding. Exposed aggregate, fieldstone,
boulders, split rock, concrete or cinder block, or aggregate panels shall not
be permitted. Vertical or horizontal board and batten or shingles shall not
be permitted unless they are aesthetically acceptable and compatible with
the style of the building and nearby buildings. Repair or replacement of
exterior materials and siding shall fully comply with SOI Standards in
Attachment A. Where more than one layer of siding exists on the
building, all layers except the first must be removed before new siding is
applied. If insulation is applied under the new siding, all trim must be
built up so that it projects from the new siding to the same extent it did
with the original siding.
c. Mortar Joints. The masonry wall shall appear visually as masonry. In
restoration, care should be taken not to damage the brick, thereby creating
larger joints than were original to the specific building. No exaggerated,
uneven or oddly-colored mortar joints should be used. Mortar joints shall
duplicate the original in width and joint profile.
d. Glazing. Clear glazing material shall be used. No mirror glass shall be
permitted. Glass blocks are out of character and inappropriate. Glazing
shall be replaced in kind.

(4) Cleaning and Painting.
a. Building shall be cleaned with the gentlest method possible to accomplish
the task, therefore sandblasting or other abrasive techniques are not
permitted on brick or soft stone surfaces.
b. Masonry buildings which have never been painted shall not be painted
unless authorized by the Commission.
c. Painting can define and accent architectural features and improve the
general overall appearance of the building. An appropriate color scheme
is one of the most important factors to be aware of when restoring the
exterior of a building. Every effort should be made to determine the
"original" color. New paint schemes for affected properties within the
Washington Avenue Historic Preservation District must receive a
Certificate of Appropriateness.
SEC. 15-1-15 REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ADDITIONS IN
THE WASHINGTON AVENUE HISTORIC PRESERVATION DISTRICT
AND AT DESIGNATED HISTORIC PROPERTIES ELSEWHERE IN THE
CITY (Ord. 2015-02)
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish requirements to ensure architectural
compatibility and protect and preserve historic buildings in the Washington Avenue
Historic Preservation District and elsewhere in the City.
(b) Applicability. This Section shall apply to the construction of new buildings and
additions in the Washington Avenue Historic Preservation District and at designated
historic properties elsewhere in the City.
(c) Specific Guidelines for New Construction and Additions.
(1) General. New buildings shall correspond in height, width, proportion,
relationship to street, roof forms, composition, rhythm, proportion of openings,
materials and color to the existing buildings in the district. Plans should show
building elevations to either side and must show the compatible scale. Additions
and exterior alterations that are not visible from any street contiguous to the lot
lines upon which the building or structure is located may be approved by the
Landmark Commission if their design is compatible with the scale of the existing
building and, further, if the materials used are compatible with the existing
materials in texture, color, and architectural details. Additions and alterations
shall harmonize with the architectural design of the building rather than contrast
with it. New additions shall fully comply with SOI Standards.
(2) Height. Floor heights on main facades shall appear visually in proportion to those
of adjoining buildings. There should be no more than one story difference
between a new building and those on either side.

Building Code
36
(3) Width. New buildings shall reflect the characteristic rhythm of facades along the
street. If the site is large, the mass of the facade can be broken into a number of
smaller bays.
(4) Proportion. The characteristic proportion (relationship between height and width)
of existing facades shall be maintained.
(5) Relationship to Street. Residential-type buildings shall be built set back from the
street with side yards. Business-type buildings should be closer to the lot lines
with less setback (see Zoning Code).
(6) Roof Shapes. See Section 15-1-14(d)(2)e.
(7) Materials. New construction in the Washington Avenue Historic Preservation
District should be composed of materials which complement adjacent and nearby
facades. New buildings should not contract sharply with existing nearby
buildings. For illustrative purposes, examples of architectural styles which would
tend to have elements which are incompatible with Cedarburg's historic styles
(found in nearby facades) include (with no attempt to be inclusive) Spanish
Mission, Colonial, Scandinavian Modern, Bavarian and French Provincial.
a. In this District, masonry (brick or stone) facing should normally be used.
Brick should be of standard size 8" x 2-1/3" x 4") and of even coloration.
Exposed aggregate, fieldstone, boulders, split rock, concrete or cinder
block, aggregate panels, aluminum, steel or vinyl siding should not be
permitted. Vertical or horizontal board or batten, shingles, or clapboards
shall be permitted only if aesthetically acceptable.
b. Mortar Joints. Masonry walls should appear visually as masonry--not as
permitted. Black mortar or other mortar which contrasts with the masonry
shall not be used.
c. Glazing. Clear or slightly tinted glass or polymeric glazing materials
should be used. No mirror glass, deeply-smoked glass or glass blocks
shall be permitted.
d. Color. Colors chosen for new construction shall correspond to those
neighboring buildings within the block or the District.
(d) Conflict with Other Codes. These guidelines shall not conflict with state building codes
or energy conservation codes.
SEC. 15-1-16 SEVERABILITY.
Should any section, clause or provision of this Chapter be declared by any court to be

by Handicapped Persons
15-4-1 Grievance Procedures Regarding Access to Public Buildings
by Handicapped Persons
SEC. 15-4-1 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING ACCESS TO PUBLIC
BUILDINGS BY HANDICAPPED PERSONS.
(a) Statement of Purpose. The City of Cedarburg is committed to providing adequate access by
handicapped or visually impaired persons to public buildings financed in part by federal
financial assistance. This Section provides for a grievance procedure providing for prompt
and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the Office of
Revenue Sharing's (ORS) regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55[d][2]) implementing Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794); Section 504 states, in part, that
"no otherwise qualified handicapped individual . . . shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be
excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance . . ."
(b) Complaint Procedure.
(1) Complaints should be filed with the City Administrator, who has been designated to
coordinate Section 504 Compliance.
(2) A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and address of
the person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations.
(3) A complaint should be filed within thirty (30) days after the complainant becomes
aware of the alleged violation. (Processing of allegations of discrimination occurring
before this grievance procedure was in place will be considered on a case-by-case
basis.)
(4) An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a complaint. The
investigation will be conducted by an appropriate person designated by the City
Administrator who should review the handicapped Requirements Handbook
published by the Federal Programs Advisory Service.
(5) A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of the
resolution, if any, shall be issued by the designated person and a copy forwarded to
the complainant no later than thirty (30) days after its filing.
(6) The Section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the City relating
to the complaints filed.
(c) Appeals.
(1) The complainant may appeal the decision of the Section 504 coordinator where he or
she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The appeal request shall be made within seven
(7) days to the City Clerk.
Sign Code
(2) The grievance shall be heard by the Common Council within ten (l0) working days
after the filing of an appeals request. The grievance shall be heard at the City Hall at
a convenient time fixed by the Common Council. The City Clerk shall give at least
three (3) days written notice to the applicant by first class mail of any such grievance
hearing.
(3) Either party to the grievance may be represented, present evidence by testimony or
otherwise, cross-examine witnesses and make argument either in person or by an
agent of his or her choosing. Proceedings may, and, upon request of the applicant,
shall, be recorded.
(4) The decision of the Common Council on the grievance appeal shall be in writing and
shall state the reasons for the decision. The decision of the Council shall be rendered
within three (3) working days of the close of the hearing and the Common Council
shall immediately upon rendering the decision mail a copy thereof by first class mail
to the applicant at the current post office address given in his or her application and
record a copy of its determination with the City Clerk.
(d) Other Remedies. The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint
filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the
filing of a Section 504 complaint with the Office of Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of
the Treasury. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of
other remedies. However, the City believes that resolution of the complaint will be more
promptly achieved if the City is able to provide a remedy before the complaint is brought to
an organization.
(e) Due Process. This Section shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested
persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure that the City complies with
Section 504 and the ORS regulations.

SEC. 15-5-1 PURPOSE OF CHAPTER.
(a) The purpose of this Sign Regulation Chapter is to provide the legal framework and minimum
standards to safeguard life, property, public welfare and City aesthetics by regulating and
controlling the design, number, size, quality of materials, construction, location,
electrification, installation and maintenance of all signs as compatible with zoning
regulations.
(b) This Chapter recognizes the need for well-maintained and attractive sign displays within the
community and the need for adequate business identification advertising and communication.
Because of the unique qualities of the City of Cedarburg which need to be protected and
enhanced, a high degree of control over the aesthetic nature of signs is deemed to be an
important public purpose. It is recognized that while personal preference may be expressed
in selecting the size, shape, colors, type, style, placement, method of mounting and other
components in the design of signs, the Building Inspector, or Landmarks Commission if the
sign is located in the Historic Preservation District, is responsible for assuring that only
aesthetically pleasing and functionally purposeful signs are displayed in the City of
Cedarburg. Therefore, although a proposed sign may meet the basic requirements of this
Chapter, the ultimate decision concerning its final appearance shall rest with the Building
Inspector, or Landmarks Commission if the sign is located in the Historic Preservation
District [subject to the appeals procedure set forth in Section 15-5-3(f)].
Sign Code
(c) This Chapter authorizes the use of signs visible from the public right-of-way, provided the
signs are:
(1) Compatible with the zoning district regulations.
(2) Designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner that they do not
endanger public safety or traffic safety.
(3) Legible, readable, visible and well-designed for the circumstances in which they are
used.
(4) Respectful of the reasonable rights of other advertisers.
(5) Not covering any major architectural detail.
SEC. 15-5-2 ADMINISTRATION OF CHAPTER.
(a) Landmarks Commission. The Landmarks Commission shall examine all applications for
the erection of signs located within the Historic Preservation District, recommend permits,
denials or continued use of signs which conform with requirements of this Chapter to the
Building Inspector or his authorized agent. The Landmarks Commission shall meet no less
than twice a month, unless there are no sign applications pending.
(b) Building Inspector. The City Building Inspector or his authorized agent shall examine all
applications for the erection of signs located outside the Historic Preservation District and
shall approve, deny or permit the continued use of signs which conform with the
requirements of this Chapter. The Building Inspector or his authorized agent shall record and
file all applications for permits with any accompanying plans and documents, make
inspections of signs in the City of Cedarburg and make such reports as the City may require.
(c) Sign Inspection.
(1) The Building Inspector or his authorized agent and/or Electrical Inspector may
inspect every sign.
(2) If any such sign is found to be unsafe or in any way not in compliance with the terms
of this Chapter, the Building Inspector or his authorized agent shall report this fact to
the owner of the sign or to the owner or occupant of the premises on which it is
fastened.
(3) If the sign is not made to comply within thirty (30) days after such notice, it may be
removed or altered to comply at the expense of the holder of the permit by the
Building Inspector or his authorized agent and/or Electrical Inspector. The Building
Inspector or his authorized agent and/or Electrical Inspector may cause a sign to be
removed summarily and without notice whenever public safety requires this to be
done immediately.
(4) The fee for such an inspection is set forth in Section 15-1-101(d). If the fee is not
paid within thirty (30) days of the inspection, such fee shall be doubled and a second
invoice shall be sent to the owner of the sign by certified mail. If such invoice is not
paid within thirty (30) days, appropriate action shall be initiated by the Building
Inspector to cause the removal of the sign in question.
Sign Code
SEC. 15-5-3 SIGN PERMIT APPLICATION.
(a) Application.
(1) If the sign is located in the Historic Preservation District a sign permit application
shall be filed with the Building Inspection Department at least eight (8) working days
prior to a scheduled meeting of the Landmarks Commission. The Building Inspector,
or Landmarks Commission if the sign is located in the Historic Preservation District
shall review the physical site and message requirements of the sign application and
shall approve or deny the application in writing at that time. Upon approval of the
Landmarks Commission if the sign is located in the Historic Preservation District, the
Building Inspector or his authorized agent shall issue the permit. A sign permit shall
become null and void if work authorized under the permit has not been completed
within six (6) months of the date of issuance. Only the person who has submitted the
sign application and paid the necessary fee is authorized to erect the sign; such permit
may be taken out on behalf of the owner by an insured sign installer.
(2) Permits are not required for normal maintenance and repair of the sign and sign
structure as long as it is maintained as originally approved.
(b) Required Information. The sign permit application shall require and contain the following
information. Failure to provide this information to the Building Inspector and/or the
Landmarks Commission could result in the application being tabled until the next scheduled
meeting date.

required for the maintenance of said sign. In addition, the premises on which the sign is
erected shall be kept in a clean, sanitary and inoffensive condition, free and clear of all
noxious substances. The Building Inspector or his authorized agent requires compliance with
all standards of this Chapter. If the sign is not modified to comply with safety standards
outlined in this Chapter, the Building Inspector or his authorized agent, shall require its
removal in accordance with this Section or the sign shall be removed under the authority of
the Building Inspector or his authorized agent, and costs incurred shall be paid by the owner
of the premise on which such sign is located. Signs removed for maintenance and repair for
