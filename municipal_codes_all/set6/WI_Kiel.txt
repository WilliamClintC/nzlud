GENERAL
13.01 UTILITIES ESTABLISHED AND COMBINED.
(1) Establishment. The City of Kiel has established municipal electric, sewer and water departments. These departments together are designated City of Kiel Utilities which shall be managed and operated by the City through a Director of Public Works as to water, a Administrator as to electric and a Superintendent of Sewer Utility as to the sewer system and wastewater treatment facilities.
(2) OVERSIGHT. The general control and supervision of each of the utilities established by the City shall be by the Common Council, which shall exercise
said control through the enactment & amendment of appropriate ordinances and through oversight by such standing committees of the City as the Mayor and Common Council may determine under Sec. 2.01 of this Municipal Code.
(3) CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS. This ordinance shall be liberally construed to affect its purposes. As used herein, the terms "management and control" or "management and operation" shall be construed broadly and shall include, without limitation by enumeration, all authority related to the utility properties of the City, and all authority related to purchasing, acquiring, leasing, constructing, adding to, improving, conducting, controlling, operating or managing the City's public utilities except as specifically withheld by statute.
(4) UTILITIES COMBINED. The waterworks system and the sanitary sewer and wastewater system of the City shall be combined and operated as a single public utility, except for financial reporting, and said utility shall be subject to all of the provisions of Section 66.0819, Wis. Stats. and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation.
13.02 RULES AND REGULATIONS. The rules and regulations for the operation of the combined water and sewer utility shall be those adopted by the City Council and approved and on file with the State Public Service Commission.

This section shall not apply to utility lines which do not provide service to the area being developed.
13.04 CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION.
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 3 KIEL
(1) Cross connection prohibited:
No person shall establish, or permit to be established, or maintain, or permit to be maintained, any cross connection. No interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private, or auxiliary or emergency water supply, other than the public water supply of the utility, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply have been approved by the utility and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
(2) Responsibility:
The (utility) shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to backflow of contaminants or pollutants. The utility shall charge fees according to the utility's Cross Connection Control Manual for maintaining a Comprehensive Cross Connection Control Protection Plan.
(3) Owner Responsibility:
The property owner shall be responsible for the protection of the customer's potable water system. The responsibilities include the elimination of, or protection from, all cross connections on their premises. The owner shall, at their own expense, install, maintain and test any and all backflow preventers on their premises in compliance with the Department of Commerce Comm. 82.21 requirements and the utility's Cross Connection Control Manual and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation.
The property owner shall have corrected any malfunction revealed by periodic testing of any backflow preventer on their premises. The property owner shall inform the utility of any proposed or modified cross connections and also any existing cross connections that are not protected by an approved backflow prevention means. The property owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type in the by-pass. Property owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the backflow prevention assembly must supply additional assemblies necessary to allow testing and maintenance to take place. In the event the property owner installs potable water using fixtures, equipment or appurtenances upstream of the backflow preventer, such must have its own approved backflow prevention means.
The property owner is required to follow the protection practices described in the American Water Works Association publication AWWA M-14 titled "Recommended Backflow Prevention and Cross Connection Control", United States Environmental Protection Agency publication titled "Cross Connection Control Manual", Wisconsin Department of Commerce Plumbing Code, Comm. 82-84, and any modifications or renumbering of said statutes or regulations,
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 4 KIEL
and the utility's "Cross Connection Control Manual", unless the utility requires or authorizes other means of protecting the potable water systems. These requirements or authorizations will be at the discretion of the utility.
(4) Inspections:
It shall be the duty of the utility to cause surveys to be made of all properties serviced by the utility where cross connections with the public water system is deemed possible. Residential properties serviced by the utility shall be surveyed on a twenty (20) year interval. Industrial, manufacturing, commercial and public authority properties serviced by the utility shall be surveyed on an interval of two (2) years. Low Risk Commercial users (i.e. offices or retail stores) will have an interval of ten (10) years depending on the nature of their water usage. The utility may, but is not required to, perform the cross connection survey of the customer's property. If, in the opinion of the utility, the utility is not able to perform the survey, the property owner must, at their own expense, have the water system piping surveyed for cross connections by a person who has been properly trained in accordance with the America Society of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE) Standard number 5120 as a Cross Connection Control Surveyor and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation. The frequency of required surveys and re-surveys, based upon the potential health hazards, may be shortened by the utility.
(5) Right of Entry:
Upon presentation of credentials, representatives of the utility shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine property served by a connection to the public potable water system of the utility for cross connections. If entry is refused, such representatives shall obtain a special inspection warrant under s.66.122, Wisconsin Statutes and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation. The utility shall charge the property owner a fee of $10 per day for refusal to allow entry to examine any property. Upon request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any property served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system on such property.
(6) Authority to Discontinue Service:
The utility is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this section exists and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any damage or contamination of the potable water system. Water service shall be discontinued if the means of backflow prevention required by the utility is not installed, tested, maintained and/or repaired in compliance with this ordinance, the Department of Commerce Plumbing Code Comm. 82-84 and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation and the utility's Cross Connection Control Manual, or if it is found that the means of backflow prevention required by this ordinance has been removed or bypassed. Water
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 5 KIEL

(7) Reconnection of Service:
Water service to any property disconnected under provisions of this ordinance shall not be restored until the cross connection(s) has been eliminated or backflow prevention means, approved by the utility, has been installed in compliance with the provisions of this section.
(8) Emergency Discontinuance of Service:
If it is determined by the utility that a cross connection or an emergency endangers public health safety or welfare and requires immediate action, service may be immediately discontinued. The owner, lessee or occupant shall have an opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68, Wisconsin Statues and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation, with ten (10) days of such emergency discontinuance. Such hearing shall be before the Kiel Water Utility Council and shall conform to all existing due process requirements.
(9) Additional Protection:
In the case of premises having (a) cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled, or (b) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for surveying purposes, making it impractical or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water supply system shall be protected in the service line.
In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a manner that, in the opinion of the utility, could create an actual or potential hazard to the public water supply system, an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow assembly shall protect the public water supply system. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include premises with auxiliary water supplies either interconnected or not interconnected with the public water supply system, premises where inspection is restricted, hospitals, mortuaries, clinics, laboratories, piers, docks and other waterfront facilities, sewage treatment
plants, sewage lift stations, food and beverage, processing plants, chemical plants using a water process, metal processing plants or nuclear reactors, car washing facilities, and premises with reclaimed water systems.
In the case of any presence of toxic substances, the utility may require an approved air gap or reduced pressure principle backflow assembly at the service connection to protect the public water supply system. This requirement
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 6 KIEL
will be at the discretion of the utility.
(10) Public Water Supplies:
This section does not supersede the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Administrative Code NR811 and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation, but is supplementary to it.
(11) Plumbing Code:
The Kiel Water Utility Council adopts by reference the Wisconsin Uniform Plumbing Code being Chapter Comm. 82-84, Wisconsin Administrative Code and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation. This section does not supersede the Wisconsin Uniform Plumbing Code.
13.05 COMPULSORY CONNECTION TO SEWER AND WATER.
(1) NOTICE TO CONNECT. Whenever sewer and water becomes available to any building used for human habitation, the Director of Public Works shall notify in writing the owner, agent or occupant thereof to connect all facilities thereto required by the City. If such person to whom the notice has been given shall fail to comply for more than 10 days after the notice, the City shall cause the necessary connection to be made and the expense thereof shall be assessed as a special tax against the property pursuant to Section 281.45, Wis. Stats. and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation.
(2) ABATEMENT OF PRIVIES AND CESSPOOLS. After connection to a water main and public sewer, no privy, privy vault or cesspool shall be constructed or maintained upon such lot or parcel and shall be abated upon 10 days written notice for such abatement by the City. If not so abated, the City shall cause the same to be done and the cost thereof assessed as a special tax against the property.
(3) TIME EXTENSION. The City Council may extend the time for connection hereunder or may grant other temporary relief where strict enforcement would work an unnecessary hardship without corresponding public or private benefit.
13.051 Requiring Annexation into the City of Kiel to Receive City of Kiel Sewer or Water Services.
(1) Individual real property owners not residing in the City of Kiel who are seeking to either use sewer services through the City of Kiel or water services through the City of Kiel shall be required to have the annexation of their real property into the City of Kiel before the City of Kiel shall provide any City of Kiel sewer service or City of Kiel water service to their real property.

(8) OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT FUND ACCOUNTS.
(a) All sewer service charge revenues collected for replacement costs
shall be deposited in a separate and distinct fund to be used solely for replacement costs as defined in Section 13.10(22). All sewer service charge revenues collected for other operation and maintenance expenses shall also be deposited in a separate and distinct fund.
(b) All revenues for the replacement fund and for operation and maintenance of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities must be used solely for the replacement fund and operation and maintenance of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities.
(9) CHARGE FOR TOXIC POLLUTANTS. Any person discharging toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge from the City's wastewater treatment facility shall pay for such increased costs, as may be determined by the City Council.
(10) CHARGE FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS. The Approving Authority shall charge a daily laboratory analysis fee of $30.00.
13.15 BASIS FOR SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
(1) SEWER USERS SERVED BY WATER UTILITY WATER METERS. The City shall levy and assess upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having a connection with the wastewater collection system and being served with water solely by the Water Utility, a sewer service charge based, in part, on the quantity of water used, as measured by the Water Utility water meter used upon the premises.
(2) SEWER USERS SERVED BY PRIVATE WELLS.
(a) If any person discharging waste water into the sanitary sewers procures any part of all of his water from sources other than the Water Utility, all or part of which is discharged into the sanitary sewers, the person shall have water meters installed by the Water Utility at his expense for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these sources. Where sewer meters are already installed for determining the wastewater volume discharged, water meters will not be required. The water meters shall be furnished by the Water Utility and installed under its supervision, all costs being at the expense of the person requiring the meter.
(b) The water Utility will charge for each meter a rental charge set by the Water Utility to compensate for the cost of furnishing and servicing the meter. The rental charge shall be billed at the time the sewer service
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 27 KIEL
charge is billed.
(3) DEDUCT METERS. If a person feels that a significant amount of metered water does not reach the sanitary sewer, he can at his own expense, with approval of the Approving Authority, install such additional meters or metered services as are necessary to calculate the volume of water not discharged to the sanitary sewer. Metered water not discharged to the sanitary sewers shall not be subject to sewer service charges. Requests to install additional meters shall be made in writing to the Approving Authority.
13.16 BILLING PRACTICE.
(1) CALCULATION OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGES. Sewer service charges shall be computed according to the rates and formula presented in this chapter.
(2) BILLING AND PAYMENT. Sewer service charges shall be billed by the City to the sewer users on a monthly basis. Those persons billed shall pay such charges by the date fixed for final payment.
(3) DELINQUENT PAYMENTS. A penalty of 1.5% per month shall be added to all bills not paid by the date fixed for final payment.
(4) REMEDIES FOR FAILURE TO MAKE PAYMENTS.
(a) Suit. Sewer service charges or other charges due from any person or user shall be deemed to be debt due to the City from that person or user. If sewer service charges or other charges are not paid when due, the City may commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction and recover from such person or user the amount of charges or fees, and damages, if any, sustained by the City as a result of such failure to pay, together with such costs and expenses as may be allowed by law.
(b) Lien on Property. As an alternative to the above, the City may direct that unpaid sewer service charges or other charges due from any person or user shall be collected and taxed and shall be a lien upon the property served in the manner provided for in Section 66.0821, Wis. Stats. and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation, as amended from time to time.
(5) OBLIGATION FOR PAYMENT. While the obligation for payment of the bills in case the user is a non-property owner shall be that of the user, if the bill is not paid, the property owner shall be liable for the bill and the unpaid bill shall remain a lien against the property serviced until paid in accordance with this chapter. To the end that there may be attempts at avoidance of payment of these bills by the tenants, and to overcome the same, the City may send the bill for a user who is a tenant in care of the property owner, who shall thereupon
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 28 KIEL
determine the method in which the payment shall be assured.
13.17 SEWER CONSTRUCTION AND CONNECTIONS.
(1) WORK AUTHORIZED. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb the public sewers or appurtenances thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the Approving Authority or the Director of Public Works.
(2) COST OF SEWER CONNECTION. The person making the connection of the building sewer shall pay for the cost of the connection.
(3) USE OF OLD BUILDING SEWERS. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the Approving Authority or the Director of Public Works, to meet all requirements for this chapter.
(4) MATERIALS AND METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION. The size, slope, alignment, and materials of construction of a building sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench shall conform to the requirements of the City’s Building and Plumbing Codes or other applicable rules and regulations of the City and State. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the STM and WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.
(5) BUILDING SEWER GRADE. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. All costs related to the installation, connection, operation and maintenance of such lifting device shall be borne by the person making the building sewer connection.
(6) STORMWATER AND GROUND WATER. Stormwater and groundwater drain connections are prohibited as follows:
(a) No person shall allow the discharge or cause to be discharged into any sanitary sewer any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling waste or unpolluted industrial process waters. All stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water and all other unpolluted drainage and clear water shall be discharged into such sewers as are designated as storm sewers whenever reasonably available; further provided that if no storm sewer is available, in no event shall any such waters be discharged into
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 29 KIEL
any sanitary sewer.
(b) All sump pumps installed for the purpose of discharging clear waters from foundation drains, basement drains and ground infiltration shall discharge into a storm sewer whenever available, and, if no storm sewer is available shall discharge into an underground conduit leading to a drainage ditch, drywell or onto the ground at a point which is not less than three feet from the building and is above permanent grade. No sump pump is allowed to flow on or across a public sidewalk.
(c) In carrying out the provisions of this chapter, Approving Authority or the Director of Public Works shall have the authority to enter upon private premises at reasonable times to determine whether any of the water drainage hereinabove described exists thereon and whether such drainage complies with the provisions of this chapter. No person shall refuse to permit the Approving Authority or the Director of Public Works to enter upon any premises at reasonable times to exercise their duties under this article.
(d) It shall be rebuttably presumed that clear water is being discharged in a sanitary sewer if it is shown that existing sump pumps or other means of clear water discharge have or can be readily connected to drains, pipes or other mechanisms of discharge connected to the sanitary sewer drain within the premises.
(e) Disconnection time frame; exception. All existing downspouts or groundwater drains, etc., connected directly or indirectly to a sanitary sewer must be disconnected within 60 days of the date of an official written notice from the Approving Authority. Exceptions to this subsection may be made by the Approving Authority.
(f) Stormwater and groundwater failure to correct fee. A $50.00 monthly fee is also hereby imposed for failure to correct stormwater and groundwater connection found not conforming to specifications in section 13.17 of this code. This fee will be imposed beginning 60 days following notice by the city to the owner that corrective action is required and has not been completed on schedule and will continue until corrective action by the owner has been taken (new 13.26-13.30)
(7) CONFORMANCE TO PLUMBING CODES.

Chapter 13 – Page 30 KIEL
The connection shall be inspected and approved by the Approving Authority or the Director of Public Works.
(9) BARRICADES: RESTORATION. All excavations for the building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Approving Authority or the Director of Public Works.
13.18 APPEALS. Any user, permit applicant or permit holder affected by any decision, action or determination, including cease and desist orders, made by the Approving Authority interpreting or implementing the provisions of this chapter or in any permit issued herein, may file with the Approving Authority a written request for reconsideration within 10 days of the date of such decision, action or determination, setting forth in detail the facts supporting the user’s request for reconsideration. The Approving Authority shall render a decision on the request for reconsideration to the user, permit applicant or permit holder in writing within 15 days of receipt of request. If the ruling on the request for reconsideration made by the Approving Authority is unsatisfactory to the person, the person requesting reconsideration may, within 10 days after notification of the action, file a written appeal with the City Council. The written appeal shall be heard by the City Council within 45 days from the date of filing and the City Council shall make a final ruling on the appeal within 60 days from the date of filing.
13.19 VALIDITY. The sewer service charge system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of preexisting agreements or contracts between the Municipality and any person, which are inconsistent with Section 204(b)(1)(A) and 40 CFR 35, Subpart E of the Clean Water Act and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation.
.
13.20 AUDIT, NOTIFICATION AND RECORDS.
(1) BIENNIAL AUDIT. The City shall review, at least every 2 years, the wastewater contribution of its sewer users, the operation and maintenance expenses of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities and the sewer service charge system. Based on this review, the City shall revise the sewer service charge system, if necessary, to accomplish the following:
(a) Maintain a proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance expenses among sewer users based on the wastewater volume and pollutant loadings discharged by the users.
(b) Generate sufficient revenues to pay the operation and maintenance expenses of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities.
(2) ANNUAL NOTIFICATION. The City shall notify its sewer users annually
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 31 KIEL

The notification shall occur in conjunction with a regular bill.
(3) RECORDS. The City shall maintain records regarding wastewater flows and loadings, costs of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities, sampling programs and other information which is necessary to document compliance with 40 CFR 35, Subpart E of the Clean Water Act and any modifications or renumbering of said statute or regulation.
13.21 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
(1) WRITTEN NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS. Any person found to be violating any provision of this subchapter shall be declared to be creating a public nuisance and shall be served by the City with a written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
(2) ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE WITHOUT NOTICE.

13.27 SYSTEM RECONSTRUCTION. The City of Kiel has undertaken the systematic reconstruction of the public sanitary sewer system. The presence of an abnormal amount of clear water entry into the sanitary sewer system has been indicated. The presence of this clear water reduces available capacity to all systems users, causes system overloads that may manifest themselves as basement flooding, causes a financial burden on the citizens of the City, and is a potential source of severe health hazards. The City recognizes that its public sewer system has a finite life and in many cases has exceeded the useful life of the system. The City also recognizes that private building sewers possess many of the same characteristics as the public system.
(1) The City shall inspect all private connections to the public mains at the time of reconstruction of the public system.
(a) Any existing private connection not meeting the requirements of this section shall be considered illegal.
(b) Prior to actual reconstruction, each property owner shall be given written notice of the project. Such notices shall be made no less than 30 days prior to commencement of the actual work.
(2) Prior to the commencement of the reconstruction, the City shall inspect each private sewer connection for conformance with this section.
(a) In the event that the private system meets the requirements of this section, the City shall reconnect the private system to the public system at an appropriate point near the right of way line at time of reconstruction.
(b) In the event that the private sewer is found not to meet the requirements of this section, the City shall notify the property owner of the determined deficiency(ies).
(3) The owner shall, at the owners expense, make the necessary repairs to correct the deficiency(ies). In all cases, the City shall supply an appropriate connection point as part of its work. The owner may elect to:
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 33 KIEL
(a) Make the repair(s). In doing so the owner recognizes that all work must be done in strict conformance with all applicable local and state codes and in such a manner to correct the noted deficiency(ies). All work needed to accomplish the repair shall be done at the expense of the owner.
(b) Contract with licensed contractor to complete the repair. All work needed to accomplish the repair shall be done at the expense of the owner.
(c) Have City contractors, if available, complete the repair. The City agrees, as part of any project, to request unit prices that will allow for the calculation of cost of making the appropriate repair to the private sewer.
(1) Should the owner select this option, the owner will be charged the entire cost making the repair.
(2) The owner may elect to pay the entire amount upon completion of the work, or the owner may request that he be billed in the form of a special assessment on the owner’s tax bill.
13.28 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.
(1) All sanitary sewer mains and laterals, both public and private, shall be constructed and maintained in such a fashion that the effects of clear water on the system are held to an absolute minimum.
(2) All work, construction technique, and materials incorporated into the project shall be in strict conformance with state and local codes, or the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9 Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers.
(a) Permitted Materials. Permitted materials are specified in the City of Kiel Wastewater Utility Capacity, Maintenance, Operation and Management (CMOM) guidance.
(b) Defects Requiring Repair
(1) Any visible leak.
(2) Open, improperly formed, or root intruded joints.
(3) Improper materials such as soil or orangeburg pipe.
(4) Visible crack.
(5) Improper connections such as a palmer valve.
(6) Any defect determined by the City of Kiel to require repair to comply with the system standards identified herein.
13.29 BACKWATER VALVES.
(1) Backwater valves shall be required on all building sewers new or reconstructed at a location approved by the approving authority.
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
Chapter 13 – Page 34 KIEL
(2) When in the best interest of the City, require the installation of a backwater valve in building sewers servicing buildings not listed in this subsection.
(3) Continue to encourage the installation of floor drain backflow preventors in one- and two-family buildings without backwater valves.
13.30 SANITARY SEWER LATERAL FEES
(1) Sewer lateral fees. The following fees are hereby created and imposed, each fee separately at the rate of $50.00 per month, payable in monthly installments and billed with the regular monthly billing for City of Kiel Utility services:
(a) Televising refusal fee. A $50.00 monthly fee is hereby imposed for connection of sewer laterals against every property connected to the City of Kiel sanitary sewerage system, in the utility, which owner refuses to consent to televising of the sewer lateral by the city. This fee will be imposed beginning 30 days after request has been made by the city for permission to televise the owner's sewer lateral. This fee will continue until the property owner consents to televising by the city.
(b) Failure to correct fee. A $50.00 monthly fee is also hereby imposed for connection of sewer laterals against every property connected to the sanitary sewerage system, in the utility, which owner fails to take corrective action upon request by the city to repair sewer laterals leaking freshwater into the sewerage system. This fee will be imposed beginning 30 days following notice by the city to the owner that corrective action is required and has not been completed on schedule and will continue until corrective action by the owner has been taken.
(2) Fee exemptions. The following are the exemptions and procedures from lateral fees:
(a) Televising exemption. Upon request by the City of Kiel Wastewater Utility to televise a sewer lateral connected to a sewer main, in the utility, the property owner may grant consent to televise the lateral by signing a consent form approved by the city. Upon receipt of such signed consent form, the city is authorized to access the private sewer lateral and adjacent property for purposes of televising the lateral. Owners complying with this section are exempt from the televising refusal fee.
(b) Corrective fee exemption. Each owner that repairs all laterals determined by the city to be leaking freshwater into the sewerage system shall be exempt from the failure to correct fee beginning at such time that verification of corrective action has been provided by the owner to the city.

17.41 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT.
(1) INTENT. The PUD provisions of the Kiel Municipal Code are intended to promote creativity and flexibility in site plan design, while at the same time preserving the health, safety, order, and general welfare of the City. PUD’s may contain one use or any combination of residential, commercial, or agricultural uses, so long as they are planned and developed in an orderly and compatible way. Mixed uses may occur among or within buildings as long as the uses are compatible with each other and with the planned and existing uses of areas adjacent to the PUD. Any use of land not clearly designated by type on the approved final development plan shall be permitted in a PUD only upon issuance of a Special Use Permit.
(2) PUD STANDARDS. The PUD standards shall be as follows:
(a) Access. All land uses shall abut on a public street or have adequate access to a public street by means of a private drive. All streets and drives must tie in effectively with the City’s existing street system and with those arterial and collector streets proposed in the City’s future land use plan.
(b) Architectural Style. The architectural style of the individual structures within the PUD shall be compatible with other structures in the PUD, as well as with the overall site design and with land uses of abutting lands.
(c) Common Open Space. As far as possible, common open space shall be linked to the open space areas of surrounding developments. A common open space in a PUD shall be of an adequate size, and appropriate shape, location, and usability, to suit its proposed purpose.
(d) Density. A residential PUD may provide up to a 25% increase in the number of units per acre over other residential zoning districts if the PUD provides substantially more site amenities than are found in a conventional residential development. Approval of any increase in density in a residential PUD shall be at the discretion of the City Council, which shall in considering whether the proposed density is to be permitted in the particular PUD take into account the character, use of existing landscape, design variation and environmental concerns of the PUD. Where the land proposed for a PUD lies in an area which has already been included in a zoning district by the City, density shall be computed based on the established standards for density in such zone. Where no zone exists or where changes in zoning are proposed, the developer who proposes to develop a PUD in the particular zone shall prepare and present to the City Plan Commission and the City Council a preliminary zoning request and sketch plan.
(e) Determining Standards. Standards for lot area, coverage, setbacks, parking, screening and density shall be governed by the standards of the zoning district most similar in function to the proposed PUD use, as determined by the Plan Commission. Deviation from those standards
ZONING CODE
Chapter 17 - Page 48 KIEL
may be permitted by the Plan Commission or the City Council only if such deviation is consistent with the total design of the proposed development, encourages a desirable living environment, and is not likely to be detrimental to the welfare of the City.
(f) Exterior Boundary Setback. No principal building shall be set back less than 25 feet or the height of the building, whichever is greater, from the exterior of a PUD or a public street right-of-way. No commercial or industrial structure shall be nearer than 100 feet to its side or rear property lines where such side or rear property lines abut a single-family use.
(g) Property Owners Association. All owners of property within the PUD shall be required to be members of a property owners association consisting of the owners of all properties in the PUD. The property owners’ association shall own and maintain all common open space and private interior drives.
(h) Designation of Recreational Trails. When possible, trails should be integrated into the PUD. Trails within a PUD will be encouraged to connect to existing or future exterior trail systems. A PUD not conventionally platted must include at least 10% common open space.
(i) Minimum PUD Development Area. A minimum PUD development area shall be at least 2 acres of land in single ownership or control. A land use of less than 2 acres may qualify if one or more of the following conditions exist:
1. Natural features of land are such that development under standard zoning regulations would not adequately conserve such features;
2. The land is adjacent to or across the street from property which has been developed as a PUD and is to be developed in relationship to such prior development;
3. Flexible design is needed to address detrimental site features affecting the development potential of a site, such as heavily used highways, railroad tracks traversing a property, rock outcroppings, adjacent incompatible land uses, or similar site constraints; or
4. The site is surrounded by existing development or environmental features that prevent full public access.
(3) PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPLICATION.
The Preliminary Plan shall include the following:
(a) Existing wooded areas, streams, marshes and other predominant natural features;
(b) Phasing schedule stating the geographical phasing and approximate construction timing of the PUD or portions thereof:
(c) Preliminary drainage plan;
(d) Preliminary utility plan for all public utilities;
ZONING CODE
Chapter 17 - Page 49 KIEL
(e) Site plan showing the lot lines, building locations, public or private street system, parking spaces, drives, common open space areas, trails, recreational improvements and structures;
(f) Summary sheet indicating the area of land in each land use, number of units proposed, density of development, percentage of land in usable open space, number of acres of common recreational open space and number of parking spaces provided; and
(g) A vicinity map showing a sufficient amount of the area surrounding the proposed PUD to demonstrate the relationship of the proposed PUD development to the adjacent land uses and street system.
(4) PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF A PRELIMINARY PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
(a) The proposed PUD developer shall submit six (6) copies of an application with development plan along with the items listed below to the City Administrator, who shall transmit copies to the Plan Commission, the Building Inspector, the Public Works Director, the Park Board, and any other agencies which he may feel would appropriately have a copy of the application with development plan. The application shall include a written explanation of the character and purpose of the proposed planned development, including the type and density of any housing proposed, the nature and purpose of any non-residential development; the proposed method for preserving and maintaining open space, streets and parking areas; and a general statement of proposed financing for the project. Each proposal for a PUD shall be accompanied by a schedule showing the times within which each phase or segment of the PUD will be completed. The City Council shall review the proposed time schedule for completion of each phase or segment of the proposed PUD and may suggest changes in the said time schedule. After a specific time schedule has been approved by the City Council, in the event that any portion of such time schedule is not met, the City Council may, upon written request of the PUD developer for an extension of time, delivered to the City Administrator at least 20 days prior to the expiration of the completion date for which such extension is requested, for good cause, extend the said completion date.

Conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner which will not conflict with other municipal underground services. Proposed utility layouts shall be shown on copies of the preliminary plat supplied by the subdivider to the appropriate utilities. These layouts shall be reviewed and approved by the directors of the appropriate City utilities prior to the completion of the final plat.
(e) Sanitary Sewer Lift Stations and Force Mains. Where sanitary sewer lift stations and force mains are required to lift sewerage to a higher elevation and to the gravity sewer system, the subdivider shall have the plan and profile drawings and specifications prepared for the installation of such sewerage lift facilities. Such installation and the inspection, supervision and engineering fees shall be paid for by the subdivider unless otherwise determined by the City Council.

The cost of the curb and gutter shall be paid for by the subdivider and all required inspection, supervision and engineering fees shall be paid for by the City.
(2) LETTER OF CREDIT OR BOND. If the above facilities and improvements have not been fully installed at the time the plat is submitted for final approval, the subdivider shall file with the City Treasurer, or his deputy, either an irrevocable letter of credit from a responsible bank, savings and loan association or other financial institution, duly licensed and authorized to do business in this State, or a surety bond, which bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to the cost of making the necessary public improvements.
(3) COUNCIL DISCRETION. In all instances where it shall appear to the satisfaction of the City Council and the Plan Commission that all of a platted subdivision cannot immediately be improved with respect to the installation of storm and sanitary sewers and related facilities, street improvements or any other required improvement, the City Council may, in its discretion, authorize the subdivider to proceed with the installation of improvements required under this chapter on one or a portion of the lots covered by the plat.

18.09 VARIANCES. When, in the judgment of the Council, it would be inappropriate to apply literally a provision of this chapter because the subdivision is located outside the corporate limits, or because extraordinary hardship would result, it may waive or vary such provision so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that in no event shall the requirement of filing and recording the plat be waived.

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDING OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, TITLE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
20.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
(1) This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization in ss. 61.35 and 62.23, for villages and cities; 59.69, 59.692, and 59.694 for counties; and the requirements in s. 87.30, Stats.
20.02 FINDING OF FACT
(1) Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.
20.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
(1) This ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to:
(a) Protect life, health and property;
(b) Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;
(c) Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;
(d) Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;
(f) Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;
(g) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;
(h) Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and
(i) Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable
alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
20.04 TITLE
(1) This ordinance shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Kiel, Wisconsin.
20.05 GENERAL PROVISIONS
(1) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood, or hydraulic shadow of the Kiel Dam.
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-Zones on the Flood
FLOODPLAIN ZONING
Chapter 20 - Page 3 KIEL
Insurance Rate Map.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Kiel Floodplain Appendix. Any changes to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFE’s) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the City Administrator, City of Kiel Office. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on the Manitowoc County Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated (August 2, 2011), volume number (55071CV000A) and Calumet County Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated February 2009, volume number (55015CV000A)
(a) Manitowoc County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers (55071C0367D, 55071C0370D and 55071C0386D dated AUGUST 2, 2011; with corresponding profiles that are based on the FIS.
(b) Calumet County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) panel number 55015C0295E dated February 9, 2009 with corresponding profiles that are based on the FIS.
(c)The hydraulic shadow map with corresponding profiles based on the Kiel Dam Failure Analysis by Robert E Lee dated 1-21-2014. The area designated at “Hydraulic Shadow” shall be regulated as Floodway District.
(3) ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
(a) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.
(b) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway.
(c) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.
(d) The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge.
(4) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to s. 20.70. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived
FLOODPLAIN ZONING
Chapter 20 - Page 4 KIEL
from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to s. 20.63(3) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below.
(a) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
(b) Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be
determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to s. 20.71 (6).
(5) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for
removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above
the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to s. 20.70.
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory
purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
(6) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
(7) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties
are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits.
State agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and repair of state highways and
bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when
s. 30.2022, Stats., applies.
FLOODPLAIN ZONING
Chapter 20 - Page 5 KIEL
(8) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
(a) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under ss. 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; s. 62.23 for cities; or s. 61.35 for villages; or s. 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(b) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(9) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
(10) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

Disputes hereunder are to be resolved by arbitrators, one to be selected by each party and a third to be selected by the other two. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final. The arbitrators are to base their decisions on what is fair and equitable to both the City and the grantee, as well as to subscribers and the residents of the City in general.
(3) The grantee shall make available specified records, documents and information concerning the operation of the franchise for the purpose of these meetings. Topics for review at the said meetings shall include, but not be limited to, the following: services, rate structure, free or discounted services, use and availability of new technologies, subscriber complaints, user complaints, programming and any amendments which may be proposed to the franchise terms.

(h) If the grantee fails to receive the necessary FCC authorization within a reasonable period of time, unless such cause is directly attributable to an action or condition imposed by the City.
(i) If the grantee knowingly and with intent to deceive makes any false, misleading or fraudulent statements of fact in its proposal for a franchise or other reports or information provided to the City, other regulatory agencies or subscribers.
22.25 REVOCATION PROCEDURE. Upon the occurrence of any of the events enumerated in Section 22.24, the following procedures shall be followed:

CABLE COMMUNICATIONS
Chapter 22 - Page 28
(5) If the City Council determines that there is a default, the grantee shall be granted such an additional amount of time as the City Council shall deem reasonable to correct the default to the satisfaction of the City Council.
(6) At the conclusion of such reasonable period, the City Council shall again at a public meeting determine whether the default has been satisfactorily corrected and, if it has not, the franchise granted under authority of this chapter may be immediately revoked by resolution without further notice or hearing.
22.26 PURCHASE OF SYSTEM BY CITY ON NONRENEWAL.
(1) If the City determines not to renew the franchise, the grantee shall first offer the CCS for sale to the City at fair market value, determined on the basis of the CCS valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself.
(2) If the determination of fair market value cannot be negotiated or determined, the value shall be determined by an impartial appraisal procedure pursuant to Chapter 788, Wis. Stats., Arbitration, wherein the grantee and the City shall each choose an appraiser and the appraisers chosen shall choose a third appraiser and the valuation determined by such appraisers shall be considered the fair market value at which the system will be offered to the City. The determination of the value of the system shall be decreased by the amount of any damages sustained by the City in connection with nonrenewal, including without limitation, payment made by the City to another person or entity to operate the CCS for a temporary period after nonrenewal. The cost of the appraisal procedure shall be shared equally by the City and the grantee.
(3) The City shall have 90 days commencing on the day the fair market value of the system is determined either through negotiation or the appraisal procedure to exercise its option to purchase. If the City does not exercise its option to purchase, and the CCS is not sold to another operator who has obtained a franchise from the City, the grantee, upon request by the City, shall promptly remove all its plant, structures and equipment. While transfer of the system and franchise is being negotiated, arranged or ordered, the grantee may be required to continue service to the public unless for reasons beyond the control of the grantee such operation will be economically infeasible to the grantee.
22.27 PURCHASE OF SYSTEM BY CITY ON REVOCATION.
(1) If the City revokes the franchise for cause, the grantee shall first offer the CCS for sale to the City at an equitable price.
(2) If the determination of an equitable price cannot be negotiated or
CABLE COMMUNICATIONS
Chapter 22 - Page 29
determined, the price shall be determined by an impartial appraisal procedure pursuant to Chapter 788, Wis. Stats., wherein the grantee and the City shall each choose an appraiser and the appraisers chosen shall choose a third appraiser and the price determined by such appraisers shall be considered the equitable price at which the system will be offered to the City. The determination of the price of the system shall be decreased by the amount of any damages sustained by the City in connection with revocation, including without limitation, payment made by the City to another person or entity to operate the CCS for a temporary period after revocation. The cost of the appraisal procedure shall be shared equally by the City and the grantee.
(3) The City shall have 90 days commencing on the day the equitable price of the system is determined either through negotiation or the appraisal procedure to exercise its option to purchase. If the City does not exercise its option to purchase, and the CCS is not sold to another operator who has obtained a franchise from the City, the grantee, upon request by the City, shall promptly remove all its plant, structures and equipment. While transfer of the system and franchise is being negotiated, arranged or ordered, the grantee may be required to continue service to the public unless for reasons beyond the control of the grantee such operation will be economically infeasible to the grantee.

(1) In removing its plant, structures and equipment, the grantee shall refill at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to the company’s removal of its equipment and appliances, without affecting the electric or telephone cables, wires or attachments. The City shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal. Liability insurance and indemnity provided in Section 22.18 and the performance bond in Section 22.20 shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal.
(2) If the grantee fails to complete any work required by (1) above or any work required by City law or ordinance within the time established and to the satisfaction of the City, the City may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the City the costs thereof within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the City may recover such costs as provided in Section 22.20.
(3) Nothing shall prohibit the City from imposing lesser sanctions or censures than revocation for violations of provisions of this chapter, including the shortening of the franchise term.
(4) Upon the expiration of the franchise the City may by resolution, on its own
CABLE COMMUNICATIONS
Chapter 22 - Page 30

22.30 ACCEPTANCE AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF FRANCHISE.
(1) Any franchise awarded hereunder and the rights, privileges and authority granted thereby shall take effect and be in force from and after the 30th day following the award thereof, provided that within 30 days of such award the grantee shall file with the City the following:

A grantee shall not, as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules regulations or in any other respect, make or grant any unreasonable preference or advantage nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage. This provision shall not be deemed to prohibit promotional campaigns to stimulate subscription to the CCS or other legitimate uses thereof; nor shall it be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any subscriber coming within such classifications shall be entitled, provided such schedules have been filed with and approved by the City as provided in Section 22.21.
(2) The entire CCS shall be operated in a manner consistent with the principles of fairness and equal accessibility of its facilities, equipment, channels, studios and other services to all citizens, businesses, public agencies or other entities having legitimate use for the CCS.

22.33 INTERCONNECTION.
(1) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed so as to prohibit a grantee from interconnecting its CCS with other similar contiguous systems either in the City or in other municipalities, counties or states. However, any revenues derived therefrom shall be equitably allocated in the calculation of annual gross subscriber revenues as defined in Section 22.02(2) herein.
(2) A grantee shall, if requested by the City, conduct a technical and economic feasibility study of any interconnection requested by the City. The study shall be presented to the City, and if the study shows such interconnection to be feasible, the grantee shall, if so instructed by the City, accomplish the interconnection.
CABLE COMMUNICATIONS
Chapter 22 - Page 32
(a) If the study indicates technical feasibility only, the City may elect at its sole discretion to arrange for compensation to be paid to the grantee, in an amount sufficient to assure an economic break-even by the grantee, and so order the interconnection.
(b) If the study fails to show technical feasibility, the grantee shall have no further responsibility for accomplishing interconnection until such time as improvements in technology permit such interconnection
22.34 UNAUTHORIZED CONNECTIONS OR MODIFICATIONS.
(1) No firm, person, group, partnership, company, corporation or governmental body or agency, without the express consent of the grantee, shall make any connection, extension or division, whether physically, inductively, electronically or otherwise, with or to any segment of a franchised CCS for any purpose whatsoever, except as may be provided in this chapter.
(2) No firm, person, group, partnership, company, corporation or government body or agency shall willfully interfere with, tamper with, remove, obstruct or damage any part, segment or content of a franchised CCS for any purpose whatsoever.

Valid authorization shall mean written approval from the subscriber for a period of time not to exceed one year and shall not have been obtained from the subscriber as a condition of service. Further, a grantee, without such authorization, shall not activate and/or utilize any “television signal” in any manner from the subscriber’s premises.

CABLE COMMUNICATIONS
Chapter 22 - Page 33
(2) The City, the grantee or any person shall not, without prior written valid authorization from each subscriber so affected, provide any data identifying or designating subscribers. Any data so authorized will be made available to the authorizing subscriber in understandable fashion.

SHORELAND-WETLAND ZONING
Chapter 23 - Page 5 KIEL
Wis. Stats., applies.
(3) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
(a) This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any City zoning ordinance enacted under Sections 61.35, 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another City zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
(b) This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.

If a person makes a cash deposit, the person may nevertheless appear in court at the time specified in the citation, provided that the cash deposit may be retained for application against any forfeiture, restitution, penalty assessment, jail assessment or other assessment that may be imposed by the court.
(b) If a person appears in court in response to a citation, that citation may be used as the initial pleading, unless the court directs that a formal complaint be made, and the appearance confers personal jurisdiction over the person. The person may then plead guilty, no contest or not guilty. If the person pleads guilty or no contest, the court shall accept the plea, enter judgment of guilty and impose a forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment and such other assessments as may be established by statute. If the Court finds that the violation meets the conditions set forth in Section 800.093(1) Wis. Stats., the court may order restitution under said statute. A plea of not guilty shall put all matters in the case at issue, and the matter shall be set for trial.
(c) If the alleged violator makes a cash deposit or fails to appear in court, the citation may serve as the initial pleading and the violator shall be considered to have tendered a plea of no contest or submitted to a forfeiture, the penalty assessment imposed under State Statutes, and the jail assessment imposed under State Statutes, as well as any other assessments applying to the particular case under the Wisconsin Statutes and these Municipal Ordinances. The court may either accept the plea of no contest and enter judgment accordingly or reject the plea. If the court finds the violation to meet the conditions set forth in Section 800.093(1), Wis. Stats., the court may summon the alleged violator into court to determine if restitution shall be ordered under said statute. If the court accepts the plea of no contest, the defendant may move within ten (10) days after the date set for appearance to withdraw the plea of no contest, open the judgment and enter a plea of not guilty if the defendant shows to the satisfaction of the court that the failure to appear was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect. If the plea of no contest is accepted and that is subsequently changed to a plea of not guilty, no costs or fees shall be taxed against the violator, but a penalty assessment, jail assessment, and other applicable assessments under Wisconsin Statutes shall be assessed. If the court rejects the plea of no contest, an action for collection of the forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment or other applicable assessments under the Wisconsin Statutes may be commenced. The City may commence action under Section 66.0114(1) Wis. Stats. The citation may be used as the complaint in an action for collection of the forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment or other assessments provided for under Wisconsin Statutes.
(d) If the alleged violator does not make a cash deposit and fails to appear in court at the time specified in the citation, the court may issue a summons or warrant for the defendant’s arrest or consider the

Chapter 25 - Page 5 KIEL
nonappearance to be a plea of no contest and enter judgment accordingly if service was completed as provided under Section 968.04(3)(b)2, Wis. Stats., or by personal service by a City employee, or the City may commence an action for collection of the forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment and any other applicable assessments under State law. The City may commence action under Section 66.0114(1). The citation may be used as a complaint in the action for the collection of the forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment and any other applicable assessments under Wisconsin Statutes. If the court considers the nonappearance to be a plea of no contest and enters judgment accordingly, the court shall promptly mail a copy or notice of the judgment to the defendant. The judgment shall allow the defendant not less than twenty (20) days from the date of judgment to pay any forfeiture, penalty assessment, jail assessment and any other applicable assessments under the Wisconsin Statutes. If the defendant moves to open the judgment within six (6) months after the court appearance date fixed in the citation, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the failure to appear was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, the court shall reopen the judgment, accept a not guilty plea and set a trial date
(e) The issuance of a citation under this section shall not preclude a proceeding under any other ordinance or law related to the same or any other matter, nor shall the proceeding under any other ordinance or law relating to the same or any other matter preclude the issuance of a citation under this section.
(f) If the action is to be used in Municipal Court, the citation which shall be used shall be that provided for by Section 800.02(2), Wis. Stats.
25.05 REPEAL OF GENERAL ORDINANCES. Adoption of a revised Code shall not have the effect of repealing those ordinances which are not inconsistent with said revised Code.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION ORDINANCE
4 | P a g e - C h a p t e r 2 6 K I E L
Council. Once designated, such historic structures, sites, and districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this ordinance.

Also, unless such certificate has been granted by the committee, the building inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work.
(2) Upon filing of any application for a Certificate of Appropriateness with the committee, the committee shall approve the application unless:
(a) In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior feature of the improvement or site upon which said work is to be done:

5 | P a g e - C h a p t e r 2 6 K I E L
consistent with the character and features of the property or district, it shall issue the Certificate of Appropriateness. The committee shall make this decision within forty-five (45) days of the filing of the application.

deems necessary. The Committee may conduct an independent investigation into the proposed designation or rescission.

SMALL CELL ATTACHEMENTS
Chapter 28 - Page 8 KIEL
To the extent that filing of the wireless permit application establishes a deadline for action on any other permit that may be required in connection with the wireless telecommunications facility, the application must include complete copies of applications for every required permit (including without limitation electrical permits, building permits, traffic control permits, and excavation permits), with all engineering completed and with all fees associated with each permit.
A certification by a registered and qualified engineer that the installation can be supported by and does not exceed the tolerances of the structure on which it will be mounted and that all elements of the wireless telecommunications facility comply with applicable safety standards.

If an applicant contends that denial of the application would prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of service in violation of federal law, or otherwise violate applicable law, the application must provide all evidence on which the applicant relies in support of that claim. Applicants are not permitted to supplement this evidence if doing so would prevent the City of Kiel from complying with any deadline for action on an application.
If the application is an eligible facilities request, the application must contain information sufficient to show that the application qualifies as an eligible facilities request under 47 C.F.R. § 1.6100(b)(3), including evidence that the application relates to an existing tower or base station that has been approved by the City of Kiel. Before and after 360-degree photo simulations must be provided with detailed specifications demonstrating that the modification does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the existing approved tower or base station.
Waivers. Requests for waivers from any requirement of Section 28.06 shall be made in writing to the General Manager of Utilities.

SMALL CELL ATTACHEMENTS
Chapter 28 - Page 9 KIEL
Unauthorized Attachment Fee: 4x the Permit Application Fee for each unauthorized attachment in the year of discovery.
Public Records. Applications are public records that may be made publicly available pursuant to state and federal public records law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicant may designate portions of the application materials that it reasonably believes contain proprietary or confidential information by clearly marking each portion of such materials accordingly, and the City of Kiel shall endeavor to treat the information as proprietary and confidential, subject to applicable state and federal public records law and the General Manager of Utilities’ determination that the applicant’s request for confidential or proprietary treatment of the application materials is reasonable. The City of Kiel shall not be required to incur any costs to protect the application from disclosure.
28.07 GENERAL STANDARDS. Generally. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in this Chapter and the wireless regulations, in addition to the requirements of any other applicable law or regulation.
Regulations. The wireless regulations and decisions on wireless permits shall, at a minimum, ensure that the requirements of this Chapter are satisfied, unless it is determined that the applicant has established that denial of an application would, within the meaning of federal law, prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of a telecommunications or personal wireless services, or otherwise violate applicable laws or regulations.8 If that determination is made, the requirements of this Chapter and the wireless regulations may be waived, but only to the extent required to avoid the prohibition.
Standards.
Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be installed and modified in a manner that:
Minimizes risks to public safety;
Ensures that placement of facilities on existing structures is within the tolerance of those structures;
Avoids placement of aboveground facilities in underground areas, installation of new support structures or equipment cabinets in the public right-of-way, or placement in residential areas when commercial areas are reasonably available;
Maintains the integrity and character of the neighborhoods and corridors in which the facilities are located;
SMALL CELL ATTACHEMENTS
Chapter 28 - Page 10 KIEL
Ensures that installations are subject to periodic review to minimize the intrusion on the right-of-way;
Ensures that the City of Kiel bears no risk or liability as a result of the installations; and
Ensures that applicant’s use does not inconvenience the public, interfere with the primary uses of the right-of-way, or hinder the ability of the City of Kiel or other government entities to improve, modify, relocate, abandon, or vacate the right-of-way or any portion thereof, or to cause the improvement, modification, relocation, vacation, or abandonment of facilities in the right-of-way.
No wireless permit shall be issued unless (i) the wireless service provider applicant has immediate plans to use the proposed facility or (ii) the wireless infrastructure applicant has a contract with a wireless service provider that has immediate plans to use the proposed facility.
In no event may ground-mounted equipment interfere with pedestrian or vehicular traffic and at all times must comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
Standard Permit Conditions. All wireless permits under this Chapter are issued subject to the following minimum conditions:
Compliance. The permit holder shall at all times maintain compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and other rules.
Term. A wireless permit issued pursuant to an eligible facilities request shall expire at the same time the permit for the underlying existing wireless telecommunications facility expires. All other wireless permits shall be valid for a period of five years from the date of issuance unless revoked pursuant to Section 28.09(1) of this Chapter.
Contact Information. The permit holder shall at all times maintain with the City of Kiel accurate contact information for the permit holder and all wireless service providers making use of the facility, which shall include a phone number, mailing address, and email address for at least one natural person.
Emergencies. The City of Kiel shall have the right to support, repair, disable, or remove any elements of the facilities in emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons or property.
Indemnities. The permit holder, by accepting a permit under this Chapter, agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City of Kiel, its elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, agents, representatives, and volunteers (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all suits, actions, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
SMALL CELL ATTACHEMENTS
Chapter 28 - Page 11 KIEL
liabilities, interest, attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses of whatsoever kind or nature in any manner caused in whole or in part, or claimed to be caused in whole or in part, by reason of any act, omission, fault, or negligence, whether active or passive, of the permit holder or anyone acting under its direction or control or on its behalf, even if liability is also sought to be imposed on one or more of the Indemnified Parties. The obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties shall be applicable even if the liability results from an act or failure to act on the part of one or more of the Indemnified Parties.
