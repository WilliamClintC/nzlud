    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is one specifically assigned by the city. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, that may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of that are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

(3)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in section 1.65. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1) or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.

The rate imposed as set forth in this subsection (b) shall be known as the "PAC Room Tax". Upon full payment and satisfaction of the PAC bonds, the PAC room tax shall ultimately be reallocated toward the development and support of amateur sports facilities within the Fox Cities Tourism Zone and/or other facilities which are reasonably likely to generate paid overnight stays at more than one hotel or motel establishment within the Fox Cities Tourism Zone as more fully set forth in subsection (3) of this section. 
(c)  A room tax in the amount of three percent shall be imposed and allocated toward payment of debt service on the exhibition center bonds in accordance with that exhibition center cooperation agreement dated _________________, 2015 to which the city is a party ("exhibition center room tax"). The exhibition center room tax shall sunset and expire upon full payment and satisfaction of the exhibition center bonds at a date to be determined. Upon full satisfaction of the exhibition center bonds, the room tax shall be reduced by three percent, with such reduction being deemed to be the share of the room tax allocated to the exhibition center room tax. At the time that the exhibition center bonds are fully satisfied, there may be an excess of exhibition center room tax proceeds collected above that amount needed to satisfy the exhibition center bonds. In such an event, those excess funds shall be reallocated to the tourism development fund as that term is referenced and defined in the exhibition center cooperation agreement. 
(d)  A room tax in the amount of one percent ("municipal room tax") shall be retained by the city to be used for general tourism support and development in the Fox Cities Tourism Zone in accordance with the requirements of the Room Tax Act. 
(e)  A room tax in the amount of one percent shall be imposed and allocated toward the support of amateur sports facilities within the Fox Cities Tourism Zone and/or other facilities which are reasonably likely to generate paid overnight stays at more than one hotel or motel establishment within the Fox Cities Tourism Zone ("tourism facilities room tax"). The proceeds of the tourism facilities room tax shall be remitted to CVB to be held and administered under as part of the tourism development fund, as that term is referenced and defined in the exhibition center cooperation agreement. 
(3)  Proceeds of PAC room tax. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, in order to honor existing contractual obligations, the proceeds of the PAC room tax shall continue to be directed to the trustee under the pledge agreement until the PAC bonds have been paid in full. Following full payment and satisfaction of the PAC bonds, the proceeds generated from the PAC room tax for the calendar quarter in which the PAC bonds were fully paid and satisfied shall be directed toward payment of debt service on the exhibition center bonds, capitalized interest payments on the exhibition center bonds or may be deposited into reserve and stabilization funds associated with the issuance of the exhibition center bonds. Commencing on the first day of the next calendar quarter, all proceeds from the PAC room tax shall be directed toward the support of amateur sports facilities within the Fox Cities Tourism Zone and/or other facilities which are reasonably likely to generate paid overnight stays at more than one hotel or motel establishment within the Fox Cities Tourism Zone. 
(4)  Priority of payment. In the event any operator or municipality fails to remit the full amounts owed in any quarterly payment ("deficient payment") under this agreement, the exhibition center cooperation agreement or the ordinances executed as required thereunder, the parties agree and acknowledge that the deficient payment amounts actually received by the commission shall be applied in the following priority order: 
(a)  The deficient payment amounts received shall first be applied toward the three percent room tax imposed for the support of the CVB; and 
(b)  The deficient payment amounts remaining after payment to the CVB as required in subsection (a) above, shall be applied toward the two percent room tax pledged as collateral for payment of the PAC bonds; and 
(c)  The deficient payment amounts remaining after payment toward the PAC bonds as required in subsection (b) above, shall be applied toward the three percent room tax pledged as collateral for payment of the exhibition center bonds; and 
(d)  The deficient payment amounts remaining after payment toward the exhibition center bonds as required in subsection (c) above, shall be applied toward the one percent municipal room tax; and 
(e)  All remaining deficient payment amounts shall be applied toward the one percent tourism facilities room tax. 
(5)  Tourism entity. The CVB shall act as the "tourism entity" as that term is defined in the Room Tax Act, for purposes of providing staff, support services and assistance to the Fox Cities Room Tax Commission in developing and implementing programs to promote the Fox Cities Tourism Zone to visitors, as more fully set forth in an agreement between the Fox Cities Room Tax Commission and the CVB. 
(6)  Collection and administration of room tax. This section shall be administered by the city clerk-treasurer. The tax imposed by this section shall be payable quarterly and shall be due on the last day of the month next succeeding the calendar quarter in which it was imposed. A return shall be filed with the city clerk-treasurer by all operators on or before the same date on which such tax is due and payable. Such return shall show the gross room receipts of the preceding calendar quarter from such retail furnishing of rooms or lodging, the amount of taxes imposed for such period and such other information as the city deems necessary. Every person required to file such quarterly return shall, with his first return, elect to file an annual calendar year or fiscal year return. Such annual return shall be filed within 90 days of the close of each such calendar or fiscal year. The annual return shall summarize the quarterly returns, reconcile and adjust for errors in the quarterly returns, and shall contain certain such additional information as the city requires. Such annual returns shall be signed by the person required to file a return or his duly authorized agent, but need not be verified by oath. The city may, for good cause, extend the time of filing any return, but in no event longer than one month from the filing date. 
(7)  Permit required. Every operator under this section shall file with the city clerk-treasurer an application for a permit for each place of business that is required to collect room tax hereunder.

The application shall be signed by the owner if a sole proprietor and, if not a sole proprietor, by the person authorized to act on behalf of such sellers.

In addition to the schedule of forfeiture set forth in subsection (10) herein, any operator in violation of the terms of this Ordinance by failing to obtain and maintain a permit, when such permit is required, shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed $200.00 for each violation. Each room or unit separately rented or offered for rent, and each day of such rental or offer for rental of such unit shall be a separate violation. In addition, injunctive relief is hereby authorized to discontinue any violation of this section. Any party deemed to have violated any of the provisions of this section shall be obligated to pay the costs of prosecution, in addition to actual attorney fees expended in the course of said enforcement. The city may revoke or suspend any permit issued hereunder for failure to comply with the provisions hereof. 
(9)  Liability for tax on sale or transfer of business. If any operator liable for any amount of tax under this section sells or transfers all or substantially all of its interest in the hotel, motel or other accommodation, its successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient amounts from the purchase price to cover the amount of tax liability until the operator produces a receipt from the city treasurer that its liability has been paid in full or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If a successor subject to the tax imposed by this section fails to withhold such amount from the purchase price as required, it shall become personally liable for payment of the amount required to be withheld by it. 
(10)  Schedule of forfeiture. In addition to paying the room taxes due hereunder, each operator shall be required to forfeit an amount equal to 25 percent of the room tax due from the operator to the city for the previous year or $5,000.00, whichever is less, for a failure to pay the room tax due hereunder. 
(11)  Confidentiality of information. To the extent permitted under the law, the information provided to the city under Wis. Stats. § 66.0615(2) shall remain confidential; provided, however, that the city or any employee thereof may use such information in the discharge of duties imposed by law or of the duties of their office or by order of a court.

(d)  This section shall not apply to commodities sold in compliance with a state or federal law which prescribes another method of sale or to commodities for immediate consumption on the premises where sold. 
(10)  Declaration of quantity . 
(a)  No commodity which is marked, tagged, or labeled, or for which a sign is displayed, with a selling price based upon a price per unit of weight or measure, shall be sold unless the weight or measure of the commodity is conspicuously declared on the commodity or its tag, label, or sign. If a commodity is wrapped or labeled in advance of sale with a price affixed to the commodity or wrapping, the quantity that determines that price shall appear on the package with the price even though the quantity may already appear on a counter card or sign. 
(b)  No commodity shall be wrapped or its container made, formed, or filled so as to mislead the purchaser; nor shall the qualifying term "when packaged," or the terms "jumbo" or "giant" or "full," or words of similar import that tend to mislead the purchaser as to the amount of the commodity, be used in connection with a declaration of quantity. 
(c)  In addition to the other declarations required by this section, any commodity in package form, the package being one of a lot containing random weights, measures or counts of the same commodity and bearing the total selling price of the package, shall bear on the outside of the package a plain and conspicuous declaration of the price per single unit of weight, measure or count. 
(11)  Variations from declared quantity . The magnitude of permitted variations from declared quantity shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  The compliance of commodities sold, either in bulk or in prepackaged form, shall be based upon the results of the application of inspection procedures and tolerances as set forth by the state department of agriculture, trade, and consumer protection.

(12)  Advertising commodities for sale . Whenever a commodity in bulk or packaged form is advertised in any manner and the price of the commodity is stated in the advertisement, there shall be closely and conspicuously associated with such statement of price a declaration of the quantity, of contents offered in the case of packaged commodity, or of the price per unit and the unit based upon in the case of a bulk commodity. 
(a)  When the commodity is in packaged form, the quantity, as it appears on the package, shall likewise appear in the advertisement, provided that where the law or regulation requires a dual declaration, only that declaration setting forth the quantity in terms of the smaller unit of weight or measure (e.g., the declaration that is required to appear first on the package) need appear in the advertisement. 
(b)  Whenever any commodity is advertised as described, the appropriate method of sale as set forth in subsection (9) of this section and in state statutes and rules adopted by reference shall also be applied in the advertisement. 
(c)  There shall not be included as part of the declaration required under this section such qualifying terms as "when packaged," "minimum," "not less than," or any other terms of similar import, nor any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count, for example the terms "jumbo," "giant," "full," and the like, that tend to exaggerate the amount of commodity in the package. 
1.  Generally . Whenever any commodity or service is sold or is offered, exposed, or advertised for sale, by weight, measure or count, the price shall not be misrepresented, nor shall the price be represented in any manner calculated or tending to mislead or deceive an actual or prospective purchaser. Whenever an advertised, posted or labeled price per unit of weight, measure or count includes a fraction of a cent, all elements of the fraction shall be prominently displayed, and the numerals expressing the fraction shall be immediately adjacent to, of the same general design and style as, and at least one-half the height and width of, the numerals representing the whole cents. 
2.  Cash registers and similar devices . Prices generated by a device, such as a cash register or scanning system, are also affected under this section. The sealer shall inspect and test such systems and monitor pricing declarations made by a relative to them, such as pricing signs, shelf tags or individually price-marked units, to ensure agreement of all prices. Prices generated by these systems shall wholly agree with posted or premarked prices for the item being sold. 
a.  Cash registers . Each cash register used in buying and selling transactions shall be maintained in proper operating condition by its owner. All components, attachments and functions of the register shall be operating correctly as designed. All pricing representations shall be accurate. 
b.  UPC, scanning and point of sale systems. Pricing systems utilizing a scanning device such as a handheld gun or wand, or counter-mounted scanner units at retail checkouts which read universal product code systems or other bar code labels and the like, shall be maintained in proper operating conditions and be so calibrated to accurately read the intended systems and then generate the proper description and price for the given code. 
3.  Price refunds; price information . 
a.  A person who uses an electronic scanner to record the price of a commodity or thing at a price higher than the posted, tagged or advertised price of that commodity or thing at least shall refund to a person who purchases the commodity or thing the difference between the posted or advertised price of the commodity or thing and the price charged at the time of sale.

(a)  All coal, coke, and charcoal shall be sold by weight. Unless the fuel is delivered to the purchaser in package form, each delivery of coal, coke, or charcoal to an individual purchaser shall be accompanied by duplicate tickets on which, in ink or other indelible substance, there is clearly stated: 
1.  The name and address of the vendor; 
2.  The name and address of the purchaser; and 
3.  The net weight of the delivery and the gross tare weights, from which the net weight is computed, each expressed in pounds. 
(b)  One of these tickets shall be retained by the vendor and the other shall be delivered to the purchaser at the time of delivery of the fuel, or shall be surrendered on demand to the sealer or a deputy sealer who, if he desires to retain it as evidence, shall issue a weight slip in lieu thereof for delivery to the purchaser. If the purchaser carries away his purchase, the vendor shall be required only to give the purchaser at the time of sale a delivery ticket stating the number of pounds of fuel delivered to him. 
(15)  Fireplace wood and stove wood . 
(a)  As set forth in subsection (9)(c) of this section, firewood, fireplace wood, slab wood, or stove wood shall be sold only by units of a cord or fractions of a cord, by volumetric measure, or by weight. A delivery ticket or invoice shall be presented by the seller to the purchaser whenever any nonpackaged fireplace or stove wood is sold.

(24)  Special fees . Notwithstanding the provision for the requirement of an annual license for weighing and measuring devices, whenever a special request is made for consultation or the inspection or testing of a noncategorized weighing or measuring device, the actual expenses may be charged to the person or firm receiving the service.

Any person to whom such an order is issued shall comply immediately, but, upon written petition to the common council, shall be afforded a hearing before the public protection and safety committee within 20 days of such petition. Failure to allow an inspector immediate access to the premises to determine whether such grounds exist shall be grounds for suspension.

1.  The city finds that the $10,000.00 fee mandated by the laws of the state exceeds the actual cost of licensing the activity, thereby generating additional revenue for the city, and it is in the interest of the public welfare to use the additional revenue to increase the property tax base, provide employment opportunities, attract tourists and generally enhance the economic and cultural climate of the community by providing additional economic incentives for new businesses with liquor licenses.

The city clerk-treasurer shall determine whether the licensee is operating in compliance with the approved license. If the city clerk-treasurer determines that the licensee is so operating, the city clerk-treasurer shall authorize the approval of a $10,000.00 economic development grant. If the city clerk-treasurer determines that the licensee is not in compliance with the approved license, no economic development grant may be authorized, and the city clerk-treasurer shall make such finding in writing and cause to be delivered a copy of the findings to the licensee. If the licensee disagrees with the city clerk-treasurer's determination, the licensee may file a written notice of appeal with the city clerk-treasurer within ten calendar days of the delivery of the written notice of the city clerk-treasurer's findings. Upon receiving such notice from the licensee, the city clerk-treasurer shall relay the notice to the common council which shall hold a hearing through its health and recreation committee.

3.  Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall be installed by the person discharging the waste, at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be in safe condition, accessible, and in proper operating condition at all times. plans for installation of the control manholes or access facilities and related equipment shall be approved by the district approving authority prior to the beginning of construction. 
(e)  Measurement of flow . The volume of flow used for computing industrial waste collection and treatment charges shall be the metered water consumption of the person as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the water utility except as noted in subsections (f) and (g) of this section. 
(f)  Provision of deductions . In the event that a person discharging industrial waste into the sanitary sewers produces evidence satisfactory to the district approving authority that more than 20 percent of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the sanitary sewer, then the determination of the water consumption to be used in computing the waste volume discharged into the sanitary sewer may be made a matter of agreement between the district approving authority and the person. 
(g)  Metering of waste . Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the district approving authority if this volume cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the district approving authority. 
(h)  Waste sampling . 
1.  Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of character and concentration of the wastes. The determination shall be made by the industry as often as may be deemed necessary by the district approving authority. 
2.  Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling may be accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical equipment acceptable to the district approving authority. 
3.  Installation, operation, and maintenance of the sampling facilities shall be the responsibility of the person discharging the waste and shall be subject to the approval of the district approving authority. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the district approving authority or its duly authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to ensure their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was taken. 
(i)  Pretreatment . Where required, in the opinion of the district approving authority, to modify or eliminate wastes that are harmful to the structures, processes, or operation of the wastewater treatment works, the person shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment or processing facilities as may be determined necessary to render his wastes acceptable for admission to the sanitary sewers. 
(j)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors . Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the district approving authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in subsection (2)(c)6.c of this section, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the district approving authority and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In maintaining these interceptors, the owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the district approving authority. Disposal of the collected materials performed by the owner's personnel or currently licensed waste disposal firms must be in accordance with currently acceptable department of natural resources practice. 
(k)  Analyses . 
1.  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this section shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods of Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and with 40 CFR 136, "Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants."

a.  Submission of information. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relative to proposed flow equalization, pretreatment, or processing facilities shall be submitted for review of the district approving authority prior to the start of construction if the effluent from such facilities is to be discharged into the public sewers. 
(4)  Basis for sewer user charges . 
(a)  Sewer users served by water utility water meters . There is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building, or premises having a connection with the wastewater system and being served with water solely by the water utility, a wastewater treatment service charge based, in part, on the quantity of water used, as measured by the water utility water meter used upon the premises. 
(b)  Sewer users served by private wells . If any person discharging sewer into the public sanitary sewer system procures any part or all of his water from sources other than the water utility, all or part of which is discharged into the public sanitary sewer system, the person shall either: 
1.  Have water meters installed by the water utility at his expense for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these sources; or 
2.  Be charged a flat user charge. This flat charge will be determined by computing the average monthly residential user charge. 
The water meters shall be furnished by the water utility and installed under its supervision, all costs being at the expense of the person requiring the meter. The water utility will charge, for each meter, a rental charge set by the water utility to compensate for the cost of furnishing and servicing the meter. Requests for a second meter or metered service must be made in writing to the district. 
(5)  Amount of user charges . 
(a)  Category A. Normal domestic wastewater having concentrations of BOD no greater than 250 mg/l, suspended solids no greater than 300 mg/l, and phosphorus no greater than eight mg/l. The user charge for Category A wastewater is as follows: 
Volume charge: effective January 1, 2016, $6.75 per 100 cubic feet shall be designated for sanitary sewer utility services. 
(b)  Category B . Wastewater having concentrations of BOD greater than 250 mg/l, suspended solids greater than 300 mg/l, or phosphorous greater than 8 mg/l. The minimum category B charge will be based on a concentration of not less than 250 mg/l for BOD, 300 mg/l for suspended solids, and eight mg/l for phosphorus. The user charge for category B wastewater is as follows: 
Volume charge: effective January 1, 2016, $6.75 per 100 cubic feet shall be designated for sanitary sewer utility services. 
Surcharge: 
BOD Greater than 250 mg/l $0.309 per lb Suspended solids Greater than 300 mg/l $0.325 per lb Phosphorus Greater than 8 mg/l $6.577 per lb Ammonia-N Greater than 0 mg/l $0.913 per lb Chlorides Greater than 0 mg/l $0.004 per lb  
The category B user charges for volume, BOD, suspended solids, and phosphorus shall be computed in accordance with the formula below: 
C = F + (V × C V ) + 0.00624V[(B × C B ) + (S × C S ) + (P × C P ) + (A × C A ) + (Cl × C C )] 
Where: 
C Charge to sewer user for collection and treatment of wastewater F Fixed charge per billing period B Concentration of BOD in mg/l in the wastewater (concentration minus 250 mg/l equals B) S Concentration of suspended solids in mg/l in the wastewater (concentration minus 300 mg/l equals S) P Concentration of phosphorus in mg/l of wastewater (concentration minus 8 mg/l equals P) A Concentration of ammonia-N in mg/l of wastewater (concentration minus 0 mg/l equals A Cl Concentration of chlorides in mg/l of wastewater (concentration minus 0 mg/l equals CL V Wastewater volume in 100 cubic feet for the billing period C V Cost per 100 cubic feet C B Cost per pound of BOD C S Cost per pound of suspended solids C P Cost per pound of phosphorus C A Cost per pound of ammonia-N C C Cost per pound of chlorides 0.00624 Conversion factor  
(c)  Reassignment of sewer users . The district approving authority will reassign sewer users into appropriate user charge categories if wastewater sampling programs and other related information indicate a change of categories is necessary. 
(d)  Replacement fund account . The annual replacement revenues shall be maintained in a separate account by the district to be used solely for the purpose of purchasing replacement parts and equipment. Funds may be withdrawn from this account for the authorized use only with the approval of the district approving authority. 
(e)  Disposal of septic tank sludge and holding tank sewage . 
1.  No person in the business of gathering and disposing of septic tank sludge or holding tank sewage shall transfer such material into any disposal area or public sewer unless a permit for disposal has been first obtained from the district approving authority. Written application for the permit shall be made to the district approving authority and shall state the name and address of the applicant, the number of its disposal units and the make, model, and license number of each unit. Permits shall be nontransferable except in the case of replacement of the disposal unit for which a permit shall have been originally issued. The permit may be obtained upon payment of a fee of $25.00 per calendar year. The time and place of disposal will be designated by the district approving authority. 
2.  The district approving authority may impose such conditions as it deems necessary on any permit granted. 
3.  Any person disposing of septic tank sludge or holding tank sewage agrees to carry public liability insurance in an amount not less than $100,000.00 to protect any and all persons or property from injury and damage caused in any way or manner by an act, or the failure to act, by any of his employees. The person shall furnish a certificate certifying such insurance to be in full force and effect. 
4.  All materials disposed of into the treatment system shall be of domestic origin, or compatible pollutants only, and the person so disposing agrees that he will comply with the provisions of any applicable ordinances of the city and shall not deposit or drain any gasoline, oil, acid, alkali, grease, rags, waste, volatile, or inflammable liquids, or other deleterious substances into any manhole, nor allow any earth, sand, or other solid material to pass into any part of the sewerage system. 
5.  Persons with a permit for disposing of septic tank sludge or holding tank sewage into the wastewater collection and treatment facilities shall be charged at the rate established by the district and currently in effect. 
6.  Payments for disposal of septic tank sludge or holding tank sewage shall be made to the district at P.O. Box 187, Kaukauna, Wisconsin. If the material is disposed of into one of the city's sanitary sewers, the district shall credit the city for the full amount of the disposal charge. 
7.  The person disposing waste agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the city and district from any and all liability and claims for damages arising out of or resulting from work and labor performed. 
(f)  Minimum monthly fee . A minimum monthly sewer user fee of $3.00 per month per initial meter or sewer customer shall be charged in addition to the fees as provided in this section. 
(g)  Maximum sewer user fee for the summer months . During the summer months of May through September, the maximum sewer user fee charged to residential customers during any month shall not exceed 120 percent of the average sewer user fee charged to the residence if occupied during the preceding winter months of October through April. If a user is in a new residence which does not have seven previous winter months user fees for averaging purposes, the user's winter average will be based on a citywide average established by the city utilities. 
(6)  Reserved. 
(7)  Billing practice . 
(a)  Calculation of user charges . User charges assessed to city sewer users shall be computed by the city according to the rates and formulas presented in subsection (5) of this section. 
(b)  User charge billing period . User charges shall be billed by the city to the sewer users on a monthly basis. 
(c)  Payment of user charges . Persons billed by the city for user charges shall pay such charges within 20 days after the billing date at the water department. 
(d)  Penalty . Such user charges levied by the city against the sewer users in accordance with this section shall be a debt due the city and shall be a lien upon the property. If this debt is not paid within 20 days after its due date, a three percent penalty shall be added thereto. In addition, the debt shall be deemed delinquent and may be placed on the next year's tax roll and be collected as other taxes are collected. Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found delinquent shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating this penalty. 
(8)  Right of entry, safety, and identification . 
(a)  Right of entry . The district and municipal approving authorities or other duly authorized employees of the district and municipality, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, or testing, all in accordance with the provisions of this section and Wis. Stats. § 200.11. The district and municipal approving authorities, or other duly authorized employees of the district and municipality, shall have no authority to inquire into any process beyond that point having a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewers, waterways, or wastewater treatment facilities. 
(b)  Safety . While performing the necessary work on private premises referred to in subsection (8)(a) of this section, the duly authorized district and municipal employees shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the person, and the district or municipality shall indemnify the person against loss or damage for personal injury or property damage asserted against the person and growing out of gauging and sampling operation, and indemnify the person against loss or damage to its property by district or municipal employees, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the person to maintain safe conditions as required in subsection (3)(d) of this section. 
(c)  Identification, right to enter easements . The district and municipal approving authorities or other duly authorized employees of the district and municipality, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the district or the municipality holds a duly negotiated easement for the purpose of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying within the easement, all subject to the terms, if any, of this duly negotiated easement. 
(9)  Sanitary sewer construction and sanitary sewer reconstruction . 
(a)  Purpose . The city is undertaking the systematic reconstruction of the public sewer system lying within the corporate limits. Metering records taken by the Heart of the Valley Metropolitan Sewage District at the downstream end of the city's system indicate the presence of an abnormal amount of clear water entering into the sanitary sewer system. The presence of this clear water reduces available capacity to all system users and causes system overloads that are manifested in reduced treatment plant capacity, environmental degradation, and the potential for flooded basements, all of which are detrimental to the citizens of the community. The city recognizes that its public sewer system has a finite life, and in many cases has exceeded the useful life of the system. The city also recognizes that private building sewers possess many of the same characteristics as the public sewer system. 
(b)  Work must be authorized . No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb the sanitary sewer appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the building inspector and, if any work will occur in the street right-of-way, a permit from the city engineer as provided in section 8.06(1). 
(c)  Cost of sewer connection . All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the property owner. The property owner, or property owner's representative shall indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may, directly or indirectly, be sustained by the city or third parties by installation of the building sewer. The original installation of the sanitary sewer mains and lateral connections by contractors hired by the city are paid for by special assessment. Reconstruction of sanitary sewer mains is paid by the city. All costs of repairs or reconstruction of private building sewers and of establishment of a new connection to an existing public sewer are the responsibility of the property owner. The property owner shall restore all public property disturbed in the course of work in a manner satisfactory to the city engineer. 
(d)  New construction inspection . No connection with any sewer main or any part thereof shall be covered until the same has been inspected by the plumbing inspector or some other person authorized to make such inspection by the city. Before any such connection shall be covered, the person making the inspection on behalf of the city shall endorse the approval of the same upon the permit. No connection shall be made to any sewer main except through a "Y" branch unless especially authorized by the plumbing inspector. Connections to the sewer mains shall be four inches in diameter unless otherwise permitted or required by the plumbing inspector. 
(e)  Use of old building sewers . In areas which are undergoing sanitary sewer reconstruction, old building sewers are deemed deficient unless otherwise established by qualified testing results provided by the property owner to the plumbing inspector. 
(f)  Building sewer grade . Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(g)  Stormwater and groundwater drain prohibition . 
1.  No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, into any sanitary sewer any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof run-off, subsurface drainage, or uncontaminated cooling waters. All stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof run-off, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, and all other unpolluted drainage and clear water shall be discharged into such sewers as are designated as storm sewers wherever reasonably available; provided, further, that if no storm sewer is available, in no event shall any of such waters be discharged into any sanitary sewer. 
2.  All sump pumps installed for the purpose of discharging clear waters from foundation drains, basement drains and ground infiltration shall discharge into a storm sewer wherever available or, if no storm sewer is available, shall discharge into an underground conduit leading to a drainage ditch, gutter, drywell or onto the ground at a point which is not less than three feet from the building and is above permanent grade. No sump pump discharge to grade shall be allowed to flow on or across a public sidewalk or onto adjoining properties, except within a stormwater easement. 
3.  In carrying out the provisions of this section, the city engineer or the plumbing inspector or his designated representatives shall have authority to enter upon private premises at reasonable times to determine whether any of the water drainage described in this subsection (g) exists thereon and whether such drainage complies with the provisions of this section. In carrying out this authority, the city engineer, plumbing inspector or other authorized department employee shall comply with the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 66.0119, if applicable. 
4.  Presumptive violations. It shall be rebuttably presumed that clear water is being discharged into the sanitary sewer if: 
a.  Existing sump pumps or other means of clear water discharge are, or can be readily connected to drains, pipes, or other mechanisms of discharge which are connected to the sanitary sewer drain serving the premises. 
b.  After due notice and request to the owner for inspection access, as provided in subsection (9)(g)3 of this section, the request is ignored or denied by the property owner. 
5.  Sump pump discharge to grade shall be directed to flow to the backyard in all cases commencing November 15 and continuing until April 15 of each year. 
6.  Where existing drain tile is not in compliance with Wis. Admin. Code § SPS 321.17(e), such tile shall be brought into compliance with the requirements of Wis. Admin. Code § SPS 321.17(e). 
(h)  Conformance to plumbing codes . The connection of the building sewer into the sanitary sewer shall conform to the requirements of the city or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the latest edition of the state plumbing codes. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the plumbing inspector before installation. 
(i)  System reconstruction . 
1.  Inspection required . The city engineer or plumbing inspector shall inspect all private connections to the public mains at the time that the public system is to be reconstructed: 
a.  Any existing private sewer lateral not meeting the requirements of this section shall be considered illegal. 
b.  Prior to the actual reconstruction of the sanitary sewer system, each property owner shall be given written notice of the project. Such notice shall be made not less than 30 days prior to commencement of the actual work. 
c.  As the reconstruction progresses, the city engineer or plumbing inspector shall inspect each private sewer connection for conformance with this section or, in the event inspection has been made previously, determine the condition of the private sewer connection from inspection records. 
d.  In the event that the private system meets the requirements of this section, the city shall reconnect the private system to the public system at an appropriate point near the right-of-way line. 
e.  In the event that the private sewer is found not to meet the requirements of this section, the city engineer or plumbing inspector shall immediately notify the owner, in writing, of the determined deficiencies. 
2.  Owner to correct deficiencies . The owner shall, at the owner's expense, make the necessary repairs to correct the deficiencies. In all cases, the city shall supply an appropriate connection point as part of its work. The owner may elect to: 
a.  Contract with a licensed contractor to complete the repair. All work needed to accomplish the repair shall be done at the expense of the owner. Within 30 days of the giving of notice of deficiency under subsection (9)(i)1.e of this section, proof of arrangements for repair shall be provided to the city engineer or building inspector and within 30 days of the giving of notice the repairs shall be completed. 
b.  Have the city contractors, if available, complete the repair. 
i.  The city may, as part of any project, request unit bid prices for the calculation of the cost of making appropriate repair to the private building sewers. 
ii.  If available, and should the owner select this option, the owner will be charged the entire cost of making the repair. The owner may elect to pay the entire amount upon completion of the work, or the owner may request to be billed in eight annual installments or less plus interest as provided in section 8.03(2)(j). 
(j)  System requirements; new construction and system reconstruction . 
1.  Minimum standards . All sanitary sewer mains and laterals, both public and private, shall be constructed and maintained in such a fashion that the effects of clear water on the system are held to an absolute minimum. 
2.  Code compliance . All work, construction techniques, and materials incorporated into the project shall be in strict conformance with state and local codes and the "Standard Specifications for Sewer and Water Construction in Wisconsin," (current edition). 
3.  Defects requiring repair . Repairs to sanitary sewer laterals are required when any of the following are discovered: 
a.  Any visible leak. 
b.  Open, improperly formed, or root-intruded joints. 
c.  Use of improper materials, such as clay, transite, Orangeburg pipe or similar materials. 
d.  Improper connections, such as a palmer valve. 
(k)  Required clear water inspections of residential properties . 
1.  No person shall sell, transfer or convey ownership of any one- or two-family residential building that is serviced by sanitary sewer until such time as a clear water inspection has been made and compliance approved by the building inspection department as provided in this section. Changing ownership or accepting change of ownership without such an inspection shall constitute a violation of this section and shall be subject to penalties as set forth in section 13.10. Transfers exempt from payment of a state real estate transfer fee by Wis. Stats. § 77.25 are exempt from this inspection. 
2.  The building inspection department shall, upon request, conduct an inspection of the premises to determine compliance with the provisions of this section as they relate to illegal surface water and groundwater connections into the sanitary sewer system. Such inspections shall occur prior to the sale, transfer or conveyance of title of any such building. 
3.  A notice of noncompliance shall be issued by the building inspection department to the owner of record of any residential building to be found not in compliance with the provisions of this section. This notice shall set forth areas of noncompliance and shall order the owner to bring the building into compliance within an established period of time. 
4.  In order to avoid delay or prevent sale of a property affected by this section, a buyer or transferee may file with the building inspection department evidence of a contract or accepted bid for work which, when completed, will bring the property into compliance with this section, along with evidence that adequate funds have been escrowed to complete the work. Compliance shall be met within the time limits set forth in subsection (9)k.3 of this section. Also, a stipulation signed by the buyer or transferee shall be filed agreeing to bring the property into compliance with this section within the applicable time limits. The evidence and stipulation may only be filed after the inspection provided in subsection (9)k.2 of this section, is made. Failure by the buyer or transferee to bring the property into compliance within the applicable compliance period shall constitute a violation of this section and shall subject the buyer or transferee to the penalties as set forth in section 13.10. 
5.  An inspection finding compliance only indicates that, so far as can be reasonably determined by visual inspection of the premises and review of city records, the premises meets the requirements of this section. Neither the city nor its inspectors assume any liability in the inspection findings, whether compliant or not, and there is no guarantee or warranty of the condition of the premises inspected. 
6.  The city will not be liable for any unsafe or unsanitary condition that may exist in any building that is being inspected for clear water compliance. However, if such conditions exist and are noticed by an inspector, orders to correct such conditions may be issued pursuant to applicable chapters of this Code. 
(10)  Violations, abatement procedures, and penalties . 
(a)  Violations . Violation of any provision of this section or any other rule or order lawfully promulgated by the city council shall be deemed a public nuisance. 
(b)  Enforcement . The municipal approving authority shall enforce those provisions of this section that come within the jurisdiction of his office, and he shall make periodic inspections and inspections upon complaint to ensure that such provisions are not violated. No action shall be taken under this section to abate a public nuisance unless the municipal approving authority shall have inspected or caused to be inspected the premises where the nuisance is alleged to exist and shall have satisfied himself that a nuisance does in fact exist. 
(c)  Summary abatement . If the municipal approving authority determines that a public nuisance exists within the city and that there is great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals, or decency, the municipal approving authority may cause the same to be abated and charge the cost thereof to the owner, occupant, or person causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance, as the case may be. 
(d)  Abatement after notice . If the municipal approving authority determines that a public nuisance exists on private premises but that the nature of such nuisance is not such as to threaten great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals, or decency, he shall serve notice on the person causing or maintaining the nuisance to remove the same within ten days. If such nuisance is not removed within ten days, the proper officer shall cause the nuisances to be removed as provided in subsection (10)(c) of this section. 
(dm)  Violation service charge . As an alternative to any other methods provided for obtaining compliance with the requirements of this Code regarding repair of deficient laterals, preventing the inflow of clear water into the sanitary sewer system or connecting to available storm sewer laterals, the city engineer may, no sooner than 30 days after the giving of notice as provided in subsection (9)(i)1.e of this section, notify the city finance department to bill, or arrange for billing of, the owner of the property in noncompliance a service charge of $50.00 per month, pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0821. 
(e)  Other methods not excluded . Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the abatement of public nuisances by the city or its official in accordance with the laws of the state. 
(f)  Court order . Except when necessary under subsection (10)(c) of this section, the municipal approving authority shall not use force to obtain access to private property to abate a public nuisance, but shall request permission to enter upon private property if such premises are occupied and, if such permission is denied, shall apply to any court having jurisdiction for an order assisting the abatement of the public nuisance. 
(g)  Cost of abatement . In addition to any other penalty imposed by this section for the erection, contrivance, creation, continuance, or maintenance of a public nuisance, the cost of abating a public nuisance by the city shall be collected as a debt from the owner, occupant, or person causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance, and such cost shall be assessed against the real estate as a special charge. 
(h)  Continued violations . Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the notice time limit provided shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not more than $200.00 together with the costs of prosecution. In default of payment of such forfeiture and costs, the violator shall be imprisoned in the county jail for a period not to exceed 30 days. Each day in which any violation is continued beyond the notice time limit shall be deemed a separate offense.

Sec. 13.06. - Cross connection control and backflow prevention. 
(1)  Definitions . The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Backflow means the undesirable flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases or other substances under positive or reduced pressure into the city utility ("utility") water distribution pipes of the potable supply of water from any source. 
    Backflow preventer means a device or a means designed to prevent backflow caused by backpressure or back-siphonage. These devices are most commonly categorized as air gap, reduced pressure principle backflow preventer, double check valve assembly, pressure vacuum breaker, atmospheric vacuum breaker, hose connection vacuum breaker, hose connection backflow preventer, backflow preventer with intermediate atmospheric vent, and barometric loop. 
    Backpressure means an elevation of pressure in the downstream piping system (i.e., pump, elevation of piping, or steam or air pressure) above the utility supply pressure, which would cause, or tend to cause, a reversal of the normal direction of flow. 
    Back-siphonage means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of the utility's potable water supply system from any source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the utility potable water supply system. 
    Cross-connection means any physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the utility, and the other containing water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two systems. 
(2)  Cross-connections prohibited . No person shall establish, or permit to be established, or maintain or, permit to be maintained, any cross-connection. No interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the public water supply of the utility may enter the supply or distribution system of the utility, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the utility and by the state department of natural resources. 
(3)  Inspections . It shall be the duty of the utility to cause inspections to be made of all properties serviced by the utility where cross-connection with the public water system is deemed possible. Residential properties serviced by the utility shall be inspected on a ten-year interval. All nonresidential properties serviced by the utility shall be inspected on a two-year interval. The utility may, but is not required to, perform the cross-connection inspection of the owner's property. If, in the opinion of the utility, the utility is not able to perform the inspection, the property owner must, at their own expense, have the plumbing inspected for cross-connections by a state certified cross-connection inspector/surveyor or by a state licensed plumber. The frequency of required inspections and reinspections, based on potential health hazards involved, may be shortened by the utility. The utility shall charge fees as approved by the state public service commission for on-premises follow-up visits by utility personnel for reinspection due to customer noncompliance and for after-hours inspections or reinspections. 
(4)  Right of entry . Upon presentation of credentials, representatives of the utility shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any property served by a connection to the public water system of the utility for cross-connections. If entry is refused, such representatives shall obtain a special inspection warrant under Wis. Stats. § 66.0119. Upon request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system on such property. 
(5)  Authority to discontinue service . The utility is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this section exists, or whose owner, lessee, or occupant has failed to allow an inspection for cross-connections, and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be discontinued if the means of backflow prevention required by the utility is not installed, tested, maintained and repaired in compliance with this section and Wis. Admin. Code § NR 810.15 or if it is found that the means of backflow prevention required by this section has been removed or bypassed. Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing before the city utility commission, except as provided in subsection (7) of this section. 
(6)  Reconnection of service . Water service to any property discontinued under the provisions of this section shall not be restored until the cross-connection has been eliminated or a backflow prevention device approved by the utility has been installed in compliance with the provisions of this section. The utility shall charge fees as approved by the state public service commission for the reconnection of the water service. 
(7)  Emergency discontinuance of service . If it is determined by the utility that a cross-connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate action, service may be immediately discontinued. The owner, lessee or occupant shall have an opportunity for hearing within ten days of such emergency discontinuance. Such hearing shall be before the city utility commission and shall conform to all existing due process requirements. 
(8)  Owner responsibility . The property owner shall be responsible for the elimination of or protection from all cross-connections on their premises. The owner shall, at their expense, have installed, maintained, and tested any and all backflow preventers on their premises in compliance with Wis. Admin. Code §§ NR 810.15 and SPS 382. The property owner shall have corrected any malfunction, revealed by periodic testing, of any backflow preventers on their premises. The property owner shall inform the utility of any proposed or modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections which are not protected by an approved backflow prevention device. The property owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Property owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the backflow prevention devices must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place. In the event the property owner installs plumbing upstream of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own approved backflow preventer. 
(9)  Additional protection . In the case of premises having internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled; or intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line. In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a manner that, in the opinion of the utility, could create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow preventer. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, hospitals, mortuaries, plating plants, and car wash establishments. In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the utility, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of toxic substances, the utility may require an approved air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the utility. 
(10)  Wisconsin Administrative Code . Wis. Admin. Code ch. Comm. 82, is hereby adopted, except any penalty provisions therein. Wis. Admin. Code § NR 810.15 is hereby adopted. 
(11)  Plumbing codes. This section does not supersede the state plumbing code, Wis. Admin. Code chs. SPS 381 through 387 or section 14.15 of this Code, but is supplementary to them. 
(12)  Recommended practice . The property owner will be required to follow the recommended protection practices described in the American Water Works Association publication #AWWA M14 titled "Recommended Practice for Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control," unless the utility requires or authorizes other means of protecting the public water system. These requirements or authorizations will be at the discretion of the utility.

(Code 2011, § 15.03; Ord. No. 1746, 8-16-2016) 
Sec. 15.04. - Historic structure, historic site, and historic district designation criteria. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, a historic structure, historic site, or historic district designation may be placed on any site, natural or improved, including any building, improvement, or structure located thereon, or any area of particular historic, architectural, archeological, or cultural significance to the city, such as historic structures, sites, or districts which: 
(a)  Exemplify or reflect the broad cultural, political, economic, or social history of the nation, state, or community; 
(b)  Are identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state, or local history; or 
(c)  Embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or specimen inherently valuable for a study of a period, style, method of construction, or of indigenous materials or craftsmanship. 
(2)  The commission may adopt specific operating guidelines, subject to council ratification, for historic structure, historic site, and historic district designation, provided such are in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 2011, § 15.04) 
Sec. 15.05. - Powers and duties. 
(1)  Designation . The commission shall have the power, subject to section 15.06, to recommend designation of historic structures and historic sites and to recommend designation of historic districts within the city. Such designations shall be made based on section 15.04. Historic districts, sites, and structures shall be approved by the common council. Once designated, such historic structures, sites, and districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Regulation of construction, reconstruction, alteration, and demolition . 
(a)  No owner or person in charge of a historic structure, historic site, or structure within a historic district shall reconstruct, alter, or demolish all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property or demolish such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the historic preservation commission. Also, unless such certificate has been granted by the commission, the building inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work. 
(b)  Upon filing of any application for a certificate of appropriateness with the commission, the commission shall approve the application unless: 
1.  In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy, or adversely affect any exterior feature of the improvement or site upon which the work is to be done. 
2.  In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon a historic site, or within a historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or with the district. 
3.  In the case of any property located in a historic district, the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration, or demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this preservation ordinance and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for the district. 
4.  The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the city and state. 
(c)  If the commission determines that the application for a certificate of appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with the character and features of the property or district, it shall issue the certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall make this decision within 30 days of the filing of the application. If no action is taken within 30 days of the submittal of the application, the application is considered approved. 
(d)  The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by the city. A building permit or other city permit shall be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the certificate of appropriateness required for the proposed work. 
(e)  Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a certificate of appropriateness, provided that the work involves repairs to existing features of a historic structure or site or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and does not require the issuance of a building permit. 
(3)  Appeals . Should the commission deny a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the common council within 30 days. In addition, if the commission fails to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall, with the cooperation of the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of appropriateness within the guidelines of this chapter. 
(4)  Recognition of historic structures, sites, and districts . At such time as a historic structure, site, or district has been properly designated, the commission, in cooperation with the property owner, may cause a suitable plaque to be placed declaring that such property is a historic structure, site, or district. 
(Code 2011, § 15.05) 
Sec. 15.06. - Procedures. 
(1)  Designation of historic structures and historic sites . 
(a)  The commission may, after receipt of an application submitted by the owner of property or with approval of an owner of property, and after public hearing, recommend the designation of historic structures and historic sites, or recommend the rescission of such designation or recommendation, after application of the criteria in section 15.04. At least ten days prior to such hearing, the commission shall notify the owners of record, as listed in the office of the city assessor, who are owners of the property in whole or in part situated within 200 feet of the boundaries of the property affected. Notice of such hearing shall also be published as a class I notice under state law. 
(b)  The commission shall then conduct such public hearing and, in addition to the notified persons, may hear expert witnesses, and shall have the power to subpoena such witnesses and records as it deems necessary. The commission may conduct an independent investigation into the proposed designation or rescission. Within ten days after the close of the public hearing, the commission may recommend the designation of the property as either a historic structure or historic site or rescind the designation. After the recommendation has been made, notification shall be sent to the property owner. Notification shall also be given to the city clerk-treasurer, building inspector, plan commission, and city assessor. The commission shall forward the recommendation to the city council for ratification. Upon ratification, the owner shall record the certification in the county register of deeds office. 
(2)  Designation of historic district . 
(a)  For preservation purposes, the historic preservation commission may select geographically defined areas within the city to be designated as historic districts and shall then prepare a historic preservation plan for each area. A historic district may be designated for any geographic area of particular historic, architectural, or cultural significance to the city, after application of the criteria in section 15.04. Each historic preservation plan prepared for or by the historic preservation commission shall include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guideline for development, and a statement of preservation objectives. 
(b)  Review and adoption procedure. 
1.  The historic preservation commission shall hold a public hearing when considering the plan for a historic district. Notice of the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing shall be sent by the city clerk-treasurer and to the councilmembers of the city in which the historic district is located and the owners of record, as listed in the office of the city assessor, who are owners of the property within the proposed historic district or are situated in whole or in part within 200 feet of the boundaries of the proposed historic district. The notice is to be sent at least ten days prior to the date of the public hearing. Following the public hearing, the historic preservation commission shall vote to recommend, reject, or withhold action on the plan. Such recommendation shall be forwarded to the common council. 
2.  The common council, upon receipt of the recommendations from the historic preservation commission, shall hold a public hearing, notice to be given as noted in subsection (2)(b)1 of this section and shall, following the public hearing, either designate or reject the historic district. Designation of the historic district shall constitute adoption of the plan prepared for that district and direct the implementation of the plan. 
(Code 2011, § 15.06) 
Sec. 15.07. - Interim control. 
    No building permit shall be issued by the building inspector for alteration, construction, demolition, or removal of a nominated historic structure, historic site, or any property or structure within a nominated historic district from the date of the meeting of the historic preservation commission at which a nomination form is first presented until the final disposition of the nomination by the historic preservation commission or the city council, unless such alteration, removal, or demolition is authorized by formal resolution of the city council as necessary for the public health, welfare, or safety. In no event shall the delay be for more than 180 days. 
(Code 2011, § 15.07) 
Sec. 15.08. - Penalties for violations. 
    Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be fined $50.00 for each separate violation. Each and every day during which a violation continues shall be deemed to be a separate offense. Notice of violations shall be issued by the building inspector, zoning administrator, or their designees.

Chapter 16 - SHORELAND AND WETLANDS ZONING 

Sec. 16.01. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, and statement of purpose. 
(1)  Statutory authorization . This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23, 62.231 and 281.31. 
(2)  Findings of fact and purpose . Uncontrolled use of the shoreland and wetlands and the pollution of the navigable waters of the city would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The state legislature has delegated responsibility to all cities to: 
(a)  Promote the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare. 
(b)  Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands. 
(c)  Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters. 
(d)  Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life, and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat. 
(e)  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area. 
(f)  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling, and other earth-moving activities. 
(Code 2011, § 16.01) 
Sec. 16.02. - General provisions. 
(1)  Compliance . The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the city shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state, or federal regulations. See section 16.08 for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses. All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter. 
(2)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated . Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and repair of state highways and bridges by the department of transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.12(4)(a) applies. 
(3)  Abrogation and greater restrictions . 
(a)  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any city zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. § 62.23 which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another city ordinance is more restrictive, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b)  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants, or easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(4)  Interpretation . In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state law. Where a provision of this chapter is required by a standard in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117, and where the provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of or most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(5)  Severability . Should any portion of this chapter be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. 
(6)  Annexed areas . The county shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effect administered by the city for all areas annexed by the city after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands are described on the city's official zoning map. The county shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the city zoning administrator. 
(Code 2011, § 16.02) 
Sec. 16.03. - Definitions. 
(1)  For the purpose of administering and enforcing this chapter, all distances, unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally.

    Accessory structure or use means a detached subordinate structure or a use which is clearly incidental to, and customarily found in connection with, the principal structure or use to which it is related and which is located on the same lot as that of the principal structure or use. 
    Boathouse , as defined in Wis. Stats. § 30.121(1), means a permanent structure used for the storage of watercraft and associated materials which has one or more walls or sides. 
    Class 2 public notice means publication of a public hearing notice under Wis. Stats. ch. 985 in a newspaper of circulation in the affected area. Publication is required on two consecutive weeks, the last at least seven days prior to the hearing. 
    Department means department of natural resources. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to: 
(a)  The construction of buildings, structures, or accessory structures; 
(b)  The construction of additions or substantial alterations to buildings, structures, or accessory structures; 
(c)  The placement of buildings or structures;

    Fixed houseboat , as defined in Wis. Stats. § 30.121(1), means a structure not actually used for navigation which extends beyond the ordinary high watermark of a navigable waterway and is retained in place either by cables to the shoreline or by anchors or spudpoles attached to the bed of the waterway. 
    Navigable waters . The term "navigable waters" means and includes: 
(a)  Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland lakes within this state, and all streams, ponds, sloughs, flowages, and other waters within the territorial limits of this state, including the state portion of boundary waters which are navigable under the laws of this state. Under Wis. Stats. § 281.31, notwithstanding any other provision of law or administrative rule promulgated hereunder, shoreland ordinances required under Wis. Stats. § 62.231 and Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117 do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if: 
1.  Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or river. 
2.  Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams before ditching. 
3.  Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use. 
(b)  The state supreme court has declared navigable bodies of water that have a bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow sufficient to support navigation by a recreation craft of the shallowest draft on an annually recurring basis (Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952) and Degaynor and Co., Inc. v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975)).

    Planning agency means the city plan commission created under Wis. Stats. § 62.23(1), a board of public land commissioners, or a committee of the city council which acts on matters pertaining to planning and zoning. 
    Shoreland means lands within the following distances from the ordinary high watermark of navigable waters: 
(a)  1,000 feet from a lake, pond, or flowage; and 
(b)  300 feet from a river or stream or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. 
    Shoreland-wetland district means the zoning district created as a part of this chapter, comprised of shorelands that are designated as wetlands on the wetland inventory maps which have been adopted and made a part of this chapter. 
    Unnecessary hardship means circumstances where special conditions which were not self-created affect a particular property and make strict conformity with restrictions governing area, setback, frontage, height, or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this chapter. 
    Variance means an authorization granted by the board of appeals to construct or alter a building or structure in a manner that deviates from the dimensional standards of this chapter. 
    Wetland alteration means any filling, flooding, draining, dredging, ditching, tiling, excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures, or dike and dam construction in a wetland area. 
    Wetlands means those areas where water is at, near, or above the land surface long enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which have soils indicative of wet conditions.

(Code 2011, § 16.04) 
Sec. 16.05. - District boundaries. 
(1)  The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the city, which are five acres or more and are shown on the final wetland inventory map that has been adopted and made a part of this chapter and which are: 
(a)  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high watermark of navigable lakes, ponds, or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the city shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the federal geological survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. 
(b)  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high watermark of navigable rivers or streams or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States geological survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Floodplain zoning maps adopted in section 16.04(2) shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas. 
(2)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high watermark location shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high watermark. 
(3)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary, as mapped, is in error. If department staff concur with the zoning administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands designated in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the zoning administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period. 
(4)  Wetlands which are filled prior to September 2, 1987, the date on which the city received final wetland inventory maps, in a manner which affects their wetland characteristics to the extent that the area can no longer be defined as wetland, are not subject to this chapter. 
(5)  Wetlands located between the original ordinary high watermark and bulkhead line established prior to May 7, 1982, under Wis. Stats. § 30.11, are not subject to this chapter.

9.  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(d)  Title. This section shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for Kaukauna, Wisconsin. 
(e)  General provisions. 
1.  Areas to be regulated. This section regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
2.  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see subsection (8) of this section) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the city engineer, City of Kaukauna. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
a.  Official maps: Based on the FIS: 
i.  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM), panel number (55087c0334d, 55087c0341d, 55087c0342d, 55087c0343d, 55087c0344d, 55087c0353d, 55087c0361d, 55087c0363d, 55087c0456d, 55087c0460 and 55087c0500d), dated (July 22, 2010); with corresponding profiles that are based on the flood insurance study (FIS) dated (January 20, 2016, 55087CV000B); 
Approved by: The DNR and FEMA 
3.  Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
a.  The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE zones as shown on the FIRM. 
b.  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM. 
c.  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
4.  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subesections (1)(e)4.a and b below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to subsection (8) of this section. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection (7)(c)3 and the criteria in subesections (1)(e)4.a and b below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to subsection (8) of this section. 
a.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
b.  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
5.  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to subsection (8) of this section. 
6.  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
7.  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13), applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022, applies. 
8.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
a.  This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; Wis. Stats. § 61.35 for villages; or Wis. Stats. § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
b.  This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. 
9.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by Wis. Adm. Code ch. NR 116, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance. 
10.  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This section does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This section does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this section. 
11.  Severability. Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected. 
12.  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Outagamie County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Wis. Adm. Code ch. NR 116 and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location. 
(2)  General standards applicable to all floodplain districts. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding. 
Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this ordinance and all other requirements in subsection (7)(a)2. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages. 
(a)  Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses. 
1.  No floodplain development shall: 
a.  Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height; or 
b.  Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost. 
2.  The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of subsection (8) of this section are met. 
(b)  Watercourse alterations. No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the department and FEMA regional offices, and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The standards of subsection (2)(a) must be met and the flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation and pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, the community shall apply for a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA.

    Obstruction to flow. Any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development alone or together with any future development will cause an increase in regional flood height. 
    Official floodplain zoning map. That map, adopted and made part of this ordinance, as described in subsection (1)(e)2 of this section, which has been approved by the department and FEMA. 
    Open space use. Those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures. 
    Ordinary highwater mark. The point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic. 
    Person. An individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, municipality or state agency. 
    Private sewage system. A sewage treatment and disposal system serving one structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure.

    Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure. Any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.

    Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Unnecessary hardship. Where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance.

Sec. 17.11. - Nonconformities. 
(1)  Applicability and intent . Any use of land or structures, or any lot or structure which existed at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter which would not be permitted or permissible by the provisions of this chapter as adopted or amended, shall be deemed nonconforming. It is the intent of this chapter to permit such nonconformities to continue, subject to certain restrictions. 
(2)  Nonconforming uses of land or land with minor structures only. Where, at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, a use of land exists which would not be permitted or permissible in the district in which it is located, and where such use involves a structure with a replacement value of less than $10,000.00, such use may be continued subject to the following restrictions: 
(a)  Such use shall not be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of the lot than was occupied at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(b)  Such use shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to any other portion of the lot other than the portion occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(c)  When such use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of more than 12 consecutive months for any reason whatever, or when such use is replaced by a permitted or permissible use, a nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
(d)  No additional structure in connection with such use shall be erected. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses of structures . Where, at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the use of a structure exists which would not be permitted or permissible in the district in which it is located, and where such use involves a structure with a replacement value exceeding $10,000.00, such use may be continued subject to the following restrictions: 
(a)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted or permissible shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted or permissible in the district in which it is located. 
(b)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. Any nonconforming use which occupied a portion of a building not originally designed or intended for such use shall not be extended to any other part of the building. No nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building, nor any other building not used for such nonconforming use. 
(c)  There may be a change in tenancy, ownership, or management of a nonconforming use, provided that there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming use. 
(d)  When such use of a structure is discontinued or abandoned for a period of more than 12 consecutive months for any reason whatever, or when such use is replaced by a permitted or permissible use, a nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
(e)  If a structure occupied by a nonconforming use is removed or destroyed, or damaged to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
(4)  Nonconforming structures . Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, a structure exists which could not be erected in the district in which it is located by reason of restriction on lot area or coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may continue in existence subject to the following restrictions: 
(a)  Such structure shall not be altered in any manner which would increase the degree of nonconformity. The total structural repairs or alterations in such nonconforming structure shall not, during its life, exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of the structure. 
(b)  If such structure is destroyed or damaged to an extent of less than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it may be reconstructed, provided that reconstruction shall substantially reflect the prior structural arrangement and shall not increase the degree of nonconformity. If such structure is destroyed or damaged to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of the district in which it is located. 
(5)  Nonconforming characteristics of use . If characteristics of use such as lighting, parking, noise, or other matters pertaining to the use of land, structures, and premises are made nonconforming by the provisions of this chapter as adopted or amended, no change shall be made in such characteristics of use which increases the nonconformity; provided, however, that changes may be made which do not increase, or which decrease, such nonconformity. 
(6)  Nonconforming lots of record . 
(a)  In any district, any permitted or permissible structure may be erected on a single lot of record at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements of lot area, lot width, or both for the district in which it is located, provided such lot shall be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership, and provided all other requirements for the district are met. 
(b)  If two or more lots, or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the lands involved shall be considered to be an individual parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of such parcel shall be used, divided, or sold which does not meet the lot area and lot width requirements for the district in which it is located. 
(7)  Nonconforming signs . 
(a)  No nonconforming signs shall be altered in any manner which would increase the degree of nonconformity. A legal nonconforming sign shall lose this designation if the sign is relocated or replaced or the structure or size of the sign is altered in any way, except for change of copy or normal maintenance, except towards compliance with this chapter. The legal nonconforming sign is subject to all requirements of this chapter regarding safety, maintenance, and repair. If such a sign is destroyed or damaged to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, such sign shall be replaced as a conforming sign. If a nonconforming sign is destroyed or damaged to an extent of less than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it may be reconstructed, provided that any reconstruction does not increase the degree of nonconformity which previously existed. 
(b)  In the commercial core district, any nonconforming sign, the original cost of which was less than $2,500.00, shall be removed or altered to comply with the provisions of that district within two years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. Signs that originally cost from $2,500.00 to $5,000.00 shall be removed or altered to comply with the provisions of that district within three years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. Signs that originally cost more than $5,000.00 shall be removed or altered to comply with the provisions of that district within five years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(8)  Casual, temporary, or illegal use . The casual, temporary, or illegal use of land or structures, or land structures in combination, shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use or to create rights in the continuance of such use. 
(9)  Repairs and maintenance . Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance or repair of any structure, or to prevent restoring to a safe condition any structure declared to be unsafe. 
(10)  Existing special exceptions . Any use or structure existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived which is classified as a special exception in the district in which it is located shall be deemed to have been granted approval, subject to maintaining the character and extent of such use or structure existing on that date. Any extension, enlargement, or change in such use or structure shall require approval subject to section 17.47. 
(11)  Additional provisions for floodplain districts . In addition to the provisions of this section, the following requirements shall apply to floodplain districts: 
(a)  Floodway districts . No modification or addition shall be allowed to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use in a floodway, unless the following criteria are met:

Determinations necessary for the administration and enforcement of this section range from those which can be made by a reasonable person using normal senses and no mechanical equipment, to those requiring substantial technical competence and complex equipment. It is the intent of this chapter that the methods to be used in determining compliance shall be the responsibility of the building inspector subject to the following procedures: 
(a)  Approval of building permits . Prior to approving a zoning permit for any industrial use or change thereof, the building inspector shall have received from the applicant evidence or assurance that the proposed use or changing use will satisfy the air quality, noise, vibration, and exterior lighting standards of this section. 
(b)  Violation of standards . Whenever the building inspector has reason to believe the air quality, noise, vibration, and exterior lighting standards of this section have been violated, he shall give written notice by certified mail to the person responsible for the alleged violation. Such notice shall describe the alleged violation and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation within 30 days. Failure to reply or correct the alleged violation within 30 days may cause the city to take lawful action to cause correction as provided in this chapter or to refer the alleged violation to the state department of natural resources.

(3)  General standards applicable to all floodplain districts . 
(a)  No development, except as provided in subsection (3)(b) of this section, shall be allowed in floodplain areas which will cause an obstruction to flow, will cause an increase equal to or greater than 0.01 foot in the height of the regional flood or will adversely affect existing drainage courses or facilities. 
(b)  Obstructions or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may be permitted, but only if amendments are made to this chapter, the official floodplain zoning maps, including floodway lines, and water surface profiles in accordance with section 17.51, and only if the total cumulative effect of the proposed development will not increase the height of the regional flood more than one foot for the affected hydraulic reach of the stream. 
(c)  The building inspector shall deny permits when it is determined the proposed development will cause an obstruction to flow or increase in regional flood height of 0.01 foot or greater. 
(4)  Special provisions for floodfringe areas . No developments in floodfringe areas shall materially affect the storage capacity of floodplains, based upon an equal degree of hydrologic encroachment (volume of the storage area which is lost). For the purpose of this subsection, the term "materially" is defined as any surface profile of 0.1 feet. Such developments may be permitted only if amendments are made to this chapter pursuant to section 17.51; provided, further, that the total cumulative allowable increase in height of the regional flood for any given reach of a stream shall not exceed one foot. 
(5)  Procedures for determining floodway and floodfringe areas in the general floodplain district . When any developments are proposed within the general floodplain district, a determination shall be made to establish the boundaries of the floodway and determine whether floodway or floodfringe uses apply and, where applicable, to determine the regional flood elevation. Upon receiving an application for development, the building inspector shall: 
(a)  Require the applicant to submit, at the time of application, two copies of an aerial photograph, or a plan which accurately locates the floodplain proposal with respect to the floodplain district limits, channel of stream, existing floodplain developments, together with all pertinent information such as the nature of the proposal, legal description of the property, fill limits and elevations, building floor elevations, and floodproofing measures. 
(b)  Require the applicant to furnish any of the following additional information as is deemed necessary by the department of natural resources for evaluation of the effects of the proposal upon flood flows and to determine the boundaries of the floodway and, where applicable, the regional flood elevation. 
1.  A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the stream, the floodplain adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional area to be occupied by the proposed development and high-water information. 
2.  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, location, and elevations of streets, water supply, sanitary facilities, soil types, and other pertinent information. 
3.  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream. 
4.  Specifications for building construction and materials, floodproofing, filling, dredging, channel improvement, storage of materials, water supply, and sanitary facilities. 
(c)  Transmit one copy of the information described above to the department of natural resources along with a written request to have that agency provide technical assistance to establish floodway boundaries and, where applicable, provide regional flood elevation. 
(6)  Floodproofing . Floodproofing measures, such as the following, shall be designed to withstand the flood velocities, forces, and other factors associated with the regional flood to ensure protection to the flood protection elevation. No permit or variance shall be issued until the applicant submits a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures are adequately designed to protect the flood protection elevation for the particular area. All floodproofing shall provide anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement. Other floodproofing measures may include: 
(a)  Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, and shutters. 
(b)  Reinforcement of walls and floors to resist pressures. 
(c)  Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of water through walls. 
(d)  The above floodproofing measures shall ensure that structural walls and floors are watertight to the flood protection elevation and completely dry during flooding without human intervention, pursuant to this subsection. 
(7)  Compliance . Compliance with the provisions of this section shall not be grounds for removal of lands from the floodplain district unless such lands are filled to a height of at least two feet above the elevation of the regional flood for the particular area and are contiguous to other lands lying outside the floodplain district, approval has been granted by the department of natural resources pursuant to section 17.47 and, where required, an official letter of map amendment has been issued by the Federal Insurance Administration. 
(8)  Warning and disclaimer of liability . The degree of flood protection intended to be provided by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain district boundaries or land uses permitted within such district will always be totally free from flooding or flood damage, nor shall this chapter create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the city, or any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.

All matters relating to city council consideration of a request for a special exception and city plan commission recommendation shall be a public record and require formal action of the city council. 
(7)  Fees . Any application for a special exception shall be accompanied by a fee of $25.00 to compensate the city for publication of notices and other expenses. No action shall be taken until such fee has been paid. 
(Code 2011, § 17.47) 
Sec. 17.48. - Certificate of appropriateness. 
(1)  Findings . The city council hereby finds that an economically strong commercial core serving as the focus of commercial and cultural activity of the city will promote the general welfare; that to establish and maintain an economically strong commercial core it is necessary for physical development to be highly concentrated, coordinated, and aesthetically attractive and distinctive; and that dissimilar, uncoordinated, or otherwise inappropriate physical development will adversely affect the economy, have a detrimental effect on property values, discourage private investment, adversely affect public investments and cause the loss of distinctive and unique characteristics of the area. 
(2)  Applicability . No structure, except signs exempt from the provisions of this chapter, and no building shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged, or exterior architectural feature altered in the commercial core district until a certificate of appropriateness has been obtained from the redevelopment authority. A certificate of appropriateness shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, a building permit. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for interior alterations or design features not subject to any public view or ordinary repairs and maintenance to the exterior of any structure or building where the purpose of such work is to correct any decay or damage and to restore, as nearly as practicable, its prior condition. 
(3)  Application . Application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made in writing upon a form furnished by the building inspector. Applications shall include the following information: statement of ownership and control of the property affected; a statement describing in detail the character and extent of improvements contemplated; site layout drawn to scale showing the location orientation and dimensions of buildings and structures; front elevations and architectural definitions of buildings and structures by sketches, drawings, photographs, or other information showing the proposed exterior alterations, additions, changes, or new construction as reasonably required by the redevelopment authority to make a decision. The building inspector shall transmit the application for a certificate of appropriateness to the redevelopment authority for their determination. 
(4)  Findings . Before granting a certificate of appropriateness, the redevelopment authority shall find that to the maximum extent practicable: 
(a)  The historic or cultural significance of buildings or structures affected is maintained or enhanced. 
(b)  The architectural style, value and significance, and general design arrangement, texture, material, and color of the architectural features of buildings and structures are visually and functionally coordinated with other buildings and structures in the area. 
(c)  Principal entrances are visually and functionally related and coordinated with other buildings and pedestrian ways. 
(d)  Activity nodes, such as plazas and arcades, are created, retained, and coordinated. 
(e)  Building facades and other appurtenances, such as fences, walls, and landscaping, are coordinated to form cohesive walls of enclosure along streets or other public ways and, further, that no such fences or walls shall be permitted to contain any barbs or sharp points. 
(f)  The scale, orientation, and directional expression of buildings and structures are visually and functionally coordinated with other buildings and structures in the area. 
(g)  Views are protected, created, or enhanced. 
(5)  Procedures . After the building inspector transmits the application for a certificate of appropriateness, together with the supporting information and material, to the redevelopment authority, the redevelopment authority shall act upon the application within 30 days of the filing thereof.

(1)  Establishment of board . In order that the objectives of this chapter may be more fully and equitably achieved, and a means for interpretation provided, there is established a board of appeals (hereinafter referred to as "the board") for the city. (See also section 1.38.) 
(2)  Procedures, meetings, records, and decisions . 
(a)  Procedures . The board shall be governed by the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7), this chapter, and rules and procedures adopted by the board and approved by the city council. No rule or procedure shall be changed without the affirmative vote of four members of the board and the concurrence of the city council. 
(b)  Meetings . Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairperson and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairperson or, in his absence, the acting chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. 
(c)  Records and decisions . The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be filed immediately as public records. All actions or decisions shall be taken by resolution in which four members, present during the proceedings, shall concur. Each resolution or decision shall contain a statement of the grounds forming the basis of such resolution or decision. The chairperson shall notify the mayor, city council, and plan commission of all resolutions and decisions. The district office of the department shall be notified of all decisions affecting floodplains. 
(3)  Powers and duties . 
(a)  Appeals . 
1.  Powers . The board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement of this chapter. The board may reverse or affirm wholly or in part or may modify any order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the building inspector and may issue or direct the issue of a permit. 
2.  Procedures . Appeals to the board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the building inspector without 30 days of the decision involved by filing with the building inspector and with the board of appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The building inspector shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The board shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing on the appeal and give public notice thereof as well as due notice to parties in interest, and shall decide the same within a reasonable time. In floodplain districts, the board shall review all data constituting the basis for the appeal of permit denial. For appeals concerning increases in regional flood elevation, the board shall uphold the denial where the board agrees with the data showing an increase in flood elevation. Increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be allowed after amending the flood profile and map and any appropriate legal arrangements are made with all adversely affected property owners. The appeal shall be granted where the board agrees that the data properly demonstrates that the project does not cause an increase equal to or greater than 0.01 foot, provided that no other reason for denial exists. 
3.  Preliminary review . The secretary of the board shall, as promptly as possible, inform the board concerning the appeal, and the board may either discuss the matter with the applicant if the applicant desires or proceed directly to order public notice of a hearing. If the applicant elects to withdraw the appeal any time before final determination is made by the board, this fact shall be noted on the application, with the signature of the applicant attesting withdrawal. Copies of the withdrawn application shall be returned to the secretary for the files of the board, to the building inspector, and to the applicant. If the appeal is not withdrawn, the board may request the applicant to provide such additional information as may be needed to determine the case and shall instruct the secretary to proceed with public notice of a hearing on the case. 
4.  Amendments . Amendment of an appeal by the applicant may be permitted at any time prior to or during the public hearing, provided that no such amendment shall be such as to make the case different from its description in the notice of public hearing. If the amendment is requested by the applicant after public notice of the hearing has been given, and such amendment is at variance with the information set forth in the public notice, the applicant shall pay an additional fee to cover the cost of amending the public notice. If the amended notice can be published within the time frame specified for the public hearing, the hearing on the amended appeal may be held on that date, otherwise the chairperson shall announce that the hearing originally scheduled on the case will be deferred to a future meeting, before which appropriate public notice will be given and will state the reasons for the deferral. 
(b)  Variances . 
1.  Power . The board shall have the power to grant a variance by varying the strict application of any requirement of this chapter where the strict application of such requirements would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship depriving the owner of reasonable use of land or buildings. 
2.  Requirements for a variance . In general, the power to authorize a variance from the requirements of this chapter shall be sparingly exercised and only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances. No variance shall be granted for actions which require an amendment to this chapter. Variances shall only be granted when the board finds that: 
a.  The variance is not contrary to the public interest and that such a variance will be in general harmony with the purposes and intent of this chapter. 
b.  The variance will not permit the establishment of a use which is not permitted in the district. 
c.  The hardship is due to the adoption of the floodplain ordinance or special conditions and circumstances which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. 
d.  The literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district. 
e.  The hardship is not shared generally by other land or buildings in the area. 
f.  The hardship results from the strict application of this chapter and is not the result of self-created or self-imposed circumstances. 
g.  A variance shall not be granted solely on the basis of economic gain or loss. 
h.  In floodplain districts, the variance shall not permit a lower degree of flood protection in the floodplain than the flood protection elevation. 
(c)  Interpretations . The board shall have the power to hear and decide applications for interpretations of the zoning regulations and boundaries of the zoning districts after the plan commission has made a review and recommendation. 
(4)  Procedures for floodplain boundary disputes . The following procedure shall be used by the board of appeals in hearing disputes concerning the district boundaries shown on the official floodplain zoning map: 
(a)  Where a floodplain district boundary is established by approximate or detailed floodplain studies pursuant to section 17.07, the regional flood elevations shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary. If no regional flood elevations or profiles are available to the board, other available evidence may be examined. 
(b)  In all cases, the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present arguments and technical evidence to the board of appeals. Where it is determined that the district boundary is incorrectly mapped, the board should either inform the plan commission to proceed to petition the city council or inform the person contesting the location of the boundary line to petition the city council for a map amendment pursuant to section 17.51. 
(5)  Public hearings . 
(a)  Time period . Upon filing with the board an application for an appeal or variance, the board shall fix a reasonable time, not more than 60 days from the filing date, for a public hearing.

Stats. ch. 985 shall be published in the official newspaper of the city specifying the date, time, and place of the hearing and matters to come before the board. Notices shall also be mailed to the parties at interest, as determined by the board. 
(c)  Notification . Within ten days of the filing date of an application, and prior to fixing a date for the public hearing, the secretary of the board shall transmit a copy of such application and all accompanying information to the city council. 
(6)  Appeal of board decisions . Any person, or any board, taxpayer, department, or bureau of the city aggrieved by any decision of the board of appeals, may appeal such decision to a court of record in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7). 
(7)  Fees . New applications for an appeal or variance shall be accompanied by a fee of $100.00 to compensate the city for publication of notice and other expenses. No action shall be taken until such fee has been paid.

If the city council does not receive a report and recommendation from the city plan commission within 60 days of submitting the proposed amendment, the city council may proceed with the necessary hearing. 
(3)  Public hearing and notice . No amendment of this chapter shall become effective until a public hearing is held before the city council where parties in interest and citizens shall have the opportunity to be heard. A class 2 notice in accordance with Wis. Stats. ch. 985 shall be published in the official newspaper of the city once during each of the two weeks prior to such hearing. At least ten days before the public hearing, a written notice of such hearing shall also be given to the clerk of any city whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any lands included in the proposed amendment. Failure to give such notice shall not invalidate such amendment. 
(4)  Final approval . 
(a)  An amendment shall become effective upon a majority vote of the members of the city council voting on the proposed change. However, in case of a protest against such amendment, duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20 percent or more of the land included in such proposed amendment or by owners of 20 percent or more of the area immediately adjacent extending 100 feet therefrom, or by owners of 20 percent or more of the land directly opposite thereto extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite land, such amendment shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of three-fourths of the members of the city council voting on the proposal. 
(b)  No amendment concerning the floodway, flood fringe, or general floodplain districts, shall become effective until also being approved by the department of natural resources, the Federal Insurance Administration and, in the case of district boundary amendments, until an official letter of the boundary change has been issued by the Federal Insurance Administration. 
(5)  Amendments to floodplain districts .

(b)  Referral and approval . Copies of the proposed amendment and notice of public hearing shall be submitted to the appropriate district office of the department.

(Code 2011, § 22.01; Ord. No. 1729, 3-15-2016) 
Sec. 22.02. - Post-construction stormwater management. 
(1)  Authority . 
(a)  This section is adopted by the common council under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 62.234, for cities. This ordinance supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under Wis. Stats. § 62.23, that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in Wis. Stats. §§ 62.234 and 62.23, applies to this section and to any amendments to this section. 
(b)  The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body. 
(c)  The common council hereby designates the director of public works or designee to administer and enforce the provisions of this section. 
(d)  The requirements of this ordinance do not pre-empt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
1.  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals including those authorized under Wis. Stats. §§ 281.16 and 283.33. 
2.  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under Wis. Adm. Code. § NR 151.004. 
(2)  Findings of fact . The common council finds that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can: 
(a)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(b)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(c)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads. 
(d)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading. 
(e)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities. 
(f)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes. 
(g)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding. 
(3)  Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose . The general purpose of this ordinance is to establish long-term, post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
1.  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
2.  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth. 
3.  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property. 
(b)  Intent . It is the intent of the common council that this ordinance regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This ordinance may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The common council recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this ordinance is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Wis. Stats. § 281.16, for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the common council, it is the intent of this ordinance that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community. 
(4)  Applicability and jurisdiction. 
(a)  Applicability. 
1.  Where not otherwise limited by law, this ordinance applies to all post-construction sites, unless the site is otherwise exempt under paragraph 2. 
2.  A post-construction site that meets any of the criteria in this paragraph is exempt from the requirements of this section. 
a.  One- and two-family residential dwellings that are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale and that result in less than one acre of disturbance. 
b.  Non-point discharges from agricultural activity areas. 
c.  Non-point discharges from silviculture activities. 
d.  Mill and crush operations. 
3.  Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in paragraph 1, this section applies to post-construction sites of any size that, in the opinion of the director of public works or designee, is likely to result in runoff that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or receiving body of water, that causes undue channel erosion, that increases water pollution by scouring or the transportation of particulate matter or that endangers property or public safety. 
(b)  Jurisdiction . This ordinance applies to post construction sites within the boundaries and jurisdiction of the City of Kaukauna. 
(c)  Exclusions . This ordinance is not applicable to activities conducted by a state agency, as defined under Wis.

i.  For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, and for wetlands in areas of special natural resource interest as specified in § NR 103.04, 75 feet. 
ii.  For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a United States geological survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever is more current, 50 feet. 
iii.  For lakes, 50 feet. 
iv.  For highly susceptible wetlands, 50 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the following types: fens, sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, shrub swamps, other forested wetlands, fresh wet meadows, shallow marshes, deep marshes and seasonally flooded basins. 
v.  For moderately susceptible wetlands, 50 feet. Moderately susceptible wetlands include, but are not limited to: shrub wetlands, floodplain forests, fresh wet meadows, deep/shallow marshes, and forested wetlands. Perennial and intermittent streams also fit in this protective area designation. 
vi.  For less susceptible wetlands, ten percent of the average wetland width, but no less than ten feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass. 
vii.  In subd. a.iv, v, and vi, determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in § NR 103.03. 
viii.  Wetlands shall be delineated. Wetland boundary delineations shall be made in accordance with § NR 103.08(1m). [Section] 22.02(7)(c)4.a. does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. Where there is a legally authorized wetland fill, the protective area standard need not be met in that location. 
xi.  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, ten feet. 
b.  [Section 22.02(7)(c)4 applies to all post-construction sites located within a protective area, except those areas exempted pursuant to subd. e. below. 
c.  The following requirements shall be met: 
i.  Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area to the maximum extent practicable. The stormwater management plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction.

1.  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to waters of the state or the MS4 is prohibited. 
2.  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
3.  A person is considered to be in violation of this section if the person connects a line conveying sewage to waters of the state or the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
4.  Improper connections in violation of this section must be disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved on-site wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the public works department. 
5.  Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps, or equivalent, and which may be connected to waters of the state or the MS4, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written notice of violation from the public works department requiring that such locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the public works department. 
(8)  Watercourse protection . Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of soil erosion, trash, debris, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(9)  Compliance monitoring . 
(a)  Right of entry; inspecting and sampling . The public works department shall be permitted to enter and inspect properties and facilities subject to regulation under this section as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this section. 
1.  If a property or facility has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the owner or operator shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the public works department. 
2.  Facility owners and operators shall allow the public works department ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records. 
3.  The public works department shall have the right to set up on any property or facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the public works department to conduct monitoring or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
4.  The public works department has the right to require the owner or operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary, and make the monitoring data available to the public works department. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
5.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the public works department and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator. 
6.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the public works department access to a facility is a violation of this section. A person who is the operator of a facility commits an offense if the person denies the public works department reasonable access to the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this section. 
(b)  Special inspection warrant . If the public works department has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the public works department is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this section, or that there is a need to inspect or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this section or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the public works department may seek issuance of a special inspection warrant per Wis. Stats. § 66.0119. 
(10)  Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. The owner or operator of any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution contamination of stormwater shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into waters of the state or the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises that is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to waters of the state or the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity or construction activity, to the maximum extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. 
(11)  Notification of spills . Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4, or waters of the state, the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release, so as to minimize the impacts of the discharge. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, the person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services, and shall also notify the public works department. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, the person shall notify the public works department in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the public works department within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least five years. Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of this section. 
(12)  Violations, enforcement, and penalties . 
(a)  Violations . It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the public works department is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation. The public works department is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in subsection (15) of this section. 
(b)  Warning notice . When the public works department finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this section, or any order issued hereunder, the public works department may serve upon that person a verbal or written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in the subsection shall limit the authority of the public works department to take action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice. 
(c)  Notice of violation . Whenever the public works department finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this section, the public works department may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. 
1.  The notice of violation shall contain: 
a.  The name and address of the alleged violator; 
b.  The address, when available, or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred; 
c.  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
d.  A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore compliance with this section and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action; 
e.  A statement of the penalty that shall or may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; 
f.  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the public works department by filing a written notice of appeal within three business days of service of notice of violation; and 
g.  A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore compliance within the established time schedule, representatives of the public works department may issue a notice of intent to the responsible party of its intent to perform work necessary to comply with this section. The public works department may go on the land and commence the work after issuing the notice of intent. The public works department is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in subsection (15) of this section. 
2.  Such notice may require, without limitation: 
a.  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
b.  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
c.  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
d.  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
e.  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
f.  The implementation of BMPs. 
(d)  Suspension of MS4 access . 
1.  Emergency cease and desist orders. 
a.  When the public works department finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this section, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violations have caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the state which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the public works department may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
i.  Immediately comply with all section requirements; and 
ii.  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations or terminating the discharge. 
b.  Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the public works department may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the state, or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other city utility services. The public works department may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the public works department that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this section. 
c.  A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the public works department within 30 days of receipt of the prerequisite for taking any other action against the violator. 
2.  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations . The public works department may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the public works department may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons. 
3.  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge . Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The public works department will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the public works department. 
(e)  Prosecution and penalties . Any person violating any provision of this section shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $25.00 nor more than $500.00 and the costs of prosecution for each violation. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. Compliance with the provisions of this section may also be enforced by injunction in any court with jurisdiction. It shall not be necessary to prosecute for forfeiture or a cease and desist order before resorting to injunction proceedings. 
(13)  Appeals . 
(a)  Board of appeals . The board of appeals created pursuant to the city ordinances and pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(e): 
1.  Shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is error in any order, decision or determination made by the public works department in administering this section except for cease and desist orders obtained under subsection (12)(d)1 of this section. 
2.  Upon appeal, may authorize variances from the provisions of this section which are not contrary to the public interest and where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship; and 
3.  Shall use rules, procedures, duties and powers authorized by statute in hearing and deciding appeals and authorizing variances. 
(b)  Who may appeal . Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any aggrieved person or by any office, department, board, or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the public works department. 
(14)  Enforcement measures after appeal . If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, the appropriate authority upheld the decision of the public works department, then representatives of the public works department may issue a notice of intent to the responsible party of its intent to perform work necessary to comply with this section. The public works department may go on the land and commence the work after issuing the notice of intent. The public works department is authorized to seek costs of abatement as outlined in subsection (15) of this section. It is unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(15)  Cost of abatement of the violation . The cost of the work performed by the public works department pursuant to this section, plus interest at the rate authorized by the public works department shall be billed to the responsible party.

(Code 2011, § 22.03) 
Sec. 22.04. - Stormwater utility. 
(1)  Establishment . The city finds that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharge within and beyond the Fox River, Apple Creek, Garners Creek, Konkapot Creek, and Plum Creek (the "city's waterways") is a matter that affects the health, safety, and welfare of the city, its citizens and businesses, and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the city and the heart of the Valley Metropolitan Sewerage District by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow in the sanitary sewer. In addition, surface water runoff may create erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences with water damage, and create sedimentation and other environmental damage in the city's waterways. Those elements of the system that provide for the collection of and dispose of stormwater and regulation of groundwater are of benefit and provide services to all properties within the city, including property not presently served by the storm elements of the system. The cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the benefits enjoyed and services received therefrom. There is hereby established a city stormwater utility. The operation of the stormwater utility is under the supervision of the common council. The director of public works shall be in charge of the stormwater utility. 
(2)  Authority . The city, through the stormwater utility, may acquire, construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage and finance such real estate and facilities as are deemed by the city to be proper and reasonably necessary for a system of stormwater and surface water management. These facilities may include, without limitation by enumeration, surface and underground drainage facilities, sewers, water courses, retaining walls and ponds, detention basins, and such other facilities as will support a stormwater management system. 
(3)  Definitions . The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. Terms not specifically defined in this subsection shall have the meaning defined in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 216.002. 
    Director means the director of public works, or his designee. 
    Developed property means the real property that has been altered from its natural state by the addition of any improvements that may include a building, structure, impervious surface, change in grade or landscaping. 
    Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) means the statistical average horizontal impervious area of single-family homes within the city on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. The horizontal impervious area includes, but is not limited to, all areas covered by structures, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways and sidewalks. 
    Duplex unit means any residential space identified for habitation by members of the same household attached to only one other residential space or as classified by the city building and zoning codes. 
    Dwelling unit means any residential space identified for habitation by members of the same household or as classified by the city building and zoning codes. A dwelling unit includes, but is not limited to, single-family homes, manufactured homes, duplexes, multifamily apartments, residential condominiums and townhouse living units. 
    Impervious area or impervious surface means areas that have been paved, covered or compacted to inhibit the natural infiltration of water into the soil or cause water to run off the area in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the present under natural conditions as undeveloped property. Such areas may include, but are not limited to, roofs, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways, sidewalks, pavement, gravel, athletic courts and compacted surfaces. Excluded from this definition are undisturbed land, lawn and fields. 
    Nonresidential property means any developed lot or parcel not exclusively residential as defined herein, but not limited to, transient rentals, such as hotels and motels, mobile home parks, commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental properties and parking lots. 
    Residential property means any lot or parcel developed exclusively for residential purposes, including, but not limited to, single-family homes, manufactured homes, duplexes, multifamily apartments, residential condominiums and townhouse living units. 
    Runoff means the surface water, including rain and snow melt, which is inhibited by impervious surfaces from naturally infiltrating into soil. 
    Stormwater facilities means all constructed facilities or natural features used for collecting, storing and conducting stormwater to, through and from drainage areas to the point of final outlet. Stormwater facilities collectively constitute a stormwater system. 
    Undeveloped property means that which has not been altered from its natural state by the addition of any improvements, such as a building, structure, impervious surface, change of grade or landscaping. For new construction, a property shall be considered developed pursuant to this section at the time of water meter installation or upon review of the actual impervious area by January 1. 
(4)  Rate charges . 
(a)  By this section, the common council is authorizing charges on properties within the city for services and facilities provided by the stormwater utility. The actual charges to be imposed, the establishment of formulas for calculations of the charges, the establishment of specific customer classifications, and any future changes in those rates, formulas, rate charges and customer classifications, may be made by resolution. All rates established pursuant to this section will be fair and reasonable in accordance with the decision and judgment of the common council. The current rates will be on file with the city clerk-treasurer. 
(b)  Rate charges shall be used to finance the costs of the stormwater utility. These rate charges may include: 
1.  Base charge (BC). The base charge may be imposed on all property in the city. The base charge will be designed to reflect the fact that all properties benefit from the stormwater management activities of the city and that all property contributes in some way to the stormwater discharge that must be managed by the city. The BC will be designed to collect the administrative costs of the storm sewer utility and the portion of the capital costs not covered by special assessment. 
2.  Equivalent runoff unit charge (ERU). This charge shall be imposed on all property that has any developed impervious area. The ERU will be designed on the basis of a typical residential unit of property. Other units of property will be charged multiples of the ERU, based upon the impervious area contributing to surface water runoff. 
3.  Special charge (SC). This charge may be imposed on property that is in an area specially benefited by a particular stormwater management facility. The SC will be developed to reflect the benefits/services in a particular area that may not be appropriate to spread to property throughout the city. The SC will be calculated on an ERU basis. 
a.  The common council may make such other adjustments or customer classifications as will be likely to provide reasonable and fair distribution of the costs of the stormwater utility. In so doing, the council may provide credits against certain portions of the charges set forth above for facilities installed and maintained by the property owner for the purpose of lessening the stormwater flow or pollutant load from that given property. 
b.  The city's finance department is hereby appointed as the collection agency for the city stormwater utility. Bills shall be prepared by the city or its agent. The city shall allocate the actual cost of billing and collecting as a charge upon the stormwater utility. 
c.  The bills for stormwater utility charges shall be provided to the designated water utility bill recipient, but this notification shall not relieve the owner of the property from liability for rental property in the event payment is not made as required in this article. The owner of any property served which is occupied by tenants shall have the right to examine collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether such rates and charges have been paid for by such tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business. 
d.  Stormwater utility charges shall be paid monthly. If stormwater utility charges remain unpaid after a period of 20 days from the date of utility bill, such bill shall become a delinquent special charge and shall become a lien as provided in Wis. Stats. §§ 66.0809 and 66.0821. The charges shall automatically be extended upon the current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property, and all proceedings in relation to the collection, return, and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such special charges. Unpaid charges shall be assessed the same as the water utility bills. 
e.  All delinquent charges shall be subject to a ten percent penalty in addition to all other charges and prior penalties or interest when the delinquent charge is extended upon the tax roll. 
(5)  Customer classification . 
(a)  For purposes of imposing the stormwater charges, all lots and parcels within the city are classified into the following five customer classes: 
1.  Residential, single-family. 
2.  Residential, duplex. 
3.  Residential, multifamily and condominium. 
4.  Nonresidential. 
5.  Undeveloped. 
(b)  The director of public works shall prepare a list of lots and parcels within the city, and assign a classification to each lot or parcel. 
(c)  The average square footage of impervious area of the ERU is established to be equivalent to 2,944 square feet. 
(d)  The charges imposed for single-family residential properties shall be the rate for one ERU. 
(e)  The charges imposed for duplex residential properties shall be the rate for six-tenths of one ERU per each individual dwelling unit existing on the property (ERU rate multiplied by the number of dwelling units). 
(f)  The charges imposed for multifamily apartment, condominium, and townhouse residential properties shall be the same as nonresidential properties. 
(g)  The charges imposed for nonresidential properties shall be the rate for one ERU, multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area of a nonresidential property by the square footage of one ERU. The numerical factor shall be rounded down to the nearest one-tenth, i.e., ERU rate multiplied by impervious area (square feet) divided by 2,944 square feet 
(h)  No ERU charge is imposed for undeveloped properties. 
(i)  The director of public works shall be responsible for determining the impervious area, based upon the best available information, including, but not limited to, data supplied by the building inspector, aerial photography, the property owner, tenant or developer. The director of public works may require additional information, as necessary, to make the determination. The impervious area calculation shall be updated no less than annually by the director of public works on any additions to the impervious area. Upon the property owner's written notification and request, the director of public works shall review impervious area for possible reductions. 
(j)  The minimum charges for any developed property shall be equal to the rate for one ERU. 
(6)  New construction . The owner shall also be liable for stormwater charges, under this section, for the improvement from the date of water meter installation or upon determination of the actual impervious area. 
(7)  Method of appeal . 
(a)  The amount of stormwater utility charge may be appealed, as follows: 
1.  A written appeal shall be filed with the director of public works prior to the utility charge due date; or 
2.  Within 30 days of payment, a written challenge to the stormwater charge must be filed with the director of public works on behalf of the customer, specifying all bases for the challenge and the amount of the stormwater charge the customer asserts is appropriate. Failure to file a challenge within 90 days of payment waives all right to later challenge the charge. 
(b)  A property owner not satisfied with the director of public work's decision may appeal to the board of public works for their review and action. 
(c)  Following review by the board of public works, the common council will determine whether the amount of stormwater charge is fair and reasonable, or whether a refund or adjustment is due the customer. The common council may act with or without a hearing, and will inform the customer in writing of its decision. 
(d)  If the common council determines that a refund is due the customer, the refund will be applied as a credit on the customer's next stormwater billing, if the refund will not exceed the customer's next stormwater billing, or will be refunded at the discretion of the finance director without interest. 
(8)  Special assessment authority . In addition to any other method for collection of the charges established pursuant to this section for stormwater utility costs, the common council finds that these charges may be levied on property as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. The charges established hereunder reasonably reflect the benefits conferred on property and may be assessed as special charges. The billing for such charges to the owner will serve as notice to the owner that failure to pay the charges when due may result in them being charged pursuant to the authority of Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. In addition, the city may provide notice each October of any unpaid charges to the stormwater utility, which charges, if not paid by November 15, may be placed on the tax roll under Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(9)  Budget excess revenues . The stormwater utility finances shall be accounted for in a separate stormwater utility fund by the city. The utility shall prepare an annual budget, which is to include all operation and maintenance costs, administrative costs, depreciation costs, debt service, and other costs related to the operation of the stormwater utility. The budget is subject to approval by the common council. The costs shall be spread over the rate classifications as determined by the common council. Any excess of revenues over expenditures in a year will be retained by the stormwater utility fund for subsequent years' needs.
