If the property is not disposed of in a sale open to the public, the Chief of Police shall maintain an inventory of such property, a record of the date and method of disposal, the consideration received for the property, if any, and the name and address of the person taking possession of the property. The inventory shall be kept as a public record for at least two years after the disposal of the property.

[Prior code § 3.72]


3.750 Public Records Management.

(1) Purposes. The purposes of this section are as follows:

(a) To establish a minimum records retention schedule for records of the City of Manitowoc;

(b) To authorize destruction of City of Manitowoc public records after the minimum retention time has been met;

(c) To comply with the notice requirements to the State Historical Society of Wisconsin established in Wis. Stat. § 19.21(4)(d) prior to the destruction of obsolete public records; and

(d) To obtain the consent of the Wisconsin Public Records and Forms Board in the case of records whose retention schedules are for less than seven years.

(2) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the following definitions:

CR means the date on which the record was received or created.

EVT means the event upon which the record was created or received, except as otherwise noted.

Legal custodian means the individual responsible for maintaining records pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 19.33.

N means the SHSW must still be notified as provided for in Wis. Stat. § 19.21(4)(a) prior to the destruction of the applicable record.

N/A means the record is designated for permanent retention and the waiver application to the SHSW is not applicable.

PERM means the record shall be retained permanently.

Record means a record of the City of Manitowoc as defined in Wis. Stat. § 19.32(2).

(3) General Provisions.

(a) Notice to State Historical Society of Wisconsin. Wis. Stat. § 19.21(4)(a) requires that at least 60 days’ notice in writing of the destruction of any obsolete public record be given to the SHSW. The Statute allows the SHSW, however, to waive such notice upon application. Prior to adoption, the ordinance codified in this section shall have been submitted to the SHSW. Where “W” appears in the SHSW Notice column, the SHSW has waived the 60-day notice requirement for the applicable class of records. In the event “N” appears in the SHSW Notice column for a particular record, the SHSW must still be notified as provided for in Wis. Stat. § 19.21(4)(a) prior to destruction of the record. Where “N/A” appears in the SHSW Notice column, the record is designated for permanent retention and the waiver application to the SHSW is not applicable. Notice to the SHSW is also required for any record not specifically listed in subsection (4) of this section.

(b) Reproductive Preservation of Records. City of Manitowoc records may be kept and preserved through the use of microfilm or other reproductive devices, as authorized by Wis. Stat. § 19.21(4)(c).

(c) Destruction Prohibited After Request for Inspection. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 19.35(5), this section does not permit the destruction of any record at any time after receipt of a request for inspection or copying of the record under Wis. Stat. § 19.35(1) until after the request is granted or until at least 60 days after the date that the request is denied. If an action is commenced under Wis. Stat. § 19.37, the requested record may not be destroyed until the time permitted in Wis. Stat. § 19.35(5).

(d) Destruction Pending Litigation. No record subject to pending litigation shall be destroyed until the litigation is resolved.

(e) Approval by Public Record and Forms Board. The ordinance codified in this section and the retention periods of less than seven years have been reviewed and approved by the Wisconsin Public Records and Forms Board.

(4) Records Retention Schedules. The following schedule shows the minimum period of time for which the records described herein shall be retained and whether or not notice from the SHSW is required prior to destruction of any particular type of record.

3.800 Code of Ethics.

(1) Declaration of Policy. It is declared that high moral and ethical standards among City officials and employees are essential to conduct of free government; that the Mayor and Common Council believe that a code of ethics for the guidance of City officials and employees will help them avoid conflicts of interest, will improve public service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of this City in their City officials and employees. This code of ethics is intended to supplement the code of ethics for local government officials, employees, and candidates set forth in Wis. Stat. § 19.59.

(2) Definitions.

Employee shall mean any employee of the City of Manitowoc, including full-time, part-time and temporary employees and employees of the Manitowoc Public Utilities.

Financial interest shall mean any interest which yields directly a monetary or other material benefit.

Official shall mean any official of the City of Manitowoc and shall include the Mayor, members of the Common Council, department heads, and any other person elected to City office, as well as anyone appointed to serve on any City board, committee or commission, whether or not compensation is received for such service.

(3) Regulated Ethical Conduct.

(a) Fair and Equal Treatment. No official or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen.

(b) Use of Public Property. No official or employee shall request, permit or participate in the unauthorized use of City-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit.

(c) Conflict of Interest. No official or employee may use his or her public position or office to obtain any financial interest for himself, his or her spouse or legal dependent, or for any business with which he/she is associated.

(d) Incompatible Employment. No official or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render service for a private interest when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or would tend to impair such person’s independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties, unless otherwise permitted by law and unless disclosure is made as provided therein.

(e) Disclosure of Confidential Information. No official or employee shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information gained in the course of, or by reason of, his or her official position or activities.

(f) Gifts and Favors. No official or employee may solicit or accept, from any person or organization, directly or indirectly, anything of value if it could reasonably be expected to influence such official’s or employee’s vote, official actions or judgment, or could reasonably be considered as a reward for any action or inaction relating to such person’s office or employment. Elected officials shall refrain from giving gifts to employees.

(g) Contracts with the City. No official or employee who in his or her capacity as such official or employee participates in the making of a contract in which such official or employee has a private pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, or performs in regard to that contract some function requiring the exercise of discretion on the part of such official or employee, shall enter into any contract with the City unless, within the confines of Wis. Stat. § 946.13, the contract is awarded through a process of public notice and competitive bidding.

(h) Disclosure of Interest in Legislation. To the extent known, any member of the Common Council who has a financial interest in any proposed action before the Common Council shall disclose on the records of the Common Council, or the Ethics Board created by this section, the nature and extent of such interest.

Any other official or employee who has a financial interest in any proposed legislative action of the Common Council and who participates in discussion with or gives an official opinion or recommendation to the Common Council, or any subdivision thereof, shall disclose on the records of the Common Council, or the Ethics Board created by this section, the nature and extent of such interest.

(i) Ability of Officials to Bind. No official or employee has the authority to act on behalf of or bind the City without authorization of the Common Council by resolution. Officials and employees should be clear about whether they are acting in their official capacity when meeting with businesses or individuals. Officials and employees should also strive to avoid discussing negotiations or litigation with adverse parties when not at a scheduled meeting.

(j) Campaign Contributions. Campaign contributions shall be reported by all candidates for the City office in conformity with the Wisconsin Statutes.

(k) Correspondence. All City-related email correspondence shall be conducted using City-issued email accounts. Officials shall refrain from using their personal emails for City business and should forward any City emails received on their personal email accounts to their City account.

(4) Ethics Board.

(a) There is hereby created an Ethics Board to consist of five members: one alderperson, one City official and three citizens; all appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the Common Council. The citizen members shall be chosen from the private sector and shall not be affiliated with City government in any capacity, including, but not limited to, employment, appointment or election. Terms of office of these private citizens shall be three years, with one appointment to be made annually. The Ethics Board shall elect its own chair and vice-chair, and the City Attorney shall furnish the Board with whatever legal assistance is necessary to carry out its functions. If any member of the Ethics Board petitions the Board for a hearing and advice regarding his or her own conduct, such member shall not be eligible to consider the matter, and an alternate shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the Council, to substitute therefor when the need arises.

(b) The Ethics Board may make recommendations to the Common Council with respect to amendments to this code of ethics.

(c) Upon the sworn statement of any person alleging acts which, if true, would constitute improper conduct under this section, the Board may conduct a public hearing, unless a private hearing is requested by the individual involved, in accordance with all common law requirements of due process. Following such hearing, the Board shall make a determination with written findings of fact and conclusions concerning the propriety of the conduct of the official or employee. If the Ethics Board, by a four-fifths vote, finds that probable cause exists against an individual for a violation of this section, it shall refer the matter for appropriate action to the City Attorney or District Attorney. In making such referral, the Ethics Board shall supply the City Attorney or District Attorney with a written statement of its determination, as well as such documents as it decides to release, but the statements of determination shall not be admissible as evidence in any court.

(d) The Board shall authorize the release to the City Attorney or District Attorney of any information, records, complaints, documents, reports and transcripts in its possession, if such release is material to the matter being investigated or prosecuted by the City Attorney or District Attorney. The accused official or employee cited by the declaration of probable cause may request the Ethics Board to withhold any information, records, documents, reports and transcripts that were placed before the Board on behalf of the accused as part of his/her defense.

(1) Five-Year Installment Plan. All such assessments may be paid by the property owner in five annual equal installments. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the London Interbank Offered Rate One-Year rate as of January 1st of the year the project will be completed plus 1.5 percent, to remain set at that constant rate for the life of the plan. Interest shall begin to accrue at this rate on the unpaid balance as of November 1st of the year assessments are levied.

(2) Ten-Year Installment Plan. The Board of Public Works is hereby empowered to grant a 10-year installment plan in lieu of the five-year plan upon written application therefor from any property owner who at the time of the assessment is not occupying the assessed property as a residence and demonstrates an economic hardship or any property owner who occupies as a resident the property against which the assessment has been made. The interest rate for a 10-year installment plan shall be the London Interbank Offered Rate One-Year rate as of January 1st of the year the project will be completed plus two percent, to remain set at that constant rate for the life of the plan.

Upon the filing of such request, collection of such assessments which are levied against the second side of the corner lot shall be delayed and no interest on such assessments shall accrue during the five-year period in which the assessments on the first side are being paid. Where such special assessments were levied against a corner lot, the side with the greater amount of assessments shall be treated as the side against which special assessments were levied. In the year the assessments against the first side are paid or due, whichever first occurs, the property owner shall have the option of paying the assessments against the second side in one lump sum prior to October 15th of that year or pursuant to the five-year payment plan in subsection (1) of this section, in which case interest shall begin to accrue on November 1st of that year as provided for therein.

7.290 Delayed Assessment Policy.

(1) When Granted. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Manitowoc that the Common Council may, in its discretion, delay the payment of special assessments made against a property owner where there is no immediate benefit to the property owner from the improvement and where failure to delay the assessment would impose an undue hardship on the property owner. It is the further policy of the City of Manitowoc to create a uniform policy for granting and administering delayed assessments. In order to qualify under this section, the assessed property must be unimproved and unplatted throughout the period of delay, the owner must make no use of the improvements for which the assessment is made during the period of delay, and the owner must not sell any part of the property assessed during the period of delay.

No delayed assessment may be granted unless the total assessment costs exceed the sum of $1,000 and unless the person requesting the delayed assessment shall have made the request in writing.

(2) Terms.

(a) Length of Delay. Special assessments may be initially delayed for a period of up to 10 years from the initial assessment due date. This 10-year period shall be extended for an additional period of up to 10 years upon application by the property owner, provided none of the events in subsection (3) of this section triggering expiration have occurred and provided the total amount of the assessment delayed exceeds $7,500. In no event shall the total period of delay hereunder exceed 20 years. Any special assessments shall be a lien against the property as of the date of the levy.

Any applicant for a delayed assessment must sign a form to be prepared by the City Attorney waiving any objection to the improvements made, the assessment or to the terms of the delayed assessment granted. Acceptance of the delay by the owner also expressly implies a waiver of their rights to object to the assessment at a later date. All assessments for which a delay is granted shall become due and payable upon expiration of the delay as provided for in subsection (3) of this section; provided, however, that the property owner may elect to pay for the assessment charge over a five-year period commencing on the delayed assessment expiration date with interest computed at the prevailing interest rate chargeable to all special assessments at the time such installment payments are made.

(b) Amount Delayed. No delay may be granted for the first $2,500 attributable to street improvements or for the first 100 feet of sewer improvements, except that the Common Council may waive this restriction for any land zoned P-1 or R-1.

(c) Interest. Effective January 1, 1982, no interest shall be charged against assessments delayed under this section. In the case of delayed assessments granted prior to January 1, 1982, no additional interest shall be charged to the outstanding balances of accumulated principal and interest as they existed on December 31, 1981.

(3) Expiration. Any delay which is granted shall expire on the first to occur of the following events:

(a) The expiration date granted by the Common Council;

(b) Sale of the property for which the delayed assessment was granted;

(c) The platting or placing of any improvement on the property for which the delayed assessment was granted; or

(d) The use of the improvements for which the assessment was made by the property owner.

The Common Council may, in its discretion, limit the expiration of the delay to only part of a parcel for which a delayed assessment has been granted if the expiration is caused by one of the events described in subsection (3)(b), (c) or (d) of this section and such event is deemed not to affect the entire parcel.

In every case where such petition requesting a high-type pavement has been filed, any and all abutting property owned by the City of Manitowoc is to be included in and computed with the land represented by the petition presented by the property owners requesting said improvements.

(2) The Common Council may on its own initiative, and in the situation when it is deemed expedient and to the best interest of the City of Manitowoc, order infrastructure improvements anywhere within the City limits.

12.090 Water Main Extension and Assessment Policy.

(1) Water Main Extensions. Whenever any streets are to be paved in the City of Manitowoc and water mains have not previously been installed, the Commission shall be notified and required to install the necessary mains in said street before the same is paved. In addition to these extensions, the Commission shall have authority to install water mains as it deems necessary or convenient for the operation of the Water Utility. The Commission and Common Council may by mutual agreement decide not to install water mains under any street which is to be paved.

(2) Assessment Policy Rules and Regulations. For reference purposes, following are the current assessment rules and regulations which have been approved by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission following approval by the Manitowoc Common Council:

Water mains within the corporate limits of the City of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, shall be extended in accordance with the following rules and regulations as filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and approved by the Common Council of said City under MMC 12.050.

The Manitowoc Public Utilities Commission shall approve the extension of water mains according to need and necessity and shall disapprove any water main extension or petition for just cause.

When the City of Manitowoc extends a sanitary sewer on its own initiative and in situations when it is deemed expedient to the best interest of the City, the Manitowoc Public Utilities Commission may order water main extension in the same area without a water petition. The cost of installing such water mains shall be assessed to the abutting property owners along the said street at the assessment rate in effect at the time of the water main extension.

When a water main extension has been installed, all assessments shall be paid in full before the property sale closing date except in those instances when the new property owner agrees to assume an existing installment payment agreement.

The Utility shall determine the size of the main to be installed in any location and the schedule of installations.

All water mains within the City limits of the City of Manitowoc shall be sole property of the Water Utility.

Plan “A”

The Utility may approve the installation of water mains on any street upon the presentation of a petition signed by the owners of 51 percent of the assessable front footage of abutting property owners along said street. The cost of installing mains shall be assessed at $27.00 per front foot of property for each side of the street where water mains are being installed, except for corner lots. Corner lots shall be exempt one-half of the total lot frontage, up to a maximum exemption of 100 feet. When a water main is simultaneously laid on both sides of a corner lot, the assessment shall be $27.00 per foot installed subject to the above exemption. Where the main is to be laid on one side of a corner lot, the assessment shall be $27.00 per foot installed up to the maximum footage as specified by the above exemption. When a main is subsequently installed on the other side of a corner lot the assessment shall be at $27.00 per foot for that total corner lot frontage which exceeds the sum of the exemption stated above and that frontage previously assessed. Any property other than a corner lot fronting on two or more streets shall be assessed only for the water main installed which will serve that property, provided such property is not of sufficient depth to be divided into two lots of reasonable size or provided a dwelling is located upon the property so as to prevent such division. Sufficient depth shall be considered to be any depth in excess of 200 feet.

All assessments shall be presented in the year of installation and payment shall be due no later than the last day of the year of installation. Interest shall be charged beginning on the first day of the year following the year of installation at the rate of eight percent per year on all unpaid assessments. Unpaid assessments on October 15th following the year of installation shall be forwarded to the City Clerk on November 16th and placed on the tax roll as a special assessment with interest to December 31st. Installment Payment Plans and Delayed Payment Plans shall be established as set forth in the applicable paragraphs.

Plan “B”

The Water Utility may reduce or install transmission mains, mains to loop dead end mains, or mains for fire protection or sanitation purposes without petition. Any abutting property owner connecting to said extension within 10 years shall pay a connection charge equal to the assessment charge in effect at the time of connection before connecting to the main. Any abutting property owner connecting to said extension after 10 years shall pay a pro-rated connection charge equal to the assessment charge in effect at the time of connection before connecting to the main. The pro-rated charge shall be calculated by multiplying the assessment rate to the straight line depreciation factor. 

Plan “C”

The Utility may approve the installation of water mains for prospective customers on any street upon the presentation of a petition from the owners of less than 51 percent of the assessable front footage along said street; provided, that said petitioners agree to pay the full assessment requirement in Plan “A” for all assessable property frontage involved in the extension before construction is started.

Any abutting property owners connecting to said extension within 10 years shall pay assessments at the rate in effect at the time of the original petition, as required in Plan “A,” before connecting with the main and any assessments received therefor within the 10-year period shall be refunded to the person or persons having paid the original full assessment in a pro rata share based on the rate originally paid by said person or persons. After all refunds are made the remaining assessment of each petitioner shall not be less than that provided in Plan “A” for the front footage owned by the petitioner, or his heirs or assigns, at the time the main is installed.

Plan “D”

Where it is deemed advisable that a water main be laid ahead of paving due to municipal requirements, assessments shall be made as provided in Plan “A.”

Plan “E”

Where a subdivider or developer petitions for installation of water mains in a regularly platted real estate development or subdivision, the petitioner shall be required to install the water main system desired upon approval of the Manitowoc Public Utilities and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, with said installations to meet all the requirements and standards of the Manitowoc Public Utilities for water main installations. All drawings for the installation shall be approved by the Manitowoc Public Utilities before construction begins with at least two weeks’ lead time required. Contractors installing such water mains shall be subject to approval by the Manitowoc Public Utilities. 

The petitioner shall be responsible for the total cost of construction, including payment for the Manitowoc Public Utilities’ engineering costs, record keeping and administrative costs and an on-site inspector. At least seven days prior to construction, the petitioner shall provide a deposit to the Manitowoc Public Utilities for the estimated engineering and administrative costs. After acceptance of the project, the Manitowoc Public Utilities shall refund or invoice the difference in the Manitowoc Public Utilities’ actual cost and the deposit.

Ownership of said main or mains shall revert to the Water Utility after completion and acceptance by Manitowoc Public Utilities and there shall be no assessments, payments or refunds by the Manitowoc Public Utilities. The petitioner shall provide as-built construction drawings and detailed actual construction costs to the Manitowoc Public Utilities following completion of the project and before water service is provided. 

A performance bond shall not be required. Failure of petitioner to complete the project as required shall result in the Manitowoc Public Utilities finishing the project or correcting defects and assessing such costs accordingly.

The petitioner shall be responsible for the total cost of water main installations up through 12 inches in size. Where the size of the water main required is larger than 12 inches, the Manitowoc Public Utilities shall refund the difference in the cost of material and installation between the larger main size and a 12-inch main. Such difference shall be determined by actual bid prices or established by the Manitowoc Public Utilities and its contractor.

Should a development or subdivision not be contiguous to existing facilities of the Manitowoc Public Utilities, water mains needed to get water to a real estate development or subdivision shall be installed by the Manitowoc Public Utilities according to either Plan “C” and/or Plan “F.”

Plan “F”

Where a subdivider, promoter or property owner petitions for a water main extension to supply a real estate subdivision or development, and where the most feasible route for the water main extension as decided by the Manitowoc Public Utilities is over property not dedicated for street purposes, the petitioner shall obtain the necessary easements as prescribed by the Manitowoc Public Utilities at no expense to the Manitowoc Public Utilities and such main footage will be assessed as in Plan “C.”

Installment Payment of Water Main Assessments

All water main assessments which exceed $2,500 may be paid upon written application by the property owner in five equal annual installments. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the rate of eight percent per year. Interest shall begin to accrue at this rate on the first day of the year following the year of installation.

Installment payment provisions shall not be available to developers.

The Manitowoc Public Utilities Commission may extend the five-year installment period to a 10-year installment period upon written application from any property owner. Any extension of the installment period shall terminate upon the transfer of the property by the person or persons to whom the extension was granted. The interest rate in effect at the time any 10-year installment payment plan is granted shall remain constant for such 10-year period.

Delayed Water Main Assessments

The Manitowoc Public Utilities Commission may at its discretion delay the payment of water main assessments made against a property owner where there is no immediate benefit to the property owner from the improvement.

In order to qualify for the delayed assessment, the assessed property must be unimproved, and unplatted throughout the period of delay. The owner must make no use of the improvements for which the water main assessment is made during the period of delay and the owner must not sell any part of the property assessed during the period of delay.

No delayed assessment shall be granted unless the total assessment costs exceed the sum of $2,500 and unless the property owner requesting the delayed assessment shall have made the request in writing.

Water main assessments may be delayed for a period up to 10 years from the date of the initial billing for the installation. The applicant for the delayed assessment must sign a form waiving any objections to the improvements made or to the terms of the assessment granted. All assessments for which a delay is granted shall become due and payable on the expiration date of the delay granted; provided, however, that the property owner may elect to pay for the assessment charges over a five-year period commencing on the delayed assessment expiration date with interest computed at the prevailing interest rate charged to all water main assessments at the time such installment payments are made.

Effective September 27, 1983, no interest shall be charged against assessments delayed under these rules. However, should the property be sold, platted, improved, or the improvements for which the assessment was made be utilized before the expiration date granted by the Manitowoc Public Utilities Commission, interest charges at the rate of eight percent per annum shall be added to the original assessment from the date of the first billing for the installation. If the interest rate is changed by the Manitowoc Public Utilities Commission during a delay period, the new rate will only apply to the balance of any outstanding delayed assessment from that point forward.

In the case of delayed assessments granted prior to September 27, 1983, no additional interest shall be charged to the outstanding balances of accumulated principal and interest as they existed during December 31, 1982, subject to the conditions of the interest qualifications as noted above.

Any delay which is granted shall expire on the first to occur of the following events:

A. The expiration date granted by the Manitowoc Public Utilities Commission.

B. The sale of property for which a delayed assessment was granted.

C. The platting or placing of any improvements on the property for which the delayed assessment was granted.

D. The use of the improvements, for which the assessment was made, by the property owner.

The Manitowoc Public Utilities may, at its discretion, limit the expiration of the delay to only a part of the parcel for which the delayed assessment has been granted if such expiration has been caused by one of the events described in subsections (B) through (D) of this section and such event is deemed not to affect the entire parcel.

Recyclables shall be kept separate from other solid waste collected by the licensed garbage hauler and the recyclables shall not be disposed of at a licensed landfill.

(b) Pricing. Commercial garbage haulers shall adopt and utilize a volume based rate structure for the collection of solid waste from occupants of single-family and two- to four-unit residences. The rate structure shall provide a flat base charge for weekly nonrecyclable garbage which is placed in a single container of 45 gallons or less, except as may otherwise be permitted by the Streets Committee and the Department of Natural Resources. The rate structure shall meet the requirements of Wis. Stat. § 287.11 and any other Department of Natural Resources requirements for a volume-based recycling program. The rate structure shall provide that recyclables will be collected at no additional charge to that made for the collection of solid waste to residential customers residing in buildings with four or less dwelling units, except that haulers may make a separate charge for the collection of yard waste and yard debris.

(c) Mixed Load Prohibited. The contents and municipality of origin of each load of garbage or refuse shall be reported accurately to the operators of the landfill in which the garbage is disposed of. In reporting the contents of each load originating in the City of Manitowoc, the hauler shall also report whether the contents consist entirely of residential waste from residential properties with four or less dwelling units, or of any other types of waste. As used in the preceding sentence, residential waste shall exclude any waste collected in containers of more than 100 gallons, as well as any demolition, building or remodeling waste. When the garbage or refuse is disposed of at a landfill, no hauler shall mix garbage, refuse or other waste in any one load, part of which may be compensable by the City and part of which is not compensable by the City. Exceptions may be granted to this provision when the hauler submits a plan for apportioning the mixed load to the City of Manitowoc and the other jurisdictions involved in the plan which is approved in writing by the Director of Public Works and an authorized representative of the other jurisdictions, and the hauler complies with any conditions required in the grant of such permission. Any violation of these mixed load requirements shall be cause for immediate revocation of the license issued to such hauler.

(d) Cooperation with Recycling Program. Commercial garbage haulers shall be required to take other measures, such as preparing reports and providing equipment compatible with available recycling facilities, as the City may require for the successful operation of its recycling program. This obligation shall extend to any requirements placed on the City by the State of Wisconsin or any of its agencies, as well as any measures approved by the City’s Streets and Sanitation Committee which are reasonably necessary for the effective operation of the City’s recycling program.

(e) Fees. All fees, including but not limited to tipping fees, associated with the disposal of waste shall be the sole responsibility of the party delivering the waste to the disposal facility.

(f) Haulers. The garbage haulers are required to abide by the delivery requirements to the specified landfill in accordance with the waste disposal agreement between the City of Manitowoc and the County of Manitowoc.

14.020 Regulation of Dogs, Cats, and Other Animals.

(1) Limit on Possession of Dogs or Cats. No person shall own, harbor, or keep in his possession at any one dwelling at any one time more than three dogs and more than three cats over six months of age, nor more than a total of 12 dogs or cats of any age, for more than three days, nor shall any person retain a litter or portion of a litter of dogs or cats longer than four months, if such litter or portion of a litter increases the total number of dogs or cats to more than three, except that none of the provisions of this subsection apply to the licensee of a duly licensed kennel.

In rare circumstances, the Chief of Police or his designee is authorized to issue a permit allowing a person to keep up to four dogs or four cats at one time in any one dwelling upon receipt of an application accompanied by a $15.00 fee. In determining whether or not to grant any such permit, the Chief of Police or his designee shall consider the likelihood of a public or private nuisance and may contact residents in the neighborhood prior to making a decision. An initial inspection of the property by the Chief of Police or his designee shall be required to confirm that all animals are properly cared for, sheltered, and do not pose a health problem within the property. Any applicant seeking such a permit shall further agree in writing to make their property available for such inspections by the Chief of Police or his designee as a condition of obtaining the permit. Any such permit granted shall be limited to specifically identified dogs or cats owned at the time of permit issuance and shall not automatically apply to later-purchased dogs or cats. 

(2) Restricted Species.

(a) Exotic or Wild Animals Prohibited. No person may bring into or keep, raise, possess or have under such person’s control, either temporarily or permanently, any venomous reptile or snake, constrictor snake or any nonvenomous snake more than five feet in length at maturity, lizard up to more than five feet in length at maturity, poisonous insect or arachnid, a wild animal, including but not limited to a live monkey or other nonhuman primate, alligator or crocodile, bat, cheetah, coyote and coyote-dog hybrids, cougar, fox, jaguar, leopard, lion, lynx, panther, prairie dog, raccoon, skunk, tiger or hybrids thereof, wolf and wolf-dog hybrids, or any other animal or bird of prey which can normally be found in the wild state, without the written permission of the Chief of Police or his designee.

(b) Certain Domestic Species Prohibited. No person may bring into or keep within the corporate limits of the City, either temporarily or permanently, gamecocks and other fighting birds, cows, cattle, horses, sheep, swine, pigs, goats, turkeys, geese, or any other domesticated livestock without the written permission of the Chief of Police or his designee. 

(c) Dangerous Animals Prohibited. No person may bring into or keep within the corporate limits of the City, either temporarily or permanently, a prohibited dangerous animal. Prohibited dangerous animal means any of the following:

1. Any animal that, while off the owner’s or caretaker’s property, has inflicted serious injury to or killed a domesticated animal without provocation;

2. Any animal that inflicts bodily harm to a person on public or private property;

3. Any animal brought from another city, village, town or county that has been declared dangerous or vicious by that jurisdiction;

4. Any animal that is subject to being destroyed under Wis. Stat. § 174.02(3);

5. Any dog trained, owned, or harbored for the purpose of dog fighting.

(d) In considering any request for permission under subsection (2)(a) or (b) of this section, the Chief of Police or his designee shall consider the number and type of animals or creatures, their location, the facilities to be used for such purpose, the likelihood of a public or private nuisance being created or a health hazard, and the ability of the owner to responsibly control and care for the creatures.

(e) Compliance with Federal Regulations. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to buy, sell or offer for sale a native or foreign species or subspecies of mammal, bird, amphibian or reptile, or the dead body or parts thereof, which appears on the endangered species list designated by the United States Secretary of the Interior and published in the Code of Federal Regulations pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1969 (Public Law 135, 91st Congress).

(f) Exemption. The provisions outlined in this section shall not be deemed to prevent the lawful importation, possession, purchase or sale of any species by a public agency; licensed veterinary clinics; pet shops; zoological gardens; public or private educational institutions; agricultural fairs; shows or projects of the 4-H Clubs; a display for judging purposes; circuses and professional animal acts; research purposes; persons holding Federal permits; or by a person holding a scientific collector’s permit issued by the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources of the State; or to any person or organization licensed to present a circus or similar recreational event.

(3) Prohibited Dangerous Animals. The Chief of Police may determine an animal to be a prohibited dangerous animal whenever he finds that an animal meets the definition of a prohibited dangerous animal as set forth in subsection (2)(c) of this section.

(a) Upon conducting an investigation and finding an animal meets the definition of a prohibited dangerous animal, the Chief of Police may issue an order declaring an animal to be a prohibited dangerous animal. Whenever an owner or caretaker wishes to contest an order, he or she shall, within 72 hours after receipt of the order, deliver to the Chief of Police a written objection to the order stating specific reasons for contesting the order. Upon receipt of the written objection, the matter shall be placed on the agenda for the Public Safety Committee to be reviewed at the next regular meeting. The Public Safety Committee shall act as a quasi-judicial body allowing the animal’s owner or caretaker an opportunity to present evidence as to why the animal should not be declared a prohibited dangerous animal. 

(b) Pending the outcome of the hearing, the animal may be confined subject to Wis. Stat. § 173.21 or held at a location outside the limits of the City.

(c) After the hearing, the owner or caretaker shall be notified in writing of the Committee’s determination. If a determination is made that the animal is a prohibited dangerous animal, the owner or caretaker shall remove the animal from within the City within five days after the date of the determination. If the owner or caretaker further contests the determination, he or she may, within five days of receiving the panel’s decision, seek review of the decision by the Circuit Court.

(d) Destruction. Any animal that has caused bodily harm to a person, persons, or a domestic animal on two separate occasions, without reasonable cause, may be destroyed as a result of a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, as specified under Wis. Stat. § 174.02(3). The City Attorney may petition an appropriate court to obtain a court order to destroy such an animal. 

(e) Exemptions. 

1. The Chief of Police may waive the provisions of this section for a law enforcement or military animal upon presentation by the animal’s owner or handler of a satisfactory arrangement for safe keeping of the animal.

2. No animal may be declared dangerous if death, injury or damage is sustained by a person who, at the time such injury or damage was sustained, was committing a trespass on the land or criminal trespass on the dwelling upon premises occupied by the owner of the animal; was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the animal; or was committing or attempting to commit a crime or violating or attempting to violate an ordinance which protects persons or property. 

3. No animal may be declared dangerous if the animal was protecting or defending a human being within the immediate vicinity of the animal from an unjustified attack or assault.

(f) Enforcement. The Chief of Police may make whatever inquiry is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with this section. 

(g) Costs of Disposition. Any owner or caretaker of a prohibited dangerous animal shall pay the costs for the animal’s removal, impoundment, destruction or other disposition. 

(h) Noncompliance. Any person failing to comply with any written terms, conditions or restrictions imposed by the City regarding a dangerous animal shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00 for a first offense and not less than $200.00 nor more than $1,000 for any subsequent offense. Each and every day that such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

(a) No dog or cat, whether licensed or unlicensed, muzzled or not muzzled, shall be allowed upon the streets of the City of Manitowoc or in public places, including but not limited to railway depots, hotels, restaurants, theaters, public conveyances, and stores, unless on a suitable and dependable leash not longer than eight feet in length. 

(b) No owner or keeper of any dog, cat, or any other creature shall permit such dog, cat or other creature to run at large at any time in the City of Manitowoc. A dog, cat, or other creature is to be considered running at large if it is off the premises of the owner or keeper and not under control of the owner or some other person. Any police officer or humane officer may attempt to capture and restrain any dog, cat, or other creature running at large as permitted by the Wisconsin Statutes.

(c) Animal Structures. All stables, coops, yards, pens, kennels or other structures wherein any animal or creature is kept shall be constructed so as to be cleanable and kept in good repair. The inside and outside shall be whitewashed or painted as often as necessary to keep them clean or finished with such material that can be easily cleaned. All such structures shall be kept clean and sanitary and shall not cause any objectionable odor. Accumulations of cleanings or manure of more than one day’s operation in any such structure shall be deemed a violation of this section and subject to a forfeiture action.

Any person who shall have seized or impounded a dog or cat with or without a license shall deliver such dog or cat personally, or shall notify the owner of the fact if such owner is known to the person or can be ascertained with reasonable effort. If the owner is not known or cannot be ascertained with reasonable effort, and if the person seizing or impounding any dog or cat is other than a police officer, such person shall forthwith notify the Police Department of the fact and shall surrender such dog or cat to the Police Department.

(8) Defecation on Private and Public Property Prohibited.

(a) Notice and Designation of Chronic Nuisance Properties. Whenever the Committee determines that a premises meets the definition of a chronic nuisance property, the Committee may direct the Chief to notify the premises owner in writing that the premises constitutes a chronic nuisance. In calculating the requisite nuisance activities, the Committee may count separate qualifying nuisance incidents resulting in enforcement action occurring on the same day (as long as they are distinct in time) or different days, but shall never count nuisance activities that were reported by the owner of the premises. 

1. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 66.0627(7), Police Department responses related to domestic abuse, as defined in Wis. Stat. § 813.12(1)(am), sexual assault as described under Wis. Stat. §§ 940.225, 948.02, and 948.025, or stalking, as described in Wis. Stat. § 940.32, shall not be used in calculating the nuisance activities to constitute a chronic nuisance. 

2. The notice shall contain the street address or legal description sufficient to identify the premises, a description of the nuisance activities that have occurred at the premises, a statement indicating that the cost of future enforcement may be assessed as a special charge against the premises, and a notice as to the appeal rights of the owner. The notice shall be delivered as set forth in subsection (3)(c) of this section.

(b) Notice and Designation of Chronic Nuisance Landlord. Whenever the Committee finds that an owner meets the definition of a chronic nuisance landlord, the Committee may direct the Chief to notify the owner in writing that the owner is declared a chronic nuisance landlord. The notice shall contain the street addresses or legal descriptions sufficient to identify the premises forming the basis for the designation, and the other notice requirements set forth in this subsection (3). The notice shall further provide a statement that the owner shall, within 10 days of receipt of the notice, provide the Committee, in writing, a course of action that will be taken to abate the nuisance activities. The owner shall also be notified that failure to abate the nuisance activities shall result in the owner’s designation of chronic nuisance landlord being posted on the City’s website and in the Herald Times Reporter. 

(c) Notice Procedure. Notice shall be deemed to be properly delivered if sent either by first class mail to the premises owner’s last known address or if delivered in person to the premises owner. If the premises owner cannot be located, the notice shall be deemed to be properly delivered if a copy of it is left at the premises owner’s usual place of abode in the presence of some competent member of the family at least 14 years of age or a competent adult currently residing there and who shall be informed of the contents of the notice. If a current address cannot be located, it shall be deemed sufficient if a copy of the notice is sent by first class mail to the last known address of the owner as identified by the records of the City Assessor or Manitowoc County Register of Deeds. If this address is returned, the Police Department may use any lawful resources available to locate the property owner.

(d) Abatement Plan. Any owner receiving such notice as set forth above shall meet with a Committee representative within 10 business days of receipt of such notice. The parties shall review the problems occurring at the property. Within 10 days of this meeting, a Committee representative, owner and property tenant shall meet, discuss and mutually prepare an abatement plan to address and eliminate the nuisance activity on the property. If the tenant is unable or unwilling to meet on such plan, a Committee representative and the property owner shall nonetheless meet to discuss such abatement plan. The Chief shall provide a written copy of the plan to the tenant. The plan shall also specify a name, address, and telephone number of a person living within 60 miles of the property who can be contacted in the event of further police, fire, or inspection contact. Failure to cooperate with the Committee in drafting a nuisance abatement plan or failure to abide by the terms of a nuisance abatement plan shall be deemed a violation of this section. 

(e) Additional Nuisance Activity. Whenever the Committee determines that additional nuisance activity has occurred at a premises for which notice has been issued as set forth above, that this nuisance activity has occurred not less than 15 days after notice has been issued, and that reasonable efforts have not been made to abate the nuisance activity, the Committee may direct the Chief to calculate the cost of police response and enforcement for this and any subsequent nuisance activities and cause such charges and administrative costs to be assessed and collected as a special charge.

(5) Appeal. Appeal of the determination of the Committee that the property is a chronic nuisance property may be submitted to the Common Council within 10 days of notice. Wis. Stat. Ch. 68 shall not apply to such an appeal.

(6) First Offense. Any person who shall violate any provision of this section or any regulation, rule, or order made hereunder shall forfeit not less than $500.00 nor more than $2,000.

(7) Subsequent Offenses. Any person who shall violate any provision of this section or any regulation, rule, or order made hereunder within 24 months after committing a previous violation of this section shall forfeit not less than $1,000.

14.575 Sexual Offender Residency Restrictions.

(1) Findings and Intent. The Common Council is empowered by Wis. Stat. § 62.11(5) to enact legislation promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the public.

The Wisconsin Statutes provide for the punishment, treatment and supervision of persons convicted or otherwise responsible for sex crimes against children, including their release into the community. Wisc. Stat. Chapter 980 provides for the civil commitment of sexually violent persons, a more dangerous type of sex offender due to their likelihood to reoffend, and specifically, Wis. Stat. § 980.08, provides for the supervised release of such persons into the community.

The City of Manitowoc places a high priority on maintaining public safety through highly skilled and trained law enforcement as well as dependency on laws that deter and punish criminal behavior.

The City finds and declares that sex offenders who prey upon children are a serious threat to public safety and it is necessary for the City to enact reasonable measures to minimize the risk of the children in the City falling prey to sexually violent persons.

This section is a non-punitive, regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the City from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend. It is the intent of this chapter not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the City’s compelling interest in promoting, protecting and improving the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City.

(2) Definitions. As used in this section, and unless the context requires otherwise:

(a) A “sexually violent offense” shall have the meaning as set forth in Wis. Stat. § 980.01(6), as amended from time to time.

(b) A “crime against children” shall mean any of the following offenses set forth within the Wisconsin statutes, as amended, or the laws of this or any other State or the Federal government, having like elements necessary for conviction, where the victim is under the age of 18, respectively:

(17) Period of Grace.

(a) When a person violating any of the provisions of this section with respect to the emission of smoke, dust, cinders, soot, fumes, noxious gases, or waste produces evidence satisfactory to the Department that he has taken all steps possible to provide for compliance with the provisions of this section, but that the acquisition of the proper equipment or device cannot be obtained or effected immediately, the Department shall have the discretion in such cases to allow a period not exceeding 12 months from the date of the applicable provision or provisions of this section, within which the necessary equipment or device is to be acquired and installed. In a case where the Department has granted a grace period of up to one year, and, notwithstanding that the person has given a bona fide order for the equipment required to comply with this section, it appears probable that such equipment will not be delivered within such grace period, the person may apply to the Advisory and Appeal Board for an extension of the grace period, serving notice of such application upon the Department. The Advisory and Appeal Board shall consider such request and within 20 days after receipt of same, if it is satisfied that there is a good cause for further extension of such grace period, by written order may extend such grace period for any time not to exceed one year from the end of the grace period granted by the Department.

(b) During said period of grace granted by the Department or by the Advisory and Appeal Board, the person violating this section shall not be subject to the fines or penalties herein prescribed; provided, however, that where such person fails in the time allowed to conform with the provisions of this section, he shall be subject to all fines and penalties herein prescribed dating from the date of the beginning of the period of grace permitted him.

(1) Permitted Uses. No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used, designed or arranged, for any purpose other than is permitted in the district in which the building or land is located.

(2) Site Plan Approval by City Planning Department or City Plan Commission.

(a) All site plans for:

1. New construction or additions to an existing building;

2. New use or expansion of an existing use which may require additional off-street parking to comply with MMC 15.430;

3. New off-street parking lot areas for five or more vehicles;

4. Unimproved off-street parking lot areas (defined herein as stone or gravel surface lot areas) when they are improved with asphaltic, bituminous or concrete hard surface, and result in a parking lot for five or more vehicles;

5. Existing off-street parking lot areas where there is no expansion of the gross area of the existing parking lot area, as measured from the edge of the parking lot pavement or unimproved surface and including access drives or aisles, ramps or internal moving lanes, but the total number of parking stalls in the lot is increased by 25 percent or greater than the number of stalls in the existing parking lot area and results in a parking lot for five or more vehicles; or

6. The expansion of existing off-street parking lot areas when the gross area of an existing parking lot, as measured from the edge of the parking lot pavement or unimproved surface and including access drives or aisles, ramps or internal moving lanes, is increased by 25 percent or greater than the existing parking lot area and results in a parking lot for five or more vehicles;

shall be referred to the City Planning Department for review and approval in conformance with this subsection (2)(a). No permit shall be issued for such new construction or addition unless the site plan has been approved by the City Planning Department, or City Plan Commission under subsection (2)(g) of this section, which shall ensure that such construction is in accord with the City’s Official Map, zoning and subdivision ordinances, comprehensive plan, and other applicable City codes and ordinances. Residential developments having four or fewer dwelling units on a lot of record need only be submitted to the Director of Building Inspection for approval.

For those projects requiring either the issuance of a building permit by the Director of Building Inspection or an erosion control permit from the City Engineer for a site plan under this subsection (2), failure to issue either permit, if required, within 180 consecutive calendar days from the date of site plan approval by the City Planning Department, shall void the approved project site plan, and such site plan approval shall become null and void, unless the 180-day period is extended by the written authorization of the Director of Building Inspection. If there is no date extension, or upon completion of any agreed upon date extension period, if the above-referenced permits are required but not issued, a new site plan must be filed, and applicable fees must be paid.

Petitions for public works improvements, easements and street dedications shall be required, as applicable, prior to issuance of an occupancy permit. All utility and drainage easements identified on the site plan are subject to standard utility easement conditions as described in a document recorded at the Manitowoc County Register of Deeds in Volume 1252, Page 498 of Records, as document No. 798738, as may be amended from time to time.

(b) Submittal of Site Plans and Review Fee. All nonresidential developments and all residential developments having more than four dwelling units on a lot of record shall require site plan approval by the City Planning Department.

Fourteen copies of site plans (three copies of site plans for residential development of four or fewer units) at a scale no smaller than 50 feet to the inch 

(except, for sites exceeding 10 acres, a smaller scale acceptable to the City Planning Department) shall be submitted to the City Planning Department, for City department and utility review and approval, prior to requesting a building permit. Site plans shall be prepared by a registered surveyor, civil engineer, architect or by a practicing land planner. All site plan information shall be provided on a single sheet, wherever practicable.

All site plans shall also be provided to the City on a three-and-one-half-inch computer diskette, compact disk or other medium specifically approved by the City Planning Department in the City’s current Microstation DGN format or a standard DXF file format, wherever practicable.

Each site plan submitted for review and approval shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee as established by resolution of the Common Council, to help defray the cost of Department and utility review.

The Commission’s determination shall be final and without appeal.

The Commission’s review of a site plan shall in no way prohibit the City Planning Department from approving a site plan and a project commencing prior to the Commission’s review. Notwithstanding the condition(s) being reviewed by the Commission, all site plan compliance requirements shall remain in full force and effect.

In the event there is a dispute or disagreement between the property or project owner or their agent and the City regarding the relevancy or appropriateness of a condition(s) required for compliance to a site plan, the Commission will, upon written request, review the site plan at its next scheduled meeting, and make a final determination whether or not compliance with the condition is required. Unless specifically authorized by the City Planning Department, City Engineer and Director of Building Inspection, no work shall be permitted to proceed on a project from the date the Commission receives the written request, and shall not resume until the Commission has made its final determination. The Commission’s determination shall be final and without appeal.

(h) Review of Public Buildings. All site plans for public buildings shall require the review and approval of the Manitowoc City Plan Commission. A public building under this section refers to any building, structure, facility or complex used by the general public, whether constructed by any State, County, or municipal government agency.

(i) Performance Agreement. All site plans approved after January 1, 2002, for new construction projects under subsection (2)(a)(1) of this section, building additions under subsection (2)(a)(1) of this section that add 30 percent or more building area to existing buildings, new off-street parking lots under subsection (2)(a)(3) of this section, traditional neighborhood development (TND) projects under MMC 15.730, and planned unit development (PUD) projects under MMC 15.750 shall be required to execute a performance agreement with the City Planning Department. After approval of a site plan by the City Planning Department or City Plan Commission under subsection (2)(g) or (h) of this section, and prior to the issuance of a building permit by the Director of Building Inspection, the site plan project owner or authorized representative as defined under MMC 15.730(14) and hereinafter referred to as “owner or project owner” shall execute a performance agreement with the City Planner or Deputy City Planner. The performance agreement shall incorporate all compliance conditions and requirements as identified on an approved site plan to secure the implementation and completion of the site plan as approved, including, but not limited to, the following:

1. Conditions relative to financing of necessary public improvements and facilities;

2. A schedule for commencement and completion of the project and any phases thereof;

3. Time limits for commencement and completion of the development;

4. Requirements for appropriate easements, reservations and land dedications;

5. Letter of credit requirements to assure a timely completion of all landscaping and site improvements required by City ordinance including landscaping and off-street parking requirements under MMC 15.690, requirements of City departments, and State or Federal regulations; and

(j) Covenant Running with the Land. The performance agreement, and any amendments or modifications to the agreement, shall upon being duly executed by all parties be recorded by the City at the Register of Deeds for Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. The cost of recording fees shall be borne by the project owner, and shall be payable at the time the agreement is executed by the parties, or payable to the City within 15 calendar days of the project owner’s receipt of an invoice from the City itemizing these costs. The City at City’s sole expense shall, upon project owner completion of all conditions prerequisite to the approval of a site plan and issuance of a certificate of occupancy, terminate all or the relevant parts of the agreement, and file the necessary legal documents at the Register of Deeds.

(k) Compliance with Performance Agreement. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the Director of Building Inspection for occupancy of a building identified on a site plan pursuant to a performance agreement, the City Planner or Deputy City Planner shall be required to first determine whether the provisions of the performance agreement have been met, and then, if all conditions of the performance agreement have been met, shall sign the certificate of occupancy. The certificate of occupancy shall not be deemed issued until signed by both the Director of Building Inspection and either the City Planner or Deputy City Planner. Occupancy of a project without a certificate of occupancy is in direct violation of this chapter, and the owner shall be subject to penalties under MMC 15.630. If it is determined that the terms of the performance agreement have not been met at any time after the execution of a performance agreement, any party aggrieved by an alleged failure of the project owner or their successors, grantees, heirs and assigns to comply with the performance agreement may request a hearing before the City Plan Commission. The City Planner or Deputy City Planner will provide the project owner with a date for said hearing before the City Plan Commission. The Commission will determine whether the development complies with the performance agreement and may:

1. Amend the approved site plan;

2. Amend the agreement to carry out the purposes of the approved site plan; or

3. Seek enforcement remedies under MMC 15.630.

The Commission’s determination shall be final and without appeal.

(l) Irrevocable Letter of Credit. Simultaneous with the approval of a site plan under this subsection (2) or execution of a performance agreement under subsection (2)(i) of this section, the project owner shall cause to have delivered to the City Planner or Deputy City Planner an original irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit. Hereinafter, the term letter of credit shall be defined to include a letter of credit instrument or comparable security instrument or agreement acceptable to the City, including but not limited to a check from the project owner deemed by the City Planner or Deputy City Planner to, at minimum, cover the cost of the obligations specified in the performance agreement, and shall be provided in form and content to the satisfaction of the City Planner or Deputy City Planner. The letter of credit shall be in an amount approved by the City Planner or Deputy City Planner, and shall not be in an amount less than two percent of the estimated total cost of constructing the project, including buildings, landscaping and on- and off-site improvements, and excluding land acquisition and the purchase of machinery and equipment. The letter of credit shall be issued by a financial institution so authorized to do so, and the original letter of credit shall be delivered to the City Planner or Deputy City Planner. As an alternative to the above and expressly for site plan projects classified under subsections (2)(a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section, the letter of credit requirement shall be established at a minimum of $5,000, and which shall be terminated upon the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Director of Building Inspection. The letter of credit issued at this time shall hereinafter be referred to as the “original letter of credit.” Said original letter of credit shall be from a recognized, financially stable lending institution satisfactory to the City, and shall be written in form and content satisfactory to the City. The original letter of credit, among other things, shall:

1. Name the City as beneficiary;

2. Be irrevocable and unconditional;

3. Be conditioned for payment to the City solely upon presentation of the letter of credit and a sight draft, which shall direct the issuing lending institution to pay the City without any explanation, affidavit or documentation;

4. Expire not earlier than six months after the date the performance agreement is fully executed, and shall provide that the original letter of credit be automatically renewed for successive periods through and including the date upon which a final certificate of occupancy is issued, and without any gaps between the expiration of the original letter of credit and the start of any renewal or new letter of credit; and

5. Authorize the City to draw on the letter of credit, in whole or in part, from time to time, at the City’s election.

Upon the City’s receipt of a request from the owner for occupancy of a project, or for a certificate of occupancy under subsection (2)(m) of this section, the City Planner or Deputy City Planner shall determine if all requirements and conditions identified on the approved site plan have been completed to the satisfaction of the City. The project owner shall be required to submit a written cost estimate of any uncompleted improvements, which shall be based on actual estimates from owner’s contractor(s), engineer or architect. In the event the amount of the original letter of credit issued under this section is not adequate to cover the costs of completing all required landscaping and site improvements, at the time occupancy of the project is requested by the owner, the owner shall cause to have delivered to the City a new letter of credit in an amount equal to 125 percent of the estimated cost of the uncompleted landscaping and site improvements, to guarantee completion of said improvements. The letter of credit issued at this time shall hereinafter be referred to as the “new letter of credit.”

In the event the financial institution issuing the original letter of credit opts to not renew the original letter of credit past the expiration date or if any check provided shall not be honored by the bank or financial institution upon which it is drawn, the project owner shall, prior to occupancy of the project site or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the City, be required to secure a substitute or new letter of credit or comparable security instrument or agreement acceptable to the City which meets the requirements of this section, to cover the required amount and renewal period. If the original letter of credit is not renewed and a substitute or new letter of credit not secured to the satisfaction of the City, the City shall have the right to draw on the original letter of credit, and implement the required landscaping and site improvements to the fullest extent possible. If the cost of required landscaping and site improvements exceeds the amount of funds available or specified in the original letter of credit, the City shall utilize any legal remedies available to collect the additional funds from the project owner to complete the uncompleted improvements, with any and all costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees which are incurred by the City for collection, payable by the project owner.

(m) Certificate of Occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be granted by the City Planner or Deputy City Planner unless and until all requirements in this subsection (2) have been completed to the sole satisfaction of the City. The City Planner or Deputy City Planner, in their discretion, may authorize the temporary occupancy of a project for a maximum period of 12 months, effective from the date temporary occupancy is authorized. The owner shall be given permission to occupy a project that is the subject of a performance agreement under subsection (2)(i) of this section upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

1. Receipt by the City Planner or Deputy City Planner of a letter of credit under subsection (2)(l) of this section; and

2. Receipt of any required payments, deeds, easements or other legal agreements required as a condition of site plan approval.

A certificate of occupancy, indicating the completion of all required landscaping and site improvements, as well as the completion of all building and site plan requirements, shall be issued to the owner upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

1. Completion of all landscaping and site improvements required and specified in an approved site plan; and

2. Receipt of written confirmation from the appropriate site plan review agencies that the required site plan improvements have been satisfactorily completed.

Upon the completion of all required landscaping and site improvements required and specified on the approved site plan, the City shall release its interest under the original and/or new letter of credit.

Any building or structure, which has been wholly or partly erected on any premises located either within or outside of this City, shall not be moved to or placed upon any premises in this City until a permit for such removal has been secured from the Director of Building Inspection. Before a permit may be issued for moving a building or structure, the Director of Building Inspection shall inspect the same and shall determine if it is in a safe condition to be moved and whether it may be reconditioned to comply with the Building Code and other requirements for the use and occupancy for which it is to be used. In addition, the City Plan Commission shall review all applications for the moving of principal buildings into or within the City of Manitowoc to determine that all provisions of this chapter are complied with in the same manner as a new structure; and that conformity or compatibility, as it pertains to property values, design, density of population, and general health and welfare of the City, is attained. Providing these conditions are complied with, a permit shall be issued for the moving of the building or structure. All property owners directly adjacent or opposite the proposed site to which the building is proposed to be moved shall be notified in writing of the meeting at which the Plan Commission is to consider the application for moving.

In instances where there are improvements required by the Plan Commission as a condition of moving a building, an irrevocable letter of credit shall be submitted to the City of Manitowoc in an amount approved by the Director of Building Inspection to cover the estimated cost of said improvements before a permit is issued to allow the moving of the building. Said irrevocable letter of credit shall be from a recognized financial institution in Manitowoc County and shall be written to give the City of Manitowoc authority to draw funds from the account nine months after the date of its issuance, or sooner if public welfare and safety require such. This requirement shall be in addition to the provisions of the Building Code.

(4) Excavations or Holes. The construction, maintenance or existence within the City of Manitowoc of any unprotected, unbarricaded, open or dangerous excavations, holes, pits, or wells, or of any excavations, holes or pits which constitute a danger or menace to the public health, safety, or welfare, are hereby prohibited. This section, however, shall not prevent any excavation under a permit issued pursuant to this chapter and the Building Code of the City of Manitowoc where such excavations are properly protected, and warning signs posted, in such manner as may be approved by the Director of Building Inspection. This section shall not apply to lakes, streams or other natural bodies of water, or to ditches, streams, reservoirs or other major bodies of water created or existing by authority of any governmental agency.

The installation of underground utilities shall be in accordance with the prevailing standards and practices of the utility or utilities (hereinafter referred to, whether one or more, as the “utility”) providing such services.

Associated equipment and facilities which are appurtenant to underground electric and communication systems, including but not limited to pad-mounted transformers, pad-mounted sectionalizing switches and above-grade pedestal-mounted terminal boxes, may be located above ground.

The cost and expense of converting existing overhead facilities to underground, or installing new facilities underground, and connection from such facilities to buildings, residences and other structures, shall be borne by the serving utility. However, if the City Plan Commission determines that the public health, welfare, convenience and pedestrian and vehicular traffic safety in any street or road widening or relocation project require conversion of existing overhead facilities to an underground installation, with connection to the buildings, residences and other structures served thereby, then in any such event, the utility affected shall rebuild their utility facilities at their own cost and expense. Unless waived by the serving utility, all owners or occupants updating or upgrading their electric service entrance and facilities due to an increase in service or due to a substandard voltage condition or a change in the character of their load shall, at their sole expense, be required to pay for the conversion of their own facilities and meet all utility service voltage and location requirements on said particular property.

(c) Easements. In order for the serving utility to be responsible for the costs of connecting the underground utility facilities to buildings, residences and other structures to be served, the utility shall be entitled to obtain from each property owner easements or licenses and permission to enter onto the property of such owner for the purpose of the installation, maintenance or replacement of such utility facilities. Each serving utility shall be responsible for securing the easements. All easements are subject to standard utility easement conditions as recorded at the Manitowoc County Register of Deeds in Volume 1252, Page 498 of Records, as Document No. 798738, as may be amended from time to time.

Property owners or occupants submitting an application for upgrades of their electric service equipment shall be required to meet all serving utility service voltage and location requirements. If the serving utility facilities are not in place to provide underground service, the serving utility shall bear all costs for temporary utility facilities required to serve the upgraded service equipment.

(29) Adaptive Reuse of School, Church and Other Buildings.

(a) The purpose of this section is to facilitate the conversion of older, economically distressed, or historically significant buildings to a new use while keeping the building’s historic features intact.

(b) The Common Council may, in accordance with the procedures under subsection (27) of this section, issue a conditional use permit for the preservation, maintenance and adaptive reuse of any building which meets at least one of the following criteria:

1. Buildings originally designed and constructed as a school building as defined under MMC 15.030, and which are or once were owned by a school district;

2. Buildings originally designed and constructed as a church building as defined under MMC 15.030, and which are or once were owned by a church;

3. Buildings individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or “contributing” structures identified in the “Manitowoc Intensive Resource Survey Final Report” dated June 1988, and as may be amended from time to time;

4. Buildings larger than 100,000 square feet in building area; or

5. Buildings originally designed and constructed as governmental buildings, and which are or once were owned by a governmental agency.

(c) Criteria. In addition to the criteria under subsection (27)(c) of this section, a conditional use permit issued under this section shall require a finding by the Common Council that: (1) the reuse of a building is made more difficult to the extent that the marketable value of such properties may be substantially diminished; and (2) the adaptive reuse of a building furthers the promotion and conservation of the economic value of such buildings and thereby protects and improves the City’s tax base.

(d) Compliance with Development Regulations. A land use authorized under this section is subject to all development regulations applicable to permitted or conditionally permitted uses in the zoning district in which it is located, excepting reductions or waivers under subsection (29)(e) or (f) of this section, and all building improvements related to the adaptive reuse shall be in compliance with any applicable Federal, State or local laws.

(e) Off-Street Parking. Compliance with the parking requirements under MMC 15.430 may render the reuse of buildings under this section unfeasible. Therefore, the City Council may authorize a reduction or waiver to the number of off-street parking spaces normally required for a particular land use pursuant to MMC 15.430(5). Such reduction or waiver may only be authorized as part of a conditional use permit under this section.

(f) Reduction or Waiver of Other Zoning Requirements. The City Council may authorize any permitted or conditionally permitted land use to locate in an adaptive reuse building under this section, and may further reduce or waive area regulations, height regulations, and sign regulations normally required for a particular land use in the zoning district in which it is located. Such reduction or waiver may only be authorized as part of a conditional use permit under this section.

(g) Multiple Occupants. The City Council may authorize a mixture of uses in a single building in accordance with the requirements of this section.

(h) Termination. Unless otherwise authorized by the City Council, any conditional use permit granted under this section may be terminated pursuant to subsection (27)(f) of this section, and shall become invalid upon termination of the use(s) for which the conditional use permit was originally authorized.

(30) Lighting for all permitted uses shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining residential premises.

(31) Vacant Lot Residential Garden Standards.

(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure that a vacant lot residential garden primarily for growing of flowers, vegetables, fruits, herbs, ornamental shrubs or trees is appropriately located and protected to utilize unused, vacant and underutilized land areas and turn them into a productive use; to encourage community health and education, garden-related job training, environmental enhancement and the preservation of green space on sites for which urban gardens represent an appropriate land use.

(b) Principal and Accessory Use. A vacant lot residential garden may be a principal use on a lot, or an accessory use to any primary use permitted on a parcel of land.

(c) On-Site Sales. When grown on-site, the sale of garden products shall be permitted. When permitted, on-site sales are limited to the sale of unprocessed, non-value-added vegetables, flowers or other crops grown on the site. Processing (the process of transforming raw materials into food) and commercial sales of these products on-site are prohibited.

(d) Equipment. Power tools or portable mechanical equipment creating offensive noise, dust, odor, smell and the like shall be prohibited. Within an “R” district, the operation of equipment shall be limited to hours beginning at 8:00 a.m. and ending at 8:00 p.m.

(e) Waste. The site shall be designed and maintained to prevent any chemical pesticide, fertilizer or other garden waste from draining onto an adjacent property. Organic gardening is strongly encouraged.

(f) On-Site Trash Storage. An on-site trash storage container, as well as compost bins or piles, shall be provided on-site, and shall be screened, enclosed and located as close as practicable to the rear lot line. Trash shall be removed from the site at least once per week.

(g) Accessory Structures, Height and Number. The combined area of all accessory structures including, but not limited to, sheds, greenhouses, hoophouses and other temporary structures shall not exceed 25 percent of the lot area, or 250 square feet in area, whichever is the lesser. Accessory structures shall provide a floor to catch chemical runoff, and shall not exceed 15 feet in height as measured from grade. Only one accessory structure shall be permitted per lot of record.

(h) Location in Any Yard. A vacant lot residential garden may be located in any yard area.

(i) Owner Authorization. Only individuals, or organizations authorized by the property owner or an authorized lessor or licensor, shall participate in a vacant lot residential garden.

(j) Identification Sign. One non-animated identification sign shall be allowed which shall not exceed two square feet in area per side, and which shall not exceed six feet in height above grade.

(k) Property Owner Notice to Adjacent Properties. The owner or an authorized lessor or licensor of any lot to be used for a vacant lot residential garden shall give each abutting property owner written notice of the owner’s, lessor or licensor’s name, address and telephone number, and a copy of the use conditions provided in this Code for a vacant lot residential garden, no less than 30 consecutive calendar days prior to the start of the vacant lot residential garden.

(l) Cultivated Areas. Cultivated areas shall be prevented from encroaching onto adjacent properties.

(m) Off-Street Parking. Off-street parking shall not be required for a vacant lot residential garden, unless required by the Common Council. If required, the parking area shall be limited in size so as to not exceed 10 percent of the total lot area, shall be unpaved or surfaced with gravel, or paved with a pervious paving material.

(n) Weeds. It is the duty of the party responsible for a vacant lot residential garden to maintain the property in compliance with City ordinances. A vacant lot residential garden is exempt from the City’s noxious weed ordinance under MMC 13.050. However, noxious and invasive weeds are not permitted in a vacant lot residential garden, and shall be regulated in accordance with the City’s noxious weed control ordinance if they are deemed by the City Engineer to be pervasive at the site, defined herein as a vacant lot garden in which weeds represent more than half of the lot area. In the event a vacant lot residential garden is found to be in violation of the weed ordinance, City crews will post a notice of violation at the property only once per growing season, and request that the weeds be taken care of within five consecutive calendar days of the notice being posted. If the lot remains in violation of the weed ordinance, City crews or their designated contractor are herein authorized to enter the property, mow it, with all costs incurred to be forwarded to the property owner. Following the initial notice of weed violation, if the lot again becomes noncompliant during the remainder of the current growing season, City crews or their designated contractor can enter the property without additional notice, mow it, with all costs incurred to be forwarded to the property owner or the person or party responsible for the vacant lot residential garden for payment; however, if the party fails to issue timely payment to the City under this section, the City may attach the charges against the property payable as a special assessment in accordance with its current special assessment policy.

15.410 Nonconforming Uses, Buildings and Structure Regulations.

(1) Nonconforming Uses.

(a) Continuance of a Nonconforming Use. Any active and actual nonconforming use lawfully existing on or before August 15, 2011, may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date.

(b) Modification of a Nonconforming Use. Except as permitted in this subsection, a nonconforming use shall not be: (1) expanded, enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered unless the use is changed to a use permitted in the zoning district in which the use is located; or (2) changed to another nonconforming use. A nonconforming nonresidential use not served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water may be permitted to expand without being served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water if either, or both, facilities are not available within 1,000 feet of the subject property, and a waiver is granted for such expansion by the Director of Building Inspection.

(c) Moving of Nonconforming Use. No nonconforming use of a building or land may be moved to any other part of a parcel of land upon which same was conducted at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

(d) Discontinuance or Abandonment. When any nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 365 consecutive calendar days from a date specified by the Director of Building Inspection, or is changed into a conforming use, any future use shall be in complete conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

(2) Nonconforming Buildings and Structures.

(a) Continuance of a Nonconforming Building. Any nonconforming principal building existing on or before August 15, 2011, shall be considered as a legal, conforming building, and shall be automatically granted full legal conforming status for size, dimension and location requirements including lot width, lot area, setbacks, parking, or noncompliance with bulk or density requirements in a particular zoning district. Full legal conforming status shall not be available for accessory structures, and shall not extend to or include principal structures located in the floodplain. Any nonconforming principal building created after August 15, 2011, may be allowed to be expanded, enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered; provided, that said expansion, enlargement, extension, reconstruction, movement or alteration complies with the requirements of the specific zoning district in which the affected property is located.

(b) Structural Repair and Alterations of Nonconforming Buildings and Structures. No nonconforming building or structure shall be expanded, enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except to make it a conforming building or structure, or to comply with requirements of health and safety laws or ordinances. The ordinary maintenance and repair of a nonconforming building or structure is permitted, including necessary repairs and incidental alterations which are reasonably necessary to prevent deterioration and promote safe and sanitary conditions, and which do not modify the use of the building or structure, or significantly increase its longevity, or exacerbate the adverse impacts of the nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever a nonconforming building or structure is damaged to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current assessed value, it shall not be restored except in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the structural repairs or alterations in a building or structure either itself nonconforming or containing a nonconforming use shall not, during its lifetime, exceed 50 percent of the assessed valuation of said building or structure unless permanently changed to a conforming status.

(c) Restoration of Certain Nonconforming Buildings and Structures.

Stat. § 62.23(7)(hc)1.b. to the extent of 50 percent or more of its assessed value at the time such damage occurred shall thereafter be made to conform with the provisions of this chapter, and may be reconstructed and used as before, if it has been completely reconstructed within 365 consecutive calendar days from a date specified by the Director of Building Inspection after such calamity.

A damaged or destroyed nonconforming building or structure may be restored to the size, location, and use that it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred, without any limits on the costs of the repair, reconstruction, or improvement if the nonconforming building or structure was damaged or destroyed by causes identified in Wis. Stat. § 62.23(7)(hc)1.

(d) Unsafe Structures. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the Director of Building Inspection or any other City official from initiating remedial or enforcement actions when a lawful nonconforming building or structure is declared unsafe or presents a danger to the public heath, safety or welfare.

(e) Future Modifications. When any lawful nonconforming building or structure in any district is modified so as to be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, any future modification of said structure complies with the requirements of the specific zoning district in which the affected property is located.

(f) Additions or Changes to Existing Structures Located on Legal Nonconforming Width Lots. Any conforming structure which exists on a legal nonconforming width lot may be added on to or altered provided it complies with the requirements of the specific zoning district in which the affected property is located.

Ordinary maintenance repairs, including repairs reasonably necessary to prevent the deterioration of a building or structure, and remodeling of a nonconforming building or structure are permitted, as well as necessary nonstructural repairs and alterations which do not expand, enlarge, extend, move, structurally alter, or intensify the nonconforming building or structure. Ordinary maintenance repairs and remodeling include, but are not limited to, internal and external painting, decorating, paneling, the addition of acoustical ceilings, the installation of heating, electrical and plumbing (including fixtures) or insulation, and the replacement of doors, windows, and other nonstructural components.

(h) Alterations. Subject to subsection (2)(d) of this section, structural alterations may be made to a building containing lawful nonconforming residential units, provided such alterations do not increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a conforming accessory building may be added if none previously existed. However, after August 15, 2011, the principal building on a lot shall not be expanded, enlarged, extended, moved or structurally altered without bringing the expansion, enlargement, extension, relocation or alteration into compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

(i) Timing of Building Permit. Any building or structure for which a validly issued building permit has been lawfully granted on or before August 15, 2011, and which will become nonconforming under the provisions of this chapter or any amendment thereto may be completed in accordance with the approved plans, provided construction is started within 365 consecutive calendar days after the date of issuance of a permit by the Director of Building Inspection for single- and two-family construction; and within 365 consecutive calendar days after the date of issuance of a building permit 

for all other types of development and construction and is completed within 730 consecutive calendar days after the date of issuance of a building permit. If all such conditions are met, the structure shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming building or structure.

(j) Municipal Actions Creating Nonconforming Lot of Record. In the event a lot of record and the principal building thereon shall become nonconforming as a result of the following actions by the United States, Wisconsin, or any instrumentality, agency or subdivision of either: (1) land reservation pursuant to the City’s Official Map; (2) zoning change initiated by the City; (3) right-of-way acquisition; (4) annexation; or (5) condemnation or eminent domain proceedings, said lot of record and the principal building thereon shall be exempt from said requirements to the extent such violation is caused by subsections (2)(j)(1) through (j)(5) of this section, and shall be deemed to be legal and conforming with City ordinances. This exemption shall only be applicable for: (1) nonconformance to lot width, lot area, setbacks, parking or noncompliance with bulk or density requirements in a particular zoning district; and (2) lots of record and principal buildings that were legal and conforming prior to the date of the municipal actions identified herein.

Such parking spaces shall be reserved for the sole use of the occupants of the building or lot and the visitors thereto. However, churches, theaters, museums, stadiums, auditoriums, other places of assembly, retail stores, business and professional office complexes may make arrangements for joint use of parking spaces as hereinafter specified.

(2) General Provisions. For the purposes of this section, the following general provisions shall apply:

(a) This section outlines minimum off-street parking requirements for land uses in the City. Minimum off-street parking requirements, by land use category, are found in subsection (4) of this section. The following calculation shall be used to determine the minimum off-street parking requirement for a particular building, structure or premises in the City:

The number of off-street parking spaces required that are based on the formulas provided for various land uses under subsection (4) of this section; plus

One additional off-street parking space for each vehicle owned by a facility occupying a particular building, structure or premises and used in connection therein; plus or minus

Adjustments for providing parking for bicycles under subsection (14) of this section and motorcycles under subsection (15) of this section.

These regulations shall govern off-street parking in the City, unless modified by the City’s Plan Commission as detailed under subsection (5) of this section. Usage of the term staff member in this section shall mean all employees at a particular building, structure or premises, including doctors and the like.

Parking spaces intended to be used for temporary snow storage or outdoor garden center displays, sales and the like shall not be included in the minimum off-street parking space totals for a particular building, structure or premises.

(b) There shall be provided, at the time any building or structure is hereafter built, enlarged, or converted or the use of the building or premises is altered through the addition of dwelling units, guest rooms, seating capacity, or gross floor area, or expansion of use, or change of use, off-street parking spaces as set forth in this section. Such space shall be maintained and shall not be encroached upon so long as said principal building or structure remains, unless an equivalent number of such spaces are provided elsewhere in conformance with this section. Also, if an existing building or structure is occupied by a new use which would require greater parking and/or loading space than is provided with the building, the Director of Building Inspection may waive the additional parking requirements provided the Director finds that the existing development renders compliance with the requirements impractical;

(c) The parking spaces required for dwelling units shall be located on the same parcel as the dwelling units and the parking spaces required for other uses shall be located on the same parcel as the use or within 400 feet of the permitted use, such distance to be measured along lines of public access to the property. If not located on the same parcel, then a cross easement or shared use agreement pursuant to subsection (8) of this section suitable to the City Planner or Deputy City Planner shall be executed and recorded at the sole expense of the parties to said agreement, in the Manitowoc County Register of Deeds, against the title of all properties affected by said agreement, and shall run with the title to these properties.

(3) Units of Measurement. For the purpose of this section, the following units of measurement shall apply:

(a) Gross floor area in the case of offices, merchandising or service types of uses shall mean the sum of the floor areas within a building, including basements, mezzanines and intermediate floored tiers, used or intended to be used for service to the public as customers, patrons, clients, or patients, including areas occupied by fixtures and equipment used for display or sale of merchandise. It shall not include areas used principally for nonpublic purposes such as basements, boiler/mechanical rooms, interior vehicular parking or loading areas, storage rooms, stairways, incidental repair, processing or packaging of merchandise, show windows, offices incidental to the management or maintenance of stores or buildings, toilets or rest rooms, utility rooms, or dressing, fitting or alteration rooms;

(c) In stadiums, sports arenas, churches or other places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews, or similar seating facilities, each 18 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining requirements for off-street parking facilities under this section; and

(d) When units of measurement for determining required parking spaces result in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction shall require one parking space.

(4) Minimum Off-Street Parking Space Requirements. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces accessory to designated uses in other districts shall be provided as follows: In the Central Business District, accessory off-street parking spaces shall not be required, except for buildings containing dwelling units or lodging rooms.

(5) Reduction of Parking Space.

(a) Notwithstanding the amount of off-street parking required under this section and in response to increased flexibility with minimum parking requirements to reflect typical daily demand and allow innovative parking provisions, the City Plan Commission may approve less off-street parking than required under this section when:

1. The proponent of a use demonstrates that, because of special circumstances including bicycle and motorcycle parking arrangements under subsections (14) and (15) of this section involved with a particular use, it is evident that the off-street parking required by this section exceeds any reasonable likely need; or

2. The use of a building is changed in such a manner that the new use would require fewer spaces.

(b) The applicant shall bear the burden of proof to demonstrate to the City Plan Commission that each of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The applicant shall demonstrate, using existing and projected (five years) employment, customer, or other relevant data, that the reduction in off-street parking spaces to be initially developed as required by this section is warranted.

A. The applicant shall submit plans of the parking lot which designate a layout for the total number of parking spaces needed to comply with the parking requirements contained herein;

B. The plans shall clearly designate which of these parking spaces are proposed to be conditionally reserved for potential future use;

C. The portion of the required parking spaces conditionally reserved for future use shall not be within areas for required buffer yards, setbacks, or areas which would otherwise be unsuitable for parking due to the physical characteristics of the land or other requirements of this chapter; and

D. Areas conditionally reserved for potential future use shall be attractively landscaped, remain in open space, and shall not be used for any structure or building, or for material storage.

The City Plan Commission reserves the right to require property owners, developers, owners/operators, lessees and licensees of a specific building, structure or premises to maintain in open space the area where off-street parking has been reduced by the Commission, or is no longer required as a result of the Commission’s action under this section. The City Plan Commission further reserves the right to require property owners, developers, owners/operators, lessees and licensees of a specific building, structure or premises to enter into written agreements with the City Planner or Deputy City Planner to formalize the implementation of a reduction of parking spaces from the level specified in this section, or joint use or shared parking arrangements under subsection (8) of this section, to maintain each conditionally reserved area as attractive, landscaped open space, and to convert some or all of the conditionally reserved area to additional off-street parking if at any time the Director of Building Inspection finds that additional parking spaces are needed.

(6) Unspecified Uses. In the case of a use not specifically listed in the land use charts contained in this chapter, requirements for off-street parking shall be determined by the Director of Building Inspection. The determination by the Director shall be based upon the specific needs of the development as determined by the Director including, but not limited to, the type of activity, intensity, number of employees and the most comparable land use listed. The applicant shall have the burden of proof for a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces, and shall provide any required documentation as requested by the Director.

(7) Collective Provision. In “B,” “C” and “I” Zoning Districts, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the collective provision of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses; provided, that the total of such off-street parking spaces supplied collectively shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for each such use as specified herein. A maximum distance of 400 feet between parking facilities and buildings or uses served shall apply to each establishment participating in the collective provision for parking. In those cases where parking is provided off site or where used jointly, a written agreement to guarantee access to the parking for all parties to the agreement shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form by the City Planner or Deputy City Planner, and shall be filed with the application for a site plan under MMC 15.370(2) or building permit.

(8) Joint Use Provision. Joint use of required parking spaces is encouraged where two or more uses on the same or separate sites are able to share the same parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different times.

(a) Joint Use Parking Requirements. Joint use of required nonresidential parking spaces is allowed if the following documentation is submitted in writing to the City Planner or Deputy City Planner as part of a site plan under MMC 15.370(2) or building permit:

1. The names and addresses of the owners or occupants and respective uses that are sharing the parking;

2. The location and number of parking spaces that are being shared;

3. An analysis showing that the peak parking times of the uses occur at different times, and that the parking area will be large enough for the anticipated demands of all uses; and

4. A legal instrument such as an easement or written agreement that guarantees access to the parking for all uses, and that the parking spaces shall be maintained so long as the uses requiring parking are in existence unless the required parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with this section.

(b) For the purposes of this section the following provisions governing joint use shall apply:

1. Parking spaces already provided to meet off-street parking requirements for theaters, stadiums, auditoriums, or other places of public assembly, stores, office buildings, and industrial establishments, lying within 400 feet of a church as measured along lines of public access that are made available for other parking, may be used to meet not more than 75 percent of the off-street parking requirements of the church; and

2. Parking spaces already provided to meet off-street parking requirements for stores, office buildings, and industrial establishments, lying within 400 feet of a place of public assembly as measured along lines of public access, may be used to meet not more than 50 percent of the total requirements of such place of assembly.

(9) Mixed Occupancies. In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities for any other use, except as hereinabove specified for collective provision.

(10) Off-Street Loading Requirements. There shall be provided on the same lot with every building, structure or part thereof erected or altered, where large amounts of goods are received or shipped, hereafter to be used for other than exclusive dwelling purposes, adequate space for standing, loading and unloading motor vehicles in order to avoid undue interference with the public use of streets or alleys. Such space, unless otherwise adequately and specifically provided for, shall be at least 10 feet wide by at least 25 feet in length with 15 feet height clearance. The minimum number of loading spaces shall be increased in accordance with the estimated volume and frequency of the loading and unloading requirements of the proposed use of the building. No portion of the vehicle shall project into a street or alley. Such space shall be designed for direct access to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movement on the street. Truck access shall be so designed as to allow each truck to enter and leave in a forward motion. All open off-street loading spaces shall be provided with the same surface improvements as required for parking areas in subsection (12)(c) of this section. Space required and allocated for off-street loading shall not be allocated or used to satisfy the space requirements for off-street parking.

15.450 Sign Ordinance.

(1) Title. This section shall be known as, referred to or cited as the “Sign Ordinance, City of Manitowoc, Wisconsin.”

(2) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to create the legal framework to regulate, administer, and enforce outdoor sign advertising and display within the City of Manitowoc. This section recognizes the need to protect the safety and welfare of the public and the need for well maintained and attractive sign displays within the community, and the need for adequate business identification, advertising, and communication.

This code authorizes the use of signs visible from public rights-of-way provided the signs are:

(a) Compatible with the zoning regulations;

(b) Designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner that they do not endanger public safety or traffic safety;

(c) Legible, readable and visible in the circumstances in which they are used;

(d) Respectful of the reasonable rights of other advertisers whose messages are displayed; and

(e) Promote an attractive environment by minimizing visual clutter and confusion, minimizing adverse effects on nearby property, and preserving the City’s distinctive cultural and historic geographic districts and neighborhoods.

The sign regulations set forth in this chapter regulate sign height, area, placement, animation, illumination and timing. The intent of these regulations is to provide a set of standards designed to optimize communication and quality of signs through emerging technologies, while protecting the public and the aesthetic character of the City. All signs developed within the City shall be required to meet the standards established in this chapter, except where otherwise specifically noted.

This section shall be applied and interpreted so as to eliminate any regulation or differential treatment based on content, except where required to protect public health and safety and where essential to provide directional or locational information. No provision of this section which purports to regulate or differentially treat signage based on content, except as provided in the foregoing sentence, shall be enforced.

(3) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this section to repel, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall govern.

(4) Definitions.

Abandoned sign means all signs including any framework, uprights, braces, pedestals, poles, trim, or molding which support a sign face, and no longer correctly directs or exhorts any person, advertises a bona fide business, lessor, owner, product or activity conducted, or product available on the premises where the sign is displayed.

Animated sign means a sign with a fixed or changing display/message composed of a series of lights that may be changed by electrical, electronic or computerized process or remote control. An animated sign may be fixed (permanently attached to real property) or movable, and may include, but not be limited to, light emitting diodes (LED), video, television and plasma screens and holographic images. Animated signs include the following:

(a) A sign whose alphabetic, pictographic, or symbolic informational content can be changed or altered on a fixed display screen composed of electronically illuminated segments;

(b) A sign or any part of a sign that changes physical position by any movement or rotation or that gives the visual impression of such movement or rotation;

(c) A sign with action, motion, or an illusion of either, or changing colors which require either electrical, solar or wind powered energy;

(d) A sign that uses movement, lighting, change of lighting, or special materials to depict action or create a special effect or scene to imitate movement;

(e) A sign that, through the use of moving structural elements, flashing or sequential lights, lighting elements, or other automated method, results in movement, the appearance of movement, or change of sign image or text;

(f) A sign with automatic changing copy, flashing copy or lights, revolving signs, and signs with stroboscopic lights, intermittent lights, beacons or any other type or style of lights;



(g) Electronic display screens, electronic message centers, and billboards/off-premises signs with digital technologies; and

(h) Any movable animated sign not permanently attached to the ground or other permanent structure, or a sign originally designed to be transported, including, but not limited to, signs designed to be transported by means of wheels. A movable animated sign includes signs available for use for a fee, payment in lieu of a fee, free of charge, or other arrangement by individuals, businesses or other entities for a limited period of time. A movable animated sign is also a temporary sign.

Signs or portions of a sign with a message content that is strictly limited to time, date, temperature, or gas prices shall not be construed to be animated.

Area of copy means the entire area within a single, continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles which encloses the extreme limits of the advertising message, announcement, or decoration of a wall sign.

Area of sign means the area of the largest single face of the sign within a perimeter which forms the outside shape including any frame that forms an integral part of the display, but excluding the necessary supports or uprights on which the sign may be placed.

(b) Electric Signs. This section recognizes that electric signs are controlled under the special equipment provisions of the National Electrical Code and the City electrical ordinance. It is also recognized that electric sign contractors have developed a specialized trade of high voltage discharge electric sign installation and maintenance to properly install and service high voltage electric signs. Electric sign contractors and their employees are herein authorized to perform the following specific tasks:

1. Install exterior electric signs, ballasts, or high voltage transformers to sockets or outline lighting tubes, but may not connect said signs to the primary branch circuit;

2. Install interior electric signs, but may not connect said signs to the primary branch circuit; and

3. Maintain and replace any electric component within the sign, on its surface, or between the sign and building for exterior signs only. This section prohibits the electric sign contractor or its employees from performing work on electric signs in contradiction to the National Electrical Code or the City electrical ordinance.

15.470 Airport Height and Use Limitation Zoning Ordinance.

(1) Title. This section shall be known as, referred to or cited as “The Airport Height and Use Limitation Zoning Ordinance of Manitowoc, Wisconsin.”

(2) General Provisions.

(a) Authority. These regulations are adopted under the authority of Wis. Stat. § 114.136, as amended.

(b) Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to protect the aerial approaches to the airport site by regulating and restricting the use, location, height, number of stories and size of buildings and structures and objects of natural growth in the vicinity of the airport in order to promote the public safety, welfare and convenience.

(c) Jurisdiction. The regulations of this section shall apply to buildings, structures, objects of natural growth and for uses that are located not more than three miles from the boundaries of the airport site, and which are in areas included within zones shown on the “Height Limitation Zoning Map, Manitowoc County Airport, Manitowoc, Wisconsin,” dated September 9, 2008.

(d) Severability. If any of the provisions of this section or the application thereof to any persons or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are declared to be severable.

(e) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of aerial approach protection provided by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes only and is based on engineering experience and scientific method of study. This section, however, does not imply that buildings, structures, uses or objects of natural growth permitted will be totally free from the hazards of aircraft, nor shall this section create a liability on the part of or be a cause of action against the City of Manitowoc, or any officer or employee thereof, for any damages that may result from reliance on this section.

(f) Other Ordinances. This section supersedes all provisions of any City of Manitowoc zoning ordinances which relate exclusively to height limitations adjacent to the airport.

(3) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, certain words and terms are defined as follows:

Airport means the Manitowoc County Airport formerly known as the Manitowoc Municipal Airport located in Sections 12 and 13, Town 19 North, Range 23 East, and Sections 7 and 18, Town 19 North, Range 24 East, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin.

Airport hazard means any structure, object of natural growth, or use of land which obstructs the air space required for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at an airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or taking off.

Nonconforming use means any building, structure, tree or use of land which does not conform to a regulation prescribed in this section or any amendment thereto, as of the effective date of such regulation.

Person means any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock association, or body politic, and includes any trustee, receiver, assignee, or other similar representative thereof.

Runway means a level portion of an airport having a surface specially developed and maintained for the landing and takeoff of aircraft.

Structure means any object constructed or installed by man.

Tree means any object of natural growth, except farm crops which are cut at least once a year, and except shrubs, bushes or plants which do not grow to a height of more than five feet.

Terms not defined in this section shall be as defined in the Manitowoc City Zoning Ordinance, subdivision regulations, in Wisconsin Statutes, or if not defined in any of the preceding, the terms shall be used with a meaning of common or standard utilization. Words used in the present tense include the future, words in the singular number include the plural numbers, and words in the plural number include the singular number. The word shall is mandatory, not permissive.

(4) Establishment of Zones. To carry out the purpose of this section, the area within three miles of the Manitowoc County Airport is divided into zones established by this section which are shown on the map entitled “Height Limitation Zoning Map, Manitowoc County Airport, Manitowoc, Wisconsin,” dated September 9, 2008, which is attached and adopted as part of the ordinance codified in this section.

(a) Interpretation of Zone Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any zone, the following rules shall apply:

1. Where zone boundaries are indicated as being approximately coterminous with street or highway centerlines, right-of-way lines, platted lot lines, section lines, quarter section lines or other survey lines, such lines shall be construed to be said boundaries;

2. Where the boundary of a zone follows the shoreline of a stream, lake or other body of water, the zone boundary line shall be interpreted as following the high-water mark of such shoreline and, in the event of a change in shoreline, shall be construed as moving with said shoreline;

3. The Board of Appeals shall decide contested cases in which the actual location of a zone is disputed. The Board shall use the following procedure in such determination:

A. In all cases, the person contesting the location of the zone boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board of Appeals and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. The Board shall not allow deviations from the boundary lines as mapped unless the evidence clearly and conclusively establishes that the mapped location or the interpretation of the mapped location is incorrect.

B. The Board of Appeals may examine any available evidence that is relevant to determine zone boundaries.

(5) Zone Regulations.

(a) Height Regulation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no structure shall be constructed, altered, located or permitted to remain after such construction, alteration or location, and no trees shall be allowed to grow, to a height in excess of the height limit indicated on the map referred to in subsection (4) of this section.

(b) Use Restrictions.

1. Activities. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, no use may be made of land in any zone in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, or make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, or result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, or impair visibility, in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft.

2. Exceptions. The restrictions contained in subsection (4) of this section shall not apply to objects which are less than 35 feet in height above ground level at the object site.

(6) Nonconforming Uses.

(a) Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed in subsections (4) and (5) of this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any nonconforming use, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use, except as otherwise provided by subsections (8)(c)(2) and (3) of this section.

(b) Changes. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, if the construction or alteration of such was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, and if such is diligently prosecuted.

(c) Removal. This section shall not interfere with the removal of nonconforming uses by purchase or the use of eminent domain.

(7) Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals established under Wis. Stat. § 62.23 (1973), as amended for the adopted Manitowoc City Zoning Ordinance, shall be the Board of Appeals under this section and shall have the duties, powers, and functions provided for by Wis. Stat. § 62.23, as amended. The Board of Appeals shall act in accordance with MMC 15.550.

(8) Administration and Enforcement.

(a) Enforcement. This section shall be administered and enforced within the Manitowoc municipal limits through its designated agent, which is the Department of Building Inspection.

(b) Administration. It shall be the duty of the Director of Building Inspection to administer the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the Director of Building Inspection upon a form furnished by him.

(c) Permits.

1. Future Uses. No structure or use shall hereafter be constructed, erected, installed, moved or structurally altered or permitted in any zone created by subsection (4) of this section until the owner or his agent shall have applied in writing for a permit therefor, and obtained such permit from the Director of Building Inspection, except for structures less than 35 feet in height above the ground. Said permit shall be posted in a prominent place on the premises prior to and during the period of construction, erection, installation or establishment. The Director of Building Inspection shall have the right to trim, prune, or remove at the owner’s expense any tree which was planted after adoption of the ordinance codified in this section and be found to be in violation of the height restriction for the zone in which it is located. Application for such permit shall indicate the use for which the permit is desired, and shall describe and locate the use with sufficient particularity to permit the Director of Building Inspection to determine whether such use would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the Director of Building Inspection shall issue the permit applied for.

2. Existing Uses. Before any nonconforming structure may be replaced, altered or rebuilt, a permit shall be applied for and secured in the manner prescribed by subsection (8)(c)(1) of this section authorizing such change, replacement or repair. (No such permit shall be denied if the structure will not become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, or than it was when the application for permit was made.)

3. Hazard Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted under subsections (7) and (8) of this section may, if such action is deemed advisable by the Board of Appeals to effectuate the purpose of this section and if such is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structures or trees in question to permit the owner of the airport, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to the flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

(9) Amendments. The Mayor and Common Council may from time to time amend, supplement or repeal the regulations or change the district boundaries of this section in accordance with the procedure provided in Wis. Stat. § 114.136(2), as amended.

(10) Penalties. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall, upon conviction, forfeit not less than $20.00 nor more than $2,000 for such offense, together with the costs of prosecution, and in default of payment of such forfeiture and costs of prosecution shall be imprisoned in the City Jail until said forfeiture and costs are paid, but not to exceed 30 days for each violation. Each day that a violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense.

15.490 Floodplain Zoning Ordinance.

(1) Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Statement of Purpose, Title and General Provisions.

(a) Statutory Authorization. The ordinance codified in this section is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stat. §§ 61.35 and 62.23 and the requirements in Wis. Stat. § 87.30.

(b) Finding of Fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of this municipality would impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base.

(c) Statement of Purpose. This section is intended to regulate floodplain development to:

1. Protect life, health and property;

2. Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;

3. Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;

4. Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;

5. Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;

6. Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;

7. Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers;

8. Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and

9. Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.

(d) Title. This section shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

(e) General Provisions.

1. Areas to Be Regulated. This section regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood.

Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.

2. Official Maps and Revisions. The boundaries of all Floodplain Districts are designated as floodplains or A Zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Manitowoc Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the City Plan Commission and Building Inspection Department, City of Manitowoc. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive approved information shall apply.

A. Official Maps. Based on the FIS, Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55071C0189D, 55071C0193D, 55071C0213D, 55071C0284D, 55071C0301D, 55071C0302D, 55071C0303D, 55071C0304D, 55071C0306D, 55071C0307D, 55071C0308D, 55071C0309D, 55071C0311D, 55071C0312D, 55071C0316D, 55071C0317D, and 55071C0326D, including the Index 55071CIND0A, dated August 2, 2011; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) 55071CV000A, dated August 2, 2011.

Approved by: The DNR and FEMA.

3. Establishment of Districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:

A. The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.

B. The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway.

C. The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.

4. Locating Floodplain Boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsection (1)(e)(4)(A) or (B) of this section. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to subsection (9) of this section. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection (8)(c) of this section and the criteria in subsections (1)(e)(4)(A) and (B) of this section.

A. If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.

B. Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department.

Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to subsection (9)(a) of this section.

5. Removal of Lands from Floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this section shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to subsection (9) of this section.

Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a letter of map change (LOMC).

6. Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this section shall be in compliance with the terms of this section, and other applicable local, State, and Federal regulations.

7. Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this section and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stat. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of State highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stat. § 30.2022(1) applies.

8. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.

A. This section supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stat. § 62.23 or Wis. Stat. § 87.30, which relates to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this section, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.

B. This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail.

9. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this section are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this section, required by Wis. Admin. Code NR 116, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this section.

10. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The flood protection standards in this section are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This section does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this section create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this section.

11. Severability. Should any portion of this section be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected.

12. Annexed Areas for Cities and Villages. The Manitowoc County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Wis. Admin. Code NR 116 and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality’s Official Zoning Map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway.

13. General Development Standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this section.

(2) Definitions.

C. The inundation caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels along the shore of Lake Michigan; or

D. The sudden increase caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a seiche, or by some similarly unusual event.

Flood frequency means the probability of a flood occurrence which is determined from statistical analyses. The frequency of a particular flood event is usually expressed as occurring, on the average, once in a specified number of years or as a percent chance of occurring in any given year.

Floodfringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway which is covered by flood waters during the regional flood and associated with standing water rather than flowing water.

Flood Hazard Boundary Map means a map designating approximate flood hazard areas. Flood hazard areas are designated as unnumbered A Zones and do not contain floodway lines or regional flood elevations. This map forms the basis for both the regulatory and insurance aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) until superseded by a Flood Insurance Study and a Flood Insurance Rate Map.

Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means a map of a community on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both special flood hazard areas (the floodplain) and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. This map can only be amended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Flood Insurance Study means a technical engineering examination, evaluation, and determination of the local flood hazard areas. It provides maps designating those areas affected by the regional flood and provides both flood insurance rate zones and base flood elevations and may provide floodway lines. The flood hazard areas are designated as numbered and unnumbered A Zones. Flood Insurance Rate Maps, that accompany the Flood Insurance Study, form the basis for both the regulatory and the insurance aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program.

Floodplain means land which has been or may be covered by flood water during the regional flood. It includes the floodway and the floodfringe, and may include other designated floodplain areas for regulatory purposes.

Floodplain island means a natural geologic land formation within the floodplain that is surrounded, but not covered, by floodwater during the regional flood.

Floodplain management means policy and procedures to ensure wise use of floodplains, including mapping and engineering, mitigation, education, and administration and enforcement of floodplain regulations.

Flood profile means a graph or a longitudinal profile line showing the relationship of the water surface elevation of a flood event to locations of land surface elevations along a stream or river.

Floodproofing means any combination of structural provisions, changes or adjustments to properties and structures, water and sanitary facilities and contents of buildings subject to flooding, for the purpose of reducing or eliminating flood damage.

Flood protection elevation means an elevation of two feet of freeboard above the water surface profile elevation designated for the regional flood. (Also see freeboard.)

Flood storage means those floodplain areas where storage of floodwaters has been taken into account during analysis in reducing the regional flood discharge.

Floodway means the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional flood discharge.

Freeboard means a safety factor expressed in terms of a specified number of feet above a calculated flood level. Freeboard compensates for any factors that cause flood heights greater than those calculated, including ice jams, debris accumulation, wave action, obstruction of bridge openings and floodways, the effects of watershed urbanization, loss of flood storage areas due to development and aggregation of the river or stream bed.

Habitable structure means any structure or portion thereof used or designed for human habitation.

Hearing notice means publication or posting meeting the requirements of Wis. Stat. Ch. 985. For appeals, a Class 1 notice, published once at least one week (seven days) before the hearing, is required. For all zoning ordinances and amendments, a Class 2 notice, published twice, once each week consecutively, the last at least a week (seven days) before the hearing. Local ordinances or by-laws may require additional notice exceeding these minimums.

High flood damage potential means damage that could result from flooding that includes any danger to life or health or any significant economic loss to a structure or building and its contents.

D. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

Increase in regional flood height means a calculated upward rise in the regional flood elevation, equal to or greater than one-hundredth foot, based on a comparison of existing conditions and proposed conditions which is directly attributable to development in the floodplain but not attributable to manipulation of mathematical variables such as roughness factors, expansion and contraction coefficients and discharge.

Land use means any nonstructural use made of unimproved or improved real estate. (Also see development.)

Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities. The term manufactured home includes a mobile home but does not include a mobile recreational vehicle.

Mobile recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled, carried or permanently towable by a licensed, light-duty vehicle, is licensed for highway use if registration is required and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. Manufactured homes that are towed or carried onto a parcel of land, but do not remain capable of being towed or carried, including park model homes, do not fall within the definition of mobile recreational vehicles.

Municipality or municipal means the city enacting, administering and enforcing this Zoning Ordinance.

New Construction. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain zoning regulations adopted by this community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purpose of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

NGVD or National Geodetic Vertical Datum means elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1929 adjustment.

Nonconforming structure means an existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this section for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the Floodfringe District is a conforming use. However, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.)

Nonconforming use means an existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this section for the area of the floodplain which it occupies (such as a residence in the floodway).

Obstruction to flow means any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development alone or together with any future development will cause an increase in regional flood height.

Official Floodplain Zoning Map means that map, adopted and made part of the ordinance codified in this section, as described in subsection (1)(e) of this section, which has been approved by the Department and FEMA.

Open space use means those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures.

Ordinary high-water mark means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark, such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.

Person means an individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, municipality or State agency.

Private sewage system means a sewage treatment and disposal system serving one structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure.

Public utilities means those utilities using underground or overhead transmission lines such as electric, telephone, and distribution and collection systems such as water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer.

Reasonably safe from flooding means base flood waters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the special flood hazard area and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings.

Regional flood means a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.

Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

Structure means any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.

Subdivision has the meaning given in Wis. Stat. § 236.02(12).

Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred.

Substantial improvement means any structural repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the present equalized assessed value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. The term does not, however, include either: (A) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (B) any alteration of a structure or site documented as deserving preservation by the Wisconsin State Historical Society or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered structural repairs, modifications or additions. Such ordinary maintenance repairs include internal and external painting, decorating, paneling, and the replacement of doors, windows, and other nonstructural components. (For purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.)

Unnecessary hardship means where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this section.

Variance means an authorization by the Board of Appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance.

Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Watershed means the entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water.

Water surface profile means a graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas.

Well means an excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring, drilling, driving or other methods, to obtain groundwater regardless of its intended use.

Zoning Administrator shall mean the Director of Building Inspection or designee.

Improvement parcel is the unit of property which includes a physical betterment constituting an improvement and the land embracing the site thereof, and is treated as a single entity for the purpose of levying real estate taxes.

(3) Historic Structures and Sites Designation Criteria.

(a) For purposes of this chapter, an historic structure or historic site designation may be placed on any site, natural or improved, including any building, improvement or structure located thereon, or any area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the City, such as historic structures or sites which:

1. Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the Nation, State or community; or

2. Is identified with historic personages or with important events in National, State or local history; or

3. Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or specimen, inherently valuable for a study of a period, style, method of construction, or of indigenous materials or craftsmanship; or

4. Is representative of the notable work of a master builder, designer or architect whose individual genius influenced his age; or

5. Has been identified in the “Manitowoc Intensive Resource Survey Final Report,” dated June 1988, or any subsequent revision thereto, as an individual building or area considered historically or architecturally significant by National Register standards.

(b) The Commission may adopt specific operating guidelines for landmark sites designation providing such are in conformance with the provisions of this subsection.

(4) Powers and Duties.

(a) Designation. The Commission shall have the power, subject to subsection (5) of this section, to recommend to the Common Council the designation of historic structures, historic sites and historic districts within the City. Such designations shall be made based on the criteria in subsection (3) of this section. Once designated, such historic structures, sites and districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter. Historic district designations must also first be approved by the Common Council.

(b) Regulation of Construction, Reconstruction and Exterior Alteration.

1. Any application for a permit from the Director of Building Inspection involving the exterior of a designated historic site or structure within an historic district shall be filed with the Historic Preservation Commission.

2. No owner or person in charge of an historic site or structure within an historic district shall reconstruct or alter all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties within an historic district or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the Historic Preservation Commission. Unless such certificate has been granted by the Commission, the Director of Building Inspection shall not issue a permit for any such work.

3. Upon filing of any application with the Historic Preservation Commission, the Commission shall determine:

A. Whether, in the case of a designated historic structure or site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature of the improvement upon which said work is to be done;

B. Whether, in the case of the construction of a new improvement upon an historic site, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site; and

C. Whether, in the case of any property located in an historic district designated hereunder, the proposed construction, reconstruction or exterior alteration does not conform to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for said district as duly adopted by the Common Council.

4. If the Commission determines subsections (4)(b)(3)(A), (B) and (C) of this section in the negative, it shall issue the certificate of appropriateness. Upon the issuance of such certificate, the building permit shall then be issued by the Director of Building Inspection. The Commission shall make this decision within 30 consecutive calendar days of the date the application has been filed. Should the Commission refuse to issue a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the above guidelines, the Commission shall state in writing the reasons for its refusal. In such event, the applicant may appeal such decision to the Common Council, which may grant said certificate by a two-thirds vote only, and then only upon a clear showing of economic hardship by the applicant. In addition, if the Commission fails to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall, at the request of the applicant, cooperate and work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of appropriateness within the guidelines of this chapter.

(c) Regulation of Demolition. No permit to demolish all or part of an historic structure, or improvement in an historic district, shall be granted by the Director of Building Inspection except as follows:

1. No person in charge of an historic district shall be granted a permit to demolish such property under any circumstances without first receiving the written approval of the City Plan Commission;

2. At such time a person applies for a permit to demolish such property, a written request shall be filed with the City Plan Commission. Upon receipt of a written request, the City Plan Commission may refuse to grant such written approval for a period of up to 180 consecutive calendar days from the date of receipt of such request, during which time the City Plan Commission and the applicant shall undertake serious and continuing discussions for the purpose of finding a method to save such property. During such period, the applicant and the City Plan Commission shall cooperate in attempting to avoid demolition of the property. At the end of this 180-day period, if no mutually agreeable method of saving the subject property bearing a reasonable prospect of eventual success is underway, or if no formal application for funds from any governmental unit or nonprofit organization to preserve the subject property is pending, the Director of Building Inspection may issue a permit to demolish the subject property without the approval of the Commission, subject to the Director’s approval of a site plan which details the post-demolition activities, condition and use of the property, and is prepared pursuant to MMC 15.370(2) (including performance agreement and letter of credit requirements if deemed applicable by the Director), and which further meets the requirements under MMC 16.070(5) for the property upon which the structure to be demolished is located. If such mutually agreeable method for saving the subject property is not successful or no such funds to preserve the subject property have been obtained and available for disbursement within a 60-consecutive-calendar-day period following the end of such 180-day period, the Director of Building Inspection may issue the permit to demolish the subject property without the approval of the Commission;

3. In determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness for any demolition, the Commission shall consider and may give decisive weight to any or all of the following:

A. Whether the building or structure is of such architectural or historic significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the City and the State;

B. Whether the building or structure, although not itself a designated historic structure, contributes to the distinctive architectural or historic character of this historic district as a whole and therefore should be preserved for the benefit of the people of the City and the State;

C. Whether demolition of the subject property would be contrary to the purpose and intent of this section as set forth in subsection (1) of this section and to the objectives of the historic preservation plan for the applicable district as duly adopted by the Common Council;

D. Whether the building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense;

E. Whether retention of the building or structure would promote the general welfare of the people of the City and the State by encouraging study of American history, architecture and design or by developing an understanding of American culture and heritage;

F. Whether the building or structure is in such a deteriorated condition that it is not structurally or economically feasible to preserve or restore it; provided, that any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner which is self-created or which is the result of any failure to maintain the property in good repair cannot qualify as a basis for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness; and

G. Whether any new structure proposed to be constructed or change in use proposed to be made is compatible with the buildings and environment of the district in which the subject property is located.

4. Any decision to deny a certificate of appropriateness shall include a written statement of the reasons for such denial. Any appeal from the decision of the Commission to grant or deny a certificate of appropriateness, whether this determination is made upon receipt of the application for a demolition permit or at the end of the one-year period in a case where action on the application has been suspended, or to suspend action on a demolition application may be taken to the Common Council by the applicant for the demolition permit or by the alderperson of the district in which the subject building or structure is located. Such appeal shall be initiated by filing a petition to appeal, specifying the grounds therefor, with the City Clerk within 10 consecutive calendar days of the date the final decision of the Commission is made. The City Clerk shall file the petition to appeal with the Common Council. After a public hearing, the Common Council may, by favorable vote of two-thirds of its members, reverse or modify the decision of the Commission if, after balancing the interest of the public in preserving the subject property and the interest of the owner in using it for his or her own purposes, the Common Council finds that, owing to special conditions pertaining to the specific piece of property, demolition will preclude any and all reasonable use of the property and/or will cause serious hardship for the owner; provided, that any self-created hardship shall not be a basis for reversal or modification of the Commission’s decision.

(d) Recognition of Historic Structures and Historic Sites. At such time as an historic structure or site has been properly designated in accordance with subsections (3) and (5) of this section, the Commission may cause to be prepared and erected on such property, at public expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property is an historic structure or site. Such plaque shall be so placed as to be easily visible to passing pedestrians.

(e) Sale of Historic Structures and Historic Sites. Any party who is listed as the owner of record of an historic structure or site at the time of its designation, who can demonstrate to the Commission that by virtue of such designation said owner is unable to find a buyer willing to preserve such an historic structure or site, even though the owner has made reasonable attempts in good faith to find and attract such a buyer, may petition the Commission for a rescission of its designation. Following the filing of such petition with the secretary of the Commission:

1. The owner and the Commission shall work together in good faith to locate a buyer for the subject property who is willing to abide by its designation;

2. If, at the end of a period not exceeding 180 consecutive calendar days from the date of such petition, no such buyer can be found, and if the owner still desires to obtain such rescission, the Commission shall rescind its designation of the subject property;

3. In the event of such rescission, the Commission shall notify the City Clerk, the Director of Building Inspection, and the City Assessor of same, and shall cause the same to be recorded, at its own expense, in the office of the Manitowoc County Register of Deeds; and

4. Following any such rescission, the Commission may not redesignate the subject property an historic structure or site for a period of not less than five years from the date of rescission.

(f) Other Duties. In addition to those duties already specified in this section, the Commission shall:

1. Cooperate with the Historic Preservation Offices for the State of Wisconsin, and the State Historic Preservation Review Board, in attempting to include such properties hereunder designated as historic structures, sites, or districts in the National Register of Historic Places;

2. Work for the continuing education of the citizens about the historic heritage of this City and the historic structures and sites designated under the provisions of this section; and

3. As it deems advisable, receive and solicit funds for the purpose of historic preservation in the City. Such funds shall be placed in a special City account for such purpose.

(5) Procedures.

(a) Designation of Historic Structures, Historic Sites and Historic Districts. The Commission may, after notice and public hearing, establish historic structures and sites and may recommend historic districts, or rescind such designation or recommendation, after application of the criteria in subsection (3) of this section. At least 10 consecutive calendar days prior to such hearing, the Commission shall notify the owners of record, as listed in the office of the City Assessor, who are owners of property in whole or in part situated within 200 feet of the boundaries of the property affected. These owners shall have the right to confer with the Commission on the designation. Notice of such hearing shall also be published as a Class 1 notice under the Wisconsin Statutes. The Commission shall also notify the following: City Engineer, Community Development Authority, Fire and Police Departments, Building Inspection Department, and Plan Commission. Each such department shall respond to the Commission within 30 consecutive calendar days of notification with its comments on the proposed designation or rescission. The Commission shall then conduct such public hearing and, in addition to the notified persons, may hear expert witnesses as it deems necessary. The Commission may conduct an independent investigation into the proposed designation or rescission. Within 10 consecutive calendar days after the close of the public hearing, the Commission may recommend designation of the property as either an historic structure, an historic site, or recommend its inclusion in an historic district, or may recommend rescinding the designation and state its reasons therefor. After the recommendation for designation, denial or rescission has been made, notification shall be sent to the property owner and to the persons who appeared at the public hearing. Notifications shall also be given to the City Clerk, Director of Building Inspection and the City Assessor. The recommendation shall be forwarded to the Common Council for concurrence or rejection by a majority vote.

(b) Voluntary Restrictive Covenants. The owner of any historic structure or site may, at any time following such designation of his property, enter into a restrictive covenant on the subject property after negotiation with the Commission. The Commission may assist the owner in preparing such covenant in the interest of preserving the historic property. The owner shall record such covenant at the Manitowoc County Register of Deeds, and shall notify the City Assessor of such covenant and the conditions thereof.

(c) Creation of Historic District.

1. For preservation purposes, the Historic Preservation Commission shall select geographically defined areas within the City to be designated as historic districts and shall, with the assistance of the City Planning Department, prepare an historic preservation plan in ordinance form for each area. An historic district may be designated for any geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the City which meets the requirements of subsection (3)(a) of this section.

2. Criteria for the Review of Alterations in Historic Districts.

A. Height. All additions shall be no higher than the existing building.

B. Second Exit Platforms. Second exit platforms shall not be applied to the front or sides of a building, unless they are not visible from the street.

C. Solar Apparatus. Passive and active solar apparatus will be allowed only if such devices do not detract from the architectural integrity of the building and are as unobtrusive as possible. Solar apparatus will not be permitted if such devices hide from the street view significant architectural features of the building or neighboring buildings, if their installation requires the loss of significant architectural features, or if they are of such a large scale that they become a major feature of the design.

D. Repairs. Repairs in materials that exactly duplicate the original composition, texture and appearance are encouraged. Repairs with new materials that duplicate the original in texture and appearance are also permitted.

Repairs with materials that do not duplicate the original in appearance will be permitted on an individual basis if the repairs are compatible with the character and materials of the existing building and if repairs that duplicate the original in appearance are prohibitively expensive.

E. Restoration. Projects that will return the appearance of the building to an earlier appearance are encouraged and will be permitted if such projects are documented by photographs, architectural or archeological research, or other suitable evidence.

F. Re-Siding with Aluminum or Vinyl. Re-siding with aluminum or vinyl that replaces clapboards or non-original siding on buildings originally sided with clapboards will be permitted only if the new siding imitates the width of the original siding within one inch; and provided, that all architectural details (such as window trim, wood cornices, and ornament) either remain uncovered or are duplicated exactly in appearance.

Siding that imitates wood graining will not be permitted.

If more than one layer of siding exists on the building, all layers except the first must be removed before new siding is applied. If insulation is applied under the new siding, all trim must be built up so that it projects from the siding as in the original.

G. Storms, Screens and Storm Doors. The repair and retention of original storms, screens and storm doors, or the replacement of same with new units that duplicate the original in materials and appearance, is encouraged. Replacements with non-original materials, such as combination metal components, may also be permitted. If metal components are used, owners are encouraged to use metal components which have been factory-enameled. Painting of raw aluminum storms after a year of weathering of the finish is encouraged. Storm doors that imitate a specific style shall be permitted only if the style matches the architectural character of the house.

H. Additions and Alterations to Street Facades. The appearance of all street facades of a building shall not be altered unless the design is sensitive to the historic character of the building. Specifically, the design shall be compatible with the existing building in scale, color, texture and the proportion of solids to voids. Materials and architectural details used in such alterations and additions shall either match those on the existing building or shall be materials and details used for the original construction of other buildings in the historic district of similar materials, age, and architectural style.

I. Additions and Alterations Not Visible from the Street. Additions and alterations that are not visible from streets contiguous to the lot lines will be permitted if their design is compatible with the scale of the existing house and in addition, materials used shall be compatible with the existing in texture, color and architectural details. Alterations shall harmonize with the architectural design of the building, rather than contrast with it.

J. Side Additions. Side additions shall be set back from the front wall of the building.

K. Alterations to the Roof. Roof alterations, resulting in an increased building volume, to provide additional windows, headroom, or area are not permitted unless approved by the Commission. In addition, the roof shape of the front of the building shall remain the same, unless the owner wishes to restore an earlier, documentable appearance.

Roof alterations on the back and sides of the building shall be compatible with the design of the house.

If the existing roofing material is the same as the original, changes in the appearance of roofing materials (not including color) will not be permitted except when the repair of the existing roof is unfeasible and the cost of replacing it in kind is prohibitive. The new roof shall match the original in appearance (not including color) as closely as is economically possible.

If the existing roofing material is not original to the house, the new roofing materials shall harmonize in color with the house. Thick wood shakes, rolled roofing and hexagonal shingles will not be allowed. Restoration to a documentable earlier appearance is encouraged.

3. Criteria for the Review of New Construction in Historic Districts.

A. New buildings constructed in a designated historic district shall be designed and constructed with materials compatible with size, height and materials of existing buildings within the district. Plans for all new buildings will be reviewed for appropriateness by the Historic Preservation Commission and Plan Commission as currently allowed by the Zoning Ordinance.

B. Accessory buildings shall be compatible with the design of the principal buildings on the same zoning lot, and shall be as unobtrusive as possible.

4. Review and Adoption Procedures.

A. Historic Preservation Commission. The Historic Preservation Commission shall hold a public hearing when considering the plan for an historic district. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such hearing shall be given by publication as a Class 2 notice under the Wisconsin Statutes. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the public hearing shall also be sent by the City Clerk to the alderperson of the aldermanic district or districts in which the historic district is located, as well as the record owners of property situated in whole or in part within 200 feet of the boundaries of the proposed historic district. Following the public hearing, the Historic Preservation Commission shall vote to recommend, reject or withhold action on the plan. This recommendation shall be forwarded to the City Plan Commission for review and recommendation, and to the Common Council for final action.

B. The City Plan Commission. The City Plan Commission shall review the historic district plan within 30 consecutive calendar days from the date the document has been referred to the City Plan Commission, and shall make a recommendation to the Common Council.

C. The Common Council. The Common Council, upon receipt of the recommendations from the Historic Preservation Commission and City Plan Commission, may hold a public hearing, with notice to be given as noted in subsection (5)(c)(4)(A) of this section and shall, following the public hearing, either designate or reject the historic district.

Designation of the historic district shall constitute adoption of the plan in ordinance form prepared for that district, and shall further direct the implementation of said plan.

(6) Conformance with Regulations. Every person in charge of any historic structure, historic site or improvement in an historic district shall maintain same or cause or permit it to be maintained in a condition consistent with provisions of this section.

The Director of Building Inspection and his designates are authorized to enforce this section. The duties of the Director of Building Inspection shall include periodic inspection at intervals provided by the City Council of designated historic structures, sites and districts. These inspections may include physical entry upon the property and improvements, with permission of the owner, to ensure that interior alterations or maintenance will not jeopardize the exterior appearance or structural stability of the improvement.

(7) Maintenance of Historic Structures, Historic Sites and Historic Districts.

(a) Every person in charge of an improvement at a historic site or in an historic district shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of such improvement and all interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend to cause the exterior portions of such improvement to fall into a state of disrepair. This provision shall be in addition to all other provisions of law requiring such improvement to be kept in good repair.

(b) Insofar as they are applicable to an historic structure, historic site or improvement in an historic district designated under this section, any provision of any applicable building or plumbing code as adopted in Chapter 16 MMC, or any sign regulations may be varied or waived, on application, by the appropriate board having such jurisdiction over such chapter or, in the absence of such board, by the Director of Building Inspection, provided such waiver does not endanger public health or safety.

(8) Conditions Dangerous to Life, Health or Property. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the making of necessary construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any historic structure, any improvement on a historic site or in a historic district pursuant to order of any governmental agency or pursuant to any court judgment, for the purpose of remedying emergency conditions determined to be dangerous to life, health or property. In such cases, no approval from the Commission shall be required.

(9) Applicability. The following districts have been established in conformance with subsections (3)(a) and (5)(c) of this section and are subject to the restrictions of this section:

(a) 8th Street Historic District.

(10) Severability. If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of this chapter and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

[Ord. 20-599 § 2, 2020; Ord. 11-430 §§ 19 – 34, 2011. Prior code § 15.65]


15.670 Shoreland-Wetland Zoning.

(1) Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Statement of Purpose and Title.

(a) Statutory Authorization. The ordinance codified in this section is adopted pursuant to the authorization in Wis. Stat. §§ 62.23 and 62.231 for cities and Wis. Stat. §§ 87.30 and 281.31 for counties.

(b) Finding of Fact and Purpose. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the City would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:

1. Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;

2. Maintain the storm and flood water storage capacity of wetlands;

3. Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;

4. Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat;

5. Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and

6. Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities.

(2) Definitions.

(a) For the purposes of administering and enforcing this section, the terms or words used herein shall be interpreted as follows: Words used in the present tense include the future; words in the singular number include the plural number; words in the plural number include the singular number. The word shall is mandatory, not permissive. All distances, unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally.

(b) The following terms used in this section shall have the following meanings:

Accessory structure or use means a detached subordinate structure or a use which is clearly incidental to, and customarily found in connection with, the principal structure or use to which it is related and which is located on the same lot as that of the principal structure or use.

Boathouse, as defined in Wis. Stat. § 30.121(1), means a permanent structure used for the storage of watercraft and associated materials and includes all structures which are totally enclosed, have roofs or walls or any combination of structural parts.

Drainage system means one or more artificial ditches, tile drains or similar devices which collect surface runoff or groundwater and convey it to a point of discharge.

Environmental control facility means any facility, temporary or permanent, which is reasonably expected to abate, reduce or aid in the prevention, measurement, control or monitoring of noise, air or water pollutants, solid waste and thermal pollution, radiation or other pollutants, including facilities installed principally to supplement or to replace existing property or equipment not meeting or allegedly not meeting acceptable pollution control standards or which are to supplement or replace other pollution control facilities.

Fixed houseboat, as defined in Wis. Stat. § 30.121(1), means a structure not actually used for navigation which extends beyond the ordinary high-water mark of a navigable waterway and is retained in place either by cables to the shoreline or by anchors or spudpoles attached to the bed of the waterway.

Navigable waters means Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland lakes within Wisconsin, and all streams, ponds, sloughs, flowages and other waters within the territorial limits of this State, including the Wisconsin portion of boundary waters, which are navigable under the laws of this State. Under Wis. Stat. § 281.31(2m), notwithstanding any other provisions of law or administrative rule promulgated thereunder, shoreland ordinances required under Wis. Stat. § 61.351 or 62.231, and Wis. Admin. Code NR 117, do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if:

A. Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or river;

B. Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams before ditching; and

C. Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use.

Note: “Wisconsin’s Supreme Court has declared navigable bodies of water that have a bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow sufficient to support navigation by a recreational craft of the shallowest draft on an annually recurring basis [Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952) and DeGaynor and Co., Inc., v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975)]. For example, a stream which is navigable by skiff or canoe during normal spring high water is navigable, in fact, under the laws of this State though it may be dry during other seasons.”

Ordinary high-water mark means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic.

Planning Agency means the City Plan Commission created under Wis. Stat. § 62.23(1) and under MMC 3.050.

Shorelands means lands within the following distances from the ordinary high-water mark of navigable waters: 1,000 feet from a lake, pond or flowage; and 300 feet from a river or stream or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater.

Shoreland-Wetland District means the zoning district, created in this section, comprised of shorelands that are designated as wetlands on the Wetland Inventory Maps which have been adopted and made a part of the ordinance codified in this section.

Unnecessary hardship means that circumstance where special conditions, which were not self-created, affect a particular property and make strict conformity with restrictions governing area, setback, frontage height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this section.

Variance means an authorization granted by the Board of Appeals to construct or alter a building or structure in a manner that deviates from the dimensional standards of this section.

Wetland alteration means any filling, flooding, draining, dredging, ditching, tiling, excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures or dike and dam construction in a wetland area.

Wetlands means those areas where water is at, near or above the land surface long enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which have soils indicative of wet conditions.

(3) General Provisions.

(a) Compliance. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the City shall be in full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable local, State or Federal regulations. All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this section.

(b) Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this section and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stat. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of State highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Wis. Stat. § 30.12(4)(a) applies.

(c) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.

1. This section supersedes all the provisions of any City zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stat. § 61.35, 62.23 or 87.30 which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another City zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this section, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.

2. This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail.

(d) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this section is required by a standard in Wis. Admin. Code NR 117, and where the ordinance provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Wis. Admin. Code NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this section.

(e) Severability. Should any portion of this section be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected.

(f) Annexed Areas. For all areas annexed by the City after May 7, 1992, the Manitowoc County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effect, but shall be administered by the City. These annexed lands are described on the City’s Official Zoning District Map. The Manitowoc County shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the City Plan Commission.

(4) Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District.

(a) Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps. The following maps are hereby adopted and made part of this section and are on file in the office of the City Plan Commission:

1. Only that part of the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Maps stamped “FINAL” on December 11, 1991, and located within the shorelands area as defined in subsection (2)(b) of this section;

2. Floodplain zoning maps titled “Federal Flood Insurance Rate Maps” and the City’s “Floodplain Delineation Maps,” in effect March 10, 1992; and

3. United States Geological Survey maps dated 1954.

(b) District Boundaries.

1. The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the City which are five acres or more and are shown on the final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made part of this section and which are:

A. Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the City shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this section; or

B. Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this section. Floodplain zoning maps adopted in subsection (4)(a)(2) of this section shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas.

2. Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department of Natural Resources for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark.

3. When an apparent discrepancy exists between the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary shown on the City’s official zoning maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department of Natural Resources to determine if the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary, as mapped, is in error. If the Department of Natural Resources staff concur with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands designated in subsections (4)(b)(4) and (5) of this section, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period.

4. Filled Wetlands. Wetlands which are filled prior to December 11, 1991, the date on which the City received final Wetland Inventory Maps, in a manner which affects their wetland characteristics to the extent that the area can no longer be defined as wetland, are not subject to this section.

15.690 Landscaping and Off-Street Parking Requirements.

(1) Purpose. The off-street parking area landscaping standards herein are intended to improve the appearance of vehicular use areas and property abutting public rights-of-way. Additionally, this section requires buffering between noncompatible land uses; and to protect, preserve and promote the aesthetic appeal, character and value of surrounding neighborhoods. Finally, this section promotes public health and safety through the reduction of noise pollution, air pollution, visual pollution and glare.

The off-street parking area landscaping standards consist of a point system that is designed to provide flexibility in developing an appropriate landscape plan. Applicants can implement a landscape plan which most effectively achieves the desired aesthetic results and is consistent with the need of providing readily accessible and visible parking, provided the landscape plan meets the minimum point requirements as specified in this section.

(a) Landscape Materials. Landscape materials include plantings such as trees, shrubs, ground covers, flowers, and other materials such as rocks, water, walls, fences, paving materials and street furniture, and similar elements.

(b) Landscaping Objectives. The objectives of the landscaping standards are to recognize both the functional importance of parking areas; and the public benefits associated with well-designed, landscaped areas which enhance the visual environment, promote public safety, moderate the microclimate, and reduce nuisances such as noise and glare.

(2) General Requirements.

(a) In all off-street parking areas for five or more vehicles, the project owner (defined herein as the property owner, tenant, developer or agent) shall develop landscape areas defined as interior parking lot landscaping in tree islands, and perimeter parking lot landscaping within 10 feet of the periphery of the parking lot surface in accordance with this section. Interior parking lot landscape areas may be peninsular or island type.

(b) Parking areas with 25 or fewer parking spaces or 7,500 square feet or less of parking and/or loading surface area shall only be required to provide perimeter parking lot landscaping as defined under subsection (2)(a) of this section.

(c) Parking areas for more than 25 parking spaces or more than 7,500 square feet of parking and/or loading surface area shall be required to meet all requirements under this section.

(d) All landscape areas including tree islands shall be protected by concrete curbing, landscape timbers or equivalent structure.

(e) All landscape areas shall have the proper soil preparation to ensure the viability of the vegetation.

(f) In addition to landscape areas as defined under subsection (2)(a) of this section, landscape plans under subsection (9) of this section shall provide for an appropriate mix of landscape materials adjacent to the exterior footprint of all buildings. These landscape materials shall be used to enhance the building’s exterior facade, and not obscure views of the building or accessory signage.

(g) All undeveloped areas of the site, excluding protected wetlands and forested areas, shall be permitted to remain in natural plant growth.

(h) In situations where the gross area of an existing off-street parking lot, as measured from the edge of the parking lot pavement or unimproved surface and including access drives or aisles, ramps or internal moving lanes, is increased by 25 percent or greater than the existing parking lot area and results in a parking lot for five or more vehicles and requires site plan review and approval under MMC 15.370(2), the existing parking lot area will be required to provide either perimeter landscaping or, if not practicable, additional on-site landscaping, equal to 10 percent of the gross existing parking and loading area. The parking lot expansion area shall be required to comply with all landscape requirements under this section.

(i) Full growth potential of trees should not create a traffic hazard, nor conflict with overhead and underground utilities, vision clearance areas or obscure street lights.

(j) Landscaping shall be conceived in a total pattern throughout the site, integrating the various elements of site design, preserving and enhancing the particular identity of the site, and creating a pleasing site character.

(k) For those zoning districts that do not require front yard setback areas, all off-street parking surfaces, pavement or gravel shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from any public right-of-way. The setback area shall be planted with grass and contain additional landscape materials equal to 10 percent of the front yard area.

(l) In no instance will more than 30 percent of the gross area of a lot be required to be landscaped under this section including lawn area and other landscape materials as defined herein.

(3) Minimum Canopy Tree and Off-Street Parking Lot Requirements.

(a) All off-street parking areas for five or more vehicles shall provide and maintain one canopy tree for each 10 parking spaces, or fraction thereof, over the initial five spaces in accordance with the schedule under subsection (3)(b) of this section. Canopy trees shall be located in tree islands, or within 10 feet of the periphery of the parking area surface. The preservation of healthy and desirable existing trees is encouraged. At the sole discretion of the City Planning Department, existing canopy trees which are disease-free and have a minimum tree diameter (caliper), measured at least six inches above ground level, of two inches and are within 10 feet of the periphery of the parking lot surface may be applied toward the canopy standard. All newly planted canopy trees must also have a minimum tree diameter of two inches.

(b) Parking areas with more than 25 parking spaces or more than 7,500 square feet of parking and/or loading surface area shall be required to provide interior parking lot landscaping in tree islands. Rows of parking stalls shall be broken, separated or terminated by a tree island at a rate of one tree island for each linear row of 10 parking spaces for single row configuration, or for each 20 parking spaces in double row configurations. At the discretion of the City Planning Department, tree islands may be located at alternative locations on the site, or replaced with an equivalent amount and area of perimeter parking lot landscaping to ensure the aesthetic appeal of the development.

(4) Screening Standards for Parking in or Adjacent to Residentially Zoned Parcels.

(a) There shall be an opaque site screening barrier for the purpose of obstructing light beams and muffling noise where:

1. An off-street parking area for five or more vehicles is adjacent to, or within 25 feet of, an adjoining Residential Zoning District or public right-of-way; or

2. An off-street parking area for five or more vehicles is located in a manner where nearby residentially zoned properties would be affected by headlight glare.

(b) The following standards shall be applied in considering whether or not a screening barrier is in compliance with this section:

1. Landscaping or screening shall effectively screen the parking area from public rights-of-way, public recreation sites and residentially zoned lands;

2. Where landscape materials are used for barrier screening, they must be of suitable size and density to accomplish the screening objective within three years from the date of planting or the date a final certificate of occupancy is issued by the City;

3. The above-grade height of the site screen shall not be less than four feet above the surface of the parking area, subject to MMC 16.350;

4. A barrier may consist of wood, masonry or chain link fencing, walls, berming, or the use of landscape material; and

5. Design of the barrier is subject to approval by the City Planning Department.

(5) Minimum Landscape Element Standards.

(a) In addition to the requirements for canopy trees under subsection (3) of this section and residential screening under subsection (4) of this section, all off-street parking areas for five or more vehicles in the following zoning districts shall be required to accumulate a minimum number of points in order to be approved and in compliance with MMC 15.370(2):

1. Parking lots located in a “B-1,” “B-2,” “B-3,” “B-4,” “C-1” or Residential Zoning District shall be required to accumulate 15 points per parking stall; or

2. Parking lots located in an “I-1” or “I-2” Zoning District shall be required to accumulate 10 points per parking stall. Parking areas for 100 or more vehicles shall be required to accumulate 10 points for each of the first 100 parking spaces, and five points for all parking spaces above 100.

(b) Points under subsection (5)(a) of this section are accumulated for each employee and visitor parking space in accordance with the point schedule detailed under subsection (5)(d) of this section. To qualify for points, the landscape materials must be located in the landscape area defined under subsection (2)(a) of this section, and in a manner which meets the landscaping objectives under subsection (1)(b) of this section. If compliance under subsection (2)(a) of this section is not practicable, an equivalent amount of landscaping may be located on site, subject to approval by the City Planning Department.

(c) Truck, trailer or heavy equipment vehicular storage and loading areas shall be required to provide either perimeter parking lot landscaping or, if not practicable, additional on-site landscaping equal to 10 percent of the gross storage and loading area.

(d) Point Schedule for Landscape Elements.

	Landscape Element	Minimum Planted Diameter or Height	Points

	Canopy trees	Over 2-1/2"	50 pts.

	Canopy trees	2" – 2-1/2"	30 pts.

	Evergreen trees	6'	30 pts.

	Tall shrubs	4'	9 pts.

	Medium shrubs	3'	6 pts.

	Low shrubs	2'	 

Walls, decorative fences, earth berms, ground covers and shrubs with a mature height of less than two feet above grade do not accumulate any points, unless approved under subsection (5)(g) of this section.

(e) To qualify for the points under subsection (5)(d) of this section, trees and shrubs shall be of good nursery stock, disease-free and not less than the minimum required planting size.

(f) Trees used to meet the canopy standard under subsection (3) of this section, and landscape materials used to meet the screening standards under subsection (4) of this section, may be applied toward the minimum landscape requirements under subsection (5)(a) of this section.

(g) The project owner may request points for decorative fences, earth berms, ground covers, existing vegetation and shrubs of a mature height of not less than two feet above grade. It must be demonstrated by the project owner that these landscape materials will contribute to the overall landscape objectives. The number of points credited will be determined by the City Planning Department.

(6) Minimum Widths for Tree Islands and Planted Areas.

(a) All tree islands and landscape areas under subsection (2)(a) of this section with trees shall be a minimum width of five feet as measured from the inside of any curb or frame.

(b) All landscape areas under subsection (2)(a) of this section without trees, but planted with shrubs, shall be a minimum width of four feet as measured from the inside of any curb or frame.

(7) Unsuitable Species. Several shrubs and trees, which are not native to Wisconsin, have an established history of spreading to nearby parks and conservancy areas. These nonnative plants tend to become overly abundant and ultimately eliminate many desirable native species. The control and eradication of these unsuitable plants create a costly management problem. Therefore, all planting specifications shall first be reviewed and approved by the City Planning Department.

(8) Adjustments to Parking and Landscaping Requirements. The City Planning Department may authorize adjustments to the requirements where literal compliance with the specifications and standards under this section would make the parking lot landscaping ineffective or unnecessary. Existing land use conditions, topographic constraints, existing vegetation, traffic safety, or compliance with fire or other public safety requirements may necessitate adjustments.

If the City Planning Department determines that the location of landscape materials within the landscape area is not appropriate or feasible, the City Planning Department may require that at least an equivalent area of landscape treatment be added elsewhere on the site.

(9) Landscape/Planting Plan.

(a) Landscape Plan and Contents. The project owner shall have prepared a landscape plan drawn by a registered landscape architect or other professional acceptable to the City, for review and approval by the City Planning Department. Any plans submitted without the following information will be rejected. The contents of the plan shall include the following:

1. Scaled and fully dimensioned plot plan identifying all existing and proposed property lines, easements, buildings and other structures, vehicular use areas (including parking stalls, driveways, service areas, etc.);

2. Location of water outlets;

3. Identification of landscape materials (including botanical and common name, installation size, on-center planting dimensions where applicable, size and quantities for all plantings used, and specifications for proper soil preparation);

4. Location and identification of all existing landscape materials to remain and to be removed from the site, and proposed new landscape materials, including the height and crown width the plantings will achieve five years after plan implementation;

5. Location and identification of snow removal storage areas, described in sufficient detail to demonstrate that required landscape materials will not be killed or harmed;

6. Typical elevations and/or cross-sections of berms, fences, retaining walls, ponds, planters, etc., as may be required; and

7. Title blocks with the pertinent names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers (project owner, person drawing plan, and person installing landscape materials), scale, date and north arrow.

(10) Maintenance and Installation. The project owner, tenant and their respective agents shall be held jointly and severally responsible to maintain their property and landscape materials in a condition presenting a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and free from weeds, refuse and debris. This requirement shall run with the property, and is binding upon all future property owners.

Landscape materials which are required by an approved site or landscape plan, and which have died, shall be replaced within three months of notification by the City. However, the time for compliance may be extended up to nine months by the City Planning Department in order to allow for seasonal or weather conditions.

6. Design of the tower, with particular reference to tower safety as certified by a professional engineer licensed to design such towers, and associated characteristics including, but not limited to, lighting and collocation;

7. Proposed ingress and egress to the tower site;

8. Availability of suitable existing towers and alternative tower structures for collocation purposes; and

9. Any other factors which may have a major impact on the tower site or surrounding properties.

The Common Council may waive or reduce the burden on the tower owner of one or more requirements of the conditional use permit, if the Common Council concludes that the intent of this section is better served thereby.

The Common Council reserves the right to amend, modify or revoke a previously approved conditional use permit, in order to advance a legitimate governmental interest related to the health, safety, and general welfare of the City.

(5) General Provisions.

(a) Authorization. All telecommunication facilities shall meet or exceed, and, at all times, remain in full compliance with applicable Federal, State and local regulations and standards. Upon the City’s receipt of a tower application under subsection (5)(gg) of this section, the City Clerk shall notify the Manitowoc County Clerk, the Manitowoc County Airport Advisory Committee, and Manitowoc Public Utilities of receipt of the application, and provide a copy of said application to each party. The City shall be provided a copy of all executed leases, licenses or agreements between a tower owner and property owner, for occupancy on all tower sites and alternative tower structures.

(b) Collocation. A tower owner is required to provide documentation that the tower owner has exhausted all possible avenues to collocate their facilities on an existing tower, or an approved but unbuilt tower, or an alternative tower structure. A tower owner cannot be denied space on an existing tower, or an approved but unbuilt tower, or an alternative tower structure unless financial, mechanical, structural or regulatory factors prevent collocation. A tower owner shall be required to demonstrate how a proposed tower location will minimize negative impacts upon adjacent properties.

In addition to the original tower owner’s telecommunication facilities, each proposed tower shall be designed and constructed so as to meet the following minimum collocation requirements:

1. The collocation of six or more future tower owners and their respective telecommunication facilities if the tower is 200 feet or more in height; or

2. The collocation of at least four future tower owners and their respective telecommunication facilities if the tower is less than 200 feet in height.

All towers shall be designed and constructed to accommodate collocation, and shall be designed to allow for the rearrangement of antennas upon a tower, and the placement of antennas upon a tower at varying heights. All tower sites shall be site planned to accommodate the collocation of future tower owners, and shall identify the location of future support buildings and equipment. The tower owner shall provide written assurances to the satisfaction of the City that the tower design can meet or exceed collocation requirements defined in this section, and shall not make access to the tower and tower site economically or financially unfeasible by charging a future tower owner more than the reasonable market rate for the proposed use.

If the Common Council determines that a tower owner has made access to a tower or tower site unfeasible for a future tower user, then the tower owner shall be subject to penalties under MMC 15.630. The Director of Building Inspection shall be responsible for all enforcement activities under this section.

The tower owner shall be required to send a letter, via first class mail, to all telecommunication service providers with facilities located in the search radius defined in this section, declaring the tower owner’s collocation and siting needs. A copy of the tower owner’s letters and any responses to the above-referenced letters shall be provided to the City as part of the tower application under subsection (5)(gg)(9) of this section.

An application for a conditional use permit under subsection (4) of this section shall not be approved by the Common Council, unless the City Plan Commission and Common Council find that the telecommunications equipment planned for a proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing tower, or an approved but unbuilt tower, or alternative tower structure within a one-mile search radius for all towers (search radius to be measured from the center of the base of the proposed tower at the tower site), due to one or more of the following reasons:

1. Planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of an existing tower, or an approved but unbuilt tower, or alternative tower structure, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and an existing tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the planned equipment or equivalent at a reasonable cost;

2. Planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at a tower as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost; or

3. Any other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the planned equipment upon an existing tower, or an approved but unbuilt tower.

Except in cases where financial, mechanical, structural or regulatory factors prevent the collocation of facilities, a tower owner cannot be denied space on a tower.

(c) Building-Mounted Facilities. All building-mounted telecommunication facilities, including those covered under subsection (5)(f) of this section, shall be located and designed to appear as an integral part of a building’s structure. Exterior wall-mounted antennas shall be architecturally integrated into the facade of a building utilizing any means acceptable to the City Planning Department, including painting. Exterior wall-mounted antennas shall be located as close to, but not more than three feet from, the outer edge of the exterior wall of a building, and the facilities and supporting equipment shall not increase the height of a building by more than 15 feet.

(d) Roof-Mounted Facilities. Roof-mounted telecommunication facilities shall be positioned at the greatest distance from the edge of a building, subject to the Director of Building Inspection’s determination that the proposed location will not jeopardize the load bearing capacity of a roof in terms of weight and wind load. The facilities are to be located so as to be effectively unnoticeable, and cannot extend more than 15 feet above the highest point of a rooftop.

(e) Building Permits. It shall be unlawful for any tower owner to build, erect or increase the height of an existing tower, or an approved but unbuilt tower, or an alternative tower structure, without the issuance of a building permit and compliance with the requirements under subsections (3) and (5)(cc) of this section. A building permit is not required for:

1. Replacing or strengthening bracing, anchor and support members, reinforcing vertical members, or any adjustment or replacement of elements of an antenna or antenna array affixed to a tower or alternative tower structure; provided, that these activities do not reduce the safety factor; or

2. A tower or antenna erected temporarily for 14 consecutive calendar days or less, and used for test purposes, for emergency communication, or for broadcasting remote pick-up operations; provided, that all requirements of this section are met.

At the time a tower application is filed with the City to build, erect or increase the height of an existing or proposed tower, the tower owner shall provide the information required in subsection (5)(gg) of this section.

A tower owner shall be required to submit four copies of a final as-built site plan for a tower site in accordance with MMC 15.370(2)(e) within 60 calendar days of commencing operation at a tower site.

(f) Historic/Architecturally Significant Structures. Telecommunication facilities, including those exempted under subsection (3)(a) of this section, shall not be located on any property, building or alternative tower structure identified as a contributing historic property, building or structure in the City’s Manitowoc Intensive Resources Survey Final Report dated June 1988, and as may be amended from time to time, unless a certificate of appropriateness is first granted by the City Plan Commission under MMC 15.650. Building-mounted facilities under subsection (5)(c) of this section which are mounted on either architecturally significant or contributing structures or significant architectural details shall be covered, concealed or camouflaged by appropriate design treatments which shall match existing architectural features found on the alternative tower structure.

(g) Interference with Public Safety and Telecommunication. No existing or proposed telecommunication facilities shall produce interfering signals which interfere with signals from any pre-existing public utility or public safety operation, the Manitowoc County Airport, or other City or private telecommunications operations. Before the introduction of a new service or changes in existing telecommunication services, a tower owner shall notify the Director of Building Inspection at least 30 calendar days in advance of such changes, and allow the Director of Building Inspection to monitor interference levels. The cost for retuning transmitters and resolving such interference shall be borne by the new installation owner. With the exception of testing approved by the Director of Building Inspection under subsection (5)(n) of this section, all operation shall cease at a tower causing interference until a suitable resolution is found and implemented. The new installation owner or interfering party shall be responsible for all costs associated with any equipment rental or purchases, or tests deemed necessary by the Director of Building Inspection to resolve any and all interference problems. If such interference has not been corrected within 10 calendar days of the date the Director of Building Inspection notifies the new installation owner or interfering party of an interference problem, the Director of Building Inspection may require the new installation owner or interfering party to remove the specific items from the telecommunication facilities causing such interference.

(h) Design/Structural Integrity. All telecommunication facilities shall be designed and situated to be visually unobtrusive and to minimize the impacts of noise, radio frequency, electrical emission, glare, heat, air contaminants and vibration upon surrounding land uses. All tower owners are required to comply with the FCC’s limits for human exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields.

The City reserves the right to require tower owners to design telecommunication facilities to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color, camouflage and architectural treatments, except in instances where the design (or specific design details such as lighting) of a telecommunication tower is dictated by Federal, State or local regulations and standards. Unless otherwise required by a Federal or State agency regulating the location of antennas and towers, or when requested by the City, towers shall be designed to match, as closely as possible, the color and texture of the wall, building or surrounding built or natural environment.

Towers shall be constructed out of metal or other nonflammable material, and shall be treated with corrosive resistant material. Wood poles shall be impregnated with rot resistant substances.

With the exception of necessary electric and telephone services, no part of any telecommunication facilities, including any lines, cable, equipment, wires or braces, shall at any time extend across, upon, under or over any part of any public right-of-way without the express written permission of the City Engineer.

All new towers must be certified by a qualified and licensed professional engineer to be:

1. All towers shall be set back a distance, at minimum, equal to 125 percent of the height of the tower from any property line or zoning line;

2. Accessory and support structures, including guy anchors, shall comply with the underlying zoning district setback requirements;

3. Tower structures shall be set back a distance, at minimum, equal to 125 percent of the height of the tower from any public right-of-way;

4. For guyed towers, the tower owner shall submit certified break-apart calculations, or an explanation of the expected mode of collapse, from a qualified engineer in order for the property boundary or zoning setbacks to be determined; and

5. If the tower owner engineer provides and certifies break-apart calculations or the expected mode of collapse, the setback requirement may be modified, at the City’s sole discretion, in line with the calculations.

(l) Separation. Irrespective of City jurisdictional boundaries, a tower’s separation distance from any property line or zoning line, and other existing towers, or approved but unbuilt towers shall be measured from the center of the tower base to the closest point of the property line or zoning line. The separation distance between towers shall be measured by drawing a straight line between the center of the tower base of an existing tower, or an approved but unbuilt tower, and the center of the tower base of the proposed new tower, pursuant to a site plan for the proposed tower.

Proposed towers must meet the following minimum separation requirements from an existing tower(s), or an approved but unbuilt tower:

1. Monopole tower structures shall be separated from all other towers, whether monopole, self-supporting or guyed, by a minimum of 750 feet;

2. Self-supporting lattice or guyed tower structures shall be separated from all other self-supporting or guyed towers by a minimum of 1,500 feet; and

3. Self-supporting lattice or guyed tower structures shall be separated from all monopole structures by a minimum of 750 feet.

(m) Noise and Traffic. Equipment at a tower site shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce noise, traffic and congestion. All telecommunication facilities shall be constructed and operated in such a manner as to minimize the amount of disruption to nearby residents and businesses. Outdoor noise produced during tower- or antenna-related construction or maintenance activities shall only take place on Monday through Saturday, nonholidays, between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. unless allowed at other times by the Director of Building Inspection, or unless an emergency situation exists. Interference conditions under subsection (5)(g) of this section shall always constitute an emergency situation. Backup generators shall only be operated during power outages and for testing and maintenance purposes.

(n) Testing and Maintenance. Testing and maintenance shall only take place on Monday through Saturday, nonholidays, between 7:30 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., unless an emergency situation exists, under which testing and maintenance shall be permitted at all days and times. Testing to eliminate interference problems shall first require the approval of the Director of Building Inspection, and shall be in accordance with subsection (5)(g) of this section. A maintenance log shall be maintained at the tower site at all times.

(o) Inspection Report (Three-Year Intervals). An inspection report shall be prepared by a qualified engineer, independent of the tower owner, and at the tower owner’s sole expense, at least every three years from the date (hereinafter referred in this subsection as “the date”) a certificate of occupancy is issued by the Director of Building Inspection. The inspection report shall be submitted to the Director of Building Inspection within three years plus 90 calendar days of the date for review and approval to ensure the continuing structural and electrical integrity of the tower and accessory structures.

If the inspection report recommends that repairs and maintenance are required, then the tower owner shall be notified by the Director of Building Inspection within 30 calendar days after receipt of said report. The tower owner shall submit to the Director of Building Inspection written evidence to verify that such repairs and maintenance have been completed. The tower owner shall have 90 calendar days from the date of the Director of Building Inspection’s notice to complete the required improvements.

The Director of Building Inspection may require a tower owner to repair or remove a tower, antenna and other tower site improvements, both above and below grade, and restore the tower site to its original preconstruction condition, except for ordinary wear and tear, based on the findings of the inspection report. The City shall have no financial responsibility or liability regarding the required inspection report, or any required repair, testing or maintenance. All repair, testing or maintenance activities at telecommunication facilities shall be performed by licensed and insured maintenance and construction personnel.

The tower owner is responsible to provide all inspection reports in a timely manner to the Director of Building Inspection. Failure of the City to provide any notice in advance of any required reporting deadline shall not void or invalidate the tower owner’s reporting responsibilities outlined in this section.

(p) Security Fencing. Every tower affixed to the ground shall be protected to discourage public access into the tower site, including the climbing of a tower by unauthorized persons. Fencing materials may consist of metal, wood, masonry, stucco or other materials acceptable to the Director of Building Inspection. A security fence, six feet in height above finished grade, shall be constructed around a tower site, including all related support and guy anchors. Access shall only be through a locked gate. The tower owner shall be responsible to maintain the fencing in good condition.

(q) Warning Signs. All tower sites shall include warning signs designed to discourage public access into a tower site. All warning signs shall use at least six-inch lettering, and be installed five feet above finished grade of the fence. “No Trespassing” warning signs shall be attached to the security fence and shall be spaced no more than 40 feet apart. If high voltage (above 220 volts) is necessary for the operation of a tower and is present at the base of a tower, signs located no more than 40 feet apart and attached to the security fence shall indicate “Danger – High Voltage.” In the event warning signs, intended to be attached to a security fence, would be obstructed from public view, the tower owner shall attach warning signs to freestanding poles (installed by the tower owner if none are present and at the tower owner’s expense) that are situated around a tower site, so as to be clearly visible and not obstructed from public view.

(r) Other Signs and Advertising. A tower site shall clearly identify the tower owner’s name and, if not the same as the property owner, the name of the telecommunication service provider or tower user, and respective address, telephone number, and other relevant information necessary to facilitate an emergency response. Address signs shall be installed in conformance with City Fire Department requirements, at the entrance to a tower site at the nearest public right-of-way. The use of any portion of a tower site for signs (other than warning or equipment information signs) and advertising is expressly prohibited.

(s) Parking. For all tower sites, a minimum of one on-site parking space shall be provided. Existing parking shall be used whenever possible. New parking areas and access roads shall be paved if required by the City, or if the access road is previously paved, and shall not exceed 350 square feet in area. Any new roads or parking areas built shall, whenever feasible, be designed and constructed to be shared with future collocation users.

(t) Pre-existing Towers and Antennas. Towers and antennas existing prior to the effective date of this section, and for which a building permit has been previously issued by the City, shall be deemed a legal conforming use and structure, and not be subject to this section except as provided herein. Towers that are increased by height or capacity in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.

Until such time that a tower owner has obtained a building permit from the Director of Building Inspection and paid all applicable fees, including fees under subsection (5)(cc) of this section for a pre-existing tower or antenna, a tower site shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use and structure under MMC 15.410, and subject to the requirements therein.

A legal and conforming, pre-existing tower or antenna which is damaged by fire, storm, or other casualty or which requires replacement may be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced; provided, that the repaired, reconstructed or replaced tower or antenna complies with its original permit or site plan, and the repaired, reconstructed or replaced tower or antenna does not exceed the height of the original tower or antenna. Any improvements to a legal and conforming, pre-existing tower or antenna that are inconsistent with the original approved building permit, conditional use permit or site plan, or which increase the height of the original tower or antenna, shall require the issuance of a conditional use permit and compliance with all requirements of this section.

(u) Lighting. Tower sites shall not be artificially lighted except for the following:

1. A manually operated or motion detector controlled light above the storage or equipment building door which shall be kept off, except when personnel authorized by the tower owner are actually present at night; and

2. Minimum tower lighting as required by the FAA or any other Federal, State or local authority with the authority to regulate towers and antennas, as are in effect at the time the tower is placed in service.

When incorporated into the approved design of a tower, lighting used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots or similar tower sites owned by the City or MPU may be attached to a tower at the sole discretion of the City. When lighting is required, it shall be oriented inward so as not to project onto surrounding properties.

(v) Shared Tower Site. The placement of more than one telecommunication tower on a tower site may be permitted if all requirements under this section are met for each tower. Towers under this section include existing towers, and towers that are approved but unbuilt.

(w) Dedication of Tower for Usage by the City. For all towers requiring a conditional use permit, the City may require a tower owner, as a condition of conditional use permit approval, and at no expense to the City, to:

1. Deed or transfer title of a tower, antenna and all appurtenances to the City upon completion of construction and all required tower site plan requirements under MMC 15.370(2), free and clear of all liens and encumbrances excepting those acceptable to the City; or

2. Enter into an agreement with the City in which a tower owner agrees to reserve space on a tower and install telecommunication facilities on a tower for the express usage by the City as may be necessary for police, fire or other City services, or other recognized public purposes.

(x) Access. A tower site must include access from a designated public right-of-way to at least one paved vehicular parking space on the tower site. A separate driveway access permit must be obtained by the tower owner, and granted by the City Engineer. Issuance of a driveway access permit is not guaranteed under this section.

(y) Occupancy. All towers and accessory structures shall be unoccupied.

(z) Principal or Accessory Use. A telecommunication tower may be considered either a principal or accessory use. If a tower is a principal use, then it must be located on a tower site which meets the minimum lot size requirements of the underlying zoning district in which the tower is located, meets the setback requirements under subsection (5)(k) of this section, and which is large enough to accommodate a tower, accessory structures, landscaping, parking and other required improvements.

The presence of an existing structure on a tower site shall not preclude the installation of a tower on such tower site as an accessory use.

(aa) Fire Protection. Tower support buildings shall be designed and constructed with built-in ventilation. At least one smoke detector shall be installed in each support or accessory building, which, upon activation, will terminate the electrical power to the building. No combustible storage is permitted in tower support structures. At least a one-hour fire resistant interior surface shall be used in the construction of all buildings at a tower site. Monitored automatic fire extinguishing systems and rapid entry (Knox) systems shall be installed at the discretion of the City’s Fire Chief.

(bb) Inspection and Certification. All tower sites may be inspected at least once each year by the Director of Building Inspection to determine compliance with this section. Deviation from original construction standards or noncompliance with any requirements for which a City permit has been obtained shall constitute a violation under this section.

The Director of Building Inspection shall have authority to enter and inspect all improvements at a tower site, for the purpose of determining whether a tower site and improvements comply with all City regulations, and all other applicable Federal and State regulations and requirements. The City reserves the right to conduct such inspections at any time, upon reasonable notice to the tower owner.

Notice of any violations shall be sent by the Director of Building Inspection to the tower owner, who will have 60 calendar days from the date the notification is issued to make repairs. The tower owner will notify the Director of Building Inspection that the repairs have been made, and shall submit documentation, satisfactory to the City, that the repairs have been completed in accordance with all Federal, State and local regulations and requirements. The tower owner shall have not more than 60 calendar days from the date of said notice to complete the repairs.

(cc) Tower and Antenna License Fee. Exclusive of any fees or payments required under any lease, license or other agreement related to a tower, tower site or alternative tower structure, a tower owner is required to pay to the Director of Building Inspection a one-time installation/inspection and management fee, as established by resolution of the Common Council, representing payment for the City’s time and expense to approve a tower owner’s initial installation, as well as to periodically inspect a tower site to ensure that all installation standards at the tower site have been complied with by the tower owner. For towers, the fee is to be calculated by multiplying an established fee rate by the height of the tower. For a new antenna installed on a tower or alternative tower structure, the fee is to be calculated by multiplying an established fee rate by the number of antennas to be installed. Said fees shall be collected by the Director of Building Inspection, and shall be due and payable concurrent with the issuance of a building permit for a tower or antenna. Failure to make this payment shall be deemed a violation of this section.

(dd) Placement of Towers or Antennas on City- or MPU-Owned Land and Structures.

1. In addition to the requirements in subsection (3) of this section, telecommunication facilities located on land or an alternative tower structure owned by the City or MPU must comply with the following requirements:

B. There is no adverse impact on surrounding properties or the Manitowoc County Airport;

C. Prior to issuance of a building permit, the tower owner will enter into a lease or license agreement with the City or MPU, which shall, at minimum, require the tower owner to:

i. Obtain worker’s compensation insurance (at statutory limits), comprehensive general liability and property damage insurance, and all risk property insurance insuring the telecommunication facilities for their full replacement costs;

ii. Provide equitable compensation to the City or MPU for the use of public property and other necessary provisions and safeguards;

iii. Upon reasonable notice, a tower, antenna and other tower site improvements both above and below grade may be required to be removed and the site restored to its original preconstruction condition, except for ordinary wear and tear, at the tower owner’s expense; and

iv. Tower owner must reimburse the City and MPU for any costs which the City and MPU incur because of the presence of a tower, antenna and all other tower site improvements both above and below grade.

D. The tower owner’s access to a tower site will not increase the risks of contamination to the City’s water supply (this determination shall be made by MPU);

E. There is sufficient room at a tower site to accommodate a tower owner’s facility;

F. The presence of the facility will not increase maintenance costs to the City or MPU; and

G. The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health of workers maintaining the structure, or the health, safety or general welfare of the public.

2. Placement of telecommunication facilities in City-owned parks will only be considered after the approval of the Director of Parks and Recreation.

3. The Common Council may terminate any lease or license agreement with a tower owner, if it determines that any one of the following conditions exist:

A. A new tower owner with a higher priority for public health and safety cannot find another adequate location, and the telecommunication facilities of a new tower owner would be incompatible with the existing use;

B. A tower owner’s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users, regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately predicted in any technical analysis filed in accordance with subsection (5)(gg) of this section; or

C. A tower owner violates any Federal, State or local law regulating telecommunication facilities, or any of the standards outlined in this section, or any conditions attached to the City’s approved conditional use permit or site plan.

Before taking action to terminate an agreement, the City will provide notice to a tower owner, and MPU, if a tower site is located on MPU-owned property, of the intended termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for a tower owner to address the Common Council regarding the proposed action.

(ee) Insurance. At all tower sites, the tower owner shall provide the City with proof of insurance for required coverages under subsection (5)(dd)(1)(C)(i) of this section which protects against losses due to personal injury and property damage resulting from the construction, operation or collapse of telecommunication facilities. Such insurance coverages shall be continually maintained in effect during a tower owner’s occupancy at a tower site. A tower owner shall be responsible to instruct its insurance carrier to provide the Director of Building Inspection with certificates of all such insurance, including the delivery of timely notices regarding policy renewals, and changes in insurance carrier or coverage levels, while telecommunication facilities remain operational at a tower site.

(ff) Removal of Facilities upon Discontinuation, Abandonment or Termination. In the event that the use of a tower or antenna is discontinued, abandoned or terminated at a tower site or an alternative tower structure, or a conditional use permit revoked or terminated by the City under MMC 15.370(27)(f), or any termination or expiration not specifically referenced in this section, the tower owner shall provide written notice to the Director of Building Inspection of its intent to discontinue, abandon or terminate a tower or antenna. In addition, a tower owner shall provide the Director of Building Inspection with a copy of any notice required to be provided to the FCC or FAA detailing the intent to cease operations at a tower site, and the date when the use shall be discontinued, abandoned or terminated. A tower owner shall have 60 calendar days after discontinuation, abandonment or termination of operations at a tower site within which to dismantle and remove all telecommunication facilities from a tower site including all structures and site improvements, both above and below grade, and restore a tower site to its original preconstruction condition, except for ordinary wear and tear.

In the event a tower owner fails to remove the telecommunication facilities and restore a tower site within the 60-calendar-day period, the City may remove, or cause the removal of, a tower, antenna and related structures and site improvements, both above and below grade, and restore a tower site to its original preconstruction condition, except for ordinary wear and tear. After removal of the facilities and restoration of a tower site, the City may place an assessment against the property to recover all direct and indirect costs incurred in dismantling, disposal and restoration of a tower site, including court costs and reasonable attorney fees, or may use any other legal remedy available by law to recover its costs.

(gg) Tower Application. A written request by a tower owner for the issuance of a conditional use permit by the Common Council as required under subsection (4) of this section shall be prepared by a tower owner and submitted to the Common Council for referral to, and consideration by, the City Plan Commission. The City shall in no way be obligated to consider an application under this section until all information outlined hereunder has been provided to the sole satisfaction of the City. The tower application shall include, at minimum, the following information:

1. The legal name, mailing address, fax and telephone number of a tower owner and property owner (if not the same party as the tower owner).

As a basis for review of a TND application by the City Plan Commission and Common Council, the following criteria, in addition to the criteria specified under MMC 15.370(27)(c), shall be applied to the application with specific consideration as to whether or not the proposed TND is consistent with the spirit and intent of this section, is consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan, has been prepared with professional advice and guidance, and produces significant benefits to the City in terms of affordability and environmental design.

(a) Character and Integrity of Land Use. In a TND, the land uses proposed and their intensity and arrangement on the site shall be of a visual and operational character which:

1. Is compatible to the physical nature of the site with particular concern for preservation of natural features, tree growth and open space;

2. Would produce an attractive environment of sustained aesthetic and ecological desirability, economic stability, and functional practicality compatible with the general development plans for the area as established by the City’s Comprehensive Plan;

3. Would not adversely affect the anticipated provisions for school or other municipal services; and

4. Would not create a traffic or parking demand incompatible with the existing or proposed facilities to serve the TND.

(b) Economic Feasibility and Impact. The proponents of a TND application shall provide evidence satisfactory to the City Plan Commission and Common Council of the economic feasibility of the development, including, but not limited to, letters of intent, prelease commitments and the availability of adequate financing, and shall further demonstrate that the TND would not adversely affect the economic prosperity of the City, or diminish the values of surrounding properties.

(c) Engineering Design Standards. The width of street rights-of-way, width and location of streets or other paving, outdoor lighting, location of sewer and water lines, provision for stormwater drainage or other similar environmental engineering considerations shall be based on standards necessary to implement the specific functions in a specific situation, provided, however, in no case shall standards be less than those necessary to ensure the public safety and welfare as determined by the City Engineer.

(d) Preservation and Maintenance of Open Space. In a TND, the owner shall be required to provide open space that is “developed” with active recreational facilities provided by the owner; and/or “undeveloped” which is designed to preserve important site amenities and environmentally sensitive areas, and which may permit certain improvements provided by the owner such as the cutting of trails, the provision of picnic areas, etc.

In a TND, all common open space, at the election of the City, shall be either set aside as common land for the sole benefit, use and enjoyment of present and future lot, home or business owners within the TND and their guests, or shall be dedicated to the City as park land for the use of the general public, or shall be subjected to a perpetual conservation easement in favor of the City or not-for-profit organization of the City’s choosing. All common open space, not individually owned or dedicated for public use and that is intended for the common use or enjoyment of the residents of the TND, shall be subject to perpetual easements. The City will not accept the dedication of open space that is not part of an existing, improved parcel.

Any lands reserved or dedicated for open space purposes shall contain appropriate covenants and deed restrictions ensuring that the open space area will continue in perpetuity for the purpose specified, will be maintained, and will not be turned into a commercial enterprise admitting the general public at a fee.

The City Plan Commission shall determine which of these options is more appropriate, and shall recommend to the Common Council one or more of the following procedures:

1. The open space land shall be conveyed by the owner to a nonprofit organization so that fee simple title shall be vested in such organization; provided, that suitable arrangements have been made for maintenance of said land and any building thereon. In addition, the open space to be reserved shall be protected against building development by conveying to the City as part of the conditions for CUP or TND approval a perpetual open space easement over such open areas restricting the area against any future building or use, except as consistent with that of providing landscaped open space for the aesthetic and recreational satisfaction of the surrounding residences. Buildings or uses for noncommercial, recreational or cultural purposes compatible with the open space objective may be permitted only where specifically authorized as part of the TND, or subsequently with the express approval of the Common Council, following approval of the FDP and final plat by the Common Council.

2. The open space land shall be dedicated to the City for park and recreational purposes by the owner. Where this option is determined to be in the best interest of the City, the owner shall be compelled to improve the natural condition of the open space.

3. The City or a not-for-profit organization of the City’s choosing shall be conveyed a perpetual conservation easement in, and to, the open space land for the purpose of assuring the retention and preservation of open space. Where this option is determined to be in the best interest of the City, the owner shall be compelled to improve the natural condition of the open space. Such easement shall also establish maintenance and enforcement procedures, and allow the City or the designated not-for-profit to perform obligations of the owner, collect its costs from the owner, and charge such costs against the open space land and adjoining property of the owner, and collect such costs as an assessment. Such easements shall not grant any right to use the open space as public park, nor any rights to the City or the public to make improvements on, or physical use of, the open space.

4. The care and maintenance of such open space reservations shall be assured by establishment of an appropriate management organization for the TND. The manner of assuring maintenance and assessing such costs to individual properties shall be included in any easement or contractual agreement, and shall be included in the title to each property.

5. Ownership and tax liability of private open space reservations shall be established in a manner acceptable to the City, and made a part of the conditions of the FDP approval.

(e) Off-Street Parking and Loading. Alternatives to off-street parking and loading requirements under MMC 15.430 shall be accepted if the owner demonstrates that such standards better reflect local conditions within the TND.

(f) Implementation Schedule. The owner of a TND shall submit a reasonable and detailed schedule for the implementation of the development to the satisfaction of the City Plan Commission and Common Council, including suitable provisions for assurances that each phase will be brought to completion in a manner that will not result in an adverse effect upon the City as a result of termination at that point.

The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendations and determination, shall consider the reasonableness of the proposed implementation schedule, and any staging plan for the physical development of the proposed TND. Commencement of the physical development of the TND within one year of the date of Common Council approval of the FDP and final plat shall be deemed reasonable.

(g) Residential TND Considerations. The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed residential TND, shall further consider whether:

1. Such development will create an attractive residential environment of sustained desirability and economic stability, including structures in relation to terrain, consideration of safe pedestrian flow, ready access to recreational space, and coordination with overall plans for the City;

2. The total net residential density within the TND will be compatible with the City’s Comprehensive Plan or components thereof, and shall be compatible with the density of the neighborhood wherein located;

3. Structure type will be generally compatible with other structural types permitted in the neighborhood;

4. Provisions have been made for the installation of adequate public facilities, and the continuing maintenance and operation of such facilities if privately owned;

5. Provisions have been made for adequate, continuing fire and police protection;

6. The population density of the TND will not have an adverse effect upon the City’s capacity to provide needed municipal service facilities; and

7. Adequate guarantee is provided for permanent preservation of open space areas as shown on the FDP or final plat, either by private reservation and maintenance, or by dedication to the public.

(h) Commercial TND Considerations. The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed commercial TND, shall further consider whether:

1. The economic practicality of the proposed TND can be justified;

2. The proposed TND will be served by off-street parking and truck service area and facilities in accordance with MMC 15.430 or subsection (21)(e) of this section;

3. The proposed TND shall be adequately provided with, and shall not impose any undue burden on, public services and facilities such as fire and police protection, street maintenance, water, sanitary sewer and stormwater drainage, and maintenance of public areas;

4. The locations of entrances and exits have been designated to prevent unnecessary interference with the safe and efficient movement of traffic and surrounding streets, and that the TND will not create any adverse effect upon the general traffic pattern of the surrounding neighborhood; and

5. The architectural design, landscaping, control of lighting and general site development will result in an attractive and harmonious service area compatible with, and not adversely affecting, the property values of the surrounding neighborhood.

(i) Mixed Use TND Considerations. The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed mixed use TND, shall further consider whether:

1. The proposed mixture of uses results in a unified composite which is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood; and

2. The various types of uses conform to the general requirements as hereinbefore set forth in this chapter, and are applicable to projects of such use and character.

(22) Revisions or Changes in a TND. A TND shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded FDP and final plat, if applicable, plus any approved and recorded amendments thereto, and a performance agreement under MMC 15.370(2)(i). The recorded documents shall be binding upon the owner, their successors, grantees, heirs and assigns, and shall limit and control the location and use of the property contained in a TND, including the internal use of buildings and structures, as set forth therein.

(a) Major Changes. Changes which alter the concept or intent of the TND including increases in land use density; changes in location and type of nonresidential land uses; increases in the height of buildings; reduction of proposed open space; more than a 15 percent modification in the proportion of housing types; changes in road standards or alignment; utilities; drainage; changes in the building schedule; or changes in the final governing agreements may be approved only by submission of a new GDP and supporting data, and following the steps and subsequent amendment of the FDP as detailed in subsection (18) of this section.

(b) Minor Changes. The City Planner may approve minor changes in the TND which do not change the concept or intent of the TND. The City Engineer may approve minor changes in road standards or alignment, utility and site drainage that do not alter the overall design of the TND. A minor change to a TND will not require submission of a new GDP and will not require the procedure in subsection (15) of this section. Minor changes are defined as any change not defined as a major change under subsection (22)(a) of this section. The City Planner and City Engineer will have sole discretion as to whether a change is considered a minor change under this section, or a major change under subsection (22)(a) of this section.

(23) Performance Agreement. Prior to the issuance of a building permit by the Director of Building Inspection, the owner shall execute a performance agreement in accordance with MMC 15.370(2)(i). The performance agreement shall incorporate all compliance conditions and requirements of the CUP and FDP approvals as identified on the approved CUP, FDP and final plat to secure the implementation and completion of the FDP as approved, including, but not limited to, the following:

(a) Conditions relative to financing of necessary public improvements and facilities;

(b) A schedule for commencement and completion of the project and any phases thereof;

(c) Time limits for commencement and completion of the development;

(d) Requirements for appropriate easements, reservations and land dedications;

(f) Other conditions, terms, restrictions and requirements relevant to the approved FDP and final plat including the termination and amendment of the performance agreement.

(24) Schedule of Construction. The Common Council shall consider the revocation of a CUP and TND if construction falls more than two years behind from the dates established in an approved implementation schedule provided under subsection (21)(f) of this section; said two years shall commence as of the date the FDP is recorded under subsection (19) of this section. The revocation process shall be conducted as outlined under MMC 15.370(27)(f). The owner shall be notified at least 30 calendar days prior to the date of any revocation hearing.

(25) TND Design Standards.

(a) Neighborhood Uses. In order to achieve the proximity necessary to make neighborhoods walkable, it is important to mix land uses. A TND may consist of residential uses, a mixed use area, and open space as provided below:

1. Residential uses in accordance with subsection (25)(a)(1)(A) of this section may occur anywhere in the TND. For infill development, the residential uses may be satisfied by existing residential uses adjacent to the TND:

A. Permitted uses and conditional uses in the “R-1,” “R-2,” “R-3,” “R-4,” “R-5,” “R-6,” and “R-7” Zoning Districts.

1. In areas devoted to mixed residential uses the number of single-family attached and detached units and multifamily units permitted shall be in compliance with MMC 15.170(4)(d);

2. In mixed use areas:

A. The number of single-family and multifamily dwelling units permitted shall be calculated the same as subsection (25)(b)(1) of this section, plus an additional number of units not to exceed 10 percent of the amount permitted.

B. Dwelling units constructed above commercial uses shall be permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units authorized under this section. However, the total number of dwelling units shall not be increased by more than 10 dwelling units or 10 percent, whichever is greater.

C. The total ground building area of nonresidential development uses, including off-street parking areas, shall not exceed 25 percent of the gross acreage of the TND area.

(c) Open Space. At least 20 percent of the gross acreage of the TND area must be open space. Open space may include undevelopable areas such as steep slopes and wetlands, and stormwater detention and retention basins, but shall exclude all right-of-way areas. Ninety percent of the lots within the areas devoted to mixed residential uses shall be within one-half mile or a 10-minute walk from a common open space.

(d) Stormwater Management. The design and development of the TND should minimize stormwater runoff, promote on-site filtration, and minimize the discharge of pollutants to ground and surface water. Natural topography and existing land cover should be maintained and protected to the maximum extent practicable. New development and redevelopment shall meet the following requirements:

1. Untreated, direct stormwater discharges to wetlands or surface waters are prohibited;

2. Post-development peak discharge rates shall not exceed predevelopment peak rates;

3. Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented to remove 80 percent of the average annual load of total suspended solids;

(e) Lot and Block Standards.

1. Street layouts should provide for perimeter blocks that are not more than 200 to 400 feet deep by 400 to 800 feet long. A variety of lot sizes shall be provided to facilitate housing diversity and choice, and meet the projected requirements of people with different housing needs;

2. Lot widths should create a relatively symmetrical street cross-section that reinforces the public space of the street as a simple, unified public space;

3. Structures in the mixed use area shall have no minimum setback. Commercial and civic or institutional buildings may abut the sidewalks in the mixed use area;

4. Single-family detached residences shall have a front yard building setback of 25 feet. Single-family attached residences and multifamily residences shall have a front yard building setback of 15 feet;

5. The principal building on lots devoted to single-family detached residences shall be set back no less than 30 feet from the rear lot line;

6. Provisions for zero side and rear lot line, single-family dwellings may be made; provided, that a reciprocal access easement is recorded for both lots and townhouses or other attached dwellings; provided, that all dwellings have pedestrian access to the rear yard through means other than the principal structure; and

7. Areas with setbacks less than 10 feet shall submit documentation to the City Engineer which demonstrates and ensures that snow in the setback areas will not be pushed into any public right-of-way.

(f) Circulation Standards. The circulation system shall allow for different modes of transportation. The circulation system shall provide functional and visual links within the residential, mixed use and open space areas of the TND, and shall be connected to existing and proposed external development. The circulation system shall provide adequate traffic capacity as determined by the City Engineer, provide connected pedestrian and bicycle routes (especially off-street bicycle or multi-use paths or bicycle lanes on the streets), control through traffic, limit lot access to streets of higher traffic volumes, and promote safe and efficient mobility through the TND.

(g) Pedestrian Circulation. Convenient pedestrian circulation systems that minimize pedestrian and motor vehicle conflicts shall be provided continuously throughout the TND. Where feasible, any existing pedestrian routes through the TND shall be preserved and enhanced. All streets, except for alleys, shall be bordered by sidewalks on both sides in accordance with the specifications listed in Table 1 under subsection (25)(k) of this section. The following provisions also apply:

1. Sidewalks in Residential Areas. Clear and well-lighted sidewalks, a minimum of five feet in width, depending on projected pedestrian traffic, shall connect all dwelling entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk;

2. Sidewalks in Mixed Use Areas. Clear and well-lighted walkways shall connect building entrances to the adjacent public sidewalk and to associated parking areas. Such walkways shall be a minimum of six feet in width. Sidewalks in areas where zero side and rear lot lines are present shall be full sidewalk from the property line to the curb;

3. Disabled Accessibility. Sidewalks shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as may be amended from time to time; and

4. Crosswalks. Intersections of sidewalks with streets shall be designed with clearly defined edges. Crosswalks shall be well-lit and clearly marked with contrasting paving materials at the edges or with striping, and shall be signed with materials in compliance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

(h) Bicycle Circulation. Bicycle circulation shall be accommodated on streets and/or on dedicated bicycle paths. Where feasible, any existing bicycle routes through the TND shall be preserved and enhanced. Facilities for bicycle travel may include off-street bicycle paths (generally shared with pedestrians and other nonmotorized users) and separate striped, four-foot bicycle lanes on streets. If a bicycle lane is combined with a lane for parking, the combined width shall be 14 feet.

(i) Public Transit Access. Where public transit service is available or planned, convenient access to transit stops shall be provided. Where transit shelters are provided, they shall be placed in highly visible locations that promote security through surveillance, and shall be well-lighted.

(j) Motor Vehicle Circulation. Motor vehicle circulation shall be designed to minimize conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Traffic calming features such as queuing lanes, curb extensions, traffic circles, and medians may be used to encourage slow traffic speeds if approved by the City Engineer.

(k) Street Hierarchy. Each street within a TND shall be classified according to the following (arterial and minor arterial streets shall not bisect a TND):

1. Collector. This street provides access to commercial or mixed use buildings, but it is also part of the City’s major street network. On-street parking helps to slow traffic. Additional parking is provided in lots to the side or rear of buildings;

2. Minor Collector. This street provides primary access to individual residential properties and connects streets of lower and higher function. Design speed is 25 miles per hour;

3. Local Street. This street provides access to individual residential properties. Traffic volumes are relatively low, with a design speed of 20 miles per hour; and

4. Alley. These streets provide secondary access to residential properties where streets are narrow, where the street is designed with a narrow width to provide limited on-street parking, or where alley access development is desired to increase residential densities. Alleys shall also provide delivery access or alternate parking access to commercial properties.

Table 1: Attributes of Streets in a TND  

	 	Collector	Minor Collector	Local Streets	Alley

	ADT	1,500 or more	750 – 1,500	Less than 750	N/A

	Right-of-way (ROW)	76 – 88 feet	66 – 72 feet	60 – 66 feet	12 – 20 feet

	Auto travel lanes	2 or 3 12-foot lanes	2 11-foot lanes	2 10-foot lanes; or 1 14-foot 1-way lane	2 8-to-10-foot lanes for 2-way traffic; or 1 12-foot lane for 1-way traffic

	Bicycle lanes	2 6-foot lanes combined with parking lanes	4-foot lanes with no parking; or 6-foot lanes combined with parking lanes	None	None

	Parking*	1 or both sides, 8 feet	1 or both sides, 8 feet	1 or both sides, 8 feet	None (access to individual drives and garages outside ROW)

	Curb lawn or planting strips	Minimum 6 feet	Minimum 6 feet	Minimum 6 feet	None

	Sidewalks	Both sides, 5 feet minimum	Both sides, 5 feet minimum	Both sides, 5 feet minimum	None

* It shall be a violation of this section to allow parking where the TND design did not account for such use.

(l) Street Layout. The TND shall maintain the existing street grid, where present, and restore any disrupted street grid, where feasible. In addition:

1. Intersections shall be at right angles whenever possible, but in no case less than 75 degrees. Low volume streets may form three-way intersections creating an inherent right-of-way assignment (the through street receives precedence) which significantly reduces accidents without the use of traffic controls.

2. Corner Radii. The roadway edge at street intersections shall be rounded by a tangential arc with a maximum radii of 15 feet for local streets, and 20 feet or more for intersections involving collector or arterial streets. The intersection of a local street and an access lane or alley shall be completed with a concrete trapezoidal approach.

3. Curb cuts for driveways to individual residential lots shall be prohibited along arterial streets. Curb cuts shall be limited to intersections with other streets or access drives to parking areas for commercial, civic or multifamily residential uses. Clear sight triangles shall be maintained at intersections, as specified below, unless controlled by electronic traffic signal devices:

	Intersection of	Minimum Clear Sight Distance

	Local street and collector	120 feet

	Collector and collector	130 feet

	Collector and arterial	50 feet

4. The orientation of streets shall enhance the visual impact of common open spaces and prominent buildings, create lots that facilitate passive solar design, and minimize street gradients. All streets shall terminate at other streets or at public land, except local streets may terminate in stub streets, when such streets act as connections to future phases of the development. Local streets may terminate when there is an appropriate cul-de-sac designed.

(m) Parking Requirements. Parking areas for shared or community use should be encouraged. In addition:

1. In the mixed use area, any parking lot shall be located at the rear or side of a building. If located at the side, screening shall be provided as specified in MMC 15.690(4);

2. A parking lot or garage may not be adjacent to or opposite a street intersection;

3. In a mixed use area, a commercial use shall provide parking space in accordance with MMC 15.430 or subsection (21)(e) of this section;

4. Parking lots or garages shall provide not less than one bicycle parking space for every 10 motor vehicle parking spaces;

5. Adjacent on-street parking may apply toward the minimum parking requirements;

6. In the mixed residential areas, parking may be provided on site; and

7. Multifamily uses must provide parking in accordance with MMC 15.430 or subsection (21)(e) of this section.

(26) Architectural Standards. A variety of architectural features and building materials is encouraged to give each building or group of buildings in a TND a distinct character.

(a) Guidelines for Existing Structures. MMC 15.650 shall determine the guidelines for existing structures. In addition, the following shall be observed.

1. Existing structures, if determined to be historic or architecturally significant, shall be protected from demolition or encroachment by incompatible structures or landscape development; and

15.750 Planned Unit Development (PUD) District.

(1) Purpose. The PUD District is established to encourage superior design and site planning, and provide for more creative development of land than is possible under conventional zoning districts. A PUD provides an opportunity to encourage a mix of residential, recreational, institutional, office, retail, commercial and industrial land uses and densities within a development in an economic and compatible manner, by allowing for greater freedom, imagination and flexibility in the development of land, while ensuring substantial compliance with the basic intent of Chapters 15 and 21 MMC and the City’s Comprehensive Plan.

(2) Character of Site. All PUDs must be suitable for development in the manner proposed without hazard to persons or property, on and off the site, from flooding, erosion, subsidence or slipping of the soil, or other dangers.

(3) Unified Control. All land included for development as a PUD shall be under the legal control of the owner, whether the owner as defined under MMC 15.730(14) be an individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or any combination thereof. Owners requesting approval of a PUD shall present evidence of unified and total control of the entire land area within the proposed PUD, together with written evidence that the owner has the unrestricted right to impose all of the covenants and conditions upon the land as are required by the provisions of this section.

(4) PUD as a Conditional Use Permit (CUP). The establishment of a PUD requires the issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to MMC 15.370(27), and is allowed as such only in accordance with the district regulations of the underlying zoning district. The predominant land use in a PUD shall be a permitted use or conditional use permitted in the underlying zoning district.

(5) Transfer of Zoning. Where there is more than one underlying zoning district within the boundaries of a parcel of land proposed as a PUD, the Common Council may, upon recommendation of the City Plan Commission, approve the transfer of permitted uses of the underlying zoning, in equal proportion of total land area, to any part of the proposed PUD where such transfer will promote the intent and purpose of this section.

(6) Fees. Each PUD submitted for review and approval under this section shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, as established by resolution of the Common Council, for the administration of this section.

(7) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. If a conflict exists between this section and any other provision or requirement contained elsewhere in Chapter 7, 8, 15 or 21 MMC, the provision or requirements contained elsewhere in Chapter 7, 8, 15 or 21 MMC shall control, unless approved by the Common Council, upon recommendation by the City Plan Commission.

(8) Coordination with City Subdivision Requirements. Subdivision review under Chapter 21 MMC shall be applied simultaneously with the review of a PUD under this section. The PUD plans required under this section shall be submitted in a form which will satisfy the requirements of Chapter 21 MMC for the preliminary and final plats.

(9) Interpretation. The provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be construed in favor of the City, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes, Wisconsin Administrative Code, rules, regulations or City ordinances, now in effect, or which may be later promulgated.

(10) Severability. If any subsection, provision or portion of this section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this section.

(11) Exceptions to Standards. The Common Council, upon recommendation from the City Plan Commission, may permit deviations from the standards and requirements outlined in this section when it can be determined that:

(a) The waiver of any standards and requirements shall result in a direct positive benefit to the residents and/or occupants of the PUD; said benefits shall be in the form of provisions of exceptional amenities, design excellence, etc.;

(b) The objectives underlying these standards and requirements can be met without strict adherence to them; and

(c) Strict adherence to these standards and requirements, given the peculiarities in the tract of land comprising the PUD or the facilities proposed, would be unreasonable.

(12) General PUD Requirements.

(a) Minimum Total Area Requirements. Areas designated as PUDs shall contain a minimum total gross area of at least two acres.

(b) Lot Area, Lot Width, Heights and Yard Requirements. In a PUD, there shall be no specific lot area, lot width, height, floor area ratio, yard and usable open space requirements, but such requirements as are made a part of an approved and recorded final development plan (FDP) under subsection (16) of this section shall be, along with a recorded plat if required, construed to be and enforced as part of this chapter.

The City may, at City’s sole discretion and expense, upon completion of all conditions prerequisite to the approval of the FDP, final plat and issuance of a certificate of occupancy, terminate any or all conditions contained in the performance agreement, and file the necessary legal documents at the Register of Deeds.

(18) No Vested Rights Granted. Except as expressly provided by law or ordinance, no vested rights in connection with a PUD shall inure to the owner until the date a building permit is first issued by the City’s Director of Building Inspection. The City does not warrant under this section that the owner is entitled to any other required approvals.

(19) Basis for Approval of an Application for a PUD. As a basis for review of a PUD application by the City Plan Commission and Common Council, the following criteria, in addition to the criteria specified under MMC 15.370(27)(c), shall be applied to the application with specific consideration as to whether or not the proposed PUD is consistent with the spirit and intent of this section, is consistent with the City’s Comprehensive Plan, has been prepared with professional advice and guidance, and produces significant benefits to the City in terms of affordability and environmental design.

(a) Character and Integrity of Land Use. In a PUD, the land uses proposed and their intensity and arrangement on the site shall be of a visual and operational character which:

1. Are compatible to the physical nature of the site with particular concern for preservation of natural features, tree growth and open space;

2. Would produce an attractive environment of sustained aesthetic and ecological desirability, economic stability, and functional practicality compatible with the general development plans for the area as established by the City’s Comprehensive Plan;

3. Would not adversely affect the anticipated provisions for school or other municipal services; and

4. Would not create a traffic or parking demand incompatible with the existing or proposed facilities to serve the PUD.

(b) Economic Feasibility and Impact. The proponents of a PUD application shall provide evidence satisfactory to the City Plan Commission and Common Council of the economic feasibility of the development, including but not limited to letters of intent, prelease commitments and the availability of adequate financing, and shall further demonstrate that the PUD would not adversely affect the economic prosperity of the City, or diminish the values of surrounding properties.

(c) Engineering Design Standards. The width of street rights-of-way, width and location of streets or other paving, outdoor lighting, location of sewer and water lines, provision for stormwater drainage or other similar environmental engineering considerations shall be based on standards necessary to implement the specific functions in a specific situation; provided, however, in no case shall standards be less than those necessary to ensure the public safety and welfare as determined by the City Engineer.

(d) Preservation and Maintenance of Open Space. In a PUD, the owner shall be required to provide open space that is “developed” with active recreational facilities provided by the owner; and/or “undeveloped” which is designed to preserve important site amenities and environmentally sensitive areas, and which may permit certain improvements provided by the owner such as the cutting of trails, the provision of picnic areas, etc.

In a PUD, all common open space, at the election of the City, shall be either set aside as common land for the sole benefit, use and enjoyment of present and future lot, home or business owners within the PUD and their guests, or shall be dedicated to the City as park land for the use of the general public, or shall be subjected to a perpetual conservation easement in favor of the City or not-for-profit organization of the City’s choosing. All common open space, not individually owned or dedicated for public use and that is intended for the common use or enjoyment of the residents of the PUD, shall be subject to perpetual easements. The City will not accept the dedication of open space that is not part of an existing, improved parcel.

Any lands reserved or dedicated for open space purposes shall contain appropriate covenants and deed restrictions ensuring that the open space area will continue in perpetuity for the purpose specified, will be maintained, and will not be turned into a commercial enterprise admitting the general public at a fee.

The City Plan Commission shall determine which of these options is more appropriate, and shall recommend to the Common Council one or more of the following procedures:

1. The open space land shall be conveyed by the owner to a nonprofit organization so that fee simple title shall be vested in such organization; provided, that suitable arrangements have been made for maintenance of said land and any building thereon. In addition, the open space to be reserved shall be protected against building development by conveying to the City as part of the conditions for CUP or PUD approval a perpetual open space easement over such open areas restricting the area against any future building or use, except as consistent with that of providing landscaped open space for the aesthetic and recreational satisfaction of the surrounding residences. Buildings or uses for noncommercial, recreational or cultural purposes compatible with the open space objective may be permitted only where specifically authorized as part of the PUD, or subsequently with the express approval of the Common Council, following approval of the FDP and final plat by the Common Council.

2. The open space land shall be dedicated to the City for park and recreational purposes by the owner. Where this option is determined to be in the best interest of the City, the owner shall be compelled to improve the natural condition of the open space.

3. The City or a not-for-profit organization of the City’s choosing shall be conveyed a perpetual conservation easement in, and to, the open space land for the purpose of assuring the retention and preservation of open space. Where this option is determined to be in the best interest of the City, the owner shall be compelled to improve the natural condition of the open space. Such easement shall also establish maintenance and enforcement procedures, and allow the City or the designated not-for-profit to perform obligations of the owner, collect its costs from the owner, and charge such costs against the open space land and adjoining property of the owner, and collect such costs as an assessment. Such easements shall not grant any right to use the open space as public park, nor any rights to the City or the public to make improvements on, or physical use of, the open space.

4. The care and maintenance of such open space reservations shall be assured by establishment of an appropriate management organization for the PUD. The manner of assuring maintenance and assessing such costs to individual properties shall be included in any easement or contractual agreement, and shall be included in the title to each property.

5. Ownership and tax liability of private open space reservations shall be established in a manner acceptable to the City, and made a part of the conditions of the FDP approval.

(e) Off-Street Parking and Loading. Alternatives to off-street parking and loading requirements under MMC 15.430 shall be accepted, if the owner demonstrates that such standards better reflect local conditions within the PUD.

(f) Implementation Schedule. The owner of a PUD shall submit a reasonable schedule for the implementation of the development to the satisfaction of the City Plan Commission and Common Council, including suitable provisions for assurances that each phase will be brought to completion in a manner that will not result in an adverse effect upon the City as a result of termination at that point.

The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendation and determination, shall consider the reasonableness of the proposed implementation schedule, and any staging plan for the physical development of the proposed PUD. Commencement of the physical development of the PUD one year of the date of Common Council approval of the FDP and final plat shall be deemed reasonable.

(g) Residential PUD Considerations. The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed residential PUD, shall further consider whether:

1. Such development will create an attractive residential environment of sustained desirability and economic stability, including structures in relation to terrain, consideration of safe pedestrian flow, ready access to recreational space, and coordination with overall plans for the City;

2. The total net residential density within the PUD will be compatible with the City’s Comprehensive Plan or components thereof, and shall be compatible with the density of the neighborhood wherein located;

3. Structure type will be generally compatible with other structural types permitted in the neighborhood;

4. Provisions have been made for the installation of adequate public facilities, and the continuing maintenance and operation of such facilities if privately owned;

5. Provisions have been made for adequate, continuing fire and police protection;

6. The population density of the PUD will not have an adverse effect upon the City’s capacity to provide needed municipal service facilities; and

7. Adequate guarantee is provided for permanent preservation of open space areas as shown on the FDP or final plat, either by private reservation and maintenance, or by dedication to the public.

(h) Commercial PUD Considerations. The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed commercial PUD, shall further consider whether:

1. The economic practicality of the proposed PUD can be justified;

2. The proposed PUD will be served by off-street parking and truck service area and facilities in accordance with MMC 15.430 or subsection (19)(e) of this section;

3. The proposed PUD shall be adequately provided with, and shall not impose any undue burden on, public services and facilities such as fire and police protection, street maintenance, water, sanitary sewer and stormwater drainage, and maintenance of public areas;

4. The locations of entrances and exits have been designated to prevent unnecessary interference with the safe and efficient movement of traffic and surrounding streets, and that the PUD will not create any adverse effect upon the general traffic pattern of the surrounding neighborhood; and

5. The architectural design, landscaping, control of lighting and general site development will result in an attractive and harmonious service area compatible with, and not adversely affecting the property values of, the surrounding neighborhood.

(i) Industrial PUD Considerations. The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed industrial PUD, shall further consider whether:

1. The operational character and physical arrangement of buildings will be compatible with the latest in performance standards and industrial development design, and will not result in an adverse effect upon the property values of the surrounding neighborhood;

2. The proposed PUD shall be adequately provided with, and shall not impose any undue burden on, public services and facilities, such as fire and police protection, street maintenance, water, sanitary sewer and stormwater drainage, and maintenance of public areas;

3. The proposed PUD will be served by off-street parking and truck service areas and facilities in accordance with MMC 15.430 or subsection (19)(e) of this section, and will be adequately served by easy access rail and/or arterial highway facilities; and

4. The proposed PUD is properly related to the total transportation system of the City, and will not result in an adverse effect on the safety and efficiency of the public streets.

(j) Mixed Use PUD Considerations. The City Plan Commission and Common Council, in making their respective recommendation and determination as to a proposed mixed use PUD, shall further consider whether:

1. The proposed mixture of uses results in a unified composite which is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood; and

2. The various types of uses conform to the general requirements as herein set forth in this chapter, and are applicable to projects of such use and character.

(20) Revisions or Changes in a PUD. A PUD shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded FDP and final plat, if applicable, plus any approved and recorded amendments thereto, and a performance agreement under MMC 15.370(2)(i). The recorded documents shall be binding upon the owner, their successors, grantees, heirs and assigns, and shall limit and control the location and use of the property contained in a PUD, including the internal use of buildings and structures, as set forth therein.

(a) Major Changes. Changes which alter the concept or intent of the PUD including increases in the land use density; changes in location and type of nonresidential land uses; increases in the height of buildings; reduction of proposed open space; more than a 15 percent modification in the proportion of housing types; changes in road standards or alignment; utilities; drainage; changes in the building schedule; or changes in the final governing agreements, may be approved only by submission of a new GDP and supporting data, and following the steps and subsequent amendment of the FDP as detailed in subsection (16) of this section.

(b) Minor Changes. The City Planner may approve minor changes in the PUD which do not change the concept or intent of the PUD. The City Engineer may approve minor changes in road standards or alignment, utilities and drainage that do not alter the overall design of the PUD. A minor change to a PUD will not require submission of a new GDP and will not require the procedure in subsection (13) of this section. Minor changes are defined as any change not defined as a major change under subsection (20)(a) of this section. The City Planner and City Engineer will have sole discretion as to whether a change under this section is considered a minor change, or a major change under subsection (20)(a) of this section.

(21) Performance Agreement. Prior to the issuance of a building permit by the Director of Building Inspection, the owner shall execute a performance agreement in accordance with MMC 15.370(2)(i).

16.070 Razing of Buildings.

(1) The purpose of this section is to regulate the razing or demolition and the removal of scrap and salvageable equipment and materials from vacated buildings without immediate functional replacement. The City of Manitowoc finds that such removal may result in the complete abandonment of property and reduce the chance that such property will in the future be devoted to any productive or enjoyable public or private use, and therefore cause conditions which will create health and safety hazards and aggravate blight, interfere with the enjoyment of and reduce the value of private property, and interfere with the safety and welfare of the public.

(a) Permit and Definition of “Demolition.” No person shall raze or demolish any building within the City without first obtaining a permit from the Fire Department, unless otherwise exempted under this section. For purposes of this section, the terms “demolition” and “razing” shall be used interchangeably, and shall be defined as a license for the deconstructing, destroying, razing, tearing down, or wrecking of any building including its foundation in an environmentally responsible manner, protective of worker safety. Demolition shall include any partial demolition and any interior demolition affecting more than 10 percent of the replacement value of the structure as determined by the Building Inspector. Any demolition work shall include (1) proper disposal of recyclables, solid waste, and hazardous materials pursuant to applicable regulations and approved plans, if any; (2) the controlled removal of materials to be salvaged or intended to be reclaimed or saved from destruction from the interior of a building including, but not limited to, machines, wire, conduit, equipment, steel, wood, copper, aluminum, glass, brick, concrete, asphalt material and the like; (3) termination of utilities serving the premises including permits and final inspections and approvals; (4) removal of driveways and repair of public sidewalks, as required; (5) site cleanup and restoration including grading, landscaping and fencing, as required; (6) compliance with all other applicable building regulations including, but not limited to, Section 30.08 of the Wisconsin Uniform Building Code; and (7) payment to the City of any outstanding taxes, fees, citations, or assessment owed.

(b) Permit Grant for Properties with Buildings in Excess of 100,000 Cubic Feet. Properties with buildings exceeding a total of 100,000 cubic feet require Common Council approval. The Common Council may consider the permit application only after receiving the recommendation of the Public Safety Committee.

Prior to making its recommendation to grant or deny the application, the Public Safety Committee shall consider: (1) the application; (2) the report, if any, of the Building Inspector; (3) the expertise and financial condition of the applicant and/or owner; (4) the effect of the proposed operation on the surrounding neighborhood; (5) the conditions in which the site and building will be left upon completion of the proposed demolition, including the post-demolition plan; (6) the effect on the City of having a stripped structure remain, if the structure is not proposed to be immediately razed or immediately renovated; (7) the presentation, if any, of the applicant; (8) the comments of the public; and (9) such other matters germane to the decision.

In making a recommendation, the Public Safety Committee shall address the following matters: (1) the amount of the irrevocable letter of credit, which shall in no case be less than 120 percent of the project cost, to be required by the City Attorney of the permittee as a condition of issuance of the permit and as a requirement of operation; (2) other State or local permits as required by law, rule or regulation that must be obtained as a condition of issuance of the permit or as a condition of operation; (3) reasonable special operating requirements to be required of the permittee; and (4) such other matters or limitations as the Public Safety Committee determines is necessary to protect the public interest.

After all conditions of issuance have been satisfied, the Building Inspector shall issue the permit to the applicant, who may then be referred to herein as permittee or permit holder.

(2) Application. The owner of a building to be razed shall sign the permit application. In the alternative, an agent for the owner may sign the permit application upon providing written authorization verifying permission of the owner to apply for the permit. The Building Inspector may require additional information, such as proof the applicant has sufficient financial resources and ability to complete the project, including, but not limited to: (a) identification of materials to be recycled; (b) a performance schedule; (c) financial assurances, including a project pro forma detailing projected revenues and expenses; (d) environmental assessment, asbestos or other reports regarding hazardous substances; and (e) other State or local permits as required by law, rule or regulation. The owner and demolition contractor/operator shall be jointly and severally liable for performance under a permit issued pursuant to this section.

(3) Fees. Permit fees shall be established by resolution of the Common Council.

(4) Irrevocable Letter of Credit or Alternative Forms of Security. Any application for a permit to engage in the razing of buildings within the City shall be accompanied by an irrevocable letter of credit which meets the following requirements:

(a) In an amount no less than 120 percent of the estimated project cost;

(b) Name the City as a beneficiary;

(c) Be irrevocable and unconditional;

(d) Be conditioned for payment to the City solely upon presentation of the letter of credit and a sight draft, which shall direct the issuing lending institution to pay the City without any explanation, affidavit or documentation;

(f) Issued by a company certified by the State to conduct such business within Wisconsin.

The irrevocable letter of credit shall be a guarantee of performance by the permittee. The City Attorney shall act as the reviewing authority for the letter of credit. The letter of credit shall be delivered to the attention of the City Attorney, who may reasonably require a greater amount on a case-by-case basis, where deemed necessary to protect the City. In considering the amount of the irrevocable letter of credit, the City Attorney shall consider: (1) the recommendation, if any, of the Building Inspector; (2) the expertise of the applicant; (3) the applicant’s work history; (4) the capitalization of the applicant; (5) the scope of the proposed project; (6) the possible environmental hazards that could be created or currently exist; (7) the effect of the proposed operation on the surrounding neighborhood; and (8) the cost of remediation on the City, should the City have to address any matter due to the unwillingness or inability of the permittee to complete its obligations.

(5) Comprehensive Liability Insurance. An applicant for a permit shall provide proof of comprehensive liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 per occurrence and per person, and $50,000 property damage. Such coverage shall be maintained for the duration of the project and shall be a condition of a permit issued under this section. In addition, the permittee shall agree to indemnify and hold the City harmless from any and all claims, demands, actions, judgments, liabilities and obligations of any nature whatsoever arising from the demolition activity or site restoration for which the permit is issued, including any attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the City as a result thereof. In addition to liability insurance, the Building Inspector or City Attorney may require additional coverages including, but not limited to, automobile liability, pollution legal liability or other environmental insurance coverage, and workers’ compensation.

(6) Disconnection of Utilities. The owner or agent shall notify all utilities having service connections within a building to be razed, such as water, electric, gas, sewer, telecommunications, and other connections. A permit to demolish or remove a building shall not be issued until the Building Inspector has determined that all appurtenant equipment, such as meters and regulators, has been removed, and service connections are sealed and plugged correctly. No permit to demolish or remove any building shall be issued without written proof of the notification and appropriate removal of appurtenant equipment provided to the Building Inspector.

(7) Sewer and Water Connections. During demolition, sewer pipes shall be protected to prevent entrance of sand, earth or other foreign materials. Upon completion of demolition, the ends of all underground sewer or drain pipes shall be securely stopped with watertight and durable material. The water supply and sewer systems shall be abandoned inside the lot line by a licensed master plumber.

If the water service from the property line to the connection at the watermain in the public right-of-way is constructed of lead or galvanized iron, the entire water service shall be abandoned at the watermain by the property owner and is not permitted for reuse. All water services abandoned at the watermain shall be witnessed by MPU personnel, who shall furnish a report to the City Plumbing Inspector. Failure to do so shall require excavation and street restoration at the owner’s expense to verify abandonment.

Abandonment of services shall take place at the same time as building demolition.

(8) Dropping Materials – Chutes Required. Where a space on the ground or on a floor is railed off and openings in boundary walls closed, materials may be dropped into such space. When a protected or enclosed space cannot be provided, material and debris shall be removed through fully enclosed inclined chutes of wood, metal or other approved durable material. Open chutes may be used to lower dismantled falsework or lumber from a height not exceeding 30 feet. The bottom of all chutes shall be equipped with a gate or stop for closing and regulating the flow of materials.

(9) Permit Conditions. All permits shall be subject to the following conditions:

(a) Permit Term. The razing or demolition of a building shall be completed 90 consecutive calendar days after the permit is issued. The Building Inspector may, at his/her discretion, extend the permit term for cause, on terms and conditions acceptable to the parties and recorded in writing. “Cause” shall mean the inability of the permittee to act due to circumstances beyond permittee’s reasonable control and upon the exercise of due diligence.

(b) Inspection of Work. During the entire period of any demolition project, employees and agents of the City shall have the ability to enter onto the property, at any time, without notice, for inspections. Such ability shall be a condition of the demolition permit. Work authorized by the permit is subject to inspection by the Building Inspector who shall have the authority to order corrective work. Failure to follow the orders of the Building Inspector, or to complete the raze in accordance with the Manitowoc Municipal Code, shall give the Building Inspector authority to seek restitution from the letter of credit or alternative security, by any remedies available at law.

(c) Foundation of Razed Building. Whenever a building has been razed, the foundation thereof, if any, shall be removed to at least two feet below adjacent grade and filled in with clean fill material approved by the Building Inspector with the top two feet of fill material being of dirt or sand. No combustible material may be used for the fill material.

(d) Driveway Approaches, Sidewalks and Slabs. Remaining driveway approaches shall be removed and replaced with curb and gutter; damaged public sidewalks shall be replaced; and driveway aprons, remaining slabs and private sidewalks shall be removed from the site pursuant to any permits for replacing curb and gutters, driveway approaches and public sidewalks obtained from the Department of Public Infrastructure.

(e) Restoration of Site. Prior to the issuance of a permit under this section by the Building Inspector to a contractor licensed in Wisconsin, the contractor may be required to provide a sufficient level of detail regarding the post-demolition activities, condition and use of the property. The Building Inspector reserves the right to require the property owner or its agent to submit (prior to commencement of any demolition activity) a site plan pursuant to MMC 15.370(2) for the property upon which the structure to be demolished is located. All debris, rubbish and other materials not used for fill shall be removed from the site upon completion of demolition work, and the site leveled and graded to provide proper drainage to conform with the grade of adjoining premises, or fenced in with a temporary solid barrier fence not less than four feet high to safeguard the public. The foundation walls shall be removed a minimum of two feet below adjacent grade, and the basement floor broken up to allow free flow of water to its natural grade. The site shall be left in a dust-free and erosion-free condition. Excavations shall be filled with a minimum of three inches of clean, solid fill to match lot grade within five consecutive calendar days of removal of the structure. The contractor shall be responsible for the repair and replacement of any public sidewalk, curb, gutter or street damaged in this process. Any excavation shall be protected with appropriate fences, barriers and/or lights.

(f) Disposal of Debris. Except for recycled or salvaged materials, the permit holder shall dispose of all building debris in a licensed landfill in a manner compliant with Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources requirements. At any time, the permit holder shall provide to the Building Inspector receipts and/or an itemized list of debris disposed of by dumping or salvage. There shall be no burning of any structure or demolition waste.

(g) Site Safety and Security. The permit holder shall, during the razing process, maintain the site in a safe and secure condition, and shall promptly report any personal injury and property damage to the Building Inspector.

1. All building materials which produce dust or other flying debris shall be sufficiently dampened during removal to minimize floating or blowing into the street or adjoining property. All adjacent streets, sidewalks or other public areas shall be protected by fences and/or scaffolds. The Building Inspector may require additional safety and security methods, including fencing and gating, as deemed necessary to protect the site and restrict access to the public.

2. The structural elements of a building or structure shall be taken down one story at a time, beginning from the top, unless a different method is approved by the Building Inspector. All structural parts of each story shall be lowered to the ground by means of approved equipment or devices except as hereinafter provided. No material shall be placed or allowed to fall in such a manner so as to overload any part of the structure which may be caused to fall because of such practice.

(10) Exception. After consideration of the factors in this section, the Building Inspector may grant an exception to subsections (9)(a), (9)(b) and (9)(c) of this section for any property for which the City will be taking title or for which a related redevelopment plan has been approved by the City. In the exercise of discretion in granting an exception, the Building Inspector shall consider the following factors:

(a) Type of contamination that may be on the property or the larger, integrated site associated with the building to be razed;

(b) Suspected level of contamination on the property based on best evidence available;

(c) Possible vectors of migrations from the property;

(d) Any known migration of contamination from the property;

(11) Exemption.

(a) Residential Remodeling. This section shall not be construed to apply to contractors or homeowners doing demolition work on part of a one- or two-family residential building which is necessary in the course of remodeling work being conducted under a building permit. The Building Inspector may exempt contractors or homeowners from the irrevocable letter of credit provisions using the same criteria used to establish whether a permit should be granted.

(b) Accessory Buildings and Detached Garages. This section shall not apply to demolition of accessory buildings or detached garages less than 500 square feet in area as measured by the exterior dimensions of the structure.

(12) Special Assessment. The Building Inspector shall recover all costs of enforcement and legal fees through special assessments to be levied and collected as a delinquent tax against the real estate upon which the building is located. Such special assessment shall be a lien upon the real estate. An administrative fee as set forth by resolution of the Common Council shall be added to the special assessment against the benefited property.

This section is effective for a building or structure having a total volume, as measured by the exterior dimensions of the building or structure, of 25,000 cubic feet or greater that had a principal industrial or commercial use as its most recent use allowed by the MMC, which principal industrial or commercial use has ceased.

(2) Permit. No person may salvage from a vacated building unless the work is performed under a demolition permit issued to the applicant by the Building Inspector.

In addition, the permittee shall agree to indemnify and hold the City harmless from any and all claims, demands, actions, judgments, liabilities and obligations of any nature whatsoever arising from the demolition activity or site restoration for which the permit is issued, including any attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the City as a result thereof.

Each renewal may be granted for up to 60 additional consecutive calendar days.

(a) The permit issued pursuant to this section shall be plainly displayed on the premises upon which the building is located.

(b) The building and premises shall, at all times, be maintained in as clean, neat and sanitary a condition as such premises will reasonably permit.

(c) No garbage, refuse or other waste liable to give off a foul odor or attract vermin shall be kept on the premises, except for domestic garbage which shall be kept in containers which are, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, rodent-proof and removed from the premises as often as is necessary to provide a sanitary environment.

(d) Work done under this permit is subject to inspection by the Building Inspector.

(e) Permittees shall have the responsibility to maintain proof of insurance policies as required in subsection (6) of this section, naming the City as an additional insured for all entities or natural persons doing work on a property or associated with the work under the permit.

(f) No scrap salvage or debris which is temporarily stored on the premises shall be allowed to rest or protrude over any public street, walkway or curb, or become scattered about or blown off the premises.

(g) No mechanized process whatsoever shall be utilized on premises to reduce salvageable material or debris in volume after such salvageable material has been detached from the real property, unless authorized by the Building Inspector. Such prohibited mechanized processes include, but are not limited to, crushers or shredders. In addition, there shall be no burning or brick cleaning on the site.

(i) No premises or building subject to a permit shall be allowed to become a public nuisance to adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare.

(j) There shall be full compliance with all City codes as well as State and Federal laws, rules or regulations which may be applicable. Compliance with Chapter 6 MMC, Fire Department and Fire Prevention, which adopts the entire NFPA, including NFPA 241, is of particular importance for demolition permits.

(p) Permittee must provide to the Building Inspector a current list of contractors doing work at a site that is subject to a permit issued pursuant to this section, including evidence of insurance as required in subsection (6) of this section. As used herein, the phrase “maintain current” means that the list filed with the Building Inspector is updated by the permittee prior to the contractor commencing work pursuant to the permit.

(9) Inspections. Permit holders and property owners shall permit authorized representatives of any department of the City having enforcement powers to inspect the premises proposed to be permitted, with or without advanced notice, as often as may be required to permit said departments to perform their duties and assure compliance with this section, without first obtaining a special inspection warrant. Inspections shall, to the fullest extent possible, be made during normal hours of business operation in the absence of emergency circumstances which require prompt action to protect the public health, safety and welfare, or to preserve evidence of noncompliance with this section. The unreasonable failure to permit inspections shall be grounds for permit denial, suspension or revocation.

(10) Summary Suspension. If, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, the public is subject to imminent danger due to a violation by the permittee of any one or combination of more than one of the requirements in subsection (8) of this section, the Building Inspector shall issue an order to the permittee requiring immediate cessation of those operations implicating the imminent danger. Pursuant to such order, the permittee shall cause such operations to cease as directed by the Building Inspector. Failure to maintain insurance as required, to maintain the letter of credit as required, or to permit inspection as required are each per se violations implicating imminent danger to the public necessitating an order to cease all operations.

In the event that an order to the permittee requiring immediate cessation is issued by the Building Inspector, such order shall be considered by the Public Safety Committee of the Common Council no later than at its next regular meeting. The Public Safety Committee, after hearing from the Building Inspector, the permittee, and the public, shall affirm the order, reverse the order, or modify the order. The decision of the Public Safety Committee may be appealed to the Common Council by either the Building Inspector or the permittee.

(11) Non-renewal or Revocation Disciplinary Hearings. Disciplinary hearings, including non-renewal, suspension and revocation hearings, shall be held before the Licensing, Permits, and Inspections Committee, which shall submit a report to the Common Council, including “findings of fact,” “conclusions of law” and a recommendation as to what action, if any, the Common Council should take with respect to the permit. The Licensing, Permits, and Inspections Committee shall provide the Building Inspector and the permittee with a copy of the report. Either the Building Inspector or permittee may make an objection, orally or in writing, to the report, and shall have the opportunity to present arguments supporting the objection to the Common Council. The Common Council shall determine whether the arguments shall be presented orally or in writing, or both. If the Common Council, after considering the Committee’s report and any arguments presented by the Building Inspector and permittee, finds the complaint to be true, or if there is no objection to a report recommending a suspension, revocation or non-renewal, the permit shall be suspended, revoked, or not renewed. If the Common Council finds the complaint untrue, the proceedings shall be dismissed without cost to the accused. The City Clerk shall give notice of each suspension, revocation or non-renewal to the party whose permit is affected.

(12) Transferability. Permits issued hereunder are personal to the applicant, and are not transferable to any other party. Permits issued hereunder are issued to a particular site and are not transferable to any other site.

(13) Enforcement. The Building Inspector shall have the primary responsibility to enforce this section.

(14) Severability. If any term, condition or provision of this section shall, to any extent, be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder hereof shall be valid in all other respects and continue to be effective.

(1) “Cross Connection” Defined. A cross connection shall be defined as any physical connection or arrangement, whether direct or indirect, between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the City of Manitowoc water system, and the other water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or chemicals whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of the flow depending on the pressure differential between the two systems. This definition shall include, but not be limited to:

(a) Any connection between the Manitowoc water system and any waste pipe, soil pipe, sewer, drain, or any unapproved source or system;

(b) Any connection between the Manitowoc sewer system and a potable water supply outlet, such as a hose or pipe, which is submerged or can be submerged in wastewater and/or any other source of contamination.

(2) Cross Connections Prohibited. No person, firm, or corporation shall establish any cross connection, or permit a cross connection to be established or maintained. No interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the City of Manitowoc may enter the supply or distribution system of said municipality, unless such private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the Manitowoc Public Utilities and by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in accordance with Wis. Admin. Code NR 810.15(2).

(3) Inspections. It shall be the cooperative duty of the Department of Building Inspection and the Manitowoc Public Utilities to cause inspection to be made of all properties served by the Manitowoc water system where cross connection with the public water system is deemed possible. The frequency of inspections and re-inspections based on potential health hazards involved shall be as established by the respective departments above, and as approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR). Generally, responsibility for inspections shall be as follows:

(a) All residential properties shall be inspected by the Manitowoc Public Utilities.

(b) All industrial, commercial, retail, multi-family and institutional buildings serviced by the utility shall be inspected on a two-year interval or as determined by the Department of Building Inspection and approved by the WDNR.

(a) Authority to Discontinue Service. The Manitowoc Public Utilities are hereby authorized and directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this section exists, and to take such other precautionary measures as may be deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Wis. Stat. Ch. 68, except that if it is determined that a cross connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate action, a written finding of that fact shall be filed with the City Clerk and delivered to the offender’s premises and service may be immediately discontinued. The offender shall then have an opportunity for hearing under Wis. Stat. Ch. 68 within 10 days of such emergency discontinuance. Water service to such property shall not be restored until the cross connection or cross connections have been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this section.

(b) Forfeiture. Violations of this section shall also be subject to the forfeitures provided for in MMC 17.110.

(b) Wherever a proposed playground, park, stormwater management or treatment facilities under Chapter 28 MMC, school site or other public land, other than streets or drainageways, designated in the Comprehensive Plan, a component part thereof, or on the existing Official Map of the City is embraced, all or in part, in a tract of land to be subdivided, these proposed public lands shall be so designed as to be made an integral part of the plat and/or CSM and may be dedicated but, in any case, shall be reserved for acquisition at the established market price at the time the plat is approved, by the agency having jurisdiction, for a period not to exceed two years unless extended by mutual agreement.

(f) Park Dedication Requirement. Prior to approval of the final plat, the subdivider shall dedicate land or provide a payment in lieu of dedication for the development of public park, recreational or open space areas, all as required in this subsection (4)(f).

1. Feasibility of Land Dedication. Following submission of a preliminary plat, the City Plan Commission, in conjunction with the City Engineer, shall determine whether a dedication of land owned by the subdivider in or adjacent to the proposed subdivision is compatible with City development plans. If such compatibility exists, the City Plan Commission shall then determine the location and acreage of land areas to be dedicated, subject to subsection (4)(f)(2) of this section. The City Plan Commission may require that a written agreement be executed with the subdivider prior to final plat approval to establish any details regarding the dedication.

2. Computation of Required Dedication. If the City Plan Commission and City Engineer determine under subsection (4)(f)(1) of this section that a dedication is compatible with City development plans, the subdivider shall dedicate to the City land for park purposes as a condition of final plat approval based on the following percentages of land in the proposed subdivision with the following zoning classifications at the time of final plat approval:

	Zoning Classification	% Allocation of Total Gross Residential Acreage

	R-1	5

	R-2, R-3	7

	R-4	9

	R-5, R-6, R-7	10

If the subdivider is obligated to dedicate more land than the City Plan Commission determines is needed under the above formula, the subdivider shall make a payment in lieu of dedication under subsection (4)(f)(3) of this section for the balance.

3. Payment in Lieu of Dedication. Where the Common Council determines such dedication is not feasible or incompatible with City plans, the subdivider shall in lieu thereof pay to the City a fee determined by taking an average equalized assessed value per acre of undeveloped property within the City, as determined by the City Assessor, multiplied by the total gross residential acreage in the proposed subdivision (including street right-of-way) which would otherwise be required under subsection (4)(f)(2) of this section. The City Plan Commission shall make a recommendation to the Common Council regarding a final decision to accept land or a payment in lieu thereof under this chapter.

4. Time of Payment. Any payment in lieu of dedication under this subsection shall be due in a lump sum prior to the time of final plat approval.

5. Use of Funds. Payments received hereunder shall be held in a nonlapsing, interest bearing account to be used exclusively for site acquisition of new park land or capital improvement of park and recreational lands.

6. Proportionate Payment in Lieu of Dedication. Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the development, the City Plan Commission may, but shall not be required to, allow such areas or portions thereof to be credited against the requirement of land dedication and/or in lieu of fees for park and recreation purposes, as set forth in this subsection; provided, that the following standards are met:

A. Yards, building separations, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building regulations shall not be included in the computations of such private open space;

B. Private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by recorded covenants, conditions and restrictions;

C. Use of private open space is restricted for permanent park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants, conditions and restrictions which run with the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City; and

D. The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location of the private open space land.

7. Exempt Lots. No dedication or payment shall be required for a lot, created by the subdivision of land under this chapter, on which a residential structure already exists, or which is a residual parcel in excess of 120 acres and not intended for immediate sale or other conveyance.

(5) Plats or Lot Divisions Outside the Corporate Limits. Before final approval by the City of any plat or CSM located outside the corporate limits of the City, but within the plat approval jurisdiction of the City, the subdivider shall give evidence that he/she has complied with all street and utility improvement requirements of the township in which the land being platted is located as well as evidence of compliance with the requirements of the subdivision regulations for Manitowoc County.

(6) Exceptions. When in the judgment of the Common Council it would be inappropriate to apply literally a provision of this chapter because the subdivision is located outside the corporate limits of the City or because extraordinary hardship would result, the Common Council may grant an exception to, waive or vary such provisions so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided, that in no event shall the requirements of filing and recording a CSM or the final plat be waived.

(7) Land Suitability. No land shall be subdivided for residential use which is held unsuitable for such use by the City Plan Commission for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or other features likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community. The City Plan Commission, in applying the provisions of this section, shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that land is not suitable for residential use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability if he/she so desires. Thereafter, the City Plan Commission may affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.

(8) Official Map. The subdivision layout shall conform to the Official Map of the City as contained in Chapter 22 MMC. However, where necessary and practical, an exception to the exact design as shown on the Official Map may be permitted if such exception does not detrimentally affect the public interest, the spirit and intent of this chapter, or the integrity of the Official Map.

(9) Public Access to Lots. The subdividing of land shall be such as to provide for each lot, and for each stormwater management or treatment facilities under Chapter 28 MMC, by means of either a public street or a permanent 25-foot-wide easement, satisfactory access to an existing public highway or to a street as shown on the Official Map.

(10) Retention of Natural Features. In all subdivisions, consideration shall be given to all natural features such as large trees, natural groves, water courses, scenic points, historic points, and similar community assets, which will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and preserve these natural assets for the good of the general public.

(11) Subdivision of Land Near Floodplains. In general, no land for residential use shall be subdivided where its elevation is lower than three feet above the highest water level recorded for the area.

(12) Planned Residential Developments. Planned residential developments containing proposals at variance with the requirements of this chapter may be established and shall be considered on the basis of area, density of development, compatibility with adjoining areas, and whether the plans include covenants, deed restrictions or other legal assurances to guarantee that the plan will be implemented and fully achieved.

(13) Division of Commercially Zoned Land. The division of commercially zoned land into residential type lots shall not be permitted. When small areas in the subdivision plat will be created for commercial use, they shall be of sufficient size to implement the operations of a local business zone, and the City Plan Commission may require the subdivider to justify the size and location.

(14) Lot Division Within the Corporate Limits or Extraterritorial Plat Jurisdiction. No person, firm, or corporation shall divide any land located within the corporate limits of the City or its extraterritorial plat approved jurisdiction for the purpose of creating an additional parcel without filing for approval by the City Plan Commission, a CSM meeting all the requirements of Wis. Stat. § 236.34, and which shall show all existing buildings located on the parcel(s) which are a part of the CSM. To the extent practicable, the division creating new lots or building sites shall comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to general requirements, design standards, improvement requirements, stormwater management or treatment facilities under Chapter 28 MMC, and drainage plan requirements.

(15) Violations. It shall be unlawful to build upon, divide, convey, record or monument any land in violation of this chapter or the Wisconsin Statutes, and no person, firm or corporation shall be issued a building permit authorizing the building on or improvement of any subdivision or replat within the jurisdiction of this chapter and not of record as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, until the provisions and requirements of this chapter have been fully met. The City may institute appropriate action or proceedings to enjoin violations of this chapter or the applicable Wisconsin Statutes.

(16) Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation that fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000 and the cost of prosecution for each violation, and, in default of payment of such forfeiture and costs, shall be imprisoned in the County Jail until payment thereof for a period not to exceed six months. Each day a violation exists or continues shall constitute a separate offense.

(a) Recordation improperly made has penalties provided in Wis. Stat. § 236.30.

(b) Conveyance of lots in unrecorded plats has penalties as provided for in Wis. Stat. § 236.31.

(c) Monuments disturbed or not placed have penalties as provided for in Wis. Stat. § 236.32.

(d) Assessor’s plat may be ordered by the City when a subdivision is created by successive divisions as provided in Wis. Stat. § 236.31(2).

This statement shall enumerate those regular and/or special site improvements and conditions of compliance which must be installed and satisfied prior to approval of the final plat by the Common Council and subsequent recording of the final plat at the Manitowoc County Register of Deeds. The preliminary plat along with the recommendations of the City Plan Commission may be considered by the Common Council at its next regular scheduled meeting. The Common Council shall, by resolution, indicate its approval, conditional approval, or rejection of the preliminary plat including any conditions upon which the approval is based, and shall specify what improvements and conditions of compliance will be required before acceptance of the final plat. A certified copy of this resolution shall be sent by the City Clerk to the person(s) submitting the plat.

(f) Submittal of Final Plat to City Plan Commission. Within 36 consecutive calendar months after the date of approval of the preliminary plat by the Common Council, a final plat of the proposed subdivision, prepared in accordance with these regulations and Wis. Stat. Ch. 236, shall be submitted to the City Clerk and City Plan Commission. The submission of this final plat shall include 10 photostatic copies of the final plat and a letter of transmittal requesting approval and outlining all necessary points in relation to the final plat. Within 60 consecutive calendar days after the date of transmittal of the final plat to the City Clerk and City Plan Commission, it shall be either approved or rejected by the Common Council according to the provisions of Wis. Stat. Ch. 236. Approval of a final plat shall require the review and conclusions pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 236.11(1)(c) regarding conformity of the final plat to the preliminary plat.

(g) City Plan Commission Report on Final Plat to Common Council. After review of the final plat by the City Plan Commission, the Commission shall forward a recommendation to the Common Council to approve, conditionally approve or reject the final plat along with a statement of the conditions of compliance upon which said recommendation was based. The recommendations to the Common Council shall include the necessary minimum improvements and special requirements needed to be carried out to fulfill the letter and spirit of this chapter.

(h) Filing Requirements of Approved Final Plat. After the final plat of the subdivision has met with all approvals, and is in a status acceptable at the Manitowoc County Register of Deeds, the subdivider shall cause to be filed with the City Plan Commission and with the City Engineer mylar tracings of the subdivision map and the surveying data pertaining thereto. The final plat must be recorded pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 236.25(2)(b).

(i) Notice to Municipalities Within 1,000 Feet. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 236.11(2), the City Clerk’s office shall (at least 10 consecutive calendar days prior to the earliest anticipated date the Common Council may take action on a final plat) issue a notice to the clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any portion of the proposed final plat advising that party of the City’s intention. Failure to give such notice shall not invalidate any such plat.

(j) Final Plat Review Fee. Whenever a final plat of a proposed subdivision is submitted to the City Clerk and City Plan Commission for approval, a review fee as determined by resolution of the Common Council shall accompany the submittal of final plat to the City Clerk. Such sum shall not be refunded whether or not the final plat is approved.

(2) Procedure for Approval of Plats or Development Plans Within the Extraterritorial Plat Approval Jurisdiction of the City. When the land to be subdivided lies within three miles of the corporate limits of the City, the subdivider shall proceed as specified in the Manitowoc County subdivision regulations. All improvement requirements, specified by the County or township Board, or any special district in matters over which they have jurisdiction, shall be met before the filing and recording of the final plat.

(a) Subdivision Plats. Any final subdivision plat as defined in the Wisconsin Statutes shall be submitted to the City Plan Commission in triplicate for its approval as provided for in Wis. Stat. § 236.10.

(b) Development Plans. Any development plans, as required by the County subdivision regulations, shall be submitted to the City Plan Commission in triplicate for its approval.

(3) Procedures for Approval of Lot Divisions Not Involving Subdivision or Development Plans. Any division of land 10 acres or less in area which creates an additional parcel or building site within the corporate limits of the City or its extraterritorial jurisdiction must be accomplished by a CSM prepared in accordance with the provisions of Wis. Stat. § 236.34, and must be submitted to and approved by the City Plan Commission after review of the CSM’s conformance to the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map, and other applicable State and local ordinances and regulations. Prior to filing a CSM, the subdivider may consult with the City Planner and/or the City Engineer for advice and assistance. These consultations are intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, the Comprehensive Plan and Official Map, and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning his/her development.

(4) CSM Review Fee. Whenever a CSM is submitted to the City Plan Commission for approval, a filing fee as determined by resolution of the Common Council shall accompany the CSM. Such sum shall not be refunded whether or not the CSM is approved.

21.050 Design Standards.

In the subdividing of a lot, parcel or tract of land for the purpose of sale or of building development, the owner or his/her authorized agent shall observe the following design standards:

(1) Street Layout.

(a) As far as practicable, all proposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect.

(b) All proposed streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless such extension is not necessary or desirable for coordination with the surrounding street pattern. Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs of reasonable length will be approved where necessitated by topography, or where they are appropriate for the type of development contemplated.

(c) Streets shall intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles, taking into consideration topography, ownership lines, or other natural barriers.

(d) Alleys may be provided in commercial or industrial districts where good design requires them to properly service local and through traffic requirements, but shall not be provided in residential districts unless required by unusual topography or other exceptional conditions, such as the need to provide limited access onto arterial streets.

(e) Whenever part of a dedicated, platted or recorded street, alley or other public way exists immediately adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the balance of such street, alley or other public way shall be dedicated by the subdivider.

(f) Minor streets shall be designed so as to discourage their use for through traffic.

(g) Street jogs with centerline off-sets of less than 125 feet shall not be approved.

(h) Vehicular access to arterial streets or parkways shall be held to a minimum, if possible only at street intersections. Vehicular access to lots adjoining or adjacent to arterial streets or a parkway shall be minimized by proper subdivision design.

(i) Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, provision shall be made on each side of such right-of-way for streets approximately parallel to and at a distance suitable for appropriate use of the land between such streets and the railroad right-of-way, but not less than 150 feet.

(2) Block Design.

(a) The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be such as are appropriate for the locality and type of development contemplated and conform to the Official Map, but shall not exceed 1,320 feet in length, unless waived by the Common Council nor shall they be less than 400 feet in length.

(b) Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots except in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways.

(c) In blocks over 900 feet in length, a crosswalk or pedestrian way, not less than 20 feet wide, may be required near the center and entirely across such block where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, other community facilities, or pedestrian traffic. Where pedestrian ways are deemed necessary by the Common Council the subdivider shall fully improve the pedestrian way at his/her own cost prior to approval of the final plat by the Common Council.

(d) The number of intersecting streets along arterial streets shall be held to a minimum, and wherever practicable said intersecting streets shall be at least 660 feet apart. When a subdivision abuts a State Trunk Highway (STH), the intersecting streets shall be in general at least 1,000 feet apart. Whenever existing streets can provide adequate access to a STH, then no new streets shall open onto the highway. Temporary street connections to arterial streets or STH shall be permitted when the subdivision is only part of the overall neighborhood development as shown on the Official Map.

(3) Street Standards.

(a) All street rights-of-way, as measured from lot line to lot line, shall be of the width as specified and shown on the Official Map of the City, or, if not specified, they shall not be less than the width as specified for the following types of streets:

	Street Type	Minimum Width in Feet

	Principal Arterial	100

	Minor Arterial	90

	Collector Street	80

	Minor Street	60, except that all future streets, not reserved, dedicated or identified on the City’s Official Map or identified on a fully executed CSM on or before November 16, 1998, shall be at a minimum right-of-way width of 66 feet.

(b) Minor streets, and cul-de-sac streets not over 650 feet in length, may be a minimum of 60 feet in width.

(c) Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 650 feet in length unless authorized by the City’s Fire Department, and shall provide a turn-around with a minimum right-of-way radius of 60 feet with a reverse curve having a minimum 90-foot radius connecting the right-of-way tangent.

(d) All alleys and pedestrian ways shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width.

(e) The minimum street widths as stated herein may be varied where topography or other special conditions require the same, but in no event will half streets or a portion of a street be permitted.

(f) Alley shall not be dead-ended, but may be developed as either “I,” or “L” or “T,” with each end terminating in a public way.

(g) Clear visibility or minimum sight distances, measured along the centerline of a public right-of-way, shall not be less than specified as follows:

	Street Type	Minimum Sight Distance in Feet

	Arterial Street	600

	Collector Street	200

	Minor Street	200

(h) When streets deflect more than five degrees from a straight line or where determined by the City Plan Commission, a horizontal curve shall be used to connect the tangents. The minimum centerline radii for such horizontal curves shall be as specified below. Exceptions from this requirement may be permitted by the City Engineer when topography or other considerations make observance of these standards impractical.

	Street Type	Minimum Radius in Feet

	Principal and Minor Arterials	400

	Collector Street	300

	Minor Street	100

(i) A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be provided between reversed curves.

(j) Street grades shall conform to the following maximum specifications:

	Street Type	Maximum Grade

	Arterial Streets	5 percent

	Collector Streets	6 percent

	Minor Streets	7 percent

	Streets less than 500 feet in length	10 percent

(k) The minimum grade to be used in all cases shall not be less than one-half percent, except on curves with a radius of less than 100 feet shall be no less than one percent.

(l) Pedestrian ways or crosswalks shall have a maximum grade of 12 percent, unless steps of an acceptable design are to be constructed.

(m) All street grades shall be determined by the developer’s engineer and approved by the City Engineer.

(n) No street shall intersect any other street at an angle less than 68 degrees.

(o) At street and alley intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by an arc, the minimum radius of which shall be 15 and 10 feet, respectively. Chords shall be substituted for such arcs. The above minimum radii shall be increased when the smallest angle of the intersection is less than 68 degrees.

(p) Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least 20 feet except that minimum radii may be larger on collector and arterial streets.

(q) The City Plan Commission shall approve the naming of all new streets.

(4) Lot Design.

(a) The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the proposed subdivision, and for the type of development contemplated; provided, however, that lots shall meet the minimum requirements specified in the district regulations of the zoning district underlying the proposed subdivision, or as required pursuant to the provisions of Wis. Stat. § 236.12(2)(a), where public sewers are not available.

(b) Every lot shall front or abut on a public right-of-way other than an alley or a pedestrian way.

(c) Double frontage lots shall be avoided.

(d) Reversed frontage lots at street intersections shall be avoided.

(e) Corner lots shall be platted 10 percent wider and 10 percent greater in area than required for minimum width interior lots in order to provide proper setbacks on both streets.

(f) In all quadrangular lots and so far as possible all other lots, the side lot line shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.

(g) In tracts subdivided into parcels containing one or more acres, parcels shall be so arranged as to allow the resubdivision of any such parcels into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of these subdivision regulations.

(h) Where not controlled by zoning regulations, minimum building lines appropriate for the location and type of development contemplated shall be established all in accordance with applicable Manitowoc County regulations.

(i) Lots shall not be platted so as to cross over municipal boundaries unless the areas involved will be annexed into the City.

(j) Double lotting will be approved, if it is part of a comprehensively designed subdivision in accordance with these subdivision regulations, and if they are incorporated with a frontage access to a public street having a minimum width of 25 feet.

(k) When a subdivision is not served with a public sewer, then all the provisions of Wis. Stat. § 236.12(2)(a) governing lot size and lot elevation shall be applicable.

(5) Easements and Restrictions.

(a) Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for the extension of any existing or planned utilities. These easements shall be at least six feet wide on each side of the lot line and/or a total minimum width of 12 feet. Where situations warrant a larger or smaller easement width, such shall be provided as requested by the utility involved.

(b) Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be uninhabitable or inappropriate shall not be platted for residential use, unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the Director of Building Inspection and the City Plan Commission.

(c) Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainageway, channel, or stream having constant or intermittent flow there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such water course, and such further width for construction and maintenance as will be adequate in the opinion of the City Engineer.

(d) All easements identified on subdivisions and CSMs are subject to “Standard Utility Easement Conditions” as recorded at the Manitowoc County Register of Deeds in Volume 1252, Page 498 of Records, as document number 798738, as may be amended from time to time, and shall be referenced on the approved plat or CSM.

(6) Underground Facilities.

(a) All new electric distribution lines (excluding lines of 12,000 volts or more), all new telephone lines from which lots are individually served, community antenna television cables and services installed within a newly platted area, manufactured home park or planned development shall be underground unless the City Plan Commission shall specifically find after study that:

1. The placing of such facilities underground would not be compatible with the planned development.

2. Location, topography, soil, stands of trees or other physical conditions would make underground installation unreasonable or impracticable.

3. The lots to be served by such facilities can be served directly from existing overhead facilities.

(b) Associated equipment and facilities which are appurtenant to underground electric and communications systems, such as, but not limited to, substations, pad-mounted transformers, pad-mounted sectionalizing switches and above-grade pedestal-mounted terminal boxes, may be located above ground.

(c) Adequate easements as required in subsection (5)(a) of this section shall be provided and dedicated on each side of all rear lot lines and on side lot lines, across lots or along front lot lines where necessary for the installation of electric and communications facilities. Such easements shall be noted as “utility easements” on the final plat or CSM. Prior to approval of the final plat or the CSM, concurrence of the electric and communications companies serving the area as to the location and width of the utility easements shall be noted on the final plat or CSM.

1. Where the electric and communications facilities are to be installed underground the utility easements shall be graded to within six inches of final grade by the subdivider prior to the installation of such facilities and earth fill, piles or mounds or dirt shall not be stored on such easement areas.

2. Where the electric and/or communication facilities are to be installed underground, a note shall be placed on the final plat or CSM stating that the final grade established by the subdivider on the utility easements shall not be altered by more than six inches by the subdivider, his/her agent or by other subsequent owner of the lots on which such utility easements are located, except with written consent of the Manitowoc Public Utilities or other utilities involved.

In the event a new lift station is deemed necessary by the City for the subdivision or a larger area including the subdivision, the City Engineer shall require the subdivider to pay for part or all of the cost of such lift station in proportion to the benefits to be derived therefrom by the proposed subdivision. In the event the particular subdivision shall derive a benefit from a lift station which was previously constructed, the City Engineer shall require the subdivider to pay a share of the original cost proportionate to the benefits to be derived therefrom by the proposed subdivision.

In instances where the subdivider requests the City to install any or all development improvements under this subsection (2)(d), and the City approves the subdivider’s request, the subdivider shall pay to the City Treasurer the fee or assessment amount required to implement the improvements.

This chapter shall apply to the City of Manitowoc wastewater facilities as hereinafter defined in MMC 25.030 and all appurtenances thereof.

This chapter shall also apply to all storm and sanitary sewers, building drains, building sewers, and private interceptor sewers existing or to be constructed in the City of Manitowoc.

[Prior code § 25.01]


25.020 Purpose.

(1) Sewer Use. It is the purpose of MMC 25.040 to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, to prevent misuse, abuse, or breakdown of the wastewater facilities, to obtain the maximum practical reduction of wastewater entering the wastewater facilities, to protect the receiving waters from pollution, and to regulate the construction and use of all sewers and drains connected to the sewer systems and wastewater facilities of the City of Manitowoc.

(2) Sewer Service Charge. Whereas, in order to adequately provide for the collection, treatment, purification and disposal in a sanitary manner of wastewaters in the City of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, said City has heretofore constructed wastewater facilities including necessary sewers and pumping stations and wastewater treatment facility; and

Whereas, in order to pay part of the cost of said municipal wastewater facilities the City has heretofore issued general obligation bonds; and

Whereas, it is necessary that additional wastewater facilities be constructed, including the upgrading of the existing plant, and that additional general obligation bonds were issued by the City of Manitowoc to pay part of the cost of said additional works; and

Whereas, it is necessary that the rates and charges for the use of the services provided by the municipal wastewater facilities of said City be revised, established and increased to pay the cost of operating and maintaining the wastewater facilities;

Therefore, it is the purpose of MMC 25.050 to recover from users of the wastewater facilities, on an equitable basis, the share of the wastewater facilities costs attributable to such users.

[Prior code § 25.04]


25.050 Sewer Service Charge.

(1) General.

(a) Sewer Service Charge Recipient. The sewer service charges provided for in this section are hereby levied and assessed upon each lodge, dwelling unit, parcel of land, building or premises having any connection with, or discharging either directly or indirectly into, the sewer system.

(b) Annually Determined Charges. The City shall annually audit the system to determine and fix the unit costs for use of the wastewater facilities on the basis of a flat rate and flow charge and determine surcharge unit costs for BOD, SS, and P and any other pollutant, taking into consideration the cost of treatment, and may increase or decrease such unit cost as often and in such amounts as may reasonably be required to accomplish the purpose of this section.

(c) Billing. The City shall compute the amount due the City and issue a statement for sewer service charges at periodic intervals to the users of the wastewater facilities. All amounts due hereunder shall be payable at the office of the City Treasurer or an approved collection station.

(2) Delinquency.

(a) Additional Charges. If sewer service charges are not paid in full within 20 calendar days after each billing date, an additional sum of one percent on the unpaid balance shall be added to the bill, and the total shall be the amount of the delinquent account.

(b) Payment Period. Payment made or mailed and postmarked on or before the last day of such 20-calendar-day period shall constitute payment within such period. If the end of such 20-calendar-day period shall fall on a legal holiday or a Sunday, payment made on or mailed and postmarked on the next succeeding weekday which is not a legal holiday shall constitute payment within such period.

(c) Failure to Receive Bills. A nonresident owner of each lot or parcel of real estate with a building located thereon, in the City of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and which is subject to a sewer service charge, shall notify the Manitowoc Public Utilities of the City of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, of his present address. Failure of any person to receive bills for sewer service charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor shall such failure result in an extension of the period of time during which the net bill should have been paid.

(3) Funds from Sewer Service Charges. The funds received from the collection of the charges authorized by this chapter shall be deposited as collected. The user charge portion shall be used for operation, maintenance and replacement costs and the debt service portion shall be used for debt service including all reserves and other funds required to be established and maintained under authorized bonds and improvements of the Wastewater Facilities, except that the portion of any such funds which is limited to a particular use by applicable State or Federal rules or regulations shall be used in compliance with such restrictions.

(4) Unit Cost Categories. The cost to be recovered pursuant to this chapter and the cost to be fixed by the City in subsection (1)(b) of this section shall be determined and allocated in the following category:

Category “A” (User Charge System).

Operation, maintenance and replacement of existing and proposed wastewater facilities.

(5) Determination of Flat Rate Charge. A flat rate charge will be assessed to each user for each connection to a private interceptor main sewer or wastewater facilities.

The flat rate charge for users of the wastewater facilities shall be determined by dividing the Category “A” costs by the total number of connections to the system. The formula for this charge calculation is as follows:

	Estimated Total Fixed Costs	= 	Flat Rate Charge per Connection

	Total Number of Connections

The portion allocated to the fixed cost category for Category “A” shall include, but not be limited to, the following components:

(a) That portion of salaries and fringe benefits which is administrative costs.

(b) Twenty percent of electrical costs.

(c) Twenty-five percent of capital outlay and capital improvements.

(d) One hundred percent of laboratory, insurance, contract services, and administrative expenses.

(e) Twenty-five percent of supplies.

(f) Thirty-five percent of natural gas.

(6) Determination of Surcharges. A surcharge will be assessed to any user discharging BOD, SS and phosphorus (P) loadings to the wastewater facilities in excess of those concentrations defined in MMC 25.030 under “general municipal flow,” and shall be determined as follows:

(a) For Category “A.” Unit costs for BOD, SS and P shall be calculated by apportioning the Category “A” costs associated with the treatment of BOD, SS and P that year and then dividing each apportioned cost by the total estimated BOD, SS and P to be received at the wastewater treatment plant in that year.

The formula for this unit cost calculation is:

	BOD:	Annual Category “A” Costs Associated w/BOD Removal	=	$6.34/100 lb. BOD

	 	Estimated Annual BOD in 100 lbs.

	SS:	Annual Category “A” Costs Associated w/SS Removal	=	$7.47/100 lb. SS

	 	Estimated Annual SS in 100 lbs.

	P:	Annual Category “A” Costs Associated w/P Removal	=	$181.00/100 lb. P

	 	Estimated Annual P in 100 lbs.

(7) Determination of Flow Charges.

(a) Determination of Billable Flow and Unit Flow Charges. The unit flow cost for each category, for users of the wastewater facilities, shall be determined by subtracting from the total annual category costs the estimated revenue from the flat rate charge and the surcharges for that year for each respective category, and then dividing the remainder of the costs to be recovered by the “billable flow.”

Billable flow will be determined annually by the sum of the following:

1. Measured industrial flow discharged to the sewer system;

2. Residential flow discharged to the sewer system as determined by the monthly average metered water for the months of January, February, March, November and December multiplied by 12;

3. Flow discharged to the sewer system as determined by metered water, minus metered water to measured industries and residential users; and

4. Flow discharged to the sewer system as determined by meters or estimated well water supplies minus well water from measured industries.

The formula for the unit cost calculation for each category is as follows:

(Total Annual Category Costs) minus (Estimated Annual Revenue from Flat Rate Charge) minus (Estimated Annual Revenue from Surcharges) divided by (Estimated Billable Flow, as defined above, in 1,000 gallons) equals the cost per 1,000 gallons.

	(Category Costs) - (Flat Rate Charges) - (Surcharge Revenue)

	(Billable Flow, in 1,000 gal.)

Estimated Billable Flow (as defined above) in 1,000 gal.

(b) Determination of Flow Charge. The flow charges to users of the wastewater facilities shall be the product of the unit cost determined in accordance with subsection (7)(a) of this section and that portion of the billable flow attributed to each domestic, commercial, institutional, governmental and industrial user. The formula for this calculation is as follows:

(Unit Flow Cost per 1,000 gallons) x (User’s Billable Flow in 1,000 gallons) = User Flow Charge

(c) Sprinkling Forgiveness. In order that domestic and residential users of the wastewater facilities shall not be penalized for the sprinkling of lawns, the billing for the use of the wastewater facilities for residential and/or domestic users for the months of April through October, inclusive, shall be based on the average water usage for the previous winter months of November, December, January, February and March. In the event the water usage for said months is less than this winter average, then the billing for the use of the wastewater facilities shall be computed on the actual water used in the month for which the wastewater facility service bill is being rendered. Domestic and/or residential wastewater facility service, as applicable to the sprinkling rate, shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate or building which is occupied and used as a residence. The sprinkling forgiveness is only available where water meter readings are always obtainable. Obtainable is considered to be having an outside water register or an inside meter always accessible during normal reading times.

Where there is no previous history or an incomplete history of water consumption, the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board may establish an individual’s flow for sprinkling forgiveness billing purposes based upon residential average consumption or another approved method.

Said sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly used for industrial or commercial purposes. In the event a portion of such premises shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the water service so that the residential portion of the premises is served through a Manitowoc Public Utilities approved separate meter, and in such case, the water usage as registered by the water serving such portion of the premises used for residential purposes would qualify under the sprinkling rate.

(8) Establishment of Sewer Service Charges.

(a) City Sewer Service Charge. The sewer service charge for City sanitary sewer users shall be as follows:

1. Flat Rate Charge. There shall be a flat rate charge for each connection to the wastewater treatment facilities. This charge shall consist of the following:

	6.	Flow Rate Charge	=	$8.46/1,000 gallons ($6.33/100 cubic feet)

(9) Measurements of Strength and Volume.

(a) Volume. Flow for billing purposes for each user will be determined as follows:

1. By means of a special wastewater measuring device installed in a sewer or other conduit carrying the wastewater flow; or

2. On the basis of the amount of water used, determined as described heretofore in subsection (9)(a)(1) of this section but adjusted for product losses or adjusted for waters which are legitimately discharged to storm sewers. Such adjustments will be made only upon application by the user, and only when the application is properly supported by documentation which will positively establish the amount of such product use or discharges to storm sewers. Application for such adjustments shall be made to the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board of the City of Manitowoc; or

3. On the basis of the amount of water used, determined as described in subsection (9)(a)(1) of this section, but, in the case of residential users only, adjusted to reflect winter water consumption only.

All private water supplies contributing to discharge to the sanitary sewer system shall be equipped with a meter approved by the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board, by and at the expense of the user. The total amount of water used from such private supplies shall be reported to the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board each month. The user shall provide for and permit access to such meter by a representative of the wastewater treatment facility. Such meters on private water supplies will not be required where measurement is provided for the flow discharged to the sewer system.

(b) Strength. All industrial users who discharge other than domestic wastes, or wastes from sanitary conveniences, or any other user required by the City, shall furnish the City with information monthly concerning the concentration of BOD and suspended solids discharged to the wastewater facilities. Sampling shall be carried out by accepted methods as listed in 40 CFR Part 136 to reflect the effect of constituents upon the wastewater facilities and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.

1. Surcharge. Such information shall be used to determine monthly surcharges, if any, as required under subsection (8)(a) of this section.

2. Sampling. Such information shall be obtained from the analysis of no less than one composite sample covering the operating period of the facility. The composite sampling shall be as described in 40 CFR Part 136. If the discharge is made through more than one connection to the wastewater facilities, such sampling program shall include all discharges.

3. Monitoring Facilities. Any industry required to pay a surcharge under this section, or any other user required by the City, shall install a suitable monitoring structure, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes to provide daily wastewater characteristics information. Such structure and equipment shall be constructed at the owner’s expense in accordance with the plans approved by the City and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.

4. Waiver of Monitoring Facilities. The City may waive the requirement for installation of monitoring facilities described in subsection (9)(b)(3) of this section if, upon application by the industry, it can be demonstrated that results equitable to both the City and industry can be obtained through the use of manually collected composite samples. If no special structure is required, the monitoring structure shall be considered to be the manhole required for periodic sampling in accordance with Wis. Admin. Code H 62.04(i).

5. Waiver of Daily Sampling. The City may waive the requirement for daily wastewater characteristic information for industries paying a surcharge if, upon application by the industry, it can be demonstrated that results equitable to both the City and the industry can be obtained through other than a daily sampling program.

(c) Methods and Analysis. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136, and shall be determined at the monitoring structure provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said monitoring structure.

(d) Inspection and Discrepancies of Flow or Strength. The City shall have the right to periodically or continuously inspect the monitoring facilities, to measure, sample and analyze the user’s flow and to analyze the samples obtained by the user, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Upon the City’s request, samples will be split, with one-half of the sample being submitted to the City. In the event of any discrepancy between the flows or loads determined by the City and the user, the values determined by the City shall be used for billing and enforcement purposes.

25.060 Control of Industrial Wastes Directed to Public Sewers.

(1) Purpose and Policy. This section sets forth uniform requirements for dischargers into the POTW City wastewater collection and treatment systems and enables the City to protect public health in conformity with all applicable local, State and Federal laws relating thereto.

The objectives of this section are:

(a) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;

(b) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and which will pass through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system; and

(c) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the system.

This section provides for the regulation of discharges into the Manitowoc wastewater system through the issuance of permits. This section does not provide for the recovery of operations, maintenance, or replacement costs of the POTW or the costs associated with the construction of collection and treatment systems used by industrial dischargers, in proportion to their use of the POTW, which are the subject of separate enactments.

(2) General Discharge Prohibitions. In addition to the prohibitions and limitations in MMC 25.040(1)(g) and (h), the following substances shall not be introduced into the wastewater disposal system or otherwise to the facilities of the City:

(a) Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.

(b) Pollutants which will cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW, but in no case discharges with pH lower than 5.0 unless the works are specifically designed to accommodate such discharges.

(c) Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference.

(d) Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the POTW.

(e) Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the wastewater treatment facility exceeds 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) unless the approval authority, upon request of the POTW, approves alternate temperature limits.

(f) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.

(g) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems.

(h) Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW.

(i) Any wastewater containing an average phosphorus concentration of greater than 20 mg/l shall not contain a phosphorus mass loading of greater than 40 pounds for a 24-hour period or for the period of discharge, if such a period of discharge is less than 24 hours.

(j) Any wastewater containing floatable oils, fats or grease.

(k) Any wastewater containing an average molybdenum concentration of greater than 0.17 mg/l, unless the industry discharge permit allows for a different concentration level. Measurements shall be taken over a 24-hour period or over the period of discharge, if such a discharge is less than 24 hours.

(3) Limitations on Wastewater Strength.

(a) National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act and as hereby adopted by reference, including future amendments thereto, shall be met by all dischargers of the regulated industrial categories. An application for modification of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be considered for submittal to the Regional Administrator by the City, when the City’s wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of the pollutants as defined by 40 CFR 403.7.

Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with the most stringent of this chapter, Federal pretreatment standards, as established by 40 CFR Chapter N, Subpart I, State standards and permit conditions, and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the Federal pretreatment regulations, and with any other pretreatment standards by applicable deadlines.

Any facilities required to pretreatment wastewater shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the POTW for review, and shall be approved by the POTW before construction of the facility. The review and approval of plans and operating procedures does not relieve the industrial user from complying with the provisions of this chapter and permit conditions. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and approved by the POTW prior to the industrial user’s initiation of the changes.

1. Deadline for Compliance with Categorical Standards. Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is otherwise specified. Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users.

New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall “start-up” all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.

2. Equivalent Limits. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limits expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration.

The Superintendent shall calculate equivalent mass-per-day limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial user’s average rate of production. This average rate of productions shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user’s actual long-term daily production, such as the average daily production during a representative year. New sources shall use projected production in place of actual production.

The Superintendent shall calculate equivalent concentration limits by dividing the mass limitations derived under the above paragraph by the average daily flow rate of the industrial user’s regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user’s actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year.

The same production of flow figure shall be used in calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations.

Any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits shall notify the POTW within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change.

(b) Specific Pollutant Limitations. The following pollutant limitations shall apply to specific users in the following cases:

1. Users that discharge or potentially discharge one or more of the following pollutants but which do not belong to one of the categories of industries for which categorical standards are or will be finalized.

2. If one or more of the following limits are more stringent than the limits in a categorical standard that has been finalized, the users in that category shall comply with the following limitations when the following limitations are more stringent. If a user has an exemption in the user’s applicable categorical standards, then the specific pollutant limitations may be waived for that user at the discretion of the Superintendent.

The users that are or will be regulated by the following limitations shall have three years to comply with the following limitations from the time that the users are notified by the City that they must comply with the following limitations.

No person shall discharge into the sewer system from any point wastewater containing any of the following pollutants in excess of the following 24-hour average concentrations, or in excess of the following average concentrations during any period of discharge, if such period of discharge is less than 24 hours:

	POLLUTANT	CONCENTRATION (mg/l)

	Cadmium (T)	    .54

	Chromium (T)	    7.0

	Cyanide (T)	    1.9

	Copper (T)	    4.5

	Lead (T)	    .6

	Mercury (T)	    .02

	Nickel (T)	    4.1

	Silver (T)	    .43

	Zinc (T)	    4.2

(c) Point of Application of Pollutant Limitations and Categorical Standards. The categorical standards and/or pollutant limitations shall apply at the user’s point of discharge to the POTW unless otherwise specified by the Federal rules and regulations, categorical standards, or the Superintendent.

(d) Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in MMC 25.020 and subsection (1) of this section. Before changing the specific pollutant limitations in subsection (3)(b) of this section, the City shall hold a public hearing and show a need to change the specific pollutant limitations.

(e) Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

(f) Bypass. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of the following paragraphs.

If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible.

An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Superintendent of the wastewater treatment facility within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.

Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:

1. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

2. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and

3. The industrial user submitted notices as required above.

The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsections (3)(f)(1), (2), and (3) of this section.

(4) Accidental Discharges. In addition to the provisions listed in MMC 25.040(1)(o), each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter. Where necessary, facilities or procedures to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger’s cost and expense.

(a) Industrial users shall provide protection from accidental discharge of materials which may interfere with the POTW by developing spill prevention plans. Facilities necessary to implement these plans shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s or industrial user’s expense. Spill prevention plans, including the facilities and the operating procedures, shall be approved by the POTW before construction of the facility.

(b) Industrial users that store hazardous substances shall not contribute to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter unless a spill prevention plan has been approved by the POTW. Approval of such plans shall not relieve the industrial user from complying with all other laws and regulations governing the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances.

(c) The POTW shall evaluate each significant industrial user at least once every two years, and other industrial users as necessary, to determine whether such user needs a plan to control slug discharges. If the POTW decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:

1. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;

2. Description of stored chemicals;

3. Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under subsection (2) of this section, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days;

4. If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response;

5. SIU is required to notify POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

Users shall notify the Superintendent immediately upon the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date, and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any user who discharges a slug of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the City on account thereof under State or Federal law.

Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user’s premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause, discover, or be injured by such a discharge with respect to the emergency notification procedure.

(e) Limitations on Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific discharger for a specific operation and are not assignable to another discharger or transferable to a different premises or operation without prior written approval of the Superintendent.

(f) Reporting Requirements for Permittee.

1. Baseline Monitoring Report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a National Pretreatment Standard, or 180 days after a final administrative decision has been made upon a categorical determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial dischargers subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to the POTW shall be required to submit to the City a complete baseline monitoring report.

At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new source industrial dischargers, and sources that become industrial dischargers subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the City a baseline monitoring report. A new source industrial discharger shall also include in this report information on the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards and estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged.

The industrial discharger shall submit the following information:

The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owners.

A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility.

A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such discharger. This description shall include a schematic process diagram indicating points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:

Regulated process streams, and

Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(3).

The industrial discharger shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process, and shall:

Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentrations shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations.

A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The Superintendent may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial discharger that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sample techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the discharger demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.

The discharger shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.

Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the discharger should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula.

The industrial discharger shall provide a statement, signed and reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial discharger and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance measures (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial discharger to meet the pretreatment standard. Any such compliance schedule shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (6)(a)(9) of this section.

2. Compliance Date Report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the POTW a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by such standards and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. Where equivalent mass or concentration limits are established by the POTW for a user, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production rate. Where a user is subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, the report shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified by a qualified professional.

3. Periodic Compliance Reports.

A. Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in this section, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the POTW, shall submit to the Superintendent during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the City, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period reported in subsection (6)(f)(1) of this section. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided, however, where feasibility considerations justify, the Superintendent may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The Superintendent for good cause when considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors may authorize the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above. These reports shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user, and certified by a qualified professional.

B. Reports of permittees shall contain all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where required by the Superintendent. The frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in Wis. Admin. Code NR 211. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. The sampling program shall be conducted such that a representative sample is obtained.

(Comment: Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, “Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants,” April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of the U.S. EPA.)

The reports required in subsection (6)(f) of this section shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The POTW shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

If an industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

4. Reports from Noncategorical Industrial Users. The POTW shall require appropriate reporting from those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the Superintendent at least once every six months (e.g., June and December) a report indicating the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the City. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the sampling and analytical techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the Administrator. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the POTW in lieu of the significant noncategorical user. Where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, the noncategorical significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report.

5. Notification of Changed Discharge. All industrial users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification.

6. Hazardous Waste Notification. Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences.

Dischargers are exempt from the hazardous waste notification requirement during a calendar month in which they discharge 15 kilograms or less of nonacute hazardous wastes.

Discharge of any quantity of acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification.

7. Notice of Violation. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the Wastewater Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Wastewater Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the City performs sampling at the industrial user’s at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user’s initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.

8. Signatory Requirements. All wastewater discharge permit applications and industrial user reports must contain the following certification statement and be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user:

I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

An authorized representative is:

A. If the user is a corporation:

1. The president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation; or

2. The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operation facilities, provided the manager is authorized to make management decisions that govern the operation of the regulated facility, including having the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations, and initiate and direct other comprehensive measures to assure long-term environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; can ensure that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather complete and accurate information for individual wastewater permit requirements, and where authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures.

B. If the user is a partnership or sole proprietorship: a general partner or proprietor, respectively.

C. If the user is a federal, state or local governmental facility: a director or highest official appointed or designated to oversee the operation and performance of the activities of the government facility, or their designee.

D. The individuals described in subsections (6)(f)(8)(A) through (C) of this section may designate another authorized representative if the authorization is in writing, the authorization specifies the individual or position responsible for the overall operation of the facility from which the discharge originates or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, and the written authorization is submitted to the City of Manitowoc.

(g) Monitoring Facilities.

1. Each discharger that is required by the Superintendent shall provide and operate, at the discharger’s own expense, monitoring facilities that allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each discharge to the POTW. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger’s premises, except, where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger, the Superintendent may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. All monitoring facilities shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with an opening of no less than 24 inches diameter and an internal diameter of no less than 36 inches. Flow measuring, recording, and sampling equipment may be required by the Superintendent in some cases to assure compliance with this chapter.



2. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger.

3. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.

4. When the Superintendent determines wastewater or wastes, either untreated or pretreated, are of a type which may pose a threat to the public or the public sanitary sewer system as previously described, such dischargers may be required to provide a continuous monitoring device incorporating a detection and warning system and a positive control device approved by the Superintendent to prevent spills or incompatible wastewater from entering the sanitary sewer, and to provide and maintain a property damage and personal injury liability insurance policy in whatever amount deemed necessary by the Superintendent. Said liability insurance shall cover claims against the user for damage to the public sanitary sewer system or treatment works which may be caused by such abnormal and/or deleterious waste and for claims brought against said user for personal injury and/or property damage generally.

(h) Inspection and Sampling. The Superintendent may inspect the monitoring facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The discharger shall allow the Superintendent, DNR and EPA, or its authorized representatives, upon presentation of credentials or identification, to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all hours, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, or the examination or copying of records required by subsection (8) of this section. The Superintendent, DNR and EPA shall have the right to set up on the discharger’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or meeting operations.

(i) Confidential Information. Information and data furnished to the Superintendent with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public and governmental agencies if just cause is shown to the City for release of this information unless the discharger specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets, according to Wis. Stat. § 134.90(1)(c), or proprietary information of the discharger. When confidentiality is requested and demonstrated by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available to governmental agencies upon written request received 10 days in advance if the information is for uses related to this chapter, the WPDES permit, and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be made available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.

(7) Enforcement.

(a) Emergency Suspension of Service and Wastewater Discharge Permits. The Superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment service and the wastewater discharge permit of a discharger when it appears to the Superintendent that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens (1) an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, (2) substantial danger to the environment, (3) interference with the operation of the POTW, or (4) violation of any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any discharger notified of suspension of its wastewater treatment service and/or the discharger’s wastewater discharge permit shall, within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Superintendent, cease all discharges. In the event the discharger fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the City shall commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger’s compliance with such order. The Superintendent shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.

(b) Revocation of Wastewater Discharge Permit. The Superintendent may revoke the permit of any discharger who violates the following conditions in accordance with the procedures of subsections (7)(c) and (d) of this section:

1. Failure of a discharger to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge.

2. Failure of a discharger to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics.

3. Refusal of access to the discharger’s premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring.

4. Violation of the conditions of the permit, or this chapter, or any judicial order entered with respect thereto.

5. Tampering with sampling or flow measurement equipment, samples, and/or analysis being conducted by or at the direction of the City.

(c) Notification of Violation – Administrative Adjustment. Whenever the Superintendent seeks to revoke a wastewater discharge permit, pursuant to subsection (7)(b) of this section, the Superintendent shall serve or cause to be served upon the discharger a written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within 10 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond personally or in writing to the Superintendent with an explanation of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and, where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. If the user does not comply with the plan, the City may take action in accordance with subsection (7)(h) of this section.

(d) Show Cause Hearing. Where a violation of subsection (7)(b) of this section is not corrected by means of administrative adjustment, the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board may order any discharger which causes or allows conduct prohibited by subsection (7)(b) of this section to show cause before the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board why the discharger’s wastewater discharge permit should not be revoked. A written notice shall specify the time and place of the hearing to be conducted before the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board, that the reason for the hearing is to determine whether or not the discharger’s permit should be revoked, the reasons for the proposed revocation, and shall direct the discharger to show cause before the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board why its discharge permit should not be revoked.

The notice of the hearing shall be served on the discharger by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, no less than 10 days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer or authorized representative of a discharger. The proceedings shall be considered by the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board, which shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger. The discharger may appeal any such order in accordance with any applicable State or local law.

(e) Hearing Officials. The Wastewater Treatment Facility Board shall conduct the hearing and shall have authority to:

1. Issue notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses in the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings.

2. Take evidence.

3. Take or order enforcement action as permitted in this subsection (7).

(f) Transcripts. At any hearing held pursuant to this subsection, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded by a reporter. A transcript will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof.

(g) Issuance of Orders. After the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board has reviewed the evidence, or if the discharger waives a show cause hearing, after reviewing any proposed compliance schedule, the Board may issue an order to the discharger directing that, following a specific time period, sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed, all treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated, and compliance with this chapter is achieved. Further orders and directives as the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board deems necessary and appropriate may be issued. If the user violates an order, the Board may order action taken in accordance with subsection (7)(h) of this section. The Board shall also immediately report any violation of an order to the Mayor and Common Council.

(h) Judicial Proceedings. Pursuant to subsection (7)(c) of this section, or following the entry of an order by the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board finding the conduct of a discharger to be contrary to the provisions of subsection (7)(b) of this section, the City Attorney may, following authorization of such action by the Wastewater Treatment Facility Board, commence an action in Circuit or Federal Court for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief, including but not limited to the termination of wastewater treatment service to the user. The Wastewater Treatment Facility Board may take further action pursuant to subsections (7)(a) and/or (7)(b) and/or (9) of this section.

(i) Enforcement Actions – Annual Publication. The City shall annually publish, in the largest daily newspaper published in Manitowoc, a list of industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria:

Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter.

Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, which are violations in which 33 percent or more of all the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC equals 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).

Any other violation that the City believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of City personnel or the general public).

Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health or welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW’s exercise of its emergency authority.

Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting or completing construction, or attaining final compliance.

Failure to provide, within 45 days of the due date, any required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.

Failure to accurately report noncompliance.

Any other violation(s) which the City determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

(j) Inquiries. Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the City on any matter covered by this section and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply.

(k) Operating Upsets. Any discharger which experiences an upset in operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this section or a wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant hereto shall inform the Superintendent within 24 hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset. The City may immediately take action pursuant to subsection (7)(h) of this section.

3. All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.

A documented and verified operating upset shall be an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the City against a discharger for any noncompliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant hereto which arises out of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law. After receipt and review of written report, the City may take no further action, or may take action in accordance with subsections (7)(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and/or (h) of this section.

(8) Record Retention. All dischargers subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve, for no less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence, and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling, and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of a discharger in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the City pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.

(9) Penalties – Costs.

(a) Civil Penalties. Violations of this chapter may be subject to a forfeiture of not more than $2,000 for each offense. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the City may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, court reporter’s fee, and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this chapter or the orders, rules, regulations, and permits issued hereunder. In default of payment of such forfeiture and costs, said violator may be imprisoned for a period not to exceed six months.

(b) Costs of Damages. Any user violating any of the provisions of this chapter or who has a discharge which causes a deposit, obstruction, damage, or other impairment to the POTW shall become liable to the City for any expense, loss, or damage caused by the violation or discharge. The City may add to the user’s charges and fees the costs assessed for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Any refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

(c) Falsifying Information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter may be subject to a forfeiture of not more than $1,000 per violation per day and costs, and in default of payment by imprisonment for not more than six months.

The Manitowoc Public Utilities shall furnish the Manitowoc City Treasurer with a list of all such lots or parcels of real estate, and the notice shall be given by the Manitowoc Public Utilities. Such notice shall be in writing and shall state the amount of such arrears, including any penalty assessed pursuant to this chapter; that unless the same is paid by November 1st, thereafter, a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of such arrears will be added thereto; and that unless such arrears with any such added penalty shall be paid by November 15th, thereafter, the same will be levied as a tax against the lot or parcel of real estate to which the sewer service was furnished and for which payment is delinquent as above specified.

Each such delinquent amount, including such penalty, shall thereupon become a lien on the lot or parcel of real estate to which the sewer service was furnished and payment for which is delinquent and the Clerk shall insert the same as a tax against such lot or parcel of real estate. All proceedings in relation to the collection of general property taxes and to the return and sale of property for delinquent taxes shall apply to said tax if the same is not paid within the time required by law for payment of taxes on real estate.

27.010 Purpose.

The City of Manitowoc finds that the development of cable television systems can potentially be of great benefit to the citizens of the City of Manitowoc. Cable technology is changing rapidly and cable is expected to play an essential role as part of the City’s basic infrastructure. Cable television systems extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rights-of-way in a manner different from the manner in which the general public uses such rights-of-way, and in a manner reserved primarily for those who provide services to the public as public utilities. The grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and creates the potential that the holder will be in a position to abuse its public trust. Because of this, the City finds that public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the City or such persons or bodies as the City so designates to protect the public and ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest. In light of the foregoing, the following goals, among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter:

(1) Cable services should be available to as many City of Manitowoc residents as possible.

(2) A cable system should be capable of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the community.

(3) A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated into existing system facilities.

(4) A cable system should be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community.

(5) A cable system should be designed and constructed so that it may conveniently and economically be used by public institutions as a telecommunications and information highway for pursuing public purposes.

(1) Grant Authority. The City may grant one or more cable television franchises, and each such franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this cable ordinance. The cable ordinance may be amended from time to time, and in no event shall the ordinance be considered a contract between the City and any franchisee such that the City would be prohibited from amending any provision of the cable ordinance.

No person, other than the City of Manitowoc or any of its subunits, including Manitowoc Public Utilities, may construct or operate a cable system without a franchise granted by the City, and no such person may be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with the City pursuant to this chapter.

(3) Franchise Characteristics.

(a) Rights and Privileges. A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter grants to the franchisee a nonexclusive franchise to construct, operate and repair in, upon, along, across, above and over streets in the City a cable system for the purpose of providing cable service, all subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. A franchise does not expressly or implicitly authorize the franchisee to provide service to, or install a cable system on private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible easements pursuant to 47 USC 541(a)(2)), or use publicly or privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owner.

(b) Term. The term of a franchise may not exceed 10 years. A franchise may be extended for an additional five years up to a total of 15 years upon recommendation of the Cable Television Commission and the recommendation of the Public Utilities and Licensing Committee.

(c) Nonexclusivity. Any franchise granted hereunder is nonexclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly preclude the issuance of any other franchises to operate cable systems within the City, affect the City’s right to authorize the use of public rights-of-way by other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as the City deems appropriate, or affect the City’s right itself to construct, operate or maintain a cable system with or without a franchise.

(d) Franchise Agreement. Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by the City and a franchisee, such franchise agreement shall constitute a contract between the franchisee and the City. The terms, conditions and provisions of such franchise agreement, subject to this chapter and all other duly enacted and applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, shall define the rights and obligations of the franchisee and the City related to the franchise. Any violation of any franchise agreement shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.

(4) Other Laws. All rights and privileges granted herein are subject to the police powers of the City and its rights under applicable laws and regulations to regulate the franchisee and the construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable system, including, but not limited to, the right to adopt and enforce additional ordinances and regulations as the City shall find necessary in the exercise of its police powers; the right to adopt and enforce applicable zoning, building and permitting and safety codes; and any right the City has to adopt and enforce laws and regulations including cable television consumer protection laws and service standards pursuant to the Cable Act.

(6) Right of Condemnation Reserved. Nothing in this chapter or any franchise agreement shall limit any right pursuant to applicable law which the City may have to acquire any property of the franchisee.

(7) Acts at Franchisee’s Expense.

Any person who occupies public rights-of-way for the purpose of operating or constructing a cable system and who does not hold a valid franchise from the City shall be subject to all provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to its provisions regarding construction and technical standards and franchise fees. In its discretion, the City at any time may require such person to enter into a franchise agreement within 30 days of receipt of a written notice by the City that a franchise agreement is required; require such person to remove its property and restore the area to a condition satisfactory to the City within such time period; remove the property itself and restore the area to a satisfactory condition and charge the person the costs therefor; and/or take any other action it is entitled to take under applicable law, including filing for and seeking damages under trespass. In no event shall a franchise be created unless it is issued by action of the City and subject to a franchise agreement.

[Prior code § 27.05]


27.070 Applications for Grant, Renewal, or Modification of Franchises.

(1) Written Application.

(a) A written application shall be filed with the City for (1) grant of an initial franchise; (2) renewal of a franchise under 47 USC 546(a) through (g); or (3) modification of a franchise agreement pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement. An applicant shall demonstrate in its application compliance with all requirements of this chapter and all applicable laws.

(b) To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall be submitted together with 12 copies. The application must be accompanied by the required application filing fee as set forth in subsection (6) of this section, conform to any applicable Request for Proposals, and contain all required information. All applications shall include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the applicant with respect to the application.

(c) All applications accepted for filing shall be made available by the City for public inspection.

(2) Application for Grant of a Franchise, Other Than a Cable Act Renewal Franchise.

(a) A person may apply for a franchise by submitting a request for issuance of a Request for Proposals (“RFP”) and requesting an evaluation of its application pursuant to subsection (2)(c) of this section. Upon receipt of a request for an RFP, the City shall commence a proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests of the community and, upon completion of that proceeding, shall promptly issue an RFP and proposed franchise agreement, which shall be provided to the person requesting its issuance. The applicant shall respond within the time directed by the City, providing the information and material set forth in subsection (4) of this section. The procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in the RFP shall be followed by each applicant as if set forth and required herein. The City or its designee may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2)(a) of this section, a person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application containing the information required in subsection (4) of this section and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to subsection (2)(c) of this section. Prior to evaluating that application, the City may conduct such investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the standards set forth in subsection (2)(c) of this section and may seek additional applications.

(c) In evaluating an application for a franchise, the City shall consider, among other things, the following factors:

1. Whether the applicant has the financial, technical and legal qualifications to provide cable service.

2. Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the City and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.

3. Whether, to the extent not considered as part of subsection (2)(c)(2) of this section, the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial support.

4. Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the streets and private property that would be used by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the streets; the effect of granting a franchise on the cable-related needs and interests of the community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications.

5. Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or controls any other cable system in the City, or whether grant of the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the City.

(d) If the City finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors set forth in subsection (2)(c) of this section, and subject to the applicant’s entry into an appropriate franchise agreement, it shall issue a franchise. If the City denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the City may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received. The City also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP. This chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any applicant or existing franchisee standing to challenge the issuance of a franchise to another.

(3) Application for Grant of a Cable Act Renewal Franchise. Applications for renewal under the Cable Act shall be received and reviewed in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546, under procedures established by the Common Council.

(4) Contents of Applications. An RFP for the grant of a franchise, including for a renewal franchise under 47 USC 546(c), shall require, and any application submitted (other than an application submitted pursuant to 47 USC 546(h)) shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:

(a) Name and address of the applicant and identification of the ownership and control of the applicant, including: all persons with five percent or more ownership interest in the applicant and its affiliates; the persons who control the applicant and its affiliates; all officers and directors of the applicant and its affiliates; and any other business affiliation and cable system ownership interest of each named person.

(b) A demonstration of the applicant’s technical ability to construct and/or operate the proposed cable system, including identification of key personnel.

(c) A demonstration of the applicant’s legal qualifications to construct and/or operate the proposed cable system, including but not limited to a demonstration that the applicant meets the following criteria:

1. The applicant must not have submitted an application for an initial or renewal franchise to the City under subsection (2) of this section or an application for renewal under subsection (3) of this section which was finally denied pursuant to the procedures set forth in those sections on the grounds that the applicant failed to propose a system meeting the cable-related needs and interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such final licensing decision were finally resolved adversely to the applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application.

2. The applicant must not have had any cable television franchise validly revoked by any licensing authority and any appeal finally resolved adversely to the applicant’s interests within three years preceding the submission of the application.

3. The applicant must have the necessary authority under Wisconsin law to operate a cable system.

4. The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it may not hold the franchise as a matter of Federal law. An applicant must have, or show that it is qualified to obtain, the necessary Federal licenses or waivers required to operate the system proposed.

5. The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time during the 10 years preceding the submission of the application, the applicant was convicted of any act or omission of such character that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the City and the subscribers of the cable system, or to substantially comply with its lawful obligations under applicable law, including obligations under consumer protection laws and laws prohibiting anticompetitive acts, fraud, racketeering, or other similar conduct.

6. The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files materially misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.

7. The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if an elected official of the City holds a controlling interest in the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall provide an opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under subsection (4)(c)(2) or (5) of this section, by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant’s principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of cable television systems.

[Prior code § 27.07]


27.090 Use of Public and Private Property.

(1) Public Right-of-Way Installation.

(a) Generally. The franchisee’s cable system shall only be installed on existing pole facilities that franchisee may use under a valid pole attachment agreement or order of the City, on the property of a subscriber, in compatible easements that franchisee is entitled to use, under or over the streets of the City or on the property of the franchisee. Installation of new poles in the streets is forbidden without the prior written consent of the City.

(b) No Vested Rights Created. A franchisee’s placement of its cable system pursuant to its franchise shall not be deemed to give that franchisee a property or other interest in any particular location within the streets, or a preference over any other entity authorized to use such property. The City reserves the right in its reasonable discretion to designate where a cable system is to be placed within the streets.

(c) Underground and Aerial Construction. In all areas of the City where the cable or wire distribution facilities of the local exchange carrier and the electric company are installed, or are to be installed, underground, the franchisee shall install its cable system underground. Without limitation, where telephone and electric distribution drops are required to be located underground, cable drops shall be underground.

In all areas of the City where the distribution lines of the local exchange carrier and the electric utility were aerially placed at the time of construction of the cable system, if such lines are subsequently relocated underground, the franchisee shall, at that same time, relocate its cable system underground; provided, that if the subscriber requests it, and if consistent with applicable laws and regulations, the franchisee need not relocate drops to the home underground.

(2) Subscriber Property Installation.

(a) Permission Required. No cable, line, wire, amplifier, converter or other piece of equipment owned or controlled by the franchisee shall be installed on private property by the franchisee without first securing the permission of the owner or tenant in possession of such property or the written permission of the holder of any easement for utility lines or similar purposes, except as expressly authorized by Federal law. Except in emergency situations, the franchisee may not enter onto private property for the purpose of installing, repairing or replacing equipment without giving advance notice, and may not enter into a home or multiple dwelling unit for those purposes without an appointment with the occupant of the property. The provisions of this subsection represent permission requirements by the City. These requirements are not meant in any way to replace any property rights of owners or occupants to restrict access to their own property.

(b) Subscriber Right to Install. A subscriber may install its own internal wiring, or contract to have wiring installed, and the franchisee must use that wire unless the installation does not meet applicable FCC standards or applicable safety codes.

(c) Consultation with Subscriber. The franchisee shall consult with the subscriber and the landowner with regard to point of entry of the drop connection to the structure and shall consult with the subscriber or landowner before such point of entry is made. It shall follow any instructions received unless it is not possible to do so in accordance with applicable safety codes.

(d) Consultation on Internal Wiring. The franchisee shall likewise consult with the subscriber and landowner and follow the instructions received with respect to internal wiring installed by the franchisee. In any event, internal cable runs shall be made as unobtrusively as possible.

(e) Terms of Extension of Service. The franchisee shall extend service upon request without charging any fee beyond then-prevailing installation charges except that:

1. In cases where service has been extended on the street past a residence or business, but the drop from the nearest point on the cable system from which service could be provided to the home exceeds 150 feet, the franchisee may require the subscriber to pay the difference between the cost of labor and materials required to install a 150-foot drop to that home and the actual cost of labor and materials required to install the drop to that home.

2. Where drop connections could be aerial, the franchisee shall place the drops underground at the subscriber’s request, if the subscriber agrees to pay the actual difference in labor and materials between the cost of installing an underground drop instead of an aerial drop.

(3) No Hindrance to Public Works. Without limiting the City’s rights under any other provision herein, it is specifically agreed that the rights and privileges granted hereby shall not be in preference or hindrance to the right of the City, or other authority having jurisdiction, to change or alter the grade, to sell or vacate any street or other public property; to construct, operate or maintain or move any building, line, pipe, conduit, ditch, sewer, playground or other public improvement, work, utility, structure, system or facility; or to protect public health and safety and property.

(4) Relocation of Facilities. Without limiting the rights of the City or the rights of others under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the following rules shall govern:

(a) For Government. The franchisee shall remove, relay and relocate its cable system at its own expense whenever the City or any authorized governmental body, including Manitowoc Public Utilities, so requires, including for reasons of traffic conditions; public health and safety and protection of property; or because the City or authorized governmental body elects to change or alter the grade, or sell or vacate any street or public property; to construct, operate, repair or move any building, line, wire, cable, pipe, conduit, ditch, sewer, playground or other public improvement, work, utility, structure, system or facility; which change, alteration, sale, vacation, movement, construction, operation or repair will be aided by removal, relaying or relocation of the franchisee’s cable system. The franchisee shall be given written notice requesting the removal, relaying or relocation of its cable system as soon as practicable, but at least 20 days in advance of the date removal, relaying or relocation of the cable system must be completed.

(b) For Other Users of Rights-of-Way. If any removal, relaying or relocation is required to accommodate the movement, construction, operation or repair of the facilities of another person that is authorized to occupy the streets, franchisee shall remove, relocate or relay its cable system within 20 days after receiving written notice from such person that such removal, relocation or relaying is required. The reasonable cost of franchisee compliance with respect to any such request shall be borne by the person requesting such compliance and the franchisee may require payment in advance.

(c) For Third Parties. The franchisee shall, upon the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the City, temporarily raise, lower, relay, relocate or remove its wires, cables and other facilities to accommodate the moving of the building. The reasonable cost of such temporary raising or lowering, relaying, relocation or removal of the franchisee’s facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the franchisee shall have the authority to establish the reasonable cost of such changes and require such payment in advance. The franchisee shall temporarily move its system as required under this section if required payments are made and the franchisee is given at least seven days’ advance written notice to arrange for such temporary changes.

(d) Removal or Relocation in Event of Emergency. In event of emergency, or where franchisee’s cable system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property, City may remove, relocate or relay that cable system without prior notice. Any costs related to such activity shall be borne by franchisee.

(5) Duty to Protect Public and Private Property.

(a) Generally. Franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain its system with due care for the safety and integrity of persons and property, and shall use appropriate safety devices, warning signs, barricades and lights to prevent harm to persons or property. It is the duty of franchisee to protect, at its expense, public and private property from damage caused by the construction, operation and repair of its cable system, and to promptly repair damage caused by the construction, operation and repair of its cable system. Unaesthetic or poor workmanship shall be considered “damage.” Property damaged shall be repaired to a condition at least as good as existed before the damage occurred within 10 days of the damage. The franchisee shall at all times comply with the requirements of 47 USC 541(a)(2)(A) through (C).

(b) Duty to Notify. The franchisee shall notify any person whose property is damaged by the franchisee within four hours of the time the damage is discovered. If the franchisee is unable to make personal contact within four hours, the franchisee may provide notice by placing a door hanger on the property. At a minimum, this section requires the franchisee to place a prominent notice in a prominent place on the damaged property, and to make diligent efforts to contact the property owner or resident by phone or in person.

(6) Failure to Move, Replace or Restore. If the franchisee fails to remove, relay or relocate its cable system as required or within the time period specified in subsection (4) of this section; or if the franchisee fails to restore, repair or replace public streets or public property as required and within the time period specified in subsection (5) of this section; the City may perform the work or hire someone to perform the work, and the franchisee shall compensate the City for all reasonable expenses it incurs. In the event the franchisee fails to restore, replace or repair private property as required and within the time period specified by subsection (5) of this section, the owner may perform the work itself or hire someone to perform the work, and the franchisee shall compensate the owner for all reasonable expenses incurred. If the franchisee fails to protect or restore streets or public property as required by the franchise, the City may do so, and the franchisee shall compensate the City for all reasonable expenses incurred thereby. The franchisee shall pay expenses incurred by the City or property owner within 30 days of receipt of an itemized account of such expenses.

(7) Contractors. All franchisee’s contractors or subcontractors shall be properly qualified and licensed, and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same obligations with respect to its work as franchisee would have under its franchise and applicable laws and regulations if the work were performed by the franchisee. The franchisee shall be responsible for training and testing, if necessary, the knowledge of all contractors and subcontractors (including installers). The franchisee is also responsible for ensuring that the work of its contractors and subcontractors is performed consistent with its franchise and applicable laws and regulations, shall be fully responsible for all acts or omissions of its contractors or subcontractors and shall be responsible for supervising and promptly correcting acts or omissions by any of its contractors or subcontractors.

(8) Identification. The franchisee shall ensure that all of its vehicles, employees, agents and contractors are clearly identified to the general public as being associated with the franchisee. Any employee, agent or contractor of the franchisee must present a picture identification before entering a subscriber’s home.

(9) Excavation. All excavation shall be performed so as to create the least inconvenience to the public, and in accordance with permits issued by the City. The City shall have the right to supervise all excavation.

(10) Tree Trimming. The franchisee shall be responsible for the trimming of any trees required by the location of its wires. The franchisee shall not, however, remove any tree or trim any portion, either above, at or below ground level, of any tree within any street, highway or other public right-of-way without the prior consent of the City’s Parks and Recreation Department. The City shall have the right at its option to do the trimming requested by the franchisee at the cost of the franchisee, or to require the franchisee to do the same. Regardless of who performs the work requested by the franchisee, the franchisee shall be responsible for and shall defend and hold the City harmless for any and all damages done to any tree as a result of any trimming, or to the land surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed. The requirements herein shall be in addition to any consents the franchisee is required to obtain under the Wisconsin Statutes or any other authority.

The subject matter which may be discussed at any scheduled or special evaluation session may include, but not be limited to, the following: service rate structures; franchise fee; penalties; free or discounted services; application of new technologies; system performance; services provided; programming offered; customer complaints; privacy; amendments to this chapter; judicial and FCC rulings; line extension policies; and any franchisee or City rules. Members of the general public may add topics by working through the franchisee or the Cable Television Commission.

(3) Franchisee Cooperation. During a review and evaluation by the Cable Television Commission on any issue, a franchisee shall fully cooperate with the City and shall provide such information and documents as the City may request to reasonably perform the review. If, at any time during its review, the City determines that reasonable evidence exists of inadequate cable television system performance, it may require a franchisee to perform tests and analyses directed toward such suspected inadequacies at the franchisee’s own expense. The franchisee shall fully cooperate with the City in performing such testing and shall prepare the results and a report, if requested, within 30 days after notice. Such report shall include the following information:

(a) The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the special tests;

(b) What system component was tested;

(c) The equipment used and the procedures employed in testing;

(d) The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved; and

(e) Any other information pertinent to said tests and analyses which may be required.

The City may require that the tests be supervised, at a franchisee’s expense, by a professional engineer not on the permanent staff of the franchisee, or other qualified person. Such person shall sign all reports of special tests and forward to the Cable Television Commission such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and recommending any action to be taken.

[Prior code § 27.25]


27.270 Franchise Fee.

(1) Finding. The City finds that public rights-of-way of the City to be used by a franchisee for the operation of a cable system are valuable public property acquired and maintained by the City at expense to the taxpayers. The City further finds that the grant of a franchise to use public rights-of-way is a valuable property right without which a franchisee would be required to invest substantial capital.

(2) Payment to the City.

(a) As compensation for use of the public rights-of-way, a franchisee shall pay the City a franchise fee in an amount up to the greater of five percent of its gross revenues, or the maximum amount permitted under State and Federal law. Every franchise agreement shall specify the percentage a franchisee is initially required to pay as a percentage of gross revenues, but if the maximum amount permitted under State and Federal law increases, the franchisee shall, simultaneously with the effective date of any change in any law or, if later, the effective date of any regulation required to implement the law at the option of the City, increase the franchise fee to the maximum allowed by that law. The franchise agreement may specify the maximum amount that the City can require the franchisee to pay as a franchise fee if Federal law does not specify a maximum amount; in such a case, subject to any limits in the franchise agreement, the City may specify the amount that it will collect by ordinance and, in that event, the franchisee shall begin paying the increased fee from the effective date of the ordinance.

(3) Not a Tax or in Lieu of Any Other Tax or Fee.

(a) Payment of the franchise fee shall not be considered in the nature of a tax.

(b) The franchise fee is in addition to all other taxes and payments that a franchisee may be required to pay under any Federal, State or local law and to any other tax, fee, or assessment imposed by utilities and cable operators for use of their services, facilities, or equipment, except to the extent that such fees, taxes, or assessments must be treated as a franchise fee under Section 642 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 522.

(4) Payments.

(a) The franchise fee and any other costs assessed by the City against a franchisee shall be paid quarterly to the City and shall commence as of the effective date of a franchise. The City shall be furnished at the time of each payment with a statement certified by the franchisee’s chief financial officer or an independent certified public accountant reflecting the total amount of monthly gross revenues for the payment period. Quarterly payments shall be made to the City no later than 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter. An annual statement of gross revenues shall be furnished to the City by an independent, certified public accountant. The franchisee shall provide an annual complete audit statement for each calendar year within 90 days from the end of that calendar year.

(b) In the event any franchise fee payment or recomputation amount is not made on or before the date specified herein, the franchisee shall pay additional compensation and interest charges computed from such due date, at a rate of one percent per month.

(5) No Accord or Satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of a franchisee.

(6) Audit.

(a) The City shall have the right to inspect and copy records and the rights to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter, whether the records are held by the franchisee, an affiliate, or any other entity that collects or receives funds related to the franchisee’s operation in the City, including, by way of illustration and not limitation, any entity that sells advertising on the franchisee’s behalf. The franchisee shall be responsible for providing the records to the City, regardless of which entity possesses or has control of the records. Records relating to franchisee’s gross revenues shall be maintained for at least six years. The City’s audit expenses shall be borne by the City unless the audit discloses an underpayment of $500.00 or more, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by the franchisee as a cost incidental to the enforcement of that franchisee’s franchise. Any additional amounts due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the franchisee by the City of the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.

(b) A franchisee shall maintain its fiscal and financial records and have all relevant fiscal and financial records maintained by others on its behalf in such a manner as to enable the City to determine the cost of assets of the franchisee which are used in providing services within the City and to determine gross revenues.

[Prior code § 27.27]


27.290 Indemnification and Insurance.

(1) Indemnification. The franchisee shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold free and harmless the City and its officers, employees, committees, boards, commissions and other governmental subunits, advisors and agents from and against any and all liability, losses, penalties, damages, settlements, costs, charges, professional fees or other expenses or liabilities of every kind and character arising out of or relating to any and all claims, liens, demands, obligations, actions, proceedings or causes of action of every kind and character (referred to collectively below as “claims”) in connection with or arising directly or indirectly out of the issuance and administration of a franchise, or the franchisee’s enjoyment or exercise of the same. By way of illustration and not limitation, this would include claims arising out of acts or omissions in constructing, operating or repairing the cable system by the franchisee or any entity for whose acts or omissions the franchisee may be liable, without regard to whether the act or omission giving rise to the indemnity was required, allowed, or prohibited by a franchise or applicable law, and claims of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by reason of any conduct undertaken pursuant to a franchise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and all such claims relating to personal injury, death, damage to property, defects in material or workmanship, actual or alleged infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright (or application for any thereof) or of any other tangible or intangible personal or property right, or any actual or alleged violation of any applicable Statute, ordinance, administrative order, rule or regulation, or decree of any court, shall be included in this indemnity. The franchisee shall investigate, handle, respond to, provide defense for and defend any such claims, etc., at its sole expense and shall bear all other costs and expenses related thereto, even if the franchisee believes the claim is groundless, false or fraudulent. Provided, further, that the duty to indemnify includes, but is not limited to, the duty to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by the City, its officers, agents and employees, in defending themselves, including but not limited to all out-of-pocket expenses, and, if franchisee or the City determines that the interests of the franchisee and the City conflict, attorney’s fees for outside counsel, and the reasonable value of any services rendered by the City’s attorney or any legal assistants, or by any employees of the City in defending the matter.

(2) Insurance.

(a) Insurance Required. The franchisee shall purchase and maintain, during the full term of a franchise and any extensions and renewals thereof, such insurance as will protect it and the City from any claims which may arise directly or indirectly or result from the issuance of a franchise or the enjoyment or exercise of the same, including, by way of illustration and not limitation, claims that may result from the construction, operation or repair of the cable system, whether such construction, operation or repair is performed by the franchisee or by anyone for whose acts the franchisee may be liable. The insurance shall, at a minimum, include the following:

1. Worker’s compensation, including liability benefits and any other legally required employee benefits, shall be supplied in statutory amounts.

2. General liability insurance, including motor vehicle, shall be supplied in the following amounts:

Personal injury or death: $5,000,000 per person.

Property damage: $2,000,000 per occurrence.

Umbrella liability: $5,000,000.

Cablecaster’s liability: $1,000,000 per occurrence.

The umbrella liability shall include coverage of worker’s compensation, commercial or comprehensive general liability, coverage for claims arising under the laws of copyright, defamation, invasion of privacy, obscenity and other, similar laws relating to the production, publication and retransmission of information.

(b) Endorsements in Favor of Municipalities.

1. The City shall be named as an additional insured on all policies maintained pursuant to the franchise, except worker’s compensation insurance.

2. The franchisee’s liability insurance policies shall include an endorsement that recognizes that insurance policies cover the franchisee’s duty to indemnify in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.

3. The franchisee’s insurance policies shall contain an endorsement stating:

It is understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the amount of coverage reduced, nor the coverages materially modified in a manner that decreases coverages until 30 days after receipt by each of the Clerk of the City of Manitowoc, by certified mail, of a written notice of intent to cancel, reduce or modify the coverage.

(c) Evidence of Insurance. The franchisee shall furnish to the City certificates of insurance acceptable to the City which shall show that the policies include all the coverages and the endorsements specified above. The certificates shall be provided within 30 days of the date a franchise agreement is signed, and new certificates shall be provided annually on December 31st of each year, or any time the insurance carrier or policies are changed. Failure to maintain insurance as required herein, or to furnish certificates of insurance, shall constitute a material and substantial violation of any franchise agreement. Upon request, the franchisee shall provide the City complete copies of the insurance policies (including any riders or addenda thereto).

(d) Approval. All insurance coverage shall be subject to approval of the City as to the issuing company and the form of the policies and certificates of insurance, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

(e) Other Policies. The franchisee, in addition to all other insurance requirements herein, shall procure and maintain insurance in the type and amount as may be required in any license, permit, or agreement obtained in connection with the construction, operation or repair of its cable system and which is necessary to complete any construction, operation or repair (e.g., highway permit, railroad crossing agreement, Corps of Engineers permit) regardless of who secured the franchise, permit or agreement.

(f) Additional Insurance. The City may require the franchisee to provide additional coverages or increase the insurance amounts from time to time as it deems appropriate to reflect inflation and increased risks to the City.

[Prior code § 27.29]


27.310 Performance Security.

(1) Security Provided. To secure the faithful performance of all franchise agreement obligations, compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any agency of the City having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under a franchise, the payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, forfeitures, payments, assessments or taxes due the City under a franchise agreement or otherwise, or which arise by reason of the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable system and the payment of any damages, penalties, fees and costs incurred by the City with respect to the same, including reasonable legal expenses incurred in enforcing a franchise agreement, the franchisee shall provide the City with the following security:

(a) Security Fund. On or before commencement of a franchise term the franchisee shall deposit with the City the sum of $10,000. The City shall deposit these funds in an interest bearing account (the “security fund”) payable, in whole or in part, to the City upon demand. Interest on the security fund as accrued shall become a part of the security fund.

(b) Performance Bond. On or before commencement of a franchise term, the franchisee shall post with the City a performance bond in the amount of $100,000. The form of performance bond shall be subject to approval as to content and form by the City Attorney. Among other provisions, the performance bond must provide:

1. That the City may recover on the performance bond upon the City’s certification that the franchisee is in substantial default of its franchise agreement or this chapter and the amounts recoverable under the performance bond shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the franchisee and the surety;

2. That the total amount of the performance bond shall be forfeited in favor of the City in the event the franchisee abandons the cable system at any time during the term of its franchise or any extension thereto; or the franchisee attempts to transfer or transfers the franchise without the prior express written consent of the City.

3. Any performance bond submitted hereunder shall contain the following endorsement:

This Performance Bond may not be canceled, allowed to lapse or the amount thereof reduced until at least thirty (30) days after receipt by the City of Manitowoc City Clerk, by certified mail, of a written notice from the issuer of the Performance Bond of its intent to cancel the Performance Bond, to allow it to lapse or to reduce the amount of the Performance Bond.

A letter of credit may be substituted for the performance bond upon mutual agreement of the parties.

(c) Construction Performance Bond. In the event a cable system is further upgraded, removed, relocated or otherwise undergoes any reconfiguration or other change involving work costing more than $100,000 during a franchise term, the City may require the franchisee to provide a performance bond in a form and with a company acceptable to the City to secure the faithful performance of such work, and to protect the City from any damages or expense arising out of the work, or the breach of any promise to perform it. The performance bond shall be in an amount equal to 10 percent of the estimated total cost of the work, and in a form satisfactory to the City. Any construction performance bond required hereunder shall contain the following endorsement:

This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, or the amount of the bond reduced until 30 days after receipt by each of the respective Clerks of the City of Manitowoc, by certified mail, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of its intent to cancel the bond, to allow it to lapse, or to reduce the amount of the bond.

Failure to maintain the performance bonds required herein shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

(2) Use of Funds. If the franchisee fails to make timely payment to the City or its designee or designees of any amount due as a result of a franchise; or fails to make timely payment to the City or its designee of any liquidated damages or penalties due under a franchise agreement or applicable law; or fails to make timely payment to the City of any taxes due; or fails to compensate the City within 20 days of written notification that such compensation is due, for any damages, costs or expense the City suffers or incurs by reason of any act or omission of the franchisee in connection with a franchise agreement or applicable law or regulations, or the enforcement of the same; or fails, after 20 days’ notice, to comply with any provision of a franchise agreement or applicable law or regulations which the City reasonably determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the security; the City may withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, and without further notice to franchisee, from the security fund and from the surety under any performance bond.

(3) Notification. Within three days of withdrawal from the security fund the City shall mail written notification of the amount, date and purpose of such withdrawal to the franchisee.

(4) Inadequate Fund Balance. If, at the time of withdrawal from the security fund by the City, the amounts available are insufficient to provide the total payment toward which the withdrawal is directed, the balance of such payment shall continue as an obligation of the franchisee to the City until paid.

(5) Replenishment. No later than 30 days after mailing of notification to the franchisee by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a withdrawal pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the franchisee shall deliver to the City for deposit in the security fund an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn. Failure to make timely delivery of such amount to the City shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

(6) Disposition. Upon termination of a franchise under conditions other than those stipulating forfeiture of the security fund, the balance then remaining in the security fund shall be withdrawn by the City and paid to the franchisee within 90 days of such termination; provided, that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the franchisee.

(7) Failure to Provide or Maintain Security. Failure to provide or maintain the security required under this section shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

[Prior code § 27.31]


27.330 Foreclosure, Receivership.

(1) Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of a cable television system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a substantial part of a cable television system, a franchisee shall notify the City of such fact, and such notification shall be taken as a notification that a change in control of the franchisee has taken place, and the provisions of this chapter governing the consent of the City Council to such change in control of the franchisee shall apply.

(2) Receivership. The City Council shall have the right to cancel any franchise 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a franchise, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:

(a) Within 120 days after his election or appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and

(b) Such receiver or trustee, within said 120 days, shall have executed an agreement, duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of the franchise granted to the franchisee and this chapter. Such agreement shall not jeopardize any other rights the City may have under this chapter.

[Prior code § 27.33]


27.350 Transfers.

(1) Franchisee Ownership. Except as otherwise provided in a franchise or applicable laws and regulations, the franchisee shall, at all times during the term of a franchise and any extensions thereto or renewals thereof, be the full and complete owner of, or have complete possessory rights to, all facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable system.

(2) Transactions Involving Facilities. The franchisee shall not enter into any transaction concerning the ownership of the facilities and property, real or personal, of a cable system or any portion thereof, unless consummation of such transaction is subject to any required approval by the City hereunder. Any approval may be conditioned as required to protect the rights of the City or the public interest.

(3) Limitation. The restrictions on transfer of ownership of the facilities and property of the cable system shall not apply to disposition of worn-out or obsolete facilities or personal property in the normal course of constructing, operating, maintaining and repairing the system, provided such facilities and property are removed and replaced with facilities and property that at least perform the same functions, with at least the same reliability and quality as the facilities and property being disposed of.

(4) Other Transfers. A franchise may not be assigned or transferred, in whole or part, or leased or sublet, mortgaged or pledged in trust by any means, without prior written notice to the City, in accordance with subsection (6) of this section, and the prior written approval of the City upon its good faith determination that the transaction proposed by the franchisee will not be adverse to the interests of the City under a franchise or this chapter or otherwise contrary to the public interest. Any approval may be conditioned as required to protect the rights of the City or the public interest.

(5) What Constitutes a Transfer. A change of control or ownership of franchisee or affiliate that is involved in the operation or management of the cable system shall be considered a transfer of a franchise. The term control includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A transfer shall be deemed to have occurred whenever one entity or a group acting in concert acquire, directly or indirectly, a 20 percent or greater ownership interest in a franchisee. A transfer shall also be presumed to have occurred in the case of a partnership, if a general partner is changed, eliminated or added.

(6) Notice of Transfer. The franchisee and the proposed transferee jointly must notify the City in writing of any sale or transfer subject to approval under this section. At the time the notice is submitted, the franchisee and proposed transferee shall complete any application provided by the City requesting approval of the transfer and shall submit information required under applicable laws and regulations, including information requested by the City relating to the matters for consideration set forth in subsection (7) of this section. The franchisee and transferee must cooperate to provide documents and respond to requests for information by the City regarding the proposed transaction and its potential effects. The notice and information required must be provided at least 120 days before the proposed transaction is scheduled to close.

(7) Matters for Consideration. In determining whether a proposed transaction is adverse to the interests of the City under a franchise or otherwise contrary to the public interest, the City may examine the financial, technical, legal or other qualifications of the transferee, whether the transferee agrees to accept and to be bound by related amendments, ordinances, and resolutions then lawfully in effect; whether the transferee agrees to accept and be bound by each and every term of a franchise; whether the transferee agrees to accept and to be bound by related amendments, ordinances, and resolutions then lawfully in effect; whether the transferee agrees to assume all liability and responsibility for acts and omissions of franchisee, known and unknown, and to correct any defects in performance; whether the transferee agrees that the transfer will not allow it to exercise any rights which could not have been exercised by the transferor, had it continued to hold a franchise; the effect of the transaction on the terms, conditions and quality of the services provided to subscribers; the effect of the transaction on any rights of the City or subscribers under applicable law; the effect of the transfer on competition for the provision of cable services or other communications services within the franchise area; and any other matter which the City is legally entitled or required to consider.

(8) Prohibited Transfers. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the City reserves the right to prohibit any requested transfer if the proposed transferee has any ownership or control of any other cable system in the City, or in circumstances in which the City determines that the acquisition of the cable system by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the City of Manitowoc.

(9) Securing Debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of the system to secure the construction, operation or repair of the cable system may be made without the City’s prior consent; except that no such arrangement may be made which would in any respect under any condition prevent the franchisee or any successor from complying with a franchise and applicable laws and regulations, nor may any such arrangement permit a third party to succeed to the interest of a franchisee, or to own or control a cable system without the prior consent of the City.

(10) Public Hearing – Time for Consideration. Deliberations on a request for assignment or transfer of a franchise shall include a notice and a hearing affording the public opportunity for full participation. Unless the parties agree to some other date, the City must adopt a resolution denying, approving or approving a transaction proposed subject to conditions within 120 days of the date the franchisee and transferee submit all the information reasonably required to be submitted by subsection (6) of this section. If the City does not so act, the request for approval of the transaction shall be deemed granted.

(11) Concurrence in Approval. At such time as the City may approve a proposed assignment or transfer of a franchise, such approval shall be contingent upon the concurrence of the Federal or State regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, if such concurrence is then required by law.

(12) Effect of Unlawful Transfer. Any transaction requiring prior approval that is made in violation of this section shall make a franchise subject to termination by the City.

(13) Costs. The City, as a condition of approval of a transaction, may require the transferee to bear the City’s reasonable costs associated with the review of any transfer request.

[Prior code § 27.35]


27.370 Effect of Termination – Continuity of Service.

(1) When Terminated. A franchisee’s franchise terminates as provided in this chapter or the franchise agreement.

(2) Removal of System upon Termination. Within 12 months of the termination of a franchise, the franchisee shall remove its cable system from all streets and property occupied pursuant to its franchise, unless the City notifies the franchisee that it intends to exercise its purchase option under subsection (6) of this section. At the option of the City, any portions of the cable system that are not removed within that 12-month period shall become the property of the City. Franchisee shall not abandon its cable system or any portion thereof at any time without the City’s prior written consent.

(3) Continuity of Service. It is the right of all subscribers in a franchisee’s franchise area to receive all available services from the franchisee as long as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied.

(4) Duty to Assure Continuity of Service. A franchisee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service in accordance with this section. At the City’s request, a franchisee shall operate its system for a temporary period (the “transition period”) following the termination, sale or transfer of its franchise as necessary to maintain service to subscribers; and shall cooperate with the City to assure an orderly transition from it to another franchisee or cable operator. The transition period shall be no longer than the reasonable period required to select under another franchisee or operator and build a replacement system, if necessary, and shall not be longer than six months, unless extended by the City for good cause. During the transition period, the franchisee will continue to be obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement and applicable laws and regulations.

(5) Failure to Operate.

(a) Effect of Failure. If a franchisee abandons its system during its franchise term, or fails to operate its system in accordance with this section during any transition period, the City, at its option, may operate the cable system or designate another entity to operate the cable system temporarily until the franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable to the City or until the franchise is revoked and a new franchisee or operator selected by the City is providing service; or obtain an injunction requiring the franchisee to continue operations. If the City is required to operate or designate another entity to operate the cable system, the franchisee shall reimburse the City or its designee for all reasonable costs and damages incurred that are in excess of the revenues from the cable system.

(b) Injunctive Relief Shall Be Granted. The parties agree that the City is entitled to injunctive relief under this section if:

1. A franchisee fails to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a substantial portion of the franchise area for 96 consecutive hours, unless the City authorizes a longer interruption of service; or

2. A franchisee, for any period, willfully and without cause refuses to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a substantial portion of the franchise area.

(6) Option to Purchase.

(a) When Exercisable. In the event a franchise is canceled, revoked or not renewed, the City shall have the option to purchase the cable system.

(b) How Exercisable. If the City intends to exercise the purchase option, it must so notify the franchisee in writing no later than 60 days after the cancellation, revocation or nonrenewal of the franchise. If the City notifies the franchisee it intends to exercise this option, the parties shall promptly enter into negotiations to establish terms and conditions of the sale consistent with general industry practices, except that the price for the cable system shall be determined in accordance with subsections (6)(c) and (d) of this section.

(c) Purchase Price upon Expiration. In the event of purchase by the City at the end of a franchise term provided for in a franchise agreement, the purchase price shall be the fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself.

(d) Purchase Price on Termination for Cause. In the event of purchase by the City upon revocation for cause, cancellation of the franchise or if the franchise is voided, the purchase price shall be an “equitable price” as that term is used in Section 627(b) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 547(b).

[Prior code § 27.37]


27.390 Rights of Individuals Protected.

(1) Discriminatory Practices Prohibited.

(a) A franchisee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers or residents of the City on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or age.

(b) A franchisee shall not discriminate among persons or take any retaliatory action against a person because of that person’s exercise of any right it may have under Federal, State, or local law, nor may the franchisee require a person to waive such rights as a condition of taking service.

(c) A franchisee shall not deny access or levy different rates and charges on any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.

(d) Except to the extent the City may not enforce such a requirement, a franchisee is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the City; and a franchisee may offer discounts for the elderly, the handicapped, or the economically disadvantaged, and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under Federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee shall comply at all times with all applicable Federal, State, and City laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination.

(2) Equal Employment Opportunity. A franchisee shall not refuse to employ, discharge from employment, or discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or age. A franchisee shall comply with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations governing equal employment opportunities.

(3) Subscriber Privacy.

(a) A franchisee shall at all times protect the privacy of all subscribers pursuant to the provisions of Section 631 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 551. A franchisee shall not condition subscriber service on the subscriber’s grant of permission to disclose information which, pursuant to Federal or State law, cannot be disclosed without the subscriber’s explicit consent.

(b) Neither a franchisee nor its agents or employees shall, without the prior and specific written authorization of the subscriber involved, sell or otherwise make available for commercial purposes the names, addresses, or telephone numbers of any subscriber or subscribers, or any information that identifies the individual viewing habits of any subscriber or subscribers.

27.410 Miscellaneous Provisions.

(1) Compliance with Laws. A franchisee shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations as they become effective, unless otherwise stated.

(2) Force Majeure. A franchisee shall not be deemed in default with provisions of its franchise where performance was rendered impossible by war or riots, civil disturbances, floods, or other natural catastrophes beyond the franchisee’s control, and a franchise shall not be revoked or a franchisee penalized for such noncompliance; provided, that the franchisee takes immediate and diligent steps to bring itself back into compliance and to comply as soon as possible under the circumstances with its franchise without unduly endangering the health, safety, and integrity of the franchisee’s employees or property, or the health, safety, and integrity of the public, public rights-of-way, public property, or private property.

(3) Connections to System – Use of Antennas.

(a) Subscribers shall have the right to attach devices to a franchisee’s system to allow them to transmit signals or services for which they have paid to VCRs, receivers, and other terminals. Subscribers also shall have the right to use their own remote control devices, converters, and other similar equipment to receive signals for which they have paid, and a franchisee shall provide information to consumers which will allow them to adjust such devices so that they may be used with the franchisee’s system.

(b) A franchisee shall not, as a condition of providing service, require a subscriber or potential subscriber to remove any existing antenna, nor disconnect an antenna except at the express direction of the subscriber or potential subscriber, nor prohibit or discourage a subscriber from installing an antenna switch; provided, that such equipment and installations are consistent with applicable codes.

(2) The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the City.

(3) The City hereby designates the Director of Public Works as the administering authority to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter.

(4) The requirements of this chapter do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following:

(a) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (“WDNR”) administrative rules, permits or approvals including those authorized under Wis. Stat. §§ 281.16 and 283.33.

(b) Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the WDNR under Wis. Admin. Code NR 151.004.

[Ord. 08-522 § 1, 2008. Prior code § 28.01]


28.020 Findings of Fact.

The City finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land development and redevelopment activity has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Specifically, uncontrolled stormwater runoff can:

(1) Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increase stream bed scour, diminish groundwater recharge, and diminish stream base flow;

(2) Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, and recreational and water supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants;

(3) Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads;

(4) Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loads;

(5) Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities, and increasing major flood peaks and volumes;

(6) Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding; and

(7) Diminish the public enjoyment of natural resources.

[Prior code § 28.02]


28.030 Purpose and Intent.

(1) Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth long-term stormwater management requirements and criteria that will prevent and control water pollution and diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and aquatic life due to runoff of stormwater from development and redevelopment. Specific purposes are to:

(a) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions;

(b) Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth;

(c) Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property; and

(d) Assure that site plans pursuant to MMC 15.370(2) comply with the provisions of this chapter.

(2) Intent. It is the general intent of the City that this chapter achieve its purpose through:

(a) Regulating long-term, post-construction stormwater discharges from land development activities;

(b) Controlling the quantity, peak flow rates, and quality of stormwater discharges from land development activities; and

(c) Maintaining and enhancing the quality of life within the community. Towards this end, the City will manage stormwater to protect, maintain and enhance the natural environment; diversity of fish and wildlife; human life; property; and recreational use of waterways within the City.

(d) The City recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the State. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Wis. Stat. § 281.16 for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the City, it is the intent of this chapter that the approved plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.

The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in accordance with all applicable State and Federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed.

(c) This subsection (5) applies to post-construction sites located within a protective area, except those areas exempted pursuant to subsection (5)(f) of this section.

(d) The following shall be met:

1. Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area to the maximum extent practicable. The stormwater management plan shall contain a written site-specific explanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction.

2. Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area, and where no impervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70 percent or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fish habitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions. Nonvegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity flows occur.

Note to Users: It is recommended that seeding of nonaggressive vegetative cover be used in the protective areas. Vegetation that is flood and drought tolerant and can provide long-term bank stability because of an extensive root system is preferable. Vegetative cover can be measured using the line transect method described in the University of Wisconsin Extension publication number A3533, titled “Estimating Residue Using the Line Transect Method.”

3. Best management practices such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins that are designed to control pollutants from nonpoint sources may be located in the protective area.

Note to Users: Other regulations, such as Wis. Stat. Ch. 30 and Wis. Admin. Code NR 103, NR 115, NR 116 and NR 117, and their associated review and approval process, may apply in the protective area.

(e) A protective area established or created after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall not be eliminated or reduced, except as allowed in subsection (5)(f)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section.

(f) Exemptions. The following areas are not required to meet the protective area requirements of this subsection (5):

1. Redevelopment and routine maintenance areas provided the minimum requirements within this subsection (5) are satisfied.

2. Structures that cross or access surface waters such as boat landings, bridges and culverts.

3. Structures constructed in accordance with Wis. Stat. § 59.692(1v).

4. Post-construction sites from which runoff does not enter the surface water, except to the extent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability.

Note to Users: A vegetated protective area to filter runoff pollutants from post-construction sites described in subsection (5)(d) of this section is not necessary since runoff is not entering the surface water at that location. Other practices necessary to meet the requirements of this section, such as a swale or basin, will need to be designed and implemented to reduce runoff pollutants before the runoff enters a surface water of the State.

(6) Exceptions. The Director of Public Works may waive the minimum requirements for on-site stormwater management practices established in subsections (2) and (3) of this section upon written request of the applicant, in which a site-specific explanation as to why that level of reduction is not attained and the total solids load shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable; and provided, that at least one of the following conditions applies:

(a) Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the Director of Public Works.

(b) Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. This requires that a off-site facility is in place, is fully functional, and is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices meeting the requirements of this chapter, and has a legally obligated applicant responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice.

(c) The Director of Public Works finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to site restrictions. The Director of Public Works shall not use financial hardship as the sole criterion in determining feasibility.

(7) Fee in Lieu of On-Site Stormwater Management Practices. Where the Director of Public Works waives all or part of the minimum on-site stormwater management requirements under subsection (3)(c) of this section, or, where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided by the City downstream of the proposed development, as provided for under subsection (3)(b) of this section, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee, or alternative consideration, in an amount determined by resolution of the Common Council. In setting the fee for land development projects, the City shall consider an equitable distribution of the cost of land, engineering design, construction, and maintenance. The minimum fee shall be as determined by the Common Council through resolution. Partial detention will be credited towards the fee, if approved by the Director of Public Works.

[Ord. 08-523 § 6, 2008. Prior code § 29.05]


29.060 Performance Standards.

(1) Responsible Party. The responsible party shall implement an erosion and sediment control plan, developed in accordance with MMC 29.080, that incorporates the requirements of this section.

(2) Plan. A written erosion and sediment control plan shall be developed in accordance with MMC 29.080 and implemented for each construction site.

(3) Requirements. The erosion and sediment control plan shall meet the following minimum requirements to the maximum extent practicable:

(a) BMPs shall be designed, installed and maintained to control total suspended solids carried in runoff from the construction site as follows.

1. For construction sites with one acre or greater of land disturbing construction activity, reduce the total suspended solids load by 80 percent, on an average annual basis, as compared with no sediment or erosion controls until the construction site has undergone final stabilization. No person shall be required to exceed an 80 percent sediment reduction to meet the requirements of this paragraph. Erosion and sediment control BMPs may be used alone or in combination to meet the requirements of this subsection. Credit toward meeting the sediment reduction shall be given for limiting the duration or area, or both, of land disturbing construction activity, or other appropriate mechanism.

2. For construction sites with less than one acre of land disturbing construction activity, reduce the total suspended solids load using BMPs from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Technical Standards. These sites are not required to satisfy a numeric performance standard.

3. Soil loss prediction tools that estimate the sediment load leaving the construction site under varying land and management conditions, or methodology identified in subchapter V of Wis. Admin. Code NR 151, may be used to calculate sediment reduction.

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (3)(a) of this section, if BMPs cannot be designed and implemented to reduce the sediment load by 80 percent, on an average annual basis, the plan shall include a written and site-specific explanation as to why the 80 percent reduction goal is not attainable and the sediment load shall be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.

(c) Where appropriate, the plan shall include sediment controls to do all of the following to the maximum extent practicable:

1. Prevent tracking of sediment from the construction site onto roads and other paved surfaces. Each site shall have a tracking pad installed in accordance with the City’s standard specifications. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed before the end of each workday. Flushing may not be used unless approved by the Director of Public Works.

2. Prevent the discharge of sediment as part of site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins or other appropriate controls for the highest dewatering pumping rate. Dewatering must also comply with WDNR rules. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels.

3. Protect the separate storm drain inlet structure from receiving sediment.

(d) The use, storage and disposal of building materials, debris, garbage, chemicals, cement, concrete truck washout, litter, sanitary waste, toxic materials, hazardous materials, cleaning wastes, and other compounds and materials used on the construction site shall be managed during the construction period, to prevent their entrance into storm sewers and waters of the State. However, projects that require the placement of these materials in waters of the State, such as constructing bridge footings or BMP installations, are not prohibited by this subsection provided they have appropriate permits.

(e) Site Erosion Control. The following criteria apply only to land development or land disturbing construction activities that result in runoff leaving the site:

1. Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall be protected as described below in subsection (3)(e)(3)(C) of this section. Sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater than 10,000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas, unless shown to have resultant runoff velocities of less than one-half foot per second across the disturbed area for the set of one-year design storms. Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels.

2. All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time. Existing vegetation shall be maintained as long as possible.

3. Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by meeting either subsections (3)(e)(3)(A) and (B) or (A) and (C) of this section and WDNR Technical Standards, whichever is more restrictive.

A. All disturbed ground left inactive for 14 or more days shall be stabilized by mulching, temporary or permanent seeding, sodding, covering with tarps, or equivalent BMPs. Seeding and sodding may only be used from April 1st to October 15th of any year. If temporary seeding is used, a permanent cover shall also be required as part of the final site stabilization.

B. For sites with 10 or more acres disturbed at one time, or if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more sedimentation basins shall be constructed. Sedimentation basins shall be designed, constructed and maintained per WDNR Technical Standards. At a minimum each sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least one percent of the area draining to the basin and at least three feet of depth. Sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of three feet. The basin shall be designed to trap sediment greater than 15 microns in size, based on the set of one-year design storms having duration from one-half to 24 hours. The basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the receiving water.

C. For sites with less than 10 acres disturbed at one time, filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent BMPs shall be placed along all sideslope and downslope sides of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes through the site, filter fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel.

D. Runoff from sites or slopes of 12 percent or more may require additional or different control methods which are not listed in this subsection (3)(e)(3).

(f) Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than 10 cubic yards of material should not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel. If remaining for 15 days or more, the piles shall be stabilized by mulching, vegetative cover, tarps, or other means. Erosion from piles which will be in existence for less than 14 days shall be controlled by placing straw bales or filter fence barriers around the pile. In-street utility repair or construction, soil or dirt storage piles located closer than 25 feet of a roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative control. The storm drain inlets must be protected with straw bale or other appropriate filtering barriers.

(4) Location. The BMPs used to comply with this section shall be located prior to runoff entering waters of the State or regional stormwater treatment facilities.

(5) Alternate Requirements. The administering authority may establish requirements more stringent than those set forth in this section if the administering authority determines that an added level of protection is needed for sensitive resources.

[Ord. 16-741 § 19, 2016; Ord. 08-625 § 1, 2008. Prior code § 30.01]


30.020 Findings of Fact.

The City of Manitowoc finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land development activity has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Specifically, uncontrolled runoff can:

(1) Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, and diminishing stream base flows.

(2) Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, and recreational and water supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants.

(3) Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads.

(4) Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loads.

(5) Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities.

(6) Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes.

(7) Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.

(8) Diminish the public enjoyment of natural resources.

[Ord. 08-625 § 1, 2008. Prior code § 30.02]


30.030 Purpose and Intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Manitowoc through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) to the maximum extent practicable as required by Federal and State law.

(1) Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.

In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the Department of Public Works is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation. The Department of Public Works is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in MMC 30.180.

(2) Warning Notice. When the Department of Public Works finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the Department of Public Works may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the Department of Public Works to take action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice.

(3) Notice of Violation. Whenever the Department of Public Works finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the Department of Public Works may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. The notice of violation shall contain:

(a) The name and address of the alleged violator;

(b) The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;

(c) A statement specifying the nature of the violation;

(d) A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action;

(a) Emergency Cease and Desist Orders. When the Department of Public Works finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4, waters of the State or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the Department of Public Works may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:

1. Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and

2. Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the Department of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4, waters of the State or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility’s water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The Department of Public Works may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department of Public Works that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a preliminary action plan within not more than three days which addresses in some detail what action is intended to be taken, a detailed written statement and action plan, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Department of Public Works within 10 days of receipt of the prerequisite for taking any other action against the violator.

(b) Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The Department of Public Works may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4, waters of the State, or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Department of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4, waters of the State, or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.

(c) Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Department of Public Works will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Department of Public Works for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the Department of Public Works.

(5) Prosecution and Penalties. Any person that has violated or continues to violate this chapter shall be liable to prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within the set time period specified by the Department of Public Works, after the Department of Public Works has taken one or more of the actions described above, the Department of Public Works may impose a penalty not to exceed $1,000 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation.
