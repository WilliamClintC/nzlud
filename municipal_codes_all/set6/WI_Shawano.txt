Findings.
The City Council of the City of Shawano has determined that herbal preparationspowdered or sprayed with a chemical synthetic cannabinoid may be available for salewithin the City of Shawano that claim to produce intoxicating effects similar to THC ormarijuana; and
While the substances are not yet categorized as illegal controlled substances underWisconsin or federal law, several other countries, states, and municipalities have alreadytaken action to prohibit these substances due to increased overdoses and other negativehealth concerns; and
While these synthetic cannabinoid substances are often marketed as benign and legalalternatives to marijuana, they are potentially dangerous to users as the substances cancreate potency from three up to 100 times greater than marijuana, produce severeadverse health conditions such as hallucinations, paranoia, seizures, and vomiting basedon reported emergency room experiences in areas of the country where use is moreprevalent, and further that long-term health effects of use of these substances are not yetknown.
It has been determined that the effects of these substances are a health, safety, andwelfare concern to the citizens of the City of Shawano.

Findings and intent.
Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexualoffenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat tothe public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and torepeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have manymore victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of theircrimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, whileincalculable, clearly exorbitant.
It is the intent of this subsection not to impose a criminal penalty, but rather to serve theCity's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfareof the citizens of the City by creating areas around locations where children regularlycongregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexualpredators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

Review and approval. There are three categories of review in this district: renovation review,design review, and project review. These categories and procedural requirements for reviewand approval are described fully in §
10-175
.
Design theme. The design theme for the Downtown Mixed Use District is based on itshistorical, pedestrian-oriented development pattern that incorporates retail, residential, andinstitutional uses. Building orientation and character includes minimum setbacks at the edgeof the sidewalk, multistory structures, use of alleys for access, and on-street or other off-siteparking. The design theme is characterized by a variety of architectural styles popular at thetime, including Italianate, Romanesque, and Neoclassical, in a two-story format with office,storage, or residential located over commercial. The facades of these buildings have atraditional main street storefront appearance, are relatively small in scale, have street yardand side yard setbacks of zero feet, have prominent horizontal and vertical patterns formedby regularly spaced window and door openings, detailed cornice designs, rich detailing inmasonry coursing, window detailing and ornamentation, and are predominately of brick,stone, or wood. See Figure 10-37a. Exterior building materials are of high quality. Exteriorappurtenances are minimal. Exterior colors are harmonious, simple, and muted. Exteriorsignage blends, rather than contrasts, with buildings in terms of coloring (complementary tobuilding), location (on-building), size (small), and number (few).

It is explicitly not the intent of this subsection to suppress free expression byunreasonably limiting alternative avenues of communication, but rather to balance the need toprotect free expression opportunities with the need to implement the City's ComprehensivePlan and protect the character and integrity of its commercial and residential neighborhoods.]

Front yard setback adjustment.
In the SR-2, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, TR-6, MR-10, MR-20, MH-8, NMU, CMU, and UMU Districts,a front yard setback may be reduced to the mean of the setbacks of the immediately adjoininglots that are on both sides of the subject lot. The following rules apply in calculating the meansetback (see Figure 10-72):
Only the setbacks on five or fewer adjoining lots, are contiguous to each other in eitherdirection of the subject lot, and are on the same side of the street as each other may beused.
Where a lot is vacant, the minimum setback of the zoning district will be applied to thevacant lot and factored into the averaging calculation.
Outliers shall be excluded in calculating the mean setback as determined by the ZoningAdministrator.
In residential districts, the depth of the minimum front yard and street side yard on any lotshall be at least 15 feet and the minimum setback for an attached or detached garagefacing the front yard, or the street side yard, shall be at least 20.
In order to preserve and maintain the character of established neighborhoods that are typifiedby front yard setbacks substantially in excess of the minimum required front yard setback,blocks with an average street side (front yard) setback more than five feet over the minimumrequired front yard setback shall be increased to the average of the adjoining same type ofprincipal structures on said block or street.

A use now regulated as a conditional use which was approved as a legal land use, eitherpermitted by right or as a conditional use, prior to the effective date of this chapter, shall beconsidered a legal, conforming land use so long as any previously approved conditions of useand site plan are followed. Any modification of the previously approved conditions of use orsite plan shall require application and City consideration as a conditional use under §
10-171
.
Any prior legal use made nonconforming by this chapter, or by an amendment to it, may begranted legal conforming status and allowed to be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, orsubstituted by the issuance of a conditional use permit, subject to the standards andprocedures prescribed by §
10-171
.
Modification of a nonconforming use.
Except as permitted in Subsection (3)(b), below, or Subsection (2)(c), above, anonconforming use shall not be expanded, enlarged, extended, or reconstructed, unless theuse is changed to a use permitted in the district in which the use is located.
Substitution of new equipment shall be permitted.
Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. When any nonconforming use of any land, building, orstructure is discontinued for a period of 12 consecutive months, or is changed into a conforminguse, any future use of said land, building, or structure shall be in complete conformity with theprovisions of this chapter.
Maintenance and repair of a nonconforming use.
The ordinary maintenance and repair of a nonconforming use is permitted, includingnecessary repairs and incidental alterations which do not exacerbate the adverse impacts ofthe nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of this chapter.

10-176
.
This subsection is intended to eliminate the continued classification and/or the creation ofstructures as nonconforming subject to the requirements of this chapter. This provisionaddresses two different situations.
Any structure erected prior to the adoption of zoning that does not meet some or all of thebulk or intensity requirements of this chapter.
In some instances, this chapter establishes new bulk or intensity requirements thatexisting legal structures under the previous Zoning Ordinance do not meet.
This section therefore ensures that owners of such structures legally established prior to theeffective date of this chapter do not encounter difficulty because the structures wouldotherwise be considered nonconforming.
The following shall apply to all structures that do not meet bulk and other requirements of thischapter.
Ordinary maintenance. Ordinary maintenance repairs, including repairs reasonably necessaryto prevent the deterioration of a structure, and remodeling of a structure are permitted, as wellas necessary nonstructural repairs and alterations which do not extend, enlarge, or intensifythe structure. Ordinary maintenance repairs and remodeling include internal and externalpainting, decorating, paneling, the addition of acoustical ceilings, the installation of heating,electricity, plumbing (including fixtures) or insulation, and the replacement of doors, windows,roof surfacing, and other nonstructural components.

After the effective date of this chapter, additional site development that would result in theenlargement, expansion, or extension of uses, structures or other development perSubsection (1)(c)1 through 8, below, will not be allowed to occur without bringing suchadditional site development into full compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or to theextent practical without removal of lawful structures.
This subsection is intended to prevent the creation of nonconforming sites related to thebuilding and site design requirements of this chapter. These building and site designcomponents may include one or more of the following:
Bulk, intensity, and density requirements.
Exterior building materials requirements.
Exterior building design requirements.
Parking, loading, access drive and other paved area design requirements.
Landscaping requirements.
Buffer yard requirements.

This subsection ensures that sites approved prior to the effective date of this chapter do notencounter difficulty because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming.
All new buildings, structures, and parking areas, including additions, shall comply with all sitedesign requirements of this chapter, including the components of Subsection (1)(c)1 through 8,above, for the new portion of the development.
On lots where the site configuration and undeveloped area are sufficient to comply with site designrequirements, no enlargement, expansion, or extension of a use, structure, or paving shall bepermitted if it makes compliance with the site design requirements of this chapter, includingSubsection (1)(c)1 through 8, above, impossible, even if said enlargement, expansion, orextension of the use, structure, or paving would otherwise be permissible.
On lots where the configuration and undeveloped area of the nonconforming site provideinsufficient space to bring the site into full compliance with all site requirements but neverthelessprovides space to reduce the degree of one or more nonconformities, the Plan Commission shallmake a determination as to the manner and degree to which each site nonconformity shall bebrought into conformance specifically to improve public safety and/or reduce public nuisances.
Enlargements, expansions, or extensions that would result in creation of one or morenonconformities, render a nonconforming site incapable of being brought into full or greatercompliance with nonconforming site requirements, or increase the degree of existingnonconformities with the site development standards of this chapter shall not be permitted, unlessa variance is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals under §

§ 10-97. (WP-O) Woodlands Protection Overlay Zoning District.
Purpose. This district is intended to set forth special requirements for the protection of woodlandsfrom the adverse effects of development. Woodlands provide a wide variety of environmentalfunctions. These include atmospheric benefits, such as removing airborne pollutants, carbondioxide uptake, oxygen production, and evapotranspiration returns. Water quality benefits includesubstantial nutrient uptake rate (particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus) and surface runoffreduction in terms of both volumes and velocities. Woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats andfood sources. Woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers, greatly reducing runoff-related soil erosion.Woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities, which further reduces soil erosion. Finally, underproper management techniques, woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources.
Definition. Woodlands are defined as areas of trees in which combined canopies cover a minimumof 80% of an area of one acre of more, as shown on air photos for the City of Shawano and itsenvirons.
Determination of boundaries. General woodland boundaries are depicted on the Official ZoningMap. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property containing a woodland depictedon the Official Zoning Map, the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per therequirements of §
10-174
. This analysis shall depict the location of all woodland areas on thesubject property as described in Subsection
(2)
above.
Requirements. Woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permittedper the requirements of Subsections
(5)
and
(6)
, below.
Principal uses permitted by right. Refer to Article

NOTES:
"Prohibited species" may not be included as part of any landscaping plan that is subject to Cityreview per §
10-132
. The purpose of this provision is to limit the planting of species that areinvasive, have invasive tendencies, or that may perpetuate or spread disease.
"Species to use sparingly" may be used as part of an overall landscaping plan, but only if thenumber of individual plants does not constitute more than one plant per 20 total plants within thesame plant classification. For example, if a landscaping plan includes a total of 20 tall deciduoustrees, no more than one of those 20 trees may be classified as a "species to use sparingly." Thepurpose of this provision is to encourage plant species diversity throughout the City.
§ 10-135. Standards for rain gardens and bioswales.
Definition.
Rain gardens and bioswales can serve both as landscaping and stormwater managementfeatures on a building site, where appropriately designed and sited. A rain garden is ashallow, depressed garden that is designed and positioned on a site to capture stormwaterrunoff and allow for the infiltration of water back into the ground. Rain garden plants arecarefully chosen for their ability to withstand moisture extremes and potentially highconcentrations of nutrients and sediments that are often found in stormwater runoff. A welldesigned and maintained rain garden serves as an attractive component of an overalllandscaping plan for a development site.
A bioswale is a linear, vegetative stormwater runoff conveyance system that is designed tostore and infiltrate water from small storm events back into the ground and direct water fromheavy rain events to appropriate storm sewer inlets or other management facilities. The flowof water being conveyed through a bioswale is slowed down, allowing for municipal stormsystems to more effectively manage heavier rain events and help reduce the risk of floodingon or off-site. Water being infiltrated or conveyed via a bioswale is also filtered by thevegetation within it, generally improving both groundwater and surface water quality.
Requirements.
The installation of a rain garden or bioswale may contribute to the overall stormwatermanagement plan for a development site and count toward meeting the City's landscapingguidelines. Rain gardens may count for 20 points for every 20 square feet forf yard area,building foundation, and/or paved area requirements, provided that the following requirementsare met.
Detailed plans shall be provided that show all proposed dimensions of the rain garden orbioswale, including length, width, depth, and slope of depression; location of the rain gardenor bioswale on the lot relative to hard-surfaced areas, downspouts, and site topography;characteristics of the soil underlying the rain garden or bioswale; description of planting

media; the species, number, and size at time of installation of all vegetation proposed for therain garden or bioswale; and information on any other materials (e.g., rocks) that will be usedto line the rain garden or bioswale.
Installation shall not be proposed for any of the following areas of a site:
Areas where there is known soil contamination unless the rain garden or bioswale isproposed to be constructed with an underdrain;
Areas where the characteristics of the soil would not allow for the proper infiltration ofwater into the ground; or
Areas where there are expected to be high levels of foot traffic.
The owner of the site shall demonstrate that the rain garden or bioswale shall be properlymaintained; kept free of trash, weeds, debris, and dead or dying plants; any pipes associatedwith the rain garden or bioswale will be inspected on an annual basis and kept free of debris;and by the beginning of every spring dead plant materials will be cut back or removed.
Bioswales and rain gardens shall be generously (and appropriately) vegetated to qualify forlandscaping points. Bioswales and rain gardens (or portions thereof) that are lined with turfand/or rocks but do not include other vegetation will not count toward meeting landscapingpoint requirements.
Rain gardens and bioswales may serve as a component of an overall stormwatermanagement plan for a site only if detailed plans, calculations, and specifications aresubmitted. Detailed plans shall include the location and description of all other stormwatermanagement facilities serving the site, particularly those to which any bioswale will bedirected.
§ 10-136. Installation requirements.
Installation. Any and all landscaping and buffer yard material required by the provisions of thischapter shall be installed on the subject property, in accordance with the approved site plan within365 days of the issuance of an occupancy permit for any building on the subject property, unless aconditional use is approved to allow for greater than 365 days.

The "average ground level" is defined as the average elevation of the ground upon which thesign supports are placed, except when the sign supports rest upon a berm or other areaelevated above the surrounding ground. In such cases, the average elevation of the base ofsuch berm or other area shall be considered as the ground level.
Minimum ground clearance. All pylon signs, projecting, marquee, and canopy/awning signs shallhave a minimum clearance of eight feet from grade to the bottom of the sign and shall not projectinto any vehicle circulation area, beyond any public street curbline, or beyond any public streetpavement edge if no curb is present.
Measurement of sign area: The measurement of sign area is based on the arrangement of signcopy and sign background:
For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy which are attached to a backgroundsurface with one or more neutral surface colors, sign area shall be measured as the sum ofthe smallest rectangle enclosing each letter or related copy. (See Example 1 in Figure 10-145b
[1]
.)
Editor's Note: Figure 10-145b is included at the end of §
10-145
.
For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy which are attached to a backgroundsurface with one or more nonneutral background colors, sign area shall be measured as thesum of the smallest rectangles and right triangles enclosing the entire sign message and anyand all nonneutral background color areas. (See Example 2 in Figure 10-145b.)
For signs comprised of letters and related copy surrounded by one or more sign backgroundcolors on a single panel, sign area shall be measured as the smallest single rectangleenclosing the entire sign message and any and all background color areas. (See Example 3in Figure 10-145b.)
For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy surrounded by one or more signbackground colors on individual panels, sign area shall be measured as the smallest singlerectangle enclosing the entire sign message and any and all background color areas. (SeeExample 4 in Figure 10-145b.)
For signs comprised of one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters ofobjects, sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as theirmaximum projection upon a vertical plane.
In the case of a freestanding sign (including three-dimensional objects), sign area shallinclude the total sign areas per Subsection (4)(a) through (d) above, that can be viewed fromany single vantage point (i.e., for a typical freestanding sign which faces two directions, onlyone face of the sign shall comprise the sign area). Sign area shall not include any elements ofthe sign structure designed solely for support of the sign structure and located below or to theside of the sign message. Examples of parts of a freestanding sign structure which areexempt from the sign area include the sign base and the supporting columns, posts, or poles.
Flexibility: The City shall allow the following flexibility for signage. Flexibility for either height orarea shall be permitted, but not both.
Height of freestanding sign. A sign may exceed the height requirements in Figure 10-144b iffor every additional foot of height, the setback increases one foot. The maximum height of thesign shall in no case exceed the maximum wall height of the primary structure.
Area of freestanding sign. A sign may exceed the area requirements in Figure 10-144b if forevery additional square foot of area, the setback increases one foot. The maximum area ofthe freestanding sign shall in no case exceed 150% of the permitted area.

Unless extended as a condition of approval, thestart of construction of any and all conditional uses shall be initiated within 365 days of theirapproval by the Common Council and shall be operational within 730 days of said approval.Failure to initiate development within this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of theconditional use. For the purposes of this section, "operational" shall be defined as the granting of acertificate of occupancy for the conditional use. Prior to such a revocation, the applicant mayrequest an extension of this period. Said request shall require formal approval by the CommonCouncil and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification (as determined by theCommon Council). However, as a condition of approval, the 365- and/or 730-day time limits maybe extended for any specific period, including no time limit, to accommodate phased or multistagedevelopment.

The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate thatthe subject conditional use was operational during this period.
Change of ownership. All requirements of the approved conditional use shall be continuedregardless of ownership of the subject property; however, submittal of a plan of operation may berequired prior to the change in ownership.
Modification, alteration, or expansion. Modification, alteration, or expansion of any conditional usewithout approval by the Common Council, shall be considered in violation of this chapter and shallbe grounds for revocation of said conditional use approval per Subsection
(10)

The variance will not be contrary to the public interest.
Substantial justice will be done by granting the variance.
The variance is needed so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed.
Due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinancewill result in unnecessary hardship.
The variance will not allow any alteration of an historic structure, including its use, whichwould preclude its continued designation as an historic structure.
The Zoning Board of Appeals may request further information and/or additional reports fromthe Zoning Administrator and/or the applicant. The Zoning Board of Appeals may take finalaction on said request for approval of the requested variance at time of its initial meeting, orsaid proceedings may be continued from time-to-time for further consideration.
If the Zoning Board of Appeals fails to make a determination within 30 days after said publichearing, then the request for the variance shall be considered denied.
Effect of denial. No application for a variance which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shallbe resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on groundsof new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning Administrator.
Limited effect of a variance. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals has granted a variance, suchapproval shall neither change the use classification of the building or premises, nor give it anystatus as a nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the variance. Granting ofa variance shall be considered as unique to the variance granted, and shall not be construed asprecedent for any other proposed variance.
Stay of proceedings. An application for a variance shall stay all legal proceedings furtheringenforcement of any provisions of this chapter from which the applicant is requesting a variance,unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals after the request for thevariance has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in hisopinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayedotherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals, or bya court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator, and on due cause shown.State Law Reference: § 62.23(7)(e)5, Wis.

Application. A zoning interpretation application contains all of the following:
Clear indication of the text of this chapter for which the interpretation is requested and thespecific questions the applicant has regarding said text.
If the requested interpretation relates to the application of this chapter to a specific property,the additional following information shall be required (Digital files should be submitted ratherthan paper copies whenever possible.):
A map of the subject property depicting:

How is the subject land use (in general) in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives,policies and standards of the City's Comprehensive Plan, this chapter, and any otherplan, program, or ordinance adopted, or under consideration pursuant to official notice bythe City?
How is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies andstandards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought?
Review by Zoning Administrator.
The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills therequirements of this chapter. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the ZoningAdministrator shall notify the applicant and inform him or her of all deficiencies.
The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on thewritten justification for the proposed interpretation provided in the application to determinewhether the requested variance is in harmony with the recommendations of City'sComprehensive Plan.
The Zoning Administrator shall forward a report to the applicant indicating the interpretation ofthe Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposal may be inconflict with the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Administrator shall notethis determination in the report.
Standards for review. This chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with thepurposes intended by the Common Council as noted in this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan.The intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this chapter is to protect both individualproperty owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed,modified, or existing land use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceedas follows:
Articulate certain public purpose(s) underlying the standard(s) for which an interpretation isrequired. (Rationale: Before any zoning interpretation is made, there must be an explicitdiscussion of certain purpose(s) for which the regulation was initially imposed. Each zoningregulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and thegeneral public. Each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiablepotential negative impact. A sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured withoutcareful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed. It is understood thatthere may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitlyarticulated.)
Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility in designand prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public. There is acritical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of designfreedom to achieve a permitted land use, and an interpretation which permits a new or notpreviously permitted use, or which allows a use to be enlarged, or have its intensity increasedbeyond the degree specified in the chapter. Design freedom is to be encouraged while alowering of the standards of this chapter is to be prohibited.
Determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rightsof the landowner and all others who will be affected by that person's land use proposal. If aninterpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the oneexpressly stated or permitted, and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protectionto any affected party (i.e., the abutting landowners, the public at large, and/or a futureproperty owner or renter), such an interpretation may be appropriately made. Anyinterpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to thebenefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter. Similarly, any interpretation whichwould either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the

regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapter.Any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyondthat already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this chapter has the powerto impose additional restrictions or requirements.
This chapter has been carefully designed by the Common Council to combine maximumachievement of public goals, and the protection of abutting property owners while providingflexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goalsand objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Great care has been taken to balance the rights ofcompeting groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of useoptions. Persons interpreting this chapter should not substitute their own judgments for thelegislative acts of the Common Council.
In addition to the applicant's response to the questions required by Subsection (5)(d), above,the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land useinterpretation matters:
No interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previouslyconsidered and rejected by the Common Council on an application for an amendment tothe Zoning Ordinance, the Official Zoning Map, or a previously applied for appeal from arequested interpretation.
No interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right, a special use,or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in thezoning district of the subject property. (See Article
II
.)
No interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presentedwhich demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicableto development in the subject property's zoning district. (See Article
II
.)
No interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use issubstantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar tosuch other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district, or permitted in a moreintensive district in the same zoning district category. (See Article
II
.)
If the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional usein the subject property's district than to a use permitted by right, then an interpretationpermitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuantto §
10-171
.
Effect of a favorable land use interpretation. No interpretation finding a particular land use to bepermitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either theestablishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or movingof any building or structure. A favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation, filing, andprocessing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this chapter.These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, required site plans, special usepermits, conditional uses, and certificates of occupancy.
Limitations on favorable land use interpretation.
No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in aspecified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date ofissuance of the interpretation, unless a building permit is issued and development has begunwithin that period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a certificate ofoccupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period.
An interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in aspecified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular
