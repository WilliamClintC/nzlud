EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the City Code into component codes,
chapters, articles and sections are based on an adaption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters,  and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the City Code. 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the City Code. It indicates whether a given ordinance was
consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections.
Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to
material  contained within a given article.

the total of estimated income.

records and shall be made available to the public at suitable places in the
City.
SECTION 5.09. AMENDMENTS AFTER ADOPTION.
   (a)    Supplemental Appropriations.  If during the fiscal year the Manager
certifies that there are available for appropriation revenues in excess of
those estimated in the budget, the Council by ordinance may make supplemental
appropriations for the year up to the amount of such excess.
   (b)    Emergency Appropriations.  To meet a public emergency affecting life,
health, property or the public peace, the Council may make emergency
appropriations. Such appropriations may be made by emergency ordinance in
accordance with the provisions of Section
2.14. To the extent that there are no available unappropriated revenues to meet
such appropriations, the Council may by such emergency ordinance authorize the
issuance of emergency notes, which may be renewed from time to time, but the
emergency notes and renewals of any fiscal year shall be paid not later than
the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding that in which the emergency
appropriation was made.
   (c)    Reduction of Appropriations.  If at any time during the fiscal year
it appears probable to the Manager that the revenues available will be
insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he shall report to the Council
without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial
action taken by him and his recommendations as to any other steps to be taken.
The Council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to
prevent or minimize any deficit, and for that purpose it may by ordinance
reduce one or more appropriations.
   (d)    Transfer of Appropriations.  At any time during the fiscal year, the
Manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance
among programs within a department, office or agency and, upon written request
by the Manager, the Council may by ordinance transfer part or all of any
unencumbered appropriation balance from one department, office or agency to
another.
   (e)    Limitations; Effective Date.  No appropriation for debt service may
be reduced or transferred, and no appropriation may be reduced below any amount
required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of the
unencumbered balance thereof. The supplemental and emergency appropriations and
reduction or transfer of appropriations authorized by this section may be made
effective immediately upon adoption.
SECTION 5.10. LAPSE OF APPROPRIATIONS.
   Every appropriation, except an appropriation for a capital expenditure,
shall lapse at the close of the fiscal year to the extent that it has not been
expended or encumbered. An appropriation for a capital expenditure shall
continue in force until the purpose for which it was made has been accomplished
or abandoned; the purpose of any such appropriation shall be deemed abandoned
if three years pass without any disbursement from or encumbrance of the
appropriation.
SECTION 5.11. ADMINISTRATION OF BUDGET.
   (a)    Work Programs and Allotments.  At such time as the Manager shall
specify, each department, office or agency shall submit work programs for the
ensuing fiscal year showing the requested allotments of its appropriation by
periods within the year. The Manager shall review and authorize such allotments
with or without revision as early as possible in the fiscal year. He may revise
such allotments during the year if he deems it desirable and shall revise them
to accord with any supplemental, emergency, reduced or transferred
appropriations made pursuant to Section
5.09. 
   (b)    Payments and Obligations Prohibited.  No payment shall be made or
obligation incurred against any allotment or appropriation except in accordance
with appropriations duly made, and unless the Manager or his designee first
certifies that there is a sufficient unencumbered balance in such allotment or
appropriation and that sufficient funds therefrom are or will be available to
cover the claim or meet the obligation when it becomes due and payable. Any
authorization of payment or incurring of obligation in violation of the
provision of this Charter shall be void, and any payment so made illegal; such
action shall be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or
made such payment or incurred such obligation, and he shall also be liable to
the City for any amount so paid. However, except where prohibited by law,
nothing in this Charter shall be construed to prevent the making or authorizing
of payments or making of contracts for capital improvements to be financed
wholly or partly by the issuance of bonds or to prevent the making of any
contract or lease providing for payments beyond the end of the fiscal year,
provided that such action is made or approved by ordinance.

such names shall appear without party designation or symbol under a heading
reading: "Nominees for Councilmember" and also stating the ward in which the
nominee resides. If there are two or more nominees from the same ward, the

shall be made not later than 30 days after the commencement of each Council's
term of office.

Commission shall file with the City Clerk a report containing a recommended
plan and a map for adjustment of ward boundaries, or recommending that no
adjustment be made, all in accordance with the specifications set forth in
subsection (d).
   (d)    Specifications.  Except as otherwise provided in Section
10.05, the ward boundaries shall be adjusted from time to time in accordance
with the following specifications:
      (1)    Each ward shall be formed of contiguous territory, and its
boundary lines shall follow the precinct lines and the center lines of streets
wherever practicable.
      (2)    Each ward shall contain as nearly as practicable the same total
population, determined by the most recently published United States Census
Bureau American Community Survey five-year estimate and registered voter data;
or, if such publication is unavailable, by the last decennial census and
registered voter data.  This specification shall not be construed to require
the adjustment of precinct boundaries or to require the sacrifice of
compactness of wards for the sake of achieving equality of numbers of residents
among the seven wards of the City.  The report shall include a map and
description of the boundaries of each of the wards.
   (e)    Action on Report. At its next regular meeting following the date of
the filing of the report mentioned in subsection (c), or at an earlier special
meeting called to consider the report, the Council shall approve or disapprove
the same or postpone consideration of the report to a future date.  Council
shall approve or disapprove the report prior to its first regular meeting in
December.  If the report is disapproved, the Council shall state the reasons
therefor on the minutes of the Council meetings.  If the report is approved,
the Council shall introduce a proposed ordinance providing for the ward
boundaries in accordance with the specifications contained in the report at or
before its first regular meeting in December; provided that, if the report
recommends no changes, Council need not introduce an ordinance following its
approval.  The procedure for the enactment of the ordinance shall be the same
as for any ordinances provided for under Section
2.13 with the additional requirements of Section
2.13(b)(3).
   (f)    Enactment of Ordinances. If (1) the report of the Commission is
disapproved, or (2) if the Commission fails to file the report as and when
required by subsection (e), the Council shall introduce an ordinance adjusting
the ward boundaries consistent with specifications of subsection (d) at or
before its first regular meeting in December unless the Council shall, within
15 days after the filing of the report, or of the failure to file the report,
make a finding of fact, entered upon the minutes of the Council meetings, that
no ward boundary adjustments are necessary.  The procedure for the enactment of
such ordinance shall be the same as for any ordinances provided for under
Section
2.13 with the additional requirements of Section
2.13(b)(3).
   (g)    Effect of Enactment.  The new ward boundaries as of the date of the
enactment of an ordinance providing therefor shall supersede previous ward
boundaries for all the purposes of the next regular City election including
nomination, unless such ordinance is enacted after December 31 of the year
preceding the election.  The new ward boundaries shall supersede previous ward
boundaries for all purposes as of the date of which all Councilmembers elected
at that regular City election take office. 
   (h)    Terms of Members of the Commission.  The terms of office of the
members of the Commission shall expire at the same time as the expiration of
the terms of the Council which appointed them. A new Commission shall
thereafter be appointed  as provided by subsection (b).  (Amended 7-18-17.)

poll books by the Clerks. The Election Commissioners shall permit those
electors to vote who are present at the polling place prior to the hour
specified before closing of the polls: provided, that at the time they are in a
line awaiting their turn to vote within the voting room itself or if the line
extends outside the voting room itself, within that line, in that event, the
Election Commissioners shall immediately after the closing proclamation begin
with the last voter in line and together supply the voters within the line with
waiting voter permits which shall be prescribed by the Secretary of State. Each
voter shall sign his permit in the presence of the Commissioner who shall then
likewise affix their signature to the permit in the presence of the voter and
each other. After such voter in line has received and signed his permit and the
Election Commissioners have affixed their signatures thereto, the voting shall
resume. Each voter shall present his permit to one of the Poll Clerks so that
the signature thereon may be compared to their voter's signature when he signs
the poll book. Each permit so presented shall be attached to the page in the
poll book in which the voter affixed his signature. In no case shall any person
who arrives at the polling place after the closing be given a waiting voter
permit or be allowed to vote. After the final voter presents his waiting voter
permit and casts his ballot, no more ballots shall be cast or received.
(Ord. 10-21-80.)
105.24  DELIVERY OF BALLOTS TO VOTERS.
   On entering the election room the voter shall give his name and residence to
one of the Poll Clerks, who shall thereupon announce the same in a loud and
distinct tone of voice. If he is duly registered or has obtained a transfer as
provided by law, the Poll Clerk shall then deliver to him one, and only one,
ballot, and each Poll Clerk shall personally sign his name on the back of the
ballot before delivering it to the voter, and no Election Commissioner shall
deposit in the ballot box any ballot upon which the names of the Poll Clerks do
not appear.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-37.)
105.25  VOTING PROCEDURES.
   Any person offering to vote in an election shall be given a ballot by the
Poll Clerks. Such person shall sign his name in the space marked "Signature of
Voter" on the poll book prescribed. If such person is physically or otherwise
unable to sign his name, his mark shall be fixed by one of the Poll Clerks in
the presence of the other. The name of the Poll Clerk affixing the mark of such
person shall be indicated beneath the affixation. The Poll Clerks shall write
their names at the place designated on the back of the official ballot called
for and deliver it to the voter, who shall have but one ballot unless he shall
return the same spoiled; and if he shall return the same spoiled, the Clerks
shall deliver to him another ballot in the same manner as they delivered the
first one and they shall neatly mark the ballot "spoiled" and the same shall be
preserved and placed in a spoiled ballot envelope together with other spoiled
ballots to be delivered to the Board of Canvassers. The spoiled ballots shall
be destroyed along with the other ballots after the election results have been
proclaimed and certified as contained herein. On the receipt of the ballot, the
voter shall forthwith and without leaving the election room, retire alone to
one of the booths or compartments provided for their purpose and shall prepare
the ballot, using a ball point pen or other indelible marking device, observing
the following rules:
   (a)    Make a cross mark on the left and opposite the name of the candidate
for whom the voter desires to vote in the blank space provided for that purpose
on the ballot;
   (b)    If the voter desires to vote for a person whose name does not appear
on the ballot, he may substitute the name by writing it in the proper place and
make a cross mark in the blank space at the left of the name so written in.
   If the voter marks more names than there are persons to be elected, or, if
for any reason, it is impossible to determine the voter's choice, the ballot
shall not be counted. No ballot shall be rejected for any technical error which
does not make it impossible to determine the voter's choice.
   After preparing the ballot the voters shall fold the same so that the face
shall not be exposed and so that the names of the Poll Clerks thereon shall be
seen. The voter shall then announce his name and present his ballot to one of
the Commissioners who shall hand the same to the other Commissioner who shall
deposit it in the ballot box, if such ballot is the official one and is
properly signed. The Commissioner of Election may inspect every ballot before
it is deposited in the box to ascertain whether it is single but without
unfolding or rolling it so as to disclose its contents. The voter who has voted
shall immediately retire from the election room and beyond the sixty foot limit
thereof and shall not return except by permission of the Commissioners.
(Ord. 10-21-80.)
105.26  VOTING RECORD.
   In any election under this article it shall be the duty of a Poll Clerk in
the presence of the other Poll Clerk, to indicate by a check mark inserted in
the appropriate place on the registration record of each voter the fact that
such voter voted in the respective election. If a person is challenged at the
polls, such fact shall be indicated by the Poll Clerks on the registration
record together with the name of the challenger. The subsequent removal of the
challenge shall be recorded on the registration record by the County Clerk.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-39.)
105.27  DEFACED AND UNUSED BALLOTS.
   Any voter who spoils, defaces or mutilates the ballot delivered to him, on
returning the same to the Poll Clerks shall receive another in place thereof.
Every person who does not vote any ballot delivered to him shall, before
leaving the election room, return the ballot to the Poll Clerks. When a spoiled
or defaced ballot is returned, the Poll Clerk shall immediately note the fact
in the poll book. The spoiled ballot shall be preserved as required by the
provisions of this article.
(Ord. 10-21-80.)
105.28  ASSISTANCE TO VOTERS UNABLE TO WRITE.
   Any person whose registration record indicates his inability to write may
declare his choice of candidates to the Poll Clerks who, in the presence of the
voter and in the presence of each other, shall prepare the ballot for voting in
the manner provided in this article, and, on request, shall read to such voter
the name of the candidate on the ballot for whom he voted, or such voter may
require the Poll Clerks to indicate to him the relative position of the names
of  the candidates on the ballot, whereupon the voter shall retire to one of
the booths or compartments to prepare his ballot in the manner hereinafter
provided,  or may request the Poll Clerks to mark the ballot as he directs.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-41.)
105.29  NUMBER OF PERSONS IN VOTING BOOTH; TIME FOR VOTING; CONVERSATIONS IN
ELECTION ROOM.
   Not more than one person shall be permitted to occupy any voting booth or
compartment at one time; and no person shall remain in or occupy a booth or

conversation or communication with any person other than the Poll Clerks or
Commissioners of Election, while in the election room. 
(1967 Code Sec. 9-42.)
105.30  RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONS IN ELECTION ROOM.
   Not more than one voter for each compartment or booth at the precinct shall
be allowed in the election room at one time, and no person shall approach
nearer than five feet to any booth or compartment while the election is being
held, except the voters to prepare their ballots, or the Poll Clerks when
called on by a voter to assist in the preparation of his ballot, and no person,
other than election officers and voters engaged in receiving, preparing and
depositing their ballots, shall be permitted to be within five feet of any
ballot box, except by authority of the Board of Election Commissioners, and
then only for the purpose of keeping order and enforcing the law.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-43.)
105.31  PRESENCE OF PERSONS WITHIN SIXTY FEET OF ELECTION ROOM.
   No person, except the election officers and voters while going to the
election room to vote and returning therefrom, shall be or remain within sixty
feet of such room while the polls are open; but this section shall not apply to
persons living or carrying on business within that distance of the election
room,  while in the discharge of their legitimate business, or to persons whose
business requires them to pass and repass within sixty feet of such room. 
(1967 Code Sec. 9-44.)
105.32  CHALLENGED VOTERS; BOARD OF CANVASSERS.
   It shall be the duty of the Receiving Board jointly or separately to
challenge the right of any person, requesting a ballot, to vote in the
election, if such a person's registration record is not available at the time
of the election, or if the signature written by the person in the poll book
does not correspond with the signature reported to be his on the registration
record, or if the registration record of such person indicated any other legal
disqualification. Any person  so challenged shall nevertheless be permitted to
vote in the election. Such persons  shall, however, be given a ballot not
endorsed by the Poll Clerks. In lieu of such endorsement, the Poll Clerks shall
fill and sign an appropriate form indicating the challenge and the reason
thereof, and the names of the challengers. Such a form shall be securely
attached to the voter’s ballot and deposited together with the ballot in a
separate box or envelope marked "Challenged Ballots".
   At the time of canvassing, the Board of Canvassers shall determine the
validity of each of the challenged votes.
(Ord. 10-21-80.)
105.33  ILLEGAL VOTING; AFFIDAVIT.
   If at any time during the election any qualified voter shall make affidavit,
before a Commissioner of Election, that any person who has voted is an illegal
voter in such precinct, the person accused shall at once be arrested by any
police officer or other person designated by the Election Commissioners to make
the arrest, and by him delivered to the civil authorities. Any person desiring
to make such affidavit shall be admitted to the election room for that
purpose.  Immediately after the close of the election, the Commissioners of
Election shall  deliver such affidavit to the Judge of the Police Court of the
City, who shall proceed thereon as if the affidavit had been made before him.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-46.)
105.34  DISORDER AT POLLS.
   The Commissioners of Election shall preserve order at, and in the vicinity
of, the polls, and keep the way to the polls open and free from obstruction,
and may direct disorderly persons to be removed therefrom, and, if necessary
and proper, to be taken and held in custody until sunrise of the next day, or
for any shorter time, which may be done by any sheriff, police officer or other
persons designated by the Commissioners of Election. For such purpose no
warrant or authority in writing shall be necessary, and the City jail or other
place designated by the Commissioners of Election may be used as the place of
custody. Any person so arrested shall have an opportunity to vote, if he be
entitled to do so, before he shall be committed to jail, if he so desires and
shall be prepared to do so promptly.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-47.)
105.35  TIME OFF FOR VOTING.

person on the day on which an election shall be held in the City, shall on
written demand of such employee, be given some period of three hours or more if
necessary, between the opening and closing of the polls, on such day, for the
purpose of enabling such person to repair to the place of voting to cast his
vote and return; and he shall not be liable to any penalty and no deduction
from his usual salary or wages on account of such absence.
   Any company or corporation violating the provisions of this section shall be
subject to the penalty provided in Section
101.99. Any person who may have employees, entitled to vote, or any office
agent or manager of any company or corporation who violates the provisions of
this section by failure or refusal, on demand of any employee, to arrange time
for such employee, entitled to vote, to vote, or in any way prevents or
attempts to prevent any employee in the employ of such person from attending
any election, or from freely exercising his right of suffrage, at any election
at which he is entitled to vote, shall, in each instance, be subject to the
penalty provided in Section
101.99.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-48.)
105.36  COUNTING AND DESTRUCTION OF BALLOTS NOT VOTED.
    Immediately after closing the polls, the Commissioners of Election shall
ascertain the number of ballots destroyed during the election and count all
ballots remaining not voted, and record number of ballots on the tally sheets.
All such remaining ballots shall be preserved or destroyed along with the voted
ballots as provided herein. The Commissioners of Election shall ascertain from
the poll books the number of persons who voted and shall report the same, over
their signatures, to the City Clerk.
(Ord. 10-21-80.)
105.37  BALLOT COUNTING PROCEDURES.
   When the polls are closed in the election precinct, the Commissioners and
Clerks at such precinct shall proceed to ascertain the result of the election
in the following manner: The ballot box shall then be opened, and one of the
Commissioners taking therefrom one ballot  at time, in the presence of the
other officers,  shall read therefrom the name of the person voted for and hand
the ballot to  another of such Commissioners, differing in politics from
himself, who, if satisfied  that it was correctly read, shall string it on a
thread. The contents of the  ballots, as they are read, shall be entered by the
Poll Clerks, under the supervision of the Commissioners, on tally sheets for
the purpose, by suitable marks, in ink, made opposite to or under the name of
each person voted for, so as to  show the number of votes received by such
person for the office to be filled.  The ballots shall be counted as they are
strung upon the thread, and whenever the number counted shall be equal to the
number of votes entered upon the poll books, the excess, if any, remaining in
the ballot box shall immediately be destroyed by fire or otherwise, without
unfolding or unrolling the same, or allowing anyone to examine or know the
contents thereof.
   They shall not adjourn until all of the votes are counted and certificates
of the results made and signed by them.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-50.)
105.38  IRREGULAR BALLOTS; BALLOTS OF CHALLENGED VOTERS.
   If two or more ballots are found folded or rolled together and the names
voted thereon are the same, one of them only shall be counted; but if the names
voted for thereon are different, in any particular, neither of them shall be
counted except as hereinbefore provided; and in either case, the Commissioners
of Election shall, in writing in ink, place a common number on such ballots and
state thereon that they were folded or rolled together when voted. If any
ballot is found to contain more than the proper number of names for any
office,  such ballot shall not be counted as to such office. Any ballot which
is not endorsed with the names of the Poll Clerks as provided in this article
shall be void and shall not be counted. Any ballot from which it is impossible
to determine the elector's choice of candidates shall not be counted as to the
candidates affected thereby.
   The ballot of any voter challenged according to the provisions of this
article  shall not be counted by the election officials. Council shall, on its
own motion, at the time of the canvassing of the election returns, sit in
session to determine  the validity of such challenges. If Council shall
determine that the challenges are unfounded, the ballot of each challenged
voter, if otherwise valid, shall be counted and tallied together with the
regular ballots cast in the election. In such determinations Council shall
disregard technical errors, omissions or oversights, if it  can reasonably be
ascertained that the challenged voter was entitled to vote.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-51.)
105.39  PRECINCT RETURNS; CERTIFICATES.
   As soon as the results are ascertained, the Commissioners of Election and
Poll Clerks at each voting place shall make out and sign two certificates
thereof, in the following form or to the following effect:
   "We, the undersigned, who acted as Commissioners and Poll Clerks of the City
election held at Precinct No.                in the                Ward of the
City of Morgantown, on the                      day of                     ,
19     , do certify that, having been first duly sworn, we have fairly and
impartially held the election according to law, and the result thereof is as
follows:     For the office of Councilperson from the              Ward,       
                        received                       votes, and              
                 received                  votes, and concluding as follows:
Given under our hands this                    day of                , 19     .”
   When the certificates are signed, the ballots shall be enclosed by the
Commissioners in an envelope, which they shall seal up, and write their names
in ink on the outside of the envelope as follows: "Ballots of the election held
at Precinct No.                in the                Ward of the City of
Morgantown, on the                day of               , 19     ."  One copy of
the certificates herein mentioned  shall be posted on the front door of the
polling place, and the other certificate shall be delivered to the City Clerk
as hereinafter provided. One of the Commissioners of Election shall, within
twelve hours after the completion of the count, tabulation  and declaration of
the result of the election at each precinct, deliver the ballots so  sealed up,
one set of the poll books and tally sheets, one of such certificates, the 
registration book and the ballot boxes, to the City Clerk, who shall deliver
the  same to Council at its next session after such election.
(1967 Code Sec. 9-52.)
105.40  CANVASS OF RETURNS; RECOUNTS, ETC.
   Council shall be an ex-officio Board of Canvassers and, as such, shall make
a record of all their proceedings in ascertaining and declaring the results of
City elections.  They shall convene as a Canvassing Board in Council chambers
on the fifth  day, Sundays excepted, after each election held within the City
and the officers  in whose custody the ballots, poll books, registration
records, tally sheets and certificates have been placed shall present the same
before them for examination. The Board of Canvassers shall keep in a well-bound
book marked "Election Record" a complete record of all their proceedings in
ascertaining and declaring the results of every election. They may, if deemed
necessary, require the attendance of any of the Commissioners, Poll Clerks or
other persons present at the election, to appear and testify respecting the
same, and to make such other orders as shaI1 seem proper, to procure correct
returns and ascertain the true results of the election in the City; but in such
case all questions to the witnesses and all of the  answers thereto, and
evidence shall be taken down in writing and filed and preserved. All orders
made shall be entered upon the record. They may adjourn from time to time, but
no longer than absolutely necessary, and, when a majority of the Commissioners
are not present, their meeting shall stand adjourned until the next day, and 
so from day to day until a quorum is present. The Board shall proceed to open
each  sealed package of ballots so made for them, and, without unfolding them,
count the number of each package and enter the same upon their record. The
ballots shall then again be sealed up carefully in a new envelope, and each
member of the Board shall write his name across the place where such envelope
is sealed. After canvassing the returns of the election, the Board shall
publicly declare the results of the election; however, they shall not enter an
order certifying such election results for a period of forty-eight hours after
such declaration. Within such a forty-eight hour period a candidate voted for
at such election may demand the Board open and examine any one or more of the
sealed packages of ballots, and recount the same; but in such case they shall
seal the same again, along with the envelope herein named, and the Clerk of the
City and each member of the Board shall write his name across the place where
it is sealed, and endorse in ink on the outside: "Ballots of Election held at

In computing the aforesaid forty-eight hour period as hereinbefore used in this
section, Saturday, Sunday and legal holidays shall be excluded: provided, that
at the end of the forty-eight hour period, an order shall be entered certifying
all election results except for those offices in which a recount has been
demanded. Every candidate who demands such recount shall be required to furnish
a bond in a reasonable amount with good, sufficient, surety to guarantee
payment of the costs and the expenses of such recount in the event the result
of the election does not change by such recount; but the amount of such bond
shall in no case exceed three hundred dollars ( $300.00) .
   In the event a recount has been demanded, the Board shall have an additional
twenty- four hours after the end of the forty-eight hour period, in which to
send notice to all candidates who filed for the office in which a recount has
been demanded, of the date, time and place where the Board will convene to
commence the recount. The recount shall be set for no sooner than three days
after the serving of the notice. Service of process shall occur in the
following manner: Any police officer of the City shall deliver a copy thereof
in writing to such candidate in person; or if such candidate cannot be found,

information of its report, to the spouse or such candidate, or any such other
person found there who is a member of his family and above the age of sixteen
years; or if neither the spouse of such candidate or any such other person is
found there, and such candidate cannot be found, by leaving a copy posted to
the front door of such place of abode. Any such officer, thereto required,
shall serve a notice and make return of the manner and time of service; for
failure to do so, he shall forfeit twenty dollars ($20.00). Such return shall
be evidence of the manner and time of service.
   When they have made their certificates and declared the results as here and
after provided, they shall deposit the sealed packages of ballots, absent voter
ballots, registration records. poll books, tally sheets and precinct
certificates with the Clerk of the City from whom they were received, and if
there is no contest pending as to any such election, and if further
preservation is not required by any order of the Court, such ballots, poll
books, tally sheets and certificates shall be destroyed by fire or otherwise,
without opening the sealed packages of ballots and if there is such contest
pending, then they shall be so destroyed as soon as the contest is ended. If
the results of the election are not changed by such recount, the cost and
expense thereof shall be paid by the party whose instance the same was made.
(Ord. 4-7-81.)
105.41  DISPOSITION OF LEFTOVER BALLOTS.
   The Board of Ballot Commissioners shall preserve the ballots that are
leftover in their hands, after supplying the precincts as provided by this
article, until the close of the polls on the day of election, and such ballots
shall then be destroyed by such Board, or the chairman thereof, by fire or
otherwise.

was the result of actual fraud, willful misconduct, or actual malice of the
person requesting defense and indemnification; or (c) the defense of the action
or proceeding by the City would create a conflict of interest between the City
and the person or persons involved.
   (c)   In any other action or proceeding, including criminal or

         (Ord. 93-20.  Passed 7-20-93.)
129.13  PAYMENT OF MUNICIPAL TAXES, FEES AND ASSESSMENTS BY CREDIT OR CHECK
CARDS.
   Pursuant to authority vested in it by Section 8-13-15 of the West Virginia
Code, the City of Morgantown’s Finance Department is authorized to accept
payments of municipal taxes, fees, assessments, and other money due the
Municipality by credit card or check card.
(Ord. 02-39.  Passed 12-3-02.)
129.14  OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (OPEB) FUND.
   (a)   Purpose.  There is hereby created an Other Post-Employment (OPEB) Fund
for the purpose of payment of current and future retirement benefits other than
pensions of employees eligible to receive those benefits under the City’s self-
funded life and health insurance plan (the “Plan”), as well as to offset any
liabilities as determined by qualified actuarial study.  The participation in
and any coverage under this Code section shall not constitute nor be construed
to constitute a specific, accrued or vested benefit for any specific employee
or retiree.  The OPEB Fund is established as a savings and investment fund for
the sole purpose of paying the City’s self-funded health insurance plan for
current and future retirees as described above, and, as such, is restricted in
nature.
   (b)   Administration.  The Finance Director shall be authorized to establish
any accounts (i.e. checking, savings, certificates of deposit, investment)
necessary for the operation, maintenance and investments associated with this
fund, and the Finance Department shall administer such funds and accounts.  The
OPEB Fund is to be administered and operated in accordance with the provisions
of Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statements 43 and 45 and as the same
may be amended or superseded.  The following administrative rules shall be
followed for the OPEB Fund:
      (1)   Accounting.  The Department of Finance and Support Services will
maintain a set of records separate from all other funds of the City for the
purpose of accounting for the financial activities and transactions of this
fund.
      (2)   Investments.  Amounts and types of investments shall be limited to
those authorized by the State Code of the State of West Virginia 8-13-22 or its
amendments and successors, as well as the current or future general investment
policies established by City of Morgantown Administration.  Any and all
investment income or loss associated with the activities of this fund shall be
reinvested in the fund and there will be no distinction between principal and
income and thus the same restrictions shall apply to both.
      (3)   Contributions.  The City shall contribute amounts as required by
future budgetary ordinances or resolutions.  Contributions shall also be made
at least once per year from the Life and Health Fund.  Whereas the Life and
Health Fund is the administrative fund for the City’s self-funded health
insurance plan, it must maintain a reasonable reserve, and therefore no
contributions shall be made from the Life and Health Fund unless this
reasonable reserve is available, which will be determined by the Department of
Finance.  The excess amounts in the Life and Health Fund, as previously
described, may not be used for any other purpose other than as a contribution
to the OPEB Fund, unless the assets available in the OPEB Fund are greater than
or equal to the actuarially determined liability of Other Post-Employment
Benefits.
      (4)   Disbursements and Expenses.  Amounts may be expended or disbursed
from the OPEB Fund for costs associated with the payment of life, health and
other post-employment benefits of retirees eligible under the City’s self-
funded health insurance plan.  Such costs shall be calculated in the same
manner used to calculate the monthly premiums paid by the City’s other
operating funds and departments to the Life and Health Fund for such associated
costs.  All amounts will be disbursed directly to the Life and Health Fund for
these costs and no individual shall be eligible to receive a direct payment of
their eligible benefits from this fund.  Other such reasonable operating
expenses associated with the fund, such as fees for accountants, legal counsel,
actuarial services, etc., shall constitute a charge against and shall be paid
from this fund; however, there will be no administrative type charges for
services performed by other departments paid to any other fund for such
services, i.e. bookkeeping services performed by the Finance Department.
      (5)   Termination.  This fund may only be closed if all liabilities for
eligible employees under the City’s self-funded health insurance plan have been
satisfied, meaning there are no outstanding amounts due and payable and,
according to the City’s self-funded health insurance plan, no current or future
employee or retiree will be eligible to receive the life, health, or other post
employment benefits.  Upon termination and closing of this fund, all assets
within it shall be placed within the City’s General Fund.
         (Ord. 12-06.  Passed 2-21-12.)
129.15  FINANCIAL STABILIZATION FUND.
   There is hereby created a Financial Stabilization Fund of which  a separate
set of financial accounts will be maintained with the City’s accounting
system.  The Financial Stabilization Fund may receive appropriations, gifts,
and grants from any other funds made available.  This account may be funded
over a period of years up to the maximum level allowable by West Va. Code 8-37-
3 or its amendments and successors.  These funds may be used to cover the
General Fund’s operating short falls and any other purpose City Council
considers appropriate.  Cash and investments maintained in this fund may not be
removed without majority approval by City Council with the following
exceptions:  the Finance Director may utilize this fund:
   (a)   For emergency purposes such as natural or man-made disasters in the
event cash is not available to meet obligations for continued operations, or
   (b)   To meet payroll obligations if a cash shortage exists in any fund
where employees are paid.
   As soon as reasonably possible report will be provided to City Council as to
the reason for utilizing these funds, the total amount utilized, and any
corrective actions that may be necessary. 
(Ord. 12-10.  Passed 4-17-12.)
129.16  FINANCE DIRECTOR’S AUTHORITY TO REQUEST INFORMATION.
   Pursuant to Section 11-10-5d of the West Virginia Code, Morgantown City
Council, as the governing body of Morgantown, West Virginia hereby appoints the
Finance Director of the City as the duly authorized agent of the Municipality
to inspect and make copies of the State business and occupation tax returns
filed by taxpayers of the Municipality and any other state tax returns
(includes, but not limited to, consumers sales and services tax return
information and health care provider tax return information) as may be
reasonably requested by the Municipality.  Such inspection or copying shall
include disclosure to the Finance Director of the Municipality for tax
administration purposes of all available return information from files of the
Tax Department relating to taxpayers who transact business within the
Municipality.  As the City’s agent in such financial matters, the Finance
Director is hereby granted authority to request in writing all such information
at his/her discretion, on a case by case basis, in lieu of receiving specific
instructions from either the Mayor or City Council for each such case.
(Ord. 14-22.  Passed 7-15-14.)
129.17   DISPOSITION OF REAL ESTATE.
   (a)   Except as provided in Paragraph (b) of this Section
129.17, City real estate will be sold or leased in accordance with applicable
provisions of West Virginia law.
   (b)    Notwithstanding any provision of West Virginia law to the contrary,
and in accordance with authority duly granted pursuant to the Municipal Home
Rule Pilot Program, City real estate may also be sold or leased as follows:
      (1)    Property may be sold to private purchasers without auction at a
fair market value if the City determines that the sale promotes economic
development or provides a service for the public good;
      (2)    Property may be leased to private lessees for less than fair
market value if the City determines that the lease promotes economic
development or provides a service for the public good;
      (3)    Property may be sold to nonprofit corporations that are qualified
501(c)(3) organizations as determined by the Internal Revenue Service for a
fair value without alone considering the commercial or market value of the
property.
         (Ord. 17-51.  Passed 12-19-17.)
129.18  EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS ON PUBLIC SCHOOL PROPERTIES.
   (a)    In addition to any other authority granted by law, and in accordance
with the provisions of this Code governing the expenditure of public funds, the
City may expend public funds on school projects that benefit the community when
the expenditure is governed by an agreement with the Monongalia County Board of
Education.
   (b)    Any provision of West Virginia law contrary to the foregoing
Paragraph (a) shall not apply to funds of the City of Morgantown, in accordance
with authority duly granted pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Pilot Program.

153.10  COMPLAINTS; PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Any individual claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful
discriminatory practice may make, sign, and file with the Commission a verified
complaint, which shall state the name and address of the person, employer,
labor organization, employment agency, owner, real estate broker, real estate
salesman, or financial institution alleged to have committed the unlawful
discriminatory practice complained of, and which shall set forth the
particulars thereof and contain such other information as may be required by
the Commission’s rules and regulations.  The Commission upon its own initiative
may, in like manner, make, sign and file such complaint.  Any employer, whose
employees, or some of them, hinder or threaten to hinder compliance with the
provisions of this article, may file with the commission a verified complaint,
asking for assistance by conciliation or other remedial action, and in such
event no hearings, orders or other actions shall be held, made or taken by the
commission against such employer on the basis of the actions set forth in the
employer’s complaint.  Any complaint filed pursuant to this article must be
filed within 365 days after the alleged act of discrimination.  No provision of
this section shall prohibit the Commission from accepting complaints in a
manner other than a verified writing and referring such complaints without
prior investigation to the West Virginia Human Rights Commission.
   (b)   After the filing of any complaint, or whenever there is reason to
believe that an unlawful discriminatory practice has been committed, the
Commission shall make a prompt investigation in connection therewith; provided,
however, that the Commission may at any time elect to refer a complaint to the
West Virginia Human Rights Commission and that the Commission shall, at any
time the complaint or a subsequent investigation indicates that only acts
prohibited by West Virginia Code Section 5-11-9 are alleged, refer such
complaint to the West Virginia Human Rights Commission.  Upon referral to the
West Virginia Human Rights Commission, the Commission shall notify the
complainant and cease its investigation.  Upon a determination by the
Commission in accordance with its applicable rules, any investigation may be
conducted by an individual member or special committee of the Commission as
authorized by the Commission.
   (c)   If it is determination after such investigation that no probable cause
exists for substantiating the allegations of the complaint, the Commission
shall, within ten days from such determination, cause to be issued to the
complainant written notice of such determination; and the complainant may,
within ten days after such service, file with the Commission a written request
for a meeting with the Commission to show probable cause for substantiating the
allegations of the complaint.  If it is determined after such investigation or
meeting that probable cause exists for substantiating the allegations of the
complaint, the Commission shall immediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful
discriminatory practices complained of by conference, conciliation, and
persuasion.  Neither the members of the Commission nor any administrative
personnel shall disclose what has transpired in the course of the conference,
conciliation and persuasion process; provided, that the Commission may publish
or release the terms of settlement or conciliation when the complaint has been
conciliated or settled.
   (d)   In case of a failure to eliminate such practice, or in advance
thereof, if in the judgment of the Commission circumstances warrant, the
Commission shall cause to be issued and served a written notice, together with
a copy of such complaint as the same may have been amended, in the manner
provided by law for the service of summons in civil actions, directing the
person, employer, labor organization, employment agency, owner, real estate
broker, real estate salesman, or other institution named in such complaint,
hereinafter referred to as respondent, to answer the charges of such complaint
at a public or private hearing before the Commission in the county where the
respondent resides or transacts business at a time and place specified in such
notice; provided, however, that such written notice shall be served at least
thirty days prior to the time set for the hearing.  The Commission or its chair
shall delegate the power and authority to conduct the hearing to a hearing
examiner, who may be an individual commissioner; a panel of commissioners; or a
third-party hearing examiner, who shall be an attorney duly licensed to
practice law in West Virginia, provided that funding has been allocated to the
Commission for retention of such hearing commissioner.
   (e)   The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with this section and the
rules and regulations of the Commission and shall be designed to create a
sufficient record to permit review in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The
respondent may file a written, verified answer to the complaint and appear at
such hearing in person or otherwise, with or without counsel, and submit
testimony and evidence.  The complainant may appear at such hearing in person
or otherwise, with or without counsel, and submit testimony and evidence.  In
addition to any other testimony and evidence received, the hearing examiner may
consider the record of the investigation of the complaint and include such
record in the record of the hearing.  Following the hearing, the hearing
examiner shall prepare or cause to be prepared a copy of the record of the
hearing and the written findings and conclusions of the hearing examiner and
transmit the same to the Commission.
   (f)   If, after such hearing and consideration of all of the testimony,
evidence and record in the case, the Commission finds that a respondent has
engaged in or is engaging in any unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in
this article, the Commission shall issue and cause to be served on such
respondent an order to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory
practice and to take such affirmative action, including but not limited to,
hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay,
admission or restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, or
the admission to full and equal enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities,
or accommodations offered by any respondent place of public accommodation, and
the sale, purchase, lease, rental or financial assistance to any complaint
otherwise qualified for the housing accommodation or real property denied in
violation of this article, as in the judgment of the Commission will effectuate
the purposes of this article, and including a requirement for reporting of the
manner of compliance, payment of expenses and lost wages of any witness called
by the complainant or Commission, payment to the complainant of reasonable
attorney fees, expert witness fees, and legal costs, and payment to the
Commission of its costs in conducting the hearing; and any other legal or
equitable relief as the Commission deems appropriate.  Such order shall be
accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to permit
review by any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (g)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the filing of a
private lawsuit or other cause of action at any time.
   (h)   The Commission may adopt rules and regulations implementing the
procedures set forth in this section, so long as such rules and regulations are
consistent with the provisions of this article.  Any such rules and regulations
adopted by the Commission shall be filed with the City Clerk and made available
for public inspection.
(Ord. 17-40.  Passed 10-17-17.)
153.11   EXEMPTIONS; CONFLICTS; SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   (a)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth within this
ordinance, nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to violate the rights
of freedom of speech or religion guaranteed by the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution or Article III, Section 7 of the West Virginia
Constitution.  This ordinance shall not pertain to a religious organization,
association, educational institution, or society employing individuals whose
primary duties consist of teaching, or spreading doctrine or belief, religious
governance, supervision of a religious order, supervision of persons teaching
or spreading religious doctrine or belief, or supervision or participation in
religious ritual or worship.  Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent a
religious organization, association, educational institution, or society from
restricting membership or access to any of its religious services or activities
to those who are members of the same religion.  These exemptions are intended,
and shall be construed, to protect rights established by the United States and
West Virginia Constitutions as determined by applicable judicial decisions.
   (b)   In the event of a conflict between the interpretation of a provision
of West Virginia Code Chapter 5, Article 11, and the interpretation of a
similar provision contained in any part of this article, the interpretation of
the provision in West Virginia Code shall apply.  Until such time as the
legislation of the State provides equal or broader protections for the
classifications of veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity, the
provisions contained herein control the application of this ordinance to those
classifications.
   (c)   If any provision of this article is finally determined to be
unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable, it is the intent of the City
Council that the remaining provisions remain in force and apply without regard
to the unenforceable provision, which shall be treated as though it is omitted
in the application of this article.

   Effective upon adoption, members' contributions shall be before tax, as
permitted by Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.
   For prior service, each participating employee in the employ of the City on
the effective date of the Fund, shall be credited, as of such date, with a
prior service credit equal to the period of service that the member has
rendered to the City prior to the effective date of the Fund. Any employee who
is in the employ of the City on the effective date of the Fund and who becomes
a member of the Fund shall be entitled to prior service credit even though such
prior service was not continuous. Any individual who is not in the employ of
the City on the effective date of the Fund but who has been employed by the

service and becomes a member of the Fund within such two-year period.

shall have forfeited all prior service credits unless he repays to the Fund in
cash at the time of re-employment the amount of money which he has withdrawn
plus six percent (6%) interest compounded annually on such amount during the
time he was separated from the service. If, however, the break in service of
such member is more than two years, he shall not be entitled to any prior
service credit nor shall he be entitled to redeposit withdrawals but he shall
reenter the Fund as a new member.
(Ord. 7-7-87.)
177.05  CONTRIBUTIONS BY CITY.
   Effective January 1, 1987, the financial objective of the City shall not be
less than to contribute to the Fund annually an amount which, together with the
contributions from the members will be sufficient to meet the normal cost of
the Fund including the cost of administration, and amortize any actuarial
deficiency over a period of not more than forty years, but for those funds in
existence on January 1, 1987, its actuarial deficiency, if any, shall not be
amortized over a period longer than that which remains under its current
schedule. For purposes of determining this minimum financial objective:
   (a)    The value of the Fund's assets shall be determined on the basis of
any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair
market value, and
   (b)    All costs, deficiencies, rate of interest and other factors under the
Fund shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods
which in the aggregate are reasonable, taking into account the experience of
the Fund and reasonable expectations, and which in combination offer the
qualified actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the Fund.
   If, as a result of this legislation, the City's financial commitment to the
Fund is materially increased, the City may elect to phase in this increase over
the five fiscal years commencing on January 1, 1987.
(Ord. 7-7-87.)

   (a)    After the effective date of the Fund, any member of the Fund who has
at least ten years of continuous total service credit shall receive a vested
right to a retirement pension which he may exercise upon or after attainment of
age sixty. When he has attained the age of sixty years, he may at his option,
apply for a retirement pension, the amount thereof to be determined in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) hereof.
   (b)    Retirement for all members of the Fund shall be compulsory at the age
of seventy, subject to the following conditions: The employee may be permitted
to continue in the service if he so desires and if his services are still
valuable to the City. Whether an employee's services are valuable at the age of
seventy shall be determined by the appointing officer of the City. If he
determines that such services are valuable, his determination shall be
certified to the Board for approval. If the Board approves, the employee may
continue in the service of the City. The appointing officer shall annually

over age seventy. The amount of any pension under the provisions of this
subsection shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection
(e) hereof.

sixty, except that if his age plus years of continuous service credit is equal
to or greater than eighty-five, the benefit shall not be reduced.
   (d)    Although he has not attained the age of sixty, any member who has
thirty-five years, total service and who becomes so physically or mentally

   (f)   With the condition that no optional benefit shall be effective if the
member dies within thirty days after the effective date of his retirement, such
member may elect at any time prior to the date that his retirement benefits
commence to receive a lesser retirement pension, on a joint and last survivor
basis, in order to provide, on an actuarial basis, an annuity to a designed
beneficiary under any of the following two options:
      (1)   Option 1.  Upon his death while on retirement, his lesser
retirement pension shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such
individual having an insurable interest in his life, as he has named in a
written designation, duly acknowledged and filed with the Board. 
      (2)   Option 2.  Upon his death while on retirement, one half of his
lesser retirement pension shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to
such individual having an insurable interest in his life as he has named in a
written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the Board.

per annum.  At no time shall the City’s required contribution to the Employee
Pension Plan exceed six percent (6%) of payroll.  Therefore, cost-of-living

Consumer Price Index, depending upon the percentage of payroll the City has
contributed to the Employee Pension Fund. 
(Ord. 02-20.  Passed 7-16-02.)
177.07  DISABILITY PENSIONS; ANNUITIES.
   A member may qualify for a disability pension under any one of the following
mutually exclusive provisions:
   (a)   If a member receives total disability in line of duty, he shall be
entitled, during the time of his disability, to a monthly disability pension
equal to fifty percent (50%) of the monthly salary of the member at the date of
disability: provided, that the minimum payment shall be one hundred dollars
($100.00) per month.  Any benefits payable from the Retirement and Benefit Fund
shall be reduced by benefits payable from workers’ compensation due to the
total disability of the member.
   (b)   If a member receives total disability not in line of duty while an
employee of the City after he has had at least ten years’ total service credit
and such member is not entitled to a retirement pension under the provisions of
Section
177.06, he shall be entitled, during the time of his disability, to one-half of
the retirement pension to which he would have been entitled under the
provisions of Section
177.06 had he been sixty years of age at the date of disability and had elected
to take retirement: provided, that he shall be entitled to a minimum payment of
fifty dollars ($50.00) per month and a maximum payment of three hundred dollars
($300.00) per month.
   (c)   If a member becomes so physically and mentally disabled as to render
him unfit for the performance of the duties of the position he occupies, but
his disability does not constitute either total disability in line of duty or
total disability not in line of duty, and such member has less than ten years’
total service credit, he shall be entitled to an annuity which shall be the
actuarial equivalent of his total accumulation at the date of his disability. 
The Board of Trustees of the Fund shall order a periodic re-examination of
members of the Fund receiving a disability pension, and if the disability no
longer exists, the payment thereunder shall be discontinued; provided, that no
such re-examination of any such member shall be ordered as aforesaid after such
member attains the age of sixty years.
Except, however that any employee when so disabled as to be otherwise eligible
to participate in the Fund shall first receive the sick leave benefits to which
he or she may be entitled under the provisions of “Personnel Rules”, adopted by
Council on May 7, 1980, and on the day following, the expiration of such
benefits shall become eligible for disability payments from the Fund as
provided in this section, it being the intention hereof that any such employee
shall first receive the benefits of accrued sick leave before becoming eligible
for disability payments under the provisions of this article from such Fund.

177.08  DEATH BENEFITS; RETURN OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   A beneficiary of a deceased member, which member was not receiving a

the following mutually exclusive provisions:
      (1)   If the member died as a result of personal injury or disease
arising out of and in the course of his employment with the City, the surviving
spouse shall be entitled during widowhood or widowerhood to a monthly benefit
equal to thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the final monthly
salary of the member.  In the event there is no surviving spouse, or if
remarriage occurs before the youngest child attains age eighteen, each child
under age eighteen shall be entitled until age eighteen to a monthly benefit
equal to twenty percent (20%) of the member’s final monthly salary, subject to
a total payment of all such children of fifty percent (50%) of such final
monthly salary.  If there is no surviving spouse or children under age
eighteen, the deceased member’s dependent father or mother or both, the
question of dependency to be determined by the Board, shall each be entitled
until death to a monthly payment equal to one sixth of the deceased member’s
final monthly salary.
   Any benefits payable from the Retirement and Benefit Fund shall be reduced
by benefits payable from workers’ compensation due to the death of the member.
      (2)    If the member died from any cause other than that stated in
subsection (a)(1) hereof and such member at the date of his death had ten or
more years' total service credit, his beneficiary shall be entitled, for a
period not to exceed ten years, to death benefits in accordance with the
retirement pension table contained in Section
177.06. The death benefits shall be paid to such individual having an insurable
interest in the member's life as such member has nominated in a designation
filed with the Board. As to any spouse beneficiary, the marriage shall have
occurred at least one year prior to the death of the member in order that the
spouse may be eligible for benefits under this subsection.
   (b)    If a member receiving a retirement pension under the provisions of
Section
177.06 at the date of his death dies with a spouse or beneficiary surviving,
concerning which retirement pension the option benefit provisions set forth in
177.06(f) are not applicable, and such member had been receiving such
retirement pension for less than ten years, such surviving spouse shall be
entitled to receive death benefits equivalent to the deceased member's
retirement pension for the remaining period of ten years dating from the date
of the member's retirement; but a surviving spouse shall not be entitled to
death benefits under the provisions of this subsection unless such surviving
spouse was married to the member before the date of his retirement and such
marriage took place at least one year prior to the date of the death of the
member. If the surviving spouse remarries, such spouse's death benefits shall
be terminated and shall not be resumed upon subsequent change in the marital
status of such spouse.
   (c)    If a member dies with less than ten years' total service credit so
that he was not entitled to a retirement pension during life, the member's
total contributions to the Fund, without interest, shall be returned to such
individual having an insurable interest in the member's life as such member has
nominated in a designation filed with the Board, and in the absence of any such
designation, to the member's estate.

   Police officers are authorized to provide for the removal and impounding of
a vehicle under the following circumstances:

   (e)    When any vehicle has been used in or connected with the commission of
a felony.
   (f)    When any vehicle has been damaged or wrecked so as to be inoperable
or violates equipment provisions of this Traffic Code or West Virginia Code
Article 17C-15 whereby its continued operation would constitute a condition
hazardous to life, limb or property.
   (g)    When any vehicle is left unattended due to the removal of an ill,
injured or arrested operator.
   (h)    When any vehicle has been operated by any person who has failed to
stop in case of an accident or collision.
   (i)    When any vehicle has been operated by any person who is driving
without a lawful license or while his license has been suspended or revoked.
   (j)    When any vehicle is found for which two or more citation tags for
violations  of this Traffic Code have been issued and the owner or operator
thereof has  failed to respond to such citation tags as lawfully required.
   (k)    When any vehicle is parked on or in front of a public or private
driveway so as to prohibit vehicular ingress and egress to such property,
without  the consent of the person having the right to the possession of the
property.
   Any vehicle removed under authority of subsection (b) hereof shall be
disposed of as provided under West Virginia Code Article 17-24.
307.02  REPORT REQUIRED; NOTICE TO OWNER.
   Any police officer removing or causing any vehicle to be removed and stored
for safe keeping under the provisions of this article shall, as soon as
practicable, make a report of such action to the officer in charge at the
police station, giving in such report the license registration number, state of
registration if any, make and type of vehicle, place of, and reason for,
removal, as well as the place at which stored. If any such vehicle shall not be
claimed within twenty-four hours from and after the time of such report, either
by the owner or the person in charge thereof, the owner of such vehicle shall
be notified by mail of the impounding thereof by the Clerk of the Police Court.
Such notice shall include the facts and matters contained  in the report to the
officer in charge and shall also notify such owner of the manner and terms upon
which he may reclaim such vehicle.
(1967 Code Sec. 20-128.)
307.03  LIABILITY OF OWNER FOR COSTS.
   The owner or person in charge of any vehicle impounded under the provisions
of this article shall pay the costs of impounding, hauling, driving, towing and
storing such vehicle, in addition to any fine and costs assessed against him
for any violation  of the provisions of this Traffic Code or other ordinance of
the City resulting from the parking of such vehicle or otherwise, or arising
out of any act resulting in the impounding of such vehicle.
(1967 Code Sec. 20-129.)
307.04  POST-STORAGE HEARINGS FOR IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   (a)    Right to Hearing.  As to any vehicle impounded pursuant to any
ordinance of the City, by its agents or employees, a person who has a legal
entitlement to possession of the vehicle has a right to a post-seizure
administrative hearing to determine whether there was probable cause to impound
the vehicle if such person files a written demand on forms so provided for such
a hearing, with the City within five days after such person has learned such
vehicle has been impounded or within five days after the mailing of the date
set in the notice of stored vehicle, whichever occurs first, the notice of
stored vehicle shall be sent in the mail to the legal and registered owner or
their agent and to the garage where the vehicle is stored within twenty-four
hours, in cases of out-of-state vehicles forty-eight hours, excluding weekends
and holidays, after impounding and storage of the vehicle.
   (b)    Conduct of Hearing.
      (1)    A hearing shall be conducted before the Municipal Police Judge
within twenty-four hours of receipt of a written demand therefor from the
person seeking the hearing unless such person waives the right to a speedy
hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and City holidays are to be excluded from the
calculation of the twenty-four hour period. The sole issue before the Police
Judge shall be whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in
question.
      (2)    "Probable cause to impound" means such a state of facts as would
lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was
sufficient breach of local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for
the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)    The Police Judge shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner
and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the
hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right
to possession of the vehicle. The Police Department shall carry the burden of
establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the Police Judge shall prepare a written
decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the
hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle, if not the person requesting
the hearing. The Police Judge's decision in no way affects any criminal
proceeding in connection with the impound in question and that any criminal
charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate
court. The decision of the Police Judge is final. Failure of the registered or
legal owner, or their agent to request or attend a scheduled post-seizure
hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing.
   (c)    Decision of the Police Judge.  The Police Judge shall only determine
that as to the vehicle in issue either there was probable cause to impound the
vehicle or there was no such probable cause, and in the event that the Police
Judge determines that there was no probable cause, the Police Judge shall
prepare and date a Certificate of No Probable Cause, copies of which shall be
given to the possessor of the vehicle and the Police Department. Upon receipt
of the possessor's copy of such certificate, the garage having custody of the
vehicle shall release the vehicle to its possessor.  Upon a finding of no
probable cause, towing and storage fees shall be paid by the City in accordance
with arrangements made between the City and the garage. If the possessor fails
to present such certificate to the garage having custody of the vehicle within
twenty-four hours of its receipt, excluding such days when the garage is not
open for business, the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent
storage charges. Such certificate shall advise the possessor of such
requirement.
(Ord. 1-19-82.)
307.05  CITY NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.
   The City, its agents, officers or employees shall not be liable for any
damages to persons or property resulting directly or indirectly from any act
done or performed under the provisions of this article.
(1967 Code Sec. 20-131.)
307.06  AUTHORITY OF CITY MANAGER.
   The City Manager is hereby authorized to rent suitable spaces in garages,
parking lots or elsewhere for the storage and safekeeping of the vehicles
impounded under the provisions of this article and he is also authorized to

thereof within thirty days from and after the date the same is impounded, such
vehicle may be sold at public auction by the Chief of Police of the City, or by
the persons storing the same under provisions of this article, but before any
such sale shall be made, ten days' notice of the date, place and purpose of
such sale with a description of the vehicle to be sold shall be served upon the
owner of record of such vehicle by registered mail at his last known address
and like notice of such sale shall be published once each week for two
successive weeks prior to the date of such sale in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. If the owner of any such vehicle is unknown; then no
notice to such owner shall be necessary but the newspaper publication shall be
made and the facts with regard to the ownership of the vehicle set forth in
such notice.
   In the making of any sale hereunder the Chief of Police may continue the
same by verbal announcement at the time and place of such sale, and in the
making of any such sale of any such vehicle he may act by agent or attorney.
   The proceeds from any such sale of any such vehicle shall be applied, first,
to the costs of such sale; second, to the hauling, towing and storage charges
thereof; third, to the payment of any fine and costs incurred by reason of any
violation of the provisions of this Traffic Code or other ordinance of the
City; and fourth, to the payment of any bona fide lien owner who intervenes or
establishes a bona fide claim to such sum. Any balance remaining shall be paid
to the owner of such vehicle, if he is known, or if unknown, shall be paid to
the general receiver of the Circuit Court of the County, to be disposed of by
him as provided by the statutes of the State. In the event that no person shall
claim any such funds in the hands of the general receiver for a period of
twenty years, the principal of such fund together with the interest thereon
shall be paid into the General Fund of the City by the general receiver.
(1967 Code Sec. 20-133.)
307.08  IMMOBILIZATION OF CERTAIN VEHICLES.
   (a)    Authority of Police.  When any police officer of the City finds on a
City street a vehicle which has in the past been cited for a traffic violation
and which violation has not been disposed of in the Police Court in accordance
with the ordinances pertaining thereto, or which vehicle is in violation of the
provisions of this Traffic Code and the City police officer deems it necessary,
in order to enforce such provisions, that an immobilizer be used, then such
City police officer may immobilize such vehicle by installing or attaching a
device thereto until the owner or driver thereof has satisfied any existing and
past violations in accordance with the ordinances pertaining thereto.
(1967 Code Sec. 20-133.1.)
   (b)    Notice.  Whenever any such vehicle is so immobilized, a notice in
writing, on a form to be prescribed by the Police Chief, shall be conspicuously
affixed to such vehicle advising the owner or driver thereof that such vehicle
has been immobilized for violation of the City ordinances enumerated thereon,
and indicating the procedure to obtain the release of such immobilizer.
(1967 Code Sec. 20-133.2.)
   (c)    Moving Vehicle Prior to Obtaining Release Prohibited.  No

emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)    No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall

313.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the

successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)    Green alone or "go":
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)    Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go" 
signal:
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)    Red alone or "stop":
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)    A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as  close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when  a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)    A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near  side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one- ay street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance  prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)    No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)    Red with green arrow:
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)    No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)    In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:

in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (b)    Wait.  No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the
direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing. 
(WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal).  When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of  vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
      (WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06  UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)    No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)    Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07  ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.

deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any

interfere with the movement of police vehicles, firefighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.

   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second

      (1)   Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),

ten-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and
      (3)   Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West

violation occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of
arrest in the current proceeding.
   (l)   A person may be charged in a warrant or indictment or information for
a second or subsequent offense under this section if the person has been
previously arrested for or charged with a violation of this section which is
alleged to have occurred within the applicable time period for prior offenses,
notwithstanding the fact that there has not been a final adjudication of the
charges for the alleged previous offense.  In that case, the warrant or
indictment or information must set forth the date, location and particulars of
the previous offense or offenses.  No person may be convicted of a second or
subsequent offense under this section unless the conviction for the previous
offense has become final, or the person has previously had a period of
conditional probation imposed pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C- 5-2(b).
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d) or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection  (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   For purposes of this section, the term “controlled substance” has the
meaning ascribed to it in West Virginia Code Chapter 60A.
   (o)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation: 
provided, that the court may apply the provisions  of West Virginia Code 62-11A
to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for a first
offense under this section:  provided however, that the court may impose a term
of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b) to persons
adjudicated thereunder.  An order for home detention by the court pursuant to
the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B may be used as an alternative
sentence to any period of incarceration required by this section for a first or
subsequent offense:  provided, however, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of second offense under this
section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than five days of
the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave
home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code
62-11B-5:  provided, however, that for any period of home incarceration ordered
for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation  of this section,
electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten days of the total
period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave home for
those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.  (WVaC 17C-5-2)
   (p)   For purposes of this section, the phrase "in this Municipality" means
anywhere within the physical boundaries of this Municipality, including, but
not limited to, publicly maintained streets and highways, and subdivision
streets or other areas not publicly maintained but nonetheless open to the use
of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.
   (q)   When used in this section, the terms or phrases "driving under the
influence of intoxicating liquor," "driving or operating a motor vehicle while
intoxicated," "for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor
to drive any vehicle," or any similar term or phrase shall be construed to mean
and be synonymous with the term or phrase "while under the influence of
alcohol...drives a vehicle" as the latter term or phrase is used in this
section.
   (r)   A warrant or indictment which charges or alleges an offense,
prohibited by the provisions of this section, and which warrant or indictment
uses any of the terms or phrases set forth in subsection (q) hereof, shall not
thereby be fatally defective if such warrant or indictment otherwise informs
the person so accused of the charges against him.
(WVaC 17C-5-2a)
333.011 DEFERRAL OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS FOR CERTAIN FIRST  OFFENSES UPON
CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR  VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM;
PROCEDURE ON CHARGE OF VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (g) hereof, whenever any person who
has not previously been convicted of any offense under this article or any
statute of the United States or of any state relating to driving under the
influence of alcohol, any controlled substance or any other drug:
      (1)   Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)   Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under subsection (c) of Section
 333.01, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent
of the accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding any
provisions of this code to the contrary, place him or her on probation, which
conditions shall include, that he or she successfully completes the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-
3a.  Participation therein shall be for a period of at least 165 days after he
or she has served the fifteen days of license suspension imposed pursuant to
West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2.
   (b)   A defendant’s election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in West Virginia Code 17C- 5A-2.
   (c)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subdivision (1)
must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program, or if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time after
the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard.  If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Test and Lock
Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provisions, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (d)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges.  This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program.  A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney.  If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant.  If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (c) hereof.
   (e)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of this article,
discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of
guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities
imposed by law upon conviction of a crime except for those provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5A-1, et seq.  Except as provided in subsection (j), (k) and
(l) of Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial.  No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as that term is defined in subsection
(l) of Section
333.01.
   (f)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (g)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)   In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision of
this article has been charged;
      (2)   If the person holds a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicle(s), or
      (3)   The person has previously had his or her driver’s license revoked
under West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(a) or under any statute of the United States
or of any state relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, any
controlled substance or any other drug.
   (h)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial,
and conviction, pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant  or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard.  If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (i)   Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, any person
prosecuted for a violation of subsection (c) of Section
333.01, whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be liable for any court costs assessable against a person convicted of
the offense.  Payment of such costs may be made a condition of probation.  The
costs assessed pursuant to this subsection, whether as a term of probation or
not, shall be distributed as other court costs in accordance with relevant
municipal ordinances and state statutes.
(Ord. 10-28.  Passed 7-6-10.)
333.02  RECKLESS DRIVING.
   (a)   No person shall drive any vehicle upon any street or highway, or upon
any residential street, or in any parking area, or upon the ways of any
institution of higher education, whether public or private or upon the property
of the Board of Education, or upon any property within the City park and public
recreation system, in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or

(Ord. 94-72.  Passed 8-16-94.)
333.03  IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   Any person who drives a motor vehicle in this Municipality shall be
deemed to have given his or her consent by the operation thereof, to a
preliminary breath analysis and a secondary chemical test of either his or her
blood, or breath to determine the alcohol concentration in his or her blood, or
the concentration in the person’s body of a controlled substance, drug, or any
combination thereof.
   (b)   A preliminary breath analysis may be administered in accordance with
the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-5 whenever a police officer has
reasonable cause to believe a person to have been driving a motor vehicle in
this Municipality while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances
or drugs as prohibited by Section
333.01.
   (c)   A secondary test of blood, or breath shall be incidental to a lawful
arrest and shall be administered at the direction of the arresting law
enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person has
committed an offense prohibited by Section
333.01.
   (d)   The Police Chief shall designate the secondary tests to be
administered: notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-7 the
refusal to submit to a blood test only shall not result in the revocation of
the arrested person’s license to operate a motor vehicle in this State.
   (e)   Any person to whom a preliminary breath test is administered who is
arrested, shall be given an oral warning and a written statement advising him
or her that his/her refusal to submit to the secondary chemical test finally
designated as provided in this section, will result in the revocation of his/
her license to operate a motor vehicle in this State for a period of at least
forty-five days and up to life; and that after fifteen minutes following the
warnings the refusal is considered final.  The arresting officer after that
period of time expires has no further duty to provide the person with an
opportunity to take the secondary test.
   (f)   Any law enforcement officer who has been properly trained in the
administration of any secondary chemical test authorized by this article,
including, but not limited to, certification by the Bureau for Public Health in
the operation of any equipment required for the collection and analysis of a
breath sample, may conduct the test at any location in the county wherein the
arrest is made: Provided, that the law-enforcement officer may conduct the test
at the nearest available properly functioning secondary chemical testing device
located outside the county in which the arrest was made, if: (i) There is no
properly functioning secondary chemical testing device located within the
county wherein the arrest was made; or (ii) There is no magistrate available
within the county wherein the arrest was made for the arraignment of the person
arrested.  A law- enforcement officer who is directing that a secondary
chemical test to be conducted has the authority to transport the person
arrested to where the secondary chemical testing devices is located.
   (g)   If the arresting officer lacks proper training in the administration
of a secondary chemical test, then any other law-enforcement officer who has
received training in the administration of the secondary chemical test to be
administered may, upon the request of the arresting law-enforcement officer and
in his or her presence, conduct the secondary test.  The results of a test
conducted pursuant to this subsection may be used in evidence to the same
extent and in the same manner as if the test had been conducted by the
arresting law-enforcement officer.
   (h)   For the purpose of this article, “law enforcement officer” or “police
officer” means and is limited to any member of the Police Department of this
City.  Only the person actually administering or conducting such test shall be
competent to testify as to the results and veracity of such tests.  (Ord. 13-

333.04  INTERPRETATION AND USE OF CHEMICAL TEST.
   (a)   Upon trial for the offense of driving a motor vehicle in this City
while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, or upon
the trial of any civil or criminal action arising out of acts alleged to have
been committed by any person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, a controlled substance or drugs, evidence of the amount of alcohol
in the person’s blood at the time of the arrest or of the acts alleged, as
shown by a chemical analysis of his or her blood, or breath, is admissible, if
the sample or specimen was taken within the time period provided in subsection
(g).
   (b)   The evidence of the amount of alcohol in the person’s blood at the
time of the arrest or the acts alleged shall give rise to the following
presumptions or have the following effect:
      (1)   Evidence that there was at that time five hundredths of one percent
(.05%) or less, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, shall be prima facie
evidence that the person was not under the influence of alcohol;
      (2)   Evidence that there was, at that time more than five hundredths of
one percent (.05%) and less than eight hundredths of one percent (.08%) by
weight of alcohol in the person’s blood shall be relevant evidence, but it is
not to be given prima facie effect in indicating whether the person was under
the influence of alcohol;
      (3)   Evidence that there was, at that time, eight hundredths of one
percent (.08%) or more, by weight of alcohol in his or her blood, shall be
admitted as prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of
alcohol.
   (c)   A determination of the percent, by weight, of alcohol in the blood
shall be based upon a formula of:
      (1)   The number of grams of alcohol per one hundred cubic centimeters of
blood;
      (2)   The number of grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of
breath; or
      (3)   The number of grams of alcohol per eight-six milliliters of serum.
   (d)   A chemical analysis of blood for the purpose of determining the
controlled substance or drug concentration of a person’s blood, must include,
but is not limited to, the following drugs or classes of drugs;
      (1)   Marijuana metabolites;
      (2)   Cocaine metabolites;
      (3)   Amphetamines;
      (4)   Opiate metabolites;
      (5)   Phencyclidine (PCP);

      (10)   Synthetic narcotics
   (e)   A chemical analysis of a person’s blood, or breath, in order to give
rise to the presumptions or to have the effect provided for in this section,
must be performed in accordance with methods and standards approved by the
State Bureau for Public Health.  A chemical analysis of blood to determine
alcoholic content or the controlled substance or drug content of blood shall be
conducted by a qualified laboratory or by the State Police Scientific
Laboratory of the West Virginia State Police Forensic Laboratory.
   (f)   The provisions of this article shall not limit the introduction in any
administrative or judicial proceeding of any other competent evidence bearing
on the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs.
   (g)   For the purpose of the admissibility of a chemical test under
subsection (a):
      (1)   A sample or specimen taken to determine the alcohol concentration
of a person’s blood, must be taken within two hours from the time of the
person’s arrest; or
      (2)   For a sample or specimen to determine the controlled substance or
drug content of a person’s blood, must be taken within four hours of the
person’s arrest.
   (h)   The results of any test administered pursuant to this section for the
purpose of detecting the concentration of any controlled substance shall not be
admissible as evidence in a criminal prosecution for the possession of a
controlled substance.
(Ord. 13-50.  Passed 9-17-13.)
333.05  TAKING A CHILD INTO CUSTODY.
   (a)   A preliminary breath analysis may be administered to a child whenever
a law enforcement official has reasonable cause to believe the child to have
been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood,
for the purpose of determining the child’s blood alcohol content.  Such breath
analysis must be administered as soon as possible after the law enforcement
officer arrives at a reasonable belief that the child has been driving a motor
vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood.  Any preliminary breath
analysis administered pursuant to this subsection must be administered with a
device and in a manner approved by the Division of Health for that purpose.  If
a preliminary breath analysis is administered, the results shall be used solely
for the purpose of guiding the officer in deciding whether the child, at the
time of driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or her
blood of two hundredths of one percent or more, by weight, and should therefore
be taken into custody to administer a secondary test in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
   (b)   A child may be taken into custody by a law enforcement official
without a warrant or court order if the official has reasonable grounds to
believe the child to have been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of
alcohol in his or her blood.  If a preliminary breath analysis is administered
and the results of the analysis indicate that the child has an alcohol
concentration in his or her blood of less than two hundredths of one percent,
by weight, the child may not be taken into custody unless other grounds exist
under West Virginia Code 49-5- 8(b).  Upon taking a child into custody pursuant
to the provisions of this section, the official shall take all reasonable steps
to cause notification to be made to the child’s parent or custodian or, if the
parent or custodian cannot be located, to a close relative.
   (c)   Upon taking a child into custody pursuant to this section, the
official shall take the child to a facility where a secondary test of the
child’s blood or urine may be administered at the direction of the official or
a test of the child’s breath may be administered by the official.  The law
enforcement agency by which such law enforcement official is employed shall
designate whether the secondary test is a test of either blood, breath or
urine.  Provided, that if the test so designated is a blood test and the child
refuses to submit to the blood test, then the law enforcement official taking
the child into custody shall designate in lieu thereof a breath test to be
administered.  Notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-7, a
refusal to submit to a blood test only shall not result in the revocation of
the child’s license to operate a motor vehicle in this State.  Any child taken
into custody pursuant to this section shall be given a written statement
advising him or her that a refusal to submit to a secondary test of either
blood, breath or urine, as finally designated by the law enforcement agency or
official in accordance with this subsection, will result in the suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this State for a period of at
least thirty days or a revocation of the license for a period up to life.
   (d)   If at any point in time the Morgantown Police Department does not have
available the testing equipment or facilities necessary to conduct any
secondary test which may be administered pursuant to the provisions of this
section, then the official who took the child into custody may request another
qualified person to administer a secondary breath test; provided, that the
breath test shall be administered in the presence of the official who took the
child into custody.  The results of such breath test may be used in evidence to
the same extent and in the same manner as if such test had been conducted by
the law enforcement official who took the child into custody.  The qualified
person administering the breath test must be a member of the Division of Public
Safety, the sheriff of the county wherein the child was taken into custody or
any deputy of such sheriff, or a law enforcement official of another
municipality within the county wherein the child was taken into custody.  Only
the person actually administering the secondary breath test is competent to
testify as to the results and veracity of the test.  If the secondary test is a
blood test the test shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of
West Virginia Code 17C-5-6.
   (e)   After taking the child into custody, if the law enforcement official
has reasonable cause to believe that the act of the child in driving the motor
vehicle is such that it would provide grounds for arrest of an offense defined
under the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-2 if the child were an adult,
then the official shall proceed to treat the child in the same manner as any
other child taken into custody without a warrant or court order, in accordance
with the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-8.
   (f)   If the results of any secondary test administered pursuant to this
section indicate that the child, at the time of driving the motor vehicle, had
an alcohol concentration in his or her blood of eight hundredths of one percent
or less, by weight, and if the law enforcement official does not have
reasonable cause to believe that the act of the child in driving the motor
vehicle is such that it would provide grounds for arrest for an offense defined
under the provisions of this article if the child were an adult, then the
official shall release the child: Provided, that if the results of any
secondary test administered pursuant to this section indicate that the child at
the time of driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or
her blood of two hundredths of one percent or more, by weight, the child shall
only be released to a parent or custodian, or to some other responsible adult.

345.35  OPERATION OF VEHICLES WITH SAFETY BELTS.
   (a)    A person shall not operate a passenger vehicle on a public street or
highway unless the person, any passenger in the back seat under eighteen years
of age, and any passenger in the front seat of such passenger vehicle is
restrained by a safety belt meeting applicable federal motor vehicle safety
standards. For the purposes of this section, "passenger vehicle" means a motor
vehicle which is designed for transporting ten passengers or less, including
the driver, except that such term does not include a motorcycle, a trailer or

models and newer.
   (b)    The required use of safety belts as provided herein does not apply to
a duly appointed or contracted rural mail carrier of the United States Postal
Service who is actually making mail deliveries or to a passenger or operator
with a physically disabling condition whose physical disability would prevent
appropriate restraint in such safety belt if the condition is duly certified by
a physician who shall state the nature of the disability as well as the reason
such restraint is inappropriate. Any regulations or rules which may be adopted
by the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles establishing a method to
certify any such physical disability and to require the use of an alternative
restraint system where feasible or to waive the requirement for the use of any
restraint system shall be hereby adopted by reference.
 
   (c)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, no
points may be entered on any driver's record maintained by the Division of

347.01  OVERSIZE OR OVERWEIGHT VEHICLES.
   (a)   General Prohibition. 
      (1)   No person shall operate or move a vehicle or combination of
vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified
in West Virginia Code Article 17C-17 upon any street or highway within the
Municipality, except pursuant to special written permit issued by the
Commissioner of Highways or the City Manager.  Every such permit shall be
carried in the vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall
be open to inspection by any police officer.
(2)   No holder of a permit issued by the Commissioner of Highways shall be
required to obtain any local permit or license or pay any local fee or charge
for movement on any State route within the Municipality; however, it shall be
unlawful to operate any such vehicle or combination of vehicles upon any
roadway within the Municipality which is not a State route, except as provided
in subsection (c) hereof.
   
   (b)   Five-ton Limitation on Local Streets.  Whenever it becomes apparent to
the City Manager that any street is being destroyed or permanently injured by
the operation thereover of commercial vehicles, in excess of ordinary wear and
tear, he has authority to close any such street to vehicles whose gross weight,
including load, exceeds five tons.  When any street has been so closed by the
City Manager, and notice of such closing posted at the entries thereto, it
shall, during the continuance of such closing, be unlawful for any person to
operate thereupon any vehicle whose gross weight exceeds five tons.  Any street
so closed by the City Manager shall be promptly reported to Council.
   (c)   Local Permit and Conditions.  Upon application and for good cause, the
City Manager may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets.
No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the Commissioner
of Highways for the movement of the vehicle or combination of vehicles on
streets or highways under local jurisdiction; however, the approval of the
Commissioner of Highways shall be required for movement upon State routes as
provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   The City Manager may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such
period of time, not to exceed one year, as the City Manager in his discretion
deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project.  The City
Manager may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such
vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or
such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public
peace, property, health and safety.  The City Manager may require the posting
of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway
or road structure.
   For each such permit, the City Manager shall charge twenty-five dollars
($25.00) and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by each police
officer in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay
thirty-six dollars ($36.00).
   Signs shall be posted indicating “no thru trucks - gross weight 5 tons” or
words of similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by
subsection (b) hereof.  No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on
any such sign.
   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit
granted by the City Manager shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit, and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalty prescribed by Section
303.99.

hundred dollars ($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any

plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection shall be fined two
hundred dollars ($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any
other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred
dollars ($300.00); and upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in
addition to any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces.  Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage.  The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle.  The photographs must show the
vehicle in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. 
Within the discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers
may issue citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the
illegally parked vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement
agency, who may issue a citation, which includes the photographs and the form,
to the owner of the illegally parked vehicle.  Volunteers shall be trained on
the requirements for citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or
designated accessible parking areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (k)   The Municipality in enforcing this section shall retain all fines and
associated late fees.  These revenues shall be used first to fund the

free handicapped parking space on any metered City street is two hours. 
Vehicles parking in excess of two hours shall be cited as follows:

(1967 Code Sec. 20-98.)
363.04  DESIGNATION OF PARKING SPACES; PARKING WITHIN SPACES.
   The City Manager is hereby directed to mark off individual parking spaces,
each for a single vehicle, in the parking meter zones designated and described
in this article, and in such other zones as may hereafter be established. Such

space shall cease and the operator, owner, possessor, driver or manager thereof
shall be subject to the penalties provided for the violation of this article.
(Ord. 16-31.  Passed 7-19-16.)
363.06  OPERATION OF METERS; DEPOSIT OF COINS; UNLAWFUL PARKING.

police officer or traffic control sign or signal, or for such periods as may be
ordered and directed by a written order of Council to the contrary, when any
vehicle is parked in any parking space alongside or next to which a parking
meter is located, the operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering such
parking meter space, immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in such meter
such proper coin of the United States as is required for such parking meter and
as is designated by the proper directions upon the meter, and when required by
the directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the deposit of
the proper coins, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism on such
meter in accordance with directions properly appearing thereon, and failure to
deposit such coins, and to set the timing mechanism in operation when so
required, shall constitute a violation of this article.  Upon the deposit of
such coin and the setting of the timing mechanism in operation when so
required, the parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the
period of time which has been prescribed for that part of the street upon which
such parking space is located; provided, that any person placing a vehicle in a
parking meter space adjacent to a meter which indicates that unused time has
been left on such meter by the previous occupant of the space shall not be
required to deposit a coin so long as the occupancy of such space does not
exceed the indicated unused parking time.
   If any vehicle remains parked in any parking space beyond the parking time
limit set for such parking space, and if the meter shall indicate such illegal
parking, then such vehicle shall be considered as parking overtime and beyond
the period of legal parking time, and such parking shall be deemed a violation
of this article.  The presence of any vehicle in any parking meter space at any
time within the hours and the periods provided in this article when the signal
on the parking meter installed at such parking meter space shows that the
lawful parking time for the parking of such vehicle has expired shall be
considered prima facie evidence of unlawful parking and a violation of this
article.

restrictions in certain designated areas of the City on public streets.

use the limited public resource of right-of-way curbspace within residential
areas by restricting the use of such space for automobile parking; promote a

dog. The policy shall contain a provision requiring that the City be notified
immediately by the agent issuing the policy in the event that the insurance
policy is canceled, terminated or expires. The liability insurance or surety
bond shall be obtained prior to the issuing of a permit to keep a dangerous
dog. The dog owner shall sign a statement attesting that he shall maintain and
not voluntarily cancel the liability insurance policy during the twelve (12)
month period for which a permit is sought, unless he ceases to own or keep the
dog prior to the expiration date of the permit period. The owner shall provide

notify the City Manager immediately if such dog escapes from its enclosure or

if the dog bites or attacks a person or domestic animal.
(i)   Failure to Comply. It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any owner
of a dangerous dog registered with the City Manager to fail to comply with the
requirements and conditions set forth in this Section. An owner or keeper of a
dangerous dog who fails to register the dog shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and fined two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00). Each day that the dangerous
dog is not registered shall be a separate offense. The fine for any other
violation of this section, for which a specific fine amount has not been set
forth, shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00) with each day that the offense
continues being a separate citable offense. Any dog found to be in violation of

any meeting of the governing body of any political subdivision of this state or
a division or agency thereof, or of any school, literary society, or place of

   Nothing described herein shall be interpreted or construed to prevent any
constitutionally protected activity including but not necessarily limited to
exercise of one's constitutionally guaranteed rights of freedom of speech or
assembly. No person may be convicted under this section when his sole intent
for engaging in the activities for which he was arrested was to exercise one or
more of the rights guaranteed to him under the Constitution of the United
States or the State Constitution or to exercise any other rights guaranteed to
that person by law.
(Ord. 7-2-80.)
509.02  AGGRESSIVE SOLICITATION.
   (a)   Legislative Purpose. 
      (1)   City Council finds that the increase in aggressive solicitation
throughout the City has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents
and businesses, and has contributed not only to the loss of access and
enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation
and disorder.
      (2)   City Council is enacting this City Code section pursuant to the
City’s plenary power and authority as set forth in West Va. Code 8-12-5 (13), 
8-12-5 (23), and  8-12-5 (44).  This law is timely and appropriate because
current laws and City regulations are insufficient to address the
aforementioned aggressive solicitation problem.
      (3)   This City Code section is not intended to limit any persons from
exercising their constitutional right to solicit funds, picket, protest or
engage in other constitutionally protected activity.  Rather, its goal is to
protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of
solicitation that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the
City.
   (b)   Definitions.  For purposes of this City Code section:
      (1)   “Solicit” means to request an immediate donation of money or other
thing of value from another person, regardless of the solicitor’s purpose or
intended use of the money or other thing of value.  The solicitation may be,
without limitation, by the spoken, written or printed word, or by other means
of communication.
      (2)   “Aggressive manner” means:
         A.   Intentionally or recklessly making any physical contact with or
touching another person in the course of the solicitation without the person’s
consent, or
         B.   Following the person being solicited, if that conduct is:
            1.   Intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the
person’s possession; or
            2.   Intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person
being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation, or
         C.   Continuing to solicit within five feet of the person being
solicited after the person has made a negative response, if continuing the
solicitation is:
            1.   Intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the
person’s possession; or
            2.   Intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person
being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation, or
         D.   Intentionally or recklessly blocking the safe or free passage of
the person being solicited or requiring the person to take evasive action to
avoid physical contact with the person making the solicitation; or
         E.   Intentionally or recklessly using obscene or abusive language or
gestures:
            1.   Intended to or likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the
person’s possession; or
            2.   Words intended to or reasonably likely to intimidate the
person into responding affirmatively to the solicitation, or
         F.   Approaching the person being solicited in a manner that is:
            1.   Intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the
person’s possession; or
            2.   Intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person
being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation.
      (3)   “Automated teller machine” means a device, linked to a financial
institution’s account records, which is able to carry out transactions,
including, but not limited to:  account transfers, deposits, cash withdrawals,
balance inquiries, and mortgage and loan payments.
      (4)   “Public area” means an area to which the public or a substantial
group of persons has access, and includes, but is not limited to, alleys,
bridges, buildings, driveways, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, plazas,
sidewalks, and streets open to the general public.
   (c)   Prohibited Acts.  It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit money
or other things of value, or to solicit the sale of goods or services:
      (1)   In an aggressive manner in a public area;
      (2)   Within fifteen feet of any entrance or exit of any bank or within
fifteen feet of any automated teller machine abutting a public right-of-way
during the hours of operation of such bank or automated teller machine.
      (3)   On private property if the owner, tenant, or lawful occupant has
asked the person not to solicit on the property, or has posted a sign clearly
indicating that solicitations are not welcome on the property.
   (d)   Construction and Severability.
      (1)   Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of
this City Code section.  If any subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this
City Code section is held invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then such judgment shall in no way affect or impair the validity
of the remaining portions of this City Code section.
      (2)   This City Code section is not intended to prohibit any demand for
payment for services rendered or goods delivered.
      (3)   This City Code section is not intended to create a result through
enforcement that is absurd, impossible or unreasonable.  The City Code section
should be held inapplicable in any such cases where its application would be
unconstitutional under the Constitution of the State of West Virginia or the
Constitution of the United States of America.
   (e)   Penalty.  Any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of
this City Code section shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense, and a separate
offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation
occurs or continues.

Chapter Seven
 
526.01  DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   The City finds that unregulated parking of motor vehicles and other personal
property in grassy or otherwise unimproved areas of front and side yards, as
well as the use of unimproved driveways within front and side yards, causes
ruts, ditches, and mud holes that are unsightly and detract from the values of
other properties within any such neighborhood, and that the placement and
movement of motor vehicles and other personal property within grassy or
otherwise unimproved areas of front and side yards, creates potential danger to
the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.  As a result, the City
finds it necessary to regulate the same through the adoption of this article.

yard parking area or driveway meets the requirements of this article, it shall
be the duty of the City Engineer to examine the same and render an opinion. 
Should any property owner allow an improved area to deteriorate to a point
where in the judgment of the City Engineer the area no longer meets the intent
and purpose of an improved area as described in this article, the City Engineer
shall inform the property owner in writing of said deterioration and therein
describe what needs to be done in order to correct the situation. Any property
owner who disagrees with the City Engineer’s decision regarding their realty,
within 10 days of receiving the City Engineer’s written decision, may appeal

side yard for purposes otherwise prohibited by this article.  For that reason
the provisions of this article shall not apply to the temporary (less than 12
hours) parking of a motor vehicle or utility trailer within the yard for
purposes of loading and unloading materials or equipment; nor shall it apply to
temporary parking of motor vehicles or utility trailers used in conjunction
with permitted construction or repair activities on the premises.
   In addition to the foregoing paragraph, should a property owner or occupant
of a structure desire to utilize a front or side yard in a manner prohibited by
this article, that individual shall be allowed to file a written request for
permission to do so with the City Manager.  Should the City Manager determine,
based upon the particular facts applicable to the request in question, that the
request should be granted, the City Manager shall notify the applicant in
writing that his or her request has been approved.  The City Manager’s letter
of approval shall set forth the specific date and time period for which the
exception to the parking requirements of this article will be allowed, and
additional conditions that the City Manager may deem necessary.  No such
exception shall be for a period of more than 12 hours.

   Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be punished
in accordance with Section
501.99(a) of the City Code.  Each day such violation exists shall constitute a

court of competent jurisdiction in those cases in which a property owner
refuses to comply with the requirements of this article or a decision by either
the City Engineer or City Manager regarding the same.

club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (b)   "Gravity knife" means any knife that has a blade released from the

other locking or catching device.
   (c)   "Knife" means an instrument, intended to be used or readily adaptable
to be used as a weapon, consisting of a sharp-edged or sharp-pointed blade,
usually made of steel, attached to a handle, which is capable of inflicting
cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds.  "Knife" includes, but is not limited to,
any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and one-half
inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any other
instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds.  A pocket
knife with a blade three and one-half inches or less in length, a hunting or
fishing knife carried for hunting, fishing, sports or other recreational uses,
or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement shall not be
included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless such knife is
knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury or
death.
   (d)   "Switchblade knife" means any knife having a spring-operated blade
which opens automatically upon pressure being applied to a button, catch or
other releasing device in its handle.

instrument, without reference to the metal or other substance or substances
from which the metallic or false knuckles are made.

the barrel, designed to be aimed and fired by the use of a single hand.

   For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a tax return or an

the Director, any books, papers, records, memoranda, or other documents bearing
upon the matters required to be included in the return and may require the

(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 10-19-04.)
735.14  UNIFORM RULES.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former Section
735.14 was repealed by Ordinance 04-35, passed October 19, 2004.)
735.15  IMPOSITION OF PRIVILEGE TAX.
   There is hereby levied and shall be collected by the City annual privilege
taxes against the persons, on account of the business and other activities, and
in the amounts to be determined by the application of rates against the values
or gross income as set forth in Sections
735.16 to
735.26.
   If any person liable for any tax under Section
735.16 or
735.17 shall ship or transport his products or any part thereof out of the City
without making sale of such products, the value of the products in the
condition or form in which they exist immediately before transportation out of
the City shall be the basis for the assessment of the tax imposed in such
sections; provided, however, that no person shall be liable for any tax under
the provisions of this section for merchandise delivered from the place of
manufacture in the City to a warehouse or distributing point in another
municipality within this State; provided, that such warehouse is wholly owned
and operated by the person manufacturing such merchandise or manufactured
products in this City.  The Director shall prescribe equitable and uniform
rules for ascertaining such value.
   In determining value, however, as regards sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation between the buyer and the seller is such that the gross proceeds from
the sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the
sale, the Director shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for determining
the value upon which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as
nearly as possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of
like quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer or
seller but the circumstances and conditions are otherwise similar.
   Gross income included in the measure of the tax under Sections
735.16 and
735.17 shall neither be added nor deducted in computing the tax levied under
the other sections of this article.
   A person exercising any privilege taxable under Section
735.16 or

   The taxes levied under this article shall be payable quarterly.  The
taxpayer shall, by the last day of the month following the expiration of each
quarter of the tax year make a return to the Director showing the gross
proceeds of the sales or gross income of the business, trade, calling,
profession or other activity,  as the case may be, for such quarterly period
and compute the amount of the tax chargeable against him in accordance with the
provisions of this article.  Forms for making such returns may be obtained by
request at the office of the Director.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Director deems it beneficial for any legitimate tax administration purpose, the
Director may require or allow the return of any payment under this section for
periods other than quarterly, but in no event exceeding an annual period.
   The Director, upon approval from the City Manager, may grant a reasonable
extension of time for payment of tax or any installment, or for filing the
fourth quarter return or quarterly return required pursuant to this article, on
such terms and conditions that he may require.  No such extensions shall exceed
six months.
   The Director, upon approval from the City Manager, may extend the time for
payment of an amount determined as a deficiency for a period not to exceed
twelve months from the date designated for payment of the deficiency.  An
extension of this time may be granted only where it is clearly established to
the satisfaction of the Director that the payment of a deficiency upon the date
designated for payment would result in undue hardship.
   If any extension of time is granted for payment of tax or deficiency, the
Director may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond or other security, in an
amount not exceeding twice the amount for which the extension of time for
payment is granted on such terms and conditions as the Director may require.

misrepresentation of a material fact:

public inspection and shall be treated as confidential and neither the
Director, nor any other officer, or employee of the City shall disclose to the
public, nor to any person, directly or indirectly, any information or data
contained in such individual returns, except as such disclosures may be deemed
necessary by the Director in the enforcement of the provisions of this article,
in the punishment or violation thereof, or in the investigations of any
supposed violation of the same, or as the same may be required in any
legislative or judicial proceeding, and a failure to comply with these
provisions shall be a violation of this article, and subject the violator to
the penalties provided therefor.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Director may permit the proper officer,
or his authorized representative, of the United States or the State, or any
political subdivision of the State, to inspect returns filed with the City or

addresses and amounts paid by them to any subcontractors employed and suppliers
of materials used upon any job or to do any work within the City.  The Director
may also require every person engaging or continuing within the City in the
business of contracting who is a non-resident of the State to pay or guarantee
the payment of the amount of the privilege tax imposed by this article for the
privilege of engaging in the business of contracting within the City.  Such
payment of such tax to be based upon the amount of the building permit issued
by the City for the work to be performed by such person, as a condition
precedent to the issuance of such building permit.  In lieu of such prior
payment in cash of such tax, any such nonresident may guarantee the payment of
such privilege tax provided for herein by delivering to the City a bond, with

   Any person, firm or corporation contracting with a person, firm or
corporation engaged in a business or service taxed under this article shall
withhold payment in sufficient amount to cover taxes assessed by this article
in the final settlement of such contracts until the receipt of a certificate
from the Director to the effect that all taxes levied and accrued under this
article against the contractor have been paid.
   If any person, firm or corporation fails to withhold as provided herein he
shall be personally liable for the payment of such taxes, and the same shall be
recoverable by the Director by appropriate legal proceedings.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 10-19-04.)
735.2904 JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   If the Director believes that the collection of any tax which is required to
administer will be jeopardized by delay, the Director may thereupon make a
jeopardy assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment.  The
amount assessed shall be immediately due and payable.  Unless the taxpayer
against whom a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment within
twenty days after service of the notice of the jeopardy assessment, such an
assessment becomes final.
   A petition for reassessment by a person against whom a jeopardy assessment
has been made must be accompanied by such security as the Director may deem
necessary to insure compliance with this article.
   In every case where a timely petition for reassessment of a jeopardy
assessment as above described is filed, the Director shall assign a time and
place for the hearing of same and shall notify the petitioner of such hearing
by written notice at least ten days in advance thereof and such hearing shall
be held within thirty days from the filing of the petition for reassessment
unless continued by agreement or by the Director for good cause.  The hearing
shall be informal and shall be conducted in an impartial manner by the
Director.  After any such hearing the Director shall, within a reasonable time,
give notice in writing of his or her decision.  Unless an appeal from the
decision of the Director is made pursuant to the provisions of Section

administrative or judicial review. 
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 10-19-04.)
735.291 JUDICIAL REVIEW.

735.2904.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 10-19-04.)
735.30  TAX CUMULATIVE, ETC.
   The tax imposed by this article shall be in addition to all other licenses
and taxes levied by law, other provisions of the City Code or other ordinances
as a condition precedent to the right of any person to engage or continue in
any business, profession, trade, calling or other activity within this City.  A
person exercising a privilege taxable under this article, subject to the
payment of all licenses and charges which are conditions precedent to
exercising the privileges taxed, may exercise the privilege in this City for
the tax year upon the condition that he shall pay the tax accruing under this
article.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 10-19-04.)
735.31  REFUNDS AND CREDITS.
   Any taxpayer claiming to have overpaid any tax, interest or penalty imposed
by this article shall file its claim with the Director within three years after
the due date of the return in respect of which the tax was imposed, and not
thereafter.
   If as a result of the claim, the Director shall be of the opinion that the
tax, interest or penalty, or any part thereof, was overpaid, the Director shall
refund the same to the taxpayer or allow an overpayment credit in such amount,
at the taxpayer’s election.  If the Director denies the claim, the taxpayer may
within sixty (60) days after notice of denial file with the Director a petition
for refund or credit, which shall be heard in accordance with Section
735.034.  A taxpayer’s failure to abide by express procedures contained in this
section precludes taxpayer’s claim for refund or credit.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 10-19-04.)
735.99  INTEREST AND PENALTY.
   (a)   The tax imposed by this article, if not paid when due, shall bear
interest at the rate of at least eight percent per annum from the due date of
the return until paid.
   (b)   If any taxpayer fails to make the return or any quarterly installment
required by this article, or makes its return but fails to remit, in whole or
in part, the proper amount of tax, there shall be added to the amount of tax
unpaid, from the date such tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount
of five percent (5%) of the tax for the first month, or fraction thereof, of
delinquency, and one percent (1%) of the tax for each succeeding month, or
fraction thereof of delinquency provided, that if such failure is due to
reasonable cause, the Director may waive, in whole or in part, these
penalties.  Additionally, if the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to
evade any such tax there shall be added an additional penalty of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the tax owed, exclusive of penalties.
   (c)   Interest and penalties may be collected in the same manner as the tax
imposed by this article.

745.01  PURPOSE.
   The City Council of the City of Morgantown finds and concludes as follows
with respect to the service fee established by this Article:
   (a)    The improvement and maintenance of the public rights-of-way is an
essential municipal service provided by the City which is necessary to ensure
public health, safety, and welfare;
   (b)    The provision of police protection services is likewise an essential
municipal service provided by the City which is necessary to ensure public
health, safety, and welfare;
   (c)    These services are enjoyed by both residents and nonresidents of the
City who travel within the City due to their use of the public rights-of-way
for transportation and their reliance on municipal police services to respond
to and prevent criminal activity;
   (d)    These services are essential to the conduct of business, educational,
and nonprofit institutions with the City, and to the safe travel of the
employees, customers, and attendees of such institutions;
   (e)    The cost of funding these essential services should be supported, so
far as reasonably possible, by the users of the services;
   (f)    West Virginia Code section 8-13-13 grants municipalities that furnish
essential services, including the maintenance and improvement of the public
rights-of-way and the provision of police protection services, the plenary
power and authority to provide for the installation, continuance, maintenance
or improvement of the services, to make reasonable regulations of the services,
and to impose by ordinance upon the users of the services reasonable rates,
fees and charges to be collected in the manner specified in the ordinance;
   (g)    This ordinance creating Article
745  of the City Code and establishing a service fee for the services
identified in this Section is designed to place upon users of the services a
fee reasonably related to the use of the services;
   (h)   A substantial portion of the users of these services are nonresidents
of the City who are employed within the City, and employers within the City are
in possession of important employment information essential to the efficient
and effective collection of the service fee;
   (i)   The reasonable regulations to be established under this ordinance for
employer withholding and remittance of the service fee are central to the
effective collection of the service fee from all service users, which promotes
equity in the funding of these essential services;
   (j)   It is in the best interest of the City, its residents, and the users
of these essential services to impose the service fee to appropriately fund the
services;
   (k)    The fee established by this ordinance is designed to bear a direct
and reasonable relationship to the actual services provided in exchange for the
fee;
   (l)   The fee is warranted based on the anticipated use of these essential
services by the defined class of users due to their regular travel within the
City, and the fee will not impose an unfair or burdensome collection upon the
users based on their use of the services.

proceedings, to collect the fee; provided that the City shall not collect a
total amount, as to any Employee, greater than the amount of the service fee

   There is hereby levied and imposed an annual license tax upon all dealers in
and of nonintoxicating beer as defined in Section
757.01, which license period shall begin on July 1 of each year and end on June
30 of the following year, and if granted for a less period the same shall be
computed quarterly and proportioned to the remainder of the fiscal year, as
follows:
   (a)    Retail dealers shall be divided into two classes, a Class A license
and a Class B license. In the case of a retail dealer under a Class A license,
the license fee shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each place of
business within the City, except such license fee for a social, fraternal or
public club, not operating for profit, and having been in continuous operation
for two years or more immediately preceding the date of application, shall be
one hundred dollars ($100.00). Any such club to be eligible for such license
shall be a bona-fide club, with a limited membership, operated for the benefit
of all the members thereof, and not operated for the profit of any one or more
individuals, even though members of such club, and shall be a club in which the
property assets are actually owned in common by the members thereof, and shall
be a club for which bona-fide qualifications for membership are required and in
which temporary memberships are not sold for a fee. All the books of accounts
and records of any such club shall be open to examination and inspection by any
duly authorized officer or representative of the City, and upon the
consideration of an application for such club license or upon a hearing for the
revocation of any such club license all books of accounts and records of such
club shall be produced before Council, if so requested.
   A Class A license issued for a social, fraternal or public club, as herein
provided, shall authorize the licensee to sell nonintoxicating beer at retail
for consumption only on the licensed premises where sold. All other Class A
licenses shall authorize the licensee to sell nonintoxicating beer at retail
for consumption on or off the licensed premises. In the case of a Class B
retailer, there shall be two types of a Class B license. The fee for a Class B
license authorizing the sale of unchilled beer only shall be fifteen dollars
($15.00). The fee for a Class B license authorizing the sale of both chilled

shall authorize the licensee to sell nonintoxicating beer at retail in bottles,
cans or other containers only, and only for consumption off the licensed
premises. Sales under this license to any person at any time shall be in less
quantities than five gallons. Such license may be issued only to the proprietor
or owner of a grocery store. For purposes of this article, "grocery store"
includes any retail establishment commonly known as a grocery store, or
delicatessen, where food or food products are sold for consumption off the
premises.
   (b)   In the case of a distributor, a license fee shall be two hundred and
fifty dollars ($250.00) for each place of business within the City.
   (c)    To be eligible for a City license under this article the applicant
therefor shall have applied for and received a corresponding license from the
State and the revocation of any such license by the State shall have the effect
of revoking the corresponding City license and such City license shall
thereupon be known void and not operable or transferable.

shall require the consumer to pay the full amount of tax due upon the credit
sale at the time such sale is made or within thirty days thereafter.
   (d)   Notwithstanding that the total amount of such taxes collected by a
hotel operator may be in excess of the amount of which a consumer would be
liable by application of the levy provided under Section
767.02 for the occupancy of a hotel room or rooms, the total amount of all
taxes collected by any hotel operator shall be remitted to the City.
(Ord. 16-41.  Passed 8-16-16.)

906.03  OUTDOOR DINING PERMITS.
   The City Manager is authorized to issue permits for the use of public
rights-of-way for restaurant tables, chairs, and similar or related equipment
for the purpose of serving food and/or drink to the public (“Outdoor Dining
Permits”), including conditions upon the time or manner in which the permitted
area may be used, subject to the following conditions:
   (a)   An Outdoor Dining Permit may be issued only upon completion of an
application form prescribed by the City Manager or City Manager’s designee and
shall be required prior to placing tables, chairs, or any other equipment on
any public right- of-way.  Each initial or modified application form shall be
submitted with a nonrefundable administrative review fee of twenty-five dollars
($25.00).  Renewal applications shall not require an administrative review
fee.  Permits issued hereunder shall be valid from January 1 through December
31.  The permit fee for a nonpartitioned Outdoor Dining Permit shall be fifty
dollars ($50.00) for each year the permit is obtained.  The permit fee for a
partitioned Outdoor Dining Permit shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) for
each year the permit is obtained.  Permit fees are fees charged for the City
services necessarily provided to enforce the provisions of this article as to
each permitted area and do not constitute payment for a license or rental of
the area.
   (b)   As a condition of the Outdoor Dining Permit, tables and chairs on any
public right- of-way shall be acquired through the City or its designated
representative, unless the City Manager or City Manager’s designee approves the
use of other tables and chairs in writing.  The design and placement of tables
and chairs, as well as other equipment, shall comply with applicable
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and any applicable federal,
state, or local law.
   (c)   The proposed use shall not unreasonably interfere with pedestrian or
vehicular traffic or with access to parked vehicles, and in no event shall the
uses permitted by an Outdoor Dining Permit reduce the open portion of any
sidewalk to less than four feet in width.  The placement of items in the public
right-of-way shall comply with visibility requirements of the Planning and
Zoning Code.
   (d)   Prior to issuance of a permit, the application shall furnish to the
City Manager a dimensioned plan showing the right-of-way and all existing
public improvements and encroachments including but not limited to light posts,

racks, and newspaper boxes.  The diagram shall also include the location of the
curb relative to the building to be served by the permit and the proposed
location of all furniture and other equipment to be placed in the right-of-
way.  The applicant shall furnish all floor plans and approvals required by the
City, including Health Department or West Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control
Administration approvals if applicable.  Outdoor dining permits shall not be
issued for an area that would obstruct access to a fire hydrant, Fire
Department standpipe connection, fire escape, bus stop, loading zone, mail
boxes, or traffic signal stanchions.  Tables must be adjacent to the restaurant
requesting a permit.
(e)   No permits will be issued for off-site seating (i.e. seating in front of
another business).
   (f)   All equipment used to partition an area shall be sufficient to control
access to the permitted area, must be removable by the permittee during non-
operating hours, and must be of a design and construction acceptable to the
City.
   (g)   The permittee shall ensure that any consumption and possession of
alcoholic beverages in the area for which an Outdoor Dining Permit has been
issued complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including those of
the West Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Administration (WVABCA).  An area
for which an Outdoor Dining Permit that allows sales and consumption of
alcoholic beverages has been issued, and which is in compliance with all WVABCA
laws and regulations, shall be exempt from the prohibition on possession,
consumption, or sale of alcohol in public places stated in City Code Section
521.06 during the lawful hours of operation of the permitted area.  Consumption
and possession of alcoholic beverages shall only be permitted with a
partitioned Outdoor Dining Permit.
   (h)   In order to serve any beverage regulated by the WVABCA in an outdoor
dining permit area, the designated area must be included in the floor plan for
the licensed premises as approved by the WVABCA.  Any beverage regulated by the
WVABCA shall be served and consumed only on the enclosed or bounded portion of
the public right-of-way designated as an outdoor dining permit area.  Patrons
may not carry any beverage regulated by the WVABCA out of the outdoor dining
permit area.
   (i)   All applicable Health Department sanitation requirements shall be
followed for outdoor food handling.  The permittee shall be responsible for
posting the outdoor seating area as to any special Health Department
requirements.
   (j)   All rights-of-way encompassed by the Outdoor Dining Permit shall be
maintained by the permittee in a sanitary manner at all times.  Food, trash,

907.01  EXCAVATIONS GENERALLY.
   No public street, alley, highway, sidewalk, public way or public ground
within the City shall be dug into, opened or excavated, or the surface thereof
in any manner broken or injured for the benefit of any person, other than the
City itself, except as provided in this article, and except as provided in
Article
921 .
   Any person desiring to have any opening or excavation made in the surface of
a street, or to use the streets and alleys for his benefit, shall make an
application in writing to the City Manager therefor. Such application shall
give the name and address of the applicant, the location and purpose of the
opening or excavation and the time when such opening or excavation is to be
made. All such openings and excavations shall be made by the City or its
agents, employees or contractors.
   Upon approval thereof, the City Manager shall issue a work order or permit,
showing the work which is to be accomplished by the City for the applicant with
the estimated cost thereof and such other information as the City Manager may
deem pertinent. In any proper case, the City Manager may require the applicant
by bond or money deposit to insure the City of payment for the work before the
same is accomplished.
   Where any such opening or excavation, or other disturbance, is upon a paved
street, the applicant may also be required to pay to the City a service fee to
cover the cost of any permanent injury to the surface of such street.
   In addition to the fees, rates and charges above provided for, the City may
also make a proper charge, to be determined by the City Manager, for
reimbursement of the cost to the City for providing the necessary safeguards to
the traveling public, and for the protection of persons and property, while
such work is being accomplished.
   The applicant shall within ten days after the completion of the work pay to
the City its full costs therefor as may be required, and in the event the same
shall not be paid within such period of time the Director of Finance shall
cause a lien to be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court of the County
against any property which the applicant may own within the City.
   In the making of any such openings and excavations, all necessary safeguards
shall be used by the City or its contractor for the safety of vehicular and
pedestrian traffic, and for the protection of lives and property.
   The foregoing provisions of this section are subject to the proviso that, as
to any public utility company or other person having a current or existing
franchise with the City, or any Municipally-owned public utility providing
public water service to the residents of the City that any such franchised
public utility company, or other person, or any such Municipally-owned
waterworks maintaining its public service lines in, on, under, over or through
the streets and other public ways within the City may at its own cost open or
excavate in any street, alley, highway, avenue, public way or sidewalk for the
purpose of laying, maintaining, repairing, relaying or altering such public
service lines but only in such manner as may be authorized or required by its
franchise, or by such Municipally-owned waterworks system in such manner as the
City Manager may require consistent with the existing franchise ordinances of
the City; provided, however, that no franchised public utility having a
franchise with the City shall act as a contractor for, or shall do work under
the terms of this section for any person or public utility which does not have
a franchise with the City.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-10.)
907.02  ERECTION, INSTALLATION AND USE OF CONDUITS, POLES AND WIRES.
   No person, without a franchise or in lieu thereof a permit in writing issued

conduits, ducts, mains, pipes, cables, wires, manholes, posts, poles, supports,
towers, masts or other fixtures, devices or equipment in, on, upon, over, under
or along the streets, avenues, highways, sidewalks or other public ways or
public grounds within the City.
   Any person having been granted a franchise by the City shall erect,
construct, maintain and repair the same in accordance with the terms and
provisions of such franchise. Any other person desiring to erect, construct,
maintain or repair the same shall, before performing any such work make
application in writing to the City Manager for a permit to do and perform the
same. Such application shall show the name and address of the applicant, the
location, depth or height of the work to be accomplished, the date when such
work shall be started and completed, the nature thereof, and such other
information as the City Manager shall reasonably require.
   If the City Manager approves such application, he shall issue a written
permit showing the name and address of the applicant, the location and nature
of the work, and the date upon which the same shall be accomplished.
   No such application or permit shall be made or issued for more than a single
location.
Each application shall be accompanied by a fee as may be required by the City,
which fee may be determined to be the average cost of the administration of the
procedures established by this article and in the supervision, inspection and
approval of the work for which such application has been made.
   The person who has obtained a permit under this section shall report in
writing to the City Manager's office immediately upon completion of the work
outlined in such permit.

over, or for the use of any of the streets, alleys, highways, avenues,
sidewalks or other public grounds of the City under the provisions of Section
907.02 requires that barriers, barricades or other obstructions be erected on
or over the same, a separate application in writing shall be made for the
erection of such barriers, barricades or other obstructions, to the City
Manager. Such application shall show the name and address of the applicant, the
location of the work to be performed, the nature of the barrier, barricade or
obstruction to be erected, and such other information as the City Manager may
reasonably require. Fees necessary to reimburse the City for its costs in
investigation, inspection and supervision of the projects accomplished under
the provisions of this section may be required to accompany each such
application, which fees shall be based upon the time required for completion of
the project and the location thereof.
   Barrier fees may be chargeable from the time fixed in the application for
first erection of barricades until written notice of removal thereof is filed
with the City Manager.
   Upon approval of the application the City Manager shall issue a written
permit therefor and a copy of such permit shall be forwarded to the Police
Department at the time of the issuance of the same.
   The fees provided under this section are determined to be the present actual
cost in the administration of the provisions of this section, and in providing
for the services of the various departments of the City in the processing and
administration of applications and permits, in the regulation, supervision,
safeguarding and inspection of the location where any such barrier, barricade
or obstruction is erected.
   No person having a franchise with the City shall be required to make such
application or secure such permit, but shall erect any such barriers,
barricades or obstructions in accordance with the provisions of such franchise
and the applicable provisions of this Code and other ordinances of the City.
   Where the work to be accomplished under, upon, on or over any of the
streets, alleys, highways, avenues, sidewalks or other public grounds under the
provisions of Section
907.02 does not require the erection of barriers, barricades or other
obstructions but does involve the parking of one or more motor vehicles, or the
temporary storage of materials and equipment upon any such streets, alleys,
highways, avenues, sidewalks or other public grounds of the City, then in any
of such events the applicant or the person proposing to perform such work shall
obtain the same permit and pay the same fees as provided for the erection of a
barrier, barricade or other obstruction.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-12.)

repaired and used in and under any such street, alley, highway, avenue,
sidewalk or other public ground shall be placed to such depth below the surface
as shall be required by the standards and specifications of the Engineering
Department of the City.
   The requirements as to height or depth shall appear, when applicable, upon
each permit issued by the City Manager under the provisions of this article.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-13.)
907.05  COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN REGULATIONS.
   All equipment, devices and installations made under the provisions of this
article shall be subject to and comply with the applicable provisions and
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, the National Electrical
Code, the National Safety Code and the State Commissioner of Highways, as the
same now or may hereafter exist.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-14.)
907.06  FULL-TIME INSPECTORS.
   In the event that, in the discretion of the City Manager, it is necessary
that the City maintain an inspector in constant attendance upon any work
performed under the provisions of this article, then the applicant shall be
responsible for, and shall reimburse the City its full and total costs of such
inspector during the time that he is actually engaged upon such project in such
inspection, including the salary or wages of such inspector, retirement fund
benefits, social security benefits, workmen's compensation, all costs of
transportation incurred, and the reimbursement for any City equipment used by
such inspector in and about such project, like payments shall be made for any
such additional inspectors. If more than one inspector shall be necessary upon
such project, like payments shall be made for any such additional inspectors.

required under the provisions of this article may appeal the decision of the
City Manager to Council. Such appeal shall be prepared in writing stating why
the appellant is aggrieved, with the reasons therefor, and shall be filed with
the City Clerk within ten days from the date of the refusal of the City Manager

   (b)    Any person, firm or corporation desiring to have a street, roadway or
alley right of way opened for public use has a right to appeal the minimum
design recommended by the Engineering Department by submitting to the
Engineering Department design criteria data prepared by a registered
professional engineer of soil support values, traffic counts or vehicular load
factors using accepted engineering procedures. After review of such additional
data, the City Engineer shall again recommend the minimum design for the street
desired to be opened. If the person, firm or corporation appealing is therefor
dissatisfied with the City Engineer's recommended minimum design he shall
submit a request to Council within thirty days of the City Engineer's second
recommendation. Council shall promptly hold a public hearing, consider all the
data and the City Engineer's recommendation and by resolution adopt that design
in the City Street Design and Classification Manual that it finds appropriate.
   (c)    When a street is to be opened for development, the person opening the
street may delay the placement of permanent pavement until the construction
associated with the development is completed. The person making the request
shall arrange to place in an escrow account, the amount necessary to cover the
cost of placing the permanent pavement. The drainage, utility and base
requirements should be completed before development begins. The asphalt or
concrete pavement, sidewalks and curb, should be placed lastly, using the
escrow funds to pay for the construction.

910.04  EXISTING ACCESS AREAS.
   If at any time, after the adoption of this article, the vehicular traffic
from an existing access area onto a City street increases to the point that the
City Engineer believes that concerns for public safety warrant a review by the
City of the access point, the City Engineer shall notify the City Manager of
the same and if the City Manager is in agreement, he/she shall authorize the
City Engineer to contact the property owner in question, explain the basis for
the City’s concern and request a meeting with the property owner so as to
review the access point in light of the increased volume of vehicular traffic
and applicable access point regulations which have been established by the City
Engineer.  If the City Engineer should determine that the volume of traffic
utilizing the access point has increased to a point that public safety is
impacted, he/she shall have the authority to issue a written order to the
property owner which specifies what changes the property owner must make to
that portion of the access point, which is within the public right of way, so
as to conform with the City’s access point regulations.  The City Engineer
shall have the authority to set a date by which time the property owner shall
have complied with the order.  The property owner shall have the right to
request a waiver of the regulation, which shall be handled in the same manner
as set froth in Section

(1967 Code Sec. 29-19.)
911.03  BIDDER'S DEPOSIT, OPENING BIDS.
   All bids submitted pursuant to the notice for bids provided for by Section
911.02 shall be accompanied by a certified check payable to the City for the
amount of not less than three percent (3%) nor more than ten percent (10%) of
the aggregate bid. Such bids shall be opened and read publicly in Council.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-20.)
911.04  LETTING CONTRACT; CONTRACTOR'S BOND; RETURN OF DEPOSITS.
   Unless all bids referred to in Section
911.02 shall be rejected, the contract for the improvement of the street or
alley involved shall be let to the bidder whom Council may deem capable of
doing the work best for the public interest, considering responsibility,
equipment and organization. After Council shall have entered into contract with
such bidder, the Director of Finance shall at once return to all unsuccessful
bidders their checks or deposits. The successful bidder, within fifteen days
after the award of the contract to him, shall furnish bond with sureties to be
approved by Council in such penalty as Council shall fix not exceeding the
aggregate bid. After such bond shall have been given and approved, the deposit
made by the contractor shall be returned to him; otherwise the same shall be
forfeited for failure either to enter into contract or to furnish bond as
aforesaid.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-21.)
911.05  REJECTION OF BIDS AND PERFORMANCE OF WORK BY CITY.
   In case Council, after consideration of the estimated cost and
recommendations submitted by the City Manager, shall be of the opinion that no
bids received for the improvement of a street or alley are satisfactory and
that the work can be done by the City with its equipment and facilities in
better manner or at less cost to the public, Council shall have the right to
reject all bids and cause the work to be done by the City.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-22.)
911.06  ESTABLISHING GRADES AND PROPERTY LINES; PETITION FOR IMPROVEMENT.
   Before any street or alley is ordered paved, the grade and property lines
thereof shall be fixed and approved by Council, and the profile thereof
recorded.
   In case persons desire to have any street or alley paved upon their
petition, if no grade and property lines have been fixed and approved as
aforesaid, the persons owning a majority of the frontage shall file their
petition in writing requesting that the grade and property lines be surveyed
and determined by the City Engineer and approved by Council.
   After approval of the grade and property lines as aforesaid, persons owning 
a majority of the frontage may petition Council to order any street or alley
graded,  curbed or paved as provided in this article, which petition shall be
accompanied by the plan and profile showing the approved grade and property
lines and shall contain suitable provisions waiving all damages for the
improvement of the street in accordance with the established grade and property
lines thereof as shown upon such plan and profile. Petitions for the
improvement of streets or alleys may also contain offers of payment in cash or
annual installments of ten years or less; and Council may require that the
estimated cost of improvement of any street or alley shall be deposited before
the work is commenced. All petitions and profiles attached thereto shall be
recorded before the work authorized by Council is begun.
   Inasmuch as the proceeds of the sale of bonds may be used legally only for
paving purposes and not for alleged damages, it is provided that where a street
or alley has been improved according to the plan and profile approved by
Council before the work is begun, no claim for damages will be considered by
Council unless substantial changes in the grade have caused material injury to
the  abutting property or until it has been established by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the manner provided by law.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-23.)
911.07  ASCERTAINMENT OF LOT FRONTAGES PRIOR TO COMMENCING WORK.
   Before any work under this article petitioned to be done is commenced,
either under contract or by the City itself, the City Manager shall ascertain
the respective  frontages of lots abutting on such portion of such street or
avenue, and upon the completion of the work, the cost thereof shall be assessed
against the owners of  the respective properties abutting on such  portion of
such street in accordance with the terms of their petition, and the Finance
Director is hereby authorized and directed to collect such assessments in
accordance with such petition.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-24.)
911.08  COST AGAINST OWNERS OF ABUTTING PROPERTY.
   (a)    Assessment of Cost .  Upon completion of any improvement ordered by
Council under this article, it shall be the duty of the City Engineer to cause
the several frontages abutting upon the street or alley so improved to be
accurately measured and to calculate the cost  to be assessed against each
abutting owner and against any public service or public utility  company, and
to make report thereof to the City Manager. Upon such report the City Clerk
shall publish notice, and after hearing grievances, if any, Council shall
assess the entire cost of the improvement against the owners of the lots or
fractional parts of lots abutting on the part of the street or alley so
improved, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)    Provided, that where any street or alley improved as aforesaid is
occupied or used by any public service or public utility company under a
franchise or permit requiring it to pave and maintain part of the street or
alley occupied or used by it, the cost of paving or repaving such part shall be
assessed against it for payment in cash as provided by its franchise or permit,
and the remainder of the cost of such improvement, including the intersections
of cross streets and alleys, shall be assessed against the abutting property
owners according to their respective frontages, taking the entire distance the
street or alley is traversed by such company as the basis of such assessment. 
      (2)    Provided, that whenever the owners of a majority of the frontage
abutting on both sides of any street or alley improved as aforesaid shall have
petitioned Council to do so, Council shall assess the entire cost thereof
against the property owners abutting on the part so improved, including the
expense of grading the same and of grading and paving the intersections of
cross streets and alleys, taking the entire distance petitioned to be paved as
the unit.
      (3)    Provided, that if any street or alley shall be once graded and
paved with concrete or other permanent base at the cost and expense of the
owners of the property abutting thereon, they shall not be again assessed with
the cost of regrading or repaving the same within fifteen years after the
completion of such grading and paving.
         (1967 Code Sec. 29-25.)
   (b)    Payment of Assessments.  The amounts assessed against abutting land
owners under the provisions of this article shall, subject to the following
proviso, be paid in ten annual payments, that is to say, one-tenth of such
amount, together with interest on the whole assessment, shall be paid into the
City Treasury before May 1 next after such work is completed and such
assessments have been certified to the County Clerk, and a like one-tenth with
interest for one year upon the whole amount remaining unpaid on or before May 1
in each succeeding year thereafter until the whole has been paid. Provided,
however, that when any property owner shall have signed a petition for the
improvement of any street or alley as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
agreeing to pay for such improvement so requested in a period of less than ten
years from the time the assessment of the cost thereof shall become final, then
the land so owned by such petitioner shall be liable to an assessment of the
cost thereof to be paid in accordance with the agreement of such property owner
in such petition; and each of such installments whether they be ten or a less
number, beginning with the first, shall bear interest on the amount of such
installment at six percent (6%) per annum from the date of the record of same
in the office of the Clerk of the County Court until paid. Provided, however,
that any abutting owner so liable for any portion of the cost of such paving
shall have the right at any time after the same is certified as aforesaid to
the Director of Finance for collection to anticipate the payment of any or all
of such assessments  and shall be allowed to pay the face of such assessment
with interest at six percent (6%) per annum only to the time of payment.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-26.)
   (c)    Collection of Delinquent Assessments; Penalty; Lien.  To each of the
installments of assessments under this article remaining unpaid in the Finance
Director's hands on the days specified in this article for the payment thereof,
a penalty of ten percent (10%) shall be added and any assessment remaining
unpaid in such Director's hands on such date shall be taken up by Council on
such settlements had with the Director on such dates, and thereupon Council
shall place such assessments with the penalty added thereto, in the hands of
the Chief of Police and the Director of Finance who is ex-officio Tax
Collector, to be treated and considered and payment thereof enforced in the
same manner as is now provided  for the collection of City taxes and
assessments, and they shall be a lien upon the property liable therefor the
same as for taxes. The liens herein provided for shall have priority over all
other liens except those for taxes due the State and shall be on a parity with
taxes and assessments due the City.

913.01  DEFINITIONS.
   The term "sidewalk" includes all of the ground between the face of the curb
of any public street or alley and the property line of the abutting property
owner.  The term "sidewalk pavement" means that part of the sidewalk paved or
required to be paved, and may be only a portion of the full width of the
sidewalk as defined above.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-28.)
913.02  WIDTH OF SIDEWALKS.
   The sidewalks of the streets and alleys of the City shall be of such width
as Council may, upon recommendation of the City Engineer, establish by orders
duly made; and, unless otherwise ordered by Council, the sidewalks on the
opposite sides of any street or alley shall  be of equal width.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-29.)
913.03  DUTIES OF OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS.
   In all cases where there has been heretofore established, or where there is
hereafter established, one or more sidewalks along any street or alley or part
thereof within the City, it shall be the duty of the owners or occupants of any
ground fronting or abutting on such sidewalks to pave and repave the same,
whenever required by an order of Council to do so, and to keep such sidewalks
in repair and to keep the same clean.
   The property owners shall be responsible for any such sidewalk being out of
repair.
(Ord. 06-17.  Passed 6-20-06.)
913.04  GRADING AND PAVING.
   Sidewalks shall be graded and paved, and repaved or repaired, in the manner
and with the materials and according to the specifications as provided in this
article.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-31.)
913.05  PLACING SIDEWALK PAVEMENT ABOVE OR BELOW CURB ELEVATION.
   The paved portion of all sidewalks or the sidewalk pavement where there is
a  grass plot between it and the curb, may, at the direction of the City
Engineer with the approval of Council, be placed above or below the elevation
of the curb in order to conform as nearly as practicable to the topography of
the abutting land and street; provided, that the slope of such grass plot shall
not be steeper than one and one-half horizontal to one vertical. Where the
sidewalk pavement is placed above or below the elevation of the curb, the owner
of the corner lot shall provide concrete steps from such sidewalk pavement to
the curb, such steps to be of similar materials and workmanship as the sidewalk
pavement and the design thereof to be approved by the City Engineer.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-82.)
913.06  SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
   All sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete pavement according to the
following specifications:
   (a)    Width and Location.  Council shall be order prescribe the width of
all concrete sidewalk pavements hereafter paved or repaved, taking into
consideration the nature and class of traffic on such street and sidewalk. Such
sidewalk pavements shall not be less than three feet in width in R1, R2 and R3
Zoning Districts and within the public right of way as designated by the City
administration, so that the grass plot, if any, shall be between the sidewalk
pavement and the curb line of the street.
(Ord. 7-18-78.)
   (b)    Subgrade.  When the subgrade is composed of a fill it shall be laid
in layers, not exceeding twelve inches, and the same shall be thoroughly wetted
and tamped or rolled. The tops of all fills shall extend at least twelve inches
beyond the sidewalk pavement, and in cases where there are no curbs the slope
shall not be steeper than one and one-half to one.
   (c)    Drainage Course.  The drainage course shall consist of coarse
aggregate, as hereinafter defined, of a depth of not less than six inches,
except where solid rock is encountered, and shall be thoroughly compacted by
tamping or rolling.
   (d)    Concrete.  The concrete shall consist of a mixture of one part of
cement, as hereinafter defined, and three parts of fine aggregate, as
hereinafter defined, and three parts of coarse aggregate, as hereinafter
defined, to a depth of not less than four inches. It shall be worked to an
approximately true surface and shall be roughened. The concrete pavement shall
be monolithic and no mortar course shall be permissible for surface.
   (e)    Water Used.  All water used in mixing materials for sidewalk
pavements shall be clean and free from oil, acid, strong alkalies or vegetable
matter.
   (f)    Forms.  All forms used for setting sidewalk pavements shall be free
from warp, and of sufficient strength to resist springing out of shape. All
mortar and dirt shall be carefully removed from forms that have been previously
used. All forms shall be well staked to the established lines and grades, as
indicated by the stakes set by the City Engineer, and all forms shall be so set
as to provide for the specified slope of one-fourth of an inch to the foot
toward the curb.
   (g)    Expansion Joints.  Expansion joints shall be made three-fourths of an
inch wide for the whole of all sidewalk pavements, and shall be spaced at
intervals of not more than forty feet, and shall be filled with sand, felt, tar
or other suitable material. The wearing surface at all expansion joints shall
be cut clear through with a jointing tool.
   (h)    Drainage.  Where the drainage course is at the same elevation as, or
above the drainage course of the curb, a blind drain or ditch of suitable size
and filled with broken stone shall be laid with a proper degree of fall from
the bottom of the drainage course of all sidewalk pavements at such points as
will properly drain the water from the drainage course to the curb. Where the
drainage course of the sidewalk pavement is below that of the curb, a three
inch agricultural tile drain shall be laid in the lower part of the drainage
course, and vitrified tile drainage connection made from it to the storm sewer
in the street.
   (i)    Precautions Against Freezing.  Concrete shall not be mixed or
deposited at a freezing temperature, unless special precautions are taken to
avoid the use of materials that are frozen or covered with ice crystals, and
adequate means are provided to prevent the concrete from freezing after being
placed in position and until it is thoroughly hardened; and no such concrete
shall be mixed or deposited in freezing weather, without the written consent of
the City Engineer.
   (j)    "Cement", "Fine Aggregate" and "Coarse Aggregate" Defined. 
"Cement",  as used in this article, shall meet the requirements of the
specifications  for Portland cement, adopted by the American Society for
Testing Materials, as set forth in its bulletins and other publications. “Fine
aggregate”, as used in this article, shall consist of clean sharp sand, crushed
stone or gravel screenings, free from all vegetable loam or  other deleterious
matter. "Coarse aggregate", as used in this article, shall consist of inert
matter, such as crushed stone, brickbats, gravel or cold crushed slag. All such
materials shall be hard and durable and free from all deleterious matter.
      (1967 Code Sec. 29-34.)
913.07  PERMIT TO LAY SIDEWALK PAVEMENT.
   The owner of any property abutting on a public street shall, before laying
any sidewalk pavement on the part of such street intended to be used for
sidewalk purposes, apply to the City Manager for a permit therefor, and such
permit when granted shall show the location and width of such sidewalk pavement
and shall recite the specifications required therefor. If such application is
to lay a sidewalk pavement on a street within the fire limits on which the
width between the curbs of such street shall be paved has not been determined,
Council shall, before a permit is granted, specify by order, resolution or
ordinance the width of sidewalk  pavements on each side thereof, and the
location and width of grass plots, if any; and if a grade has not been
established on such street, Council shall not grant such permit until a grade
is established on such street by the City Engineer and adopted by Council. In
no case where a permit is granted to lay a sidewalk pavement shall the work be
commenced until the City Engineer shall have first set stakes or had the same
done under his direction, showing the exact location of the same. The City
Manager shall have the power and authority to grant such permits, without
referring the same to Council, and to report the same at the next meeting of
Council when it shall be made a matter of record.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-37.)
913.08  ORDER TO OWNER TO GRADE AND PAVE.
   Council may order the owner of any property abutting on any public street or
alley within this City to grade that part of the sidewalk of such street
abutting on such property, if not then already graded, and to construct thereon
a sidewalk pavement, the same to be constructed according to the specifications
therefor. Such grade shall conform to the adopted grade of such street. Such
order shall designate the width of such sidewalk pavement so ordered to be
constructed. The City Manager shall cause notice of such order to be served
upon the owner of such property, such notice to be served in the manner
provided by the laws of the State for the service of notices generally, or by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation published in the County in
the manner provided by the laws of the State for the publication of notices
generally.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-38.)
913.09  WORK TO BE DONE BY CITY; ASSESSMENT OF COSTS; LIEN.
   If any property owner shall have failed or refused to comply with the order
provided for by the preceding section within fifteen days after the service or
publication thereof, then the City Manager may cause such work to be done, and
the cost thereof, including a commission of not exceeding twenty percent (20%)
of the net cost thereof to the City for the time of City employees in
supervising such construction, laying the assessment therefor and collecting
the same, over and above the actual cost to the City of such work, shall be
assessed against such property. Such assessment shall bear interest at six
percent (6%) per annum and shall be immediately due and payable and may be
collected in the same manner provided by law for the collection of City taxes.
If such assessment is not paid within thirty days after the same is made, the
City Clerk may certify the amount of any such assessment with a description of
the property chargeable therewith, and the name of the owner thereof, to the
Clerk of the County Court to be recorded in the trust deed books of such
Clerk's office; and such assessment shall be and constitute from and after the
date of such recordation the first lien against such property, subject only to
State, County and Municipal taxes and prior assessments.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-39.)
913.10  REPAIRING AND REPAVING.
   All owners of property abutting upon a public street where there is a
sidewalk shall keep the sidewalk in good repair so as to minimize public or
private liability. Any concrete sidewalk which is broken or deteriorated to the
extent of needing repair shall be repaired by replacing the entire block or
section thereof and not by surface patching.
   The City Manager on his own initiative may or upon direction of Council
shall require any such property owner to make needed repairs by having served
upon such owner a notice as provided by Section
913.08. Each thirty day period during which the owner fails to comply with the
provisions hereof shall constitute a separate violation.
   When deemed proper by the City Manager, he may cause the repairs to be made
either by the City employees or by an independent contractor and assess the
cost thereof as a lien against the property as provided in Section
913.09.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-40.)
913.11  MAINTENANCE; REMOVAL OF SNOW, ICE AND DIRT.
   The owner, lessee or occupant of property abutting on any street shall keep
the sidewalk adjacent thereto in a clean and sanitary condition and free from
snow, ice, dirt or refuse. In the event the owner, lessee or occupant of any
property shall fail to keep the sidewalk adjacent to such property in a clean
and sanitary condition and free from snow, ice, dirt or refuse the City Manager
is hereby empowered and authorized to give notice to such property owner,
lessee or occupant to clean such sidewalk of snow, ice, dirt or refuse and to
put such sidewalk in a clean and sanitary condition, such notice to be served
as provided by Section
913.08, and upon the failure or neglect of such property owner, lessee or
occupant to put such sidewalk in a clean and sanitary condition and to remove
snow, ice, dirt or refuse therefrom within twenty-four hours, excluding Sunday,
after such notice has been given, the City Manager may cause the same to be
done and the cost thereof shall be assessed against such property and become a
lien upon such property in the manner provided by Section
913.09. 
(1967 Code Sec. 29-41.)
913.12  CONDEMNATION OF SIDEWALK PAVEMENT; ORDER TO RELAY; WORK BY CITY.
   When, in the judgment of Council, the public necessity may require it, any
sidewalk pavement may be condemned because of its unsafe condition, or because
it is not laid out of suitable materials or in the manner and according to the
specifications provided therefor; and the owner of the abutting property may be
required to relay the same, after notice of the order of Council, in the same
manner as provided by Section
913.08; and upon the refusal or failure of such property owner to do so, the
City Manager may cause the same to be done and the cost thereof assessed
against such property owner in the manner provided by Section
913.09, and such assessment shall become a lien against such property in the
manner provided by Section
913.09.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-42.)
913.13  REPAIR OR REPAVING WHEN PAVEMENT BROKEN.
   When any person shall break or injure any sidewalk pavement by driving a
truck or vehicle upon or over the same, or in any other manner, he shall be
required to repair it, or if necessary to relay the same and put it in as good
condition as it was before such injury occurred; and in the event of his
failure to do so, after being served with an order of Council requiring him to
do so, the City Manager may have such sidewalk repaired or relaid and the cost
of the same shall be charged against such person, and collected by legal
process; and where, in order to properly repair such broken or injured sidewalk
pavement, it is necessary to repave the same, such repaving shall be with the
materials and in the manner and according to the specifications set forth in
this article.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-43.)
913.14  SUPERVISION AND INSPECTION OF PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION; POWER TO STOP
IMPROPER WORK.
   All sidewalk pavements laid under the provisions of this article shall be
under the direct and immediate supervision and inspection of the City Engineer,
or his authorized representative. Any owner of property who may desire to lay a
sidewalk pavement or repair the same shall, upon being granted permission
therefor, notify the City Engineer of the time he expects to begin such work;
and when, in the judgment of the City Engineer such work is not being done with
the materials and in the manner and according to the specifications required by
this article, he shall have the power and authority to stop such work until
such owner indicates his willingness to do such work with the materials and in
the manner and according to the specifications required by this article.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-44.)
913.15  ROOMS OR SPACES UNDER SIDEWALKS.
   No person shall excavate or construct any room or space or use the space in
and under any sidewalk until and unless the owner of the property adjacent
thereto shall have first obtained a permit therefor from the City, such permit
to be granted by the City Manager and confirmed by Council; and the City
Manager and Council shall have full and absolute discretion in granting or
refusing such permit.
   In applying for such permit, the applicant shall furnish the design, plans
and specifications for the construction of such room or space intended to be
used under such sidewalk, and such design, plans and specifications shall be
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
   The space between the surface of the sidewalk and the ceiling of any room
constructed thereunder shall be not less than eighteen inches in thickness.
   Such property owner shall be responsible for the construction and
maintenance and safety of any such room under any sidewalk and of the sidewalk
over the same, and if any person or his property is injured or damaged as a
result of the construction or improper maintenance of any such space under any
sidewalk or the sidewalk thereover, the owner of the property adjacent thereto
shall protect and save harmless the City from any liability therefor.
     Where there now exists a space or room underneath any sidewalk used or
intended to be used in connection with the property adjacent thereto, it shall
be the duty of the owner of such adjacent property to maintain safely and to
keep in good repair such room or space under such sidewalk and the sidewalk
thereover, and to protect and save harmless the City from any and all liability
to any person who is injured or his property damaged by reason of the failure
of such property owner to maintain safely and keep in good repair any such room
or space under such sidewalk or the sidewalk thereover. 
   No openings, chutes or ways shall be made from the surface of the sidewalk
or street to any room or space under such sidewalk now or hereafter constructed
unless and until a permit therefor shall have been obtained from the City, such
permit to be granted by the City Manager and confirmed by Council. The design,
plans and specifications therefor shall be subject to approval by the City
Engineer. The doors or coverings to such openings, chutes or ways shall be of
design and constructed according to the approval of the City Engineer, and the
same shall  be maintained safely and kept in good repair by the property owner,
who shall be responsible for any injuries or damages to persons or property for
failure to do so and who shall protect and save harmless the City from any and
all liability therefor. Such openings, chutes and ways shall not be left open
and unguarded and it shall be the duty of the property owner in connection with
whose property the same are being used to protect persons and property from
injury or damage while such openings, chutes and ways are being used.
   If, upon inspection, any room or space heretofore or hereafter constructed
under any sidewalk shall be found to be in an unsafe or unsanitary condition,
Council may order the same to be repaired or put in a sanitary condition at the
expense of the owner of the adjacent property. If such property owner shall
fail to do so, Council may cause the same to be done and the cost thereof
charged against and collected from such property owner.
   The granting of any permit heretofore or hereafter for the construction and
maintenance of any space or room under any sidewalk or street in the City shall
not be construed as vesting or granting any permanent or perpetual right,
interest or title thereto in or to the owner of the adjacent property, but the
same is only a temporary privilege. Council may at any time without notice and
without the payment of any compensation or damages to the property owner annul
and revoke any permit theretofore granted therefor and take exclusive
possession of such space or room under such sidewalk and convert the same to
public use or cause the same to be abandoned, and, where necessary, cause the
same to be filled at the expense of the owner of the adjacent property. In such
event the adjacent property owner shall have no further right or privilege to
use such space or room.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-45.)
913.16  SIDEWALKS REQUIRED WHEN BUILDING CONSTRUCTED OR STREET PAVED.
   (a)    Findings of Council.  Council finds as a fact that sidewalks within
the City are deficient as to quantity and quality, which contributes to the
hazards confronting pedestrians and in order to initiate a program of providing
more sidewalks, it is declared to be the policy of the City to require, unless
otherwise directed, the construction or replacement of sidewalks for the use of
pedestrians within the City.
(1967 Code Sec. 29-68.)
   (b)    Order When Street or Alley Paved; Exception.  In furtherance of the
stated policy concerning sidewalks, Council shall order the construction or
reconstruction of a sidewalk or sidewalks at the same time that it orders the
paving or repaving of any street or alley as provided for by Article
911 , unless Council makes a special finding in such paving ordinance that
existing sidewalk or sidewalks are adequate or the physical characteristics of
the terrain, neighborhood or pedestrian traffic would not warrant the
construction or reconstruction of sidewalks, in which event the construction or
reconstruction of sidewalks in conjunction with the paving of the street or
alley shall be waived.
(1967 Code Sec.  29-69.)
   (c)    Required When Dwelling or Building Constructed; Exception.  In
addition to the requirements of this article, any person who obtains a permit
to construct a dwelling or building pursuant to the provisions of Part
Seventeen - Building and Housing Code, the plans shall include the construction
or replacement of a sidewalk or sidewalks. Should there be an existing adequate
sidewalk adjacent to the property on which construction is to take place and it
is so deemed by the City Manager, then this section shall be inapplicable. In
all other cases, a sidewalk shall be constructed or replaced unless on appeal
to the City Manager such requirement is waived by appropriate order.
(Ord. 1-16-79.)
913.99  PENALTY.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: See Section
101.99 for general Code penalty if no specific penalty is provided.)

(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.05  LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION.
   Nothing within this article is to be interpreted to read that the City or
any of its officers, agents or employees has accepted responsibility for
assuring that the public will be safe from injury from any tree within the
City.  The City recognizes that acts of God may intervene and that it is the
ultimate responsibility of the individual property owner to assure that trees
on his or her realty are maintained in a safe manner that does not endanger a
neighbor or the general public.  The City may be responsible for the condition
of trees on its publicly owned realty; however, it does not accept
responsibility or liability for damage caused by any tree located on private
property, state roads, or state rights of way.
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.06  JURISDICTION.
   The City Manager, or his/her designee,  shall have the right and duty to
prune, preserve or remove any tree or other plant existing upon any public
place when such tree, or part thereof, is so infected with any injury, fungus,
insect or other plant pathogens or when such tree, or part thereof, constitutes
an interference with travel.  The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall be
authorized to take such measures with regard to such trees or plants as he or
she deems necessary to preserve the function and preserve or enhance the beauty
of such public place.
   The City Manager, or his/her designee,  shall have the authority and it
shall be his/her duty to order the pruning, preservation or removal of trees
upon private property when such trees meet the definition of a "Hazardous Tree"
as defined within this article, are an obstruction as set forth in Section
917.18 , or have a root system that is damaging infrastructure, such as
sidewalks or streets within a public place.
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.07  APPEALS.
   Any action of the City staff pertaining to the directives of this article
may be appealed to the City Manager.  The appeal shall clearly specify the

shall be final unless appealed to the City Council.  To be effective, an appeal
to the City Council must be in writing, state reasons for the appeal, and must
be filed with the City Clerk within 10 days after notice of the decision by the
City Manager is mailed to the applicant.  The decision of the City Council
shall be final.
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.08  COMMON MORGANTOWN TREES; SPECIES AND VARIETIE.
   The City Manager, or his/her designee, in consultation with the Municipal
Tree Board shall develop and maintain a list of undesirable trees.  This list
shall provide guidance for planting within municipal public property and rights
of way.  All trees planted within public rights of way must be a species that
will not adversely affect the surrounding infrastructure such as sidewalks,
curbs, street or underground utilities, including but not limited to heaving of
the infrastructure by the root system. 
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.09  PLANTING OF TREES ON PUBLIC PLACE OR PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   Planting and maintenance of trees on a public place or within municipal
public rights of way shall be performed under the supervision of the City
Manager, or his/her designee,  who shall be in consultation with the City
department having jurisdiction over the property in question.  Any tree
hereafter planted on, or in a location that, as it matures will affect the safe
use of such land, shall be selected, sited, planted, and maintained in
accordance with the tree care specifications established by this article.
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.10  TREE REMOVAL ON PUBLIC PLACE OR PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY.
   Any person removing a tree from a public place or municipal public right of
way shall do so in accordance with the standards adopted in this Article.  Any
person or agency private or public, needing to remove a tree six inches or more
in DBH from such land shall first be required to obtain permission from the
City Manager or his/her designee.  Permits for removal of trees of any size
located in environmentally sensitive areas must be issued in writing by the
City Manager, or his/her designee,  with the full knowledge of the Municipal
Tree Board.  Such permits may be granted for one tree or for groups of trees,
and shall be issued pursuant to guidelines established by the City Manager in
consultation with the Municipal Tree Board.  An exception to the foregoing
requirement of obtaining permission shall be those instances in which City
Administration has identified and needs to remove a hazardous tree from a
public place.
   Any person or agency removing trees which are neither hazardous trees nor
trees creating a hazardous condition,  by permit, which are six inches or more
in DBH shall provide for the planting of new trees in approximately equal
numbers of appropriate species in appropriate locations mutually agreed upon by
the City Manager, or his/her designee,  and the person obtaining the permit. 
Failure to obtain a permit when one would be required for removal of trees
shall not relieve responsibility for the planting of replacement trees.
   For any tree that is deemed to be a hazardous tree that is located on realty
other than a public place or municipal public right of way, the City Manager,
or his/her designee, shall give notice to the property owner and follow
procedures stated in Section
917.06  and
917.07 .
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.11  TREES NOT ON A PUBLIC PLACE.
   Trees located on land other than a public place or municipal public right of
way are the property and responsibility of the owner of such land.  Yet such
trees have public usefulness, and value in energy conservation; in moderating
extremes in temperature and humidity; in moderating storm water runoff; in
reducing noise, glare and air pollution; in reducing soil erosion; in traffic
calming; and in improving the City's aesthetic character.  To encourage the
conservation of this resource, the City Manager with the assistance of the
Municipal Tree Board, is empowered to take the following measures:
   (a)   Provide information and technical referral service to landowners,
developers, builders, and other interested parties, including persons and
private and public agencies, in protecting trees during planting and
construction;
   (b)   Provide  leadership for Arbor Day observances and other public
education efforts as stated in Section
917.03 .
   The City wishes to encourage and promote the planting of street trees to
provide shade within the City; however public right of way space is limited and
not always adequate for growing shade trees.  Space on private land adjoining
the right of way is often adequate for such planting of shade trees by the
City, and the use of such space would ensure that many streets and
neighborhoods that would otherwise be excluded from a municipal tree planting
program would be included.  The planting of shade trees by the City on private
property adjoining the right-of-way would produce significant public benefits
by providing a healthy and attractive tree canopy along City Streets, and also
serve to encourage property owners to plant suitable shade trees in a similar
manner on their property.
   For these reasons the City Manager, or his/her designee,  is hereby
authorized to contract with such property owners utilizing a "Greenspace
Planting Agreement" to encourage the planting of desirable tree types in
locations that will benefit all citizens of the City.  This Agreement shall
delineate the conditions to which both the City and the property owner agree,
the continuing authority of this Article, the responsibility of the property
owner for the trees except as modified by the Agreement, the duration of the
Agreement, a sketch of the planting site, showing all existing utilities (both
above and below ground) and the statement of full authority on the part of the
property owner with respect to the above planting location.
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.) 
917.12  EXCEPTIONAL TREES AND THE CITY TREE REGISTER.
   The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall maintain a City Tree Register
of exceptional trees located on public and private property.  Recognition of
exceptional trees shall be given by certificate awarded to the property owner
and by listing the tree on the municipal website.  A private property owner
must request in writing that his/her tree be listed on the City Tree Register
as an exceptional tree and must agree in writing, prior to such designation
that he/she will have included in his/her deed for the realty a restrictive
covenant binding all successor owners of the realty to the requirements of this
article as it pertains to the exceptional tree in question.
   Exceptional trees listed on the City Tree Register and which are on a public
place  within a public right of way (street or alley), or on private property
may only be removed following notification of the City Manager or his/her
designee and the Municipal Tree Board, unless it is deemed a hazardous tree or
is creating a hazardous condition.  Removal of exceptional trees shall be
generally prohibited in environmentally sensitive areas unless the trees are
determined by the City Manager or his/her designee to be in an irreversibly
hazardous condition.
   The City Manager, or his/her designee,  in communication with the Tree Board
shall maintain Specifications for Street Tree Planting.
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.13  TREE PROTECTION AND MITIGATION.
   Injury to trees is prohibited in that no person shall, without the consent
of the owner in the case of a tree , or without a written permit from the City
Manager or his/her designee, in the case of a public tree , do, or cause to be
done by others, any of the following acts:
   (a)   Secure, fasten or run any rope, wire, sign or other device or material
to,
      around or through a tree;
   (b)   Break, injure, mutilate, deface, kill or destroy or permit any fire to
burn where it will injure any tree;
   (c)   Permit any toxic chemical, gas, smoke, brine, oil or other injurious
substance to seep, drain or be emptied upon or about any tree or shrub;
   (d)   Set fire or permit fire to burn when such fire or the heat of such
will injure
      any portion of any tree;
   (e)   Excavate any ditch, tunnel or trench, or lay any drive within a
distance ratio of one foot per inch of girth at DBH, to the extent practical,
from the center of any tree.
   (f)   Erect, alter, repair or raze any building or structure without placing
suitable guards around all nearby trees as recommended in ANSI Tree Protection
During Construction Standards;
   (g)   Remove any guard, stake or other device or material intended for the
      protection of any public tree or close or obstruct any open space
      about the base of a public tree or shrub designed to permit access to
air,
      or water or fertilizer.
   In order to maintain the overall community forest, reasonable efforts shall
be made to replace trees that are removed and to protect desirable trees that
are endangered.
   A tree six inches or more in DBH removed from public places by decision of
the City Manager, or his/her designee, the Public Works Department or the Board
of Parks and Recreation Commissioners shall be replaced somewhere in the
community forest on a one-for-one basis within one year.  The plan for location
and species of any replacement shall be reviewed by the City Manager, or his/
her designee, and the Tree Board.
   Trees of desirable species and good health shall be protected as much as
possible from damage during construction, sidewalk repair, utilities work above
and below ground, and other similar activities
   Training may be offered to City departments to assist City personnel in
utilizing protective arboricultural techniques. 
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.14  PRUNING STANDARDS.
   All tree pruning on public property shall conform to the ANSI A300 standards
for tree care operations.  The City Manager, or his/her designee, on a case-by-
case basis, is authorized to issue waivers to specific requirements within ANSI
A300, should a request for such waiver be made and the City Manager, or his/her
designee, deems such waiver justified.
(Ord. 11-46.  Passed 11-15-11.)
917.15  UTILITY CLEARANCE.
   Tree limbs that grow within public rights of way, in which trees are
routinely pruned or otherwise cut during utility maintenance operations by
utility companies or companies paid by utility companies to do such work, shall
be maintained by the utility company in compliance with applicable franchise
agreements approved by the City.  Should a franchise agreement expire, the
regulations of this article shall apply to any such utility, the same as if the
work were being performed by a City department.    The same shall apply to all
public utilities doing work within a public right of way.  Each tree trimming
policy of a utility company must be reviewed by the City Manager, or his/her
designee,  prior to any trimming by the utility company. 
   (a)   The tree trimming policy mentioned above shall include a plan for
providing the City or other landowner, tenants of abutting realty whose trees
will be cut or trimmed by order of the utility, with reasonable notice which
shall include:
      (1)   A description of the area(s) in which the right of way clearing or
maintenance is performed;
      (2)   An approximate schedule of work;
      (3)   A description of the type(s) of work to be performed, including,
but not limited to tree trimming, tree removal, brush cutting, herbicide
application, growth regulation, slash disposition.
      (4)   A general description of clearances required or rights of way
widths to be maintained; and
      (5)   The name and telephone number of a contact person at the
utility.   
   (b)   In the case of right of way clearing or maintenance planned or
scheduled in the normal course of operation, the utility company shall make
personal contact with the City or other landowner, and owners or tenants of
abutting realty whose trees will be cut or trimmed by order of the utility.  In
the case of abutting realty which lacks a habitable structure or contains a
vacant structure, personal contact shall be replaced by a Class I legal
advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Morgantown.
   (c)   In the case of right of way clearing or maintenance resulting from a
sudden emergency, the utility shall issue a news release to the Morgantown
media.  After the sudden emergency is over and the necessary clearing is
complete, the utility shall publish a notice regarding the affected properties
in a Class I legal advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City of Morgantown.
   (d)   For purposes of this section, "personal contact" means, that at least
seven (7) business days prior to the scheduled clearing or maintenance, an
attempt will be made by the utility to contact the persons by telephone or in
person.  Should the attempt be unsuccessful, a door hanger or similar type of
written notice will be left at the residence which contains the information
required by this section.  A second personal contact attempt will be made prior
to the start of work.  Should contact be made with a tenant, the utility shall
either actually contact the owner before beginning work or publish a legal
advertisement as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) hereof.
   (e)   Upon receiving notice of such work to be performed by the utility, the
City of Morgantown will notify existing neighborhood associations within the
affected area, of the same. 
   (f)   All tree removal on public land or within public rights of way shall
follow City tree removal standards set forth in Section
917.10 .
   (g)   All tree pruning and maintenance shall be subject to the requirements
set forth in Sections
917.14 .
   (h)   Utility maintenance that requires digging or trenching near trees
shall provide protection of the Critical Root Zone.  Open trenching in the root
zone of a tree is to be avoided when practical except when the trenching falls
outside the Critical Root Zone.

every building served.  Buildings comprised of multiple townhome style living
units shall be served by a separate and independent customer service line for
each townhome living unit where such units are to be individually owned;  such

service line and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe,
jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the

service line or lateral sewer which in turn is connected directly or indirectly
to a sanitary sewer.
 
   (g)   The applicant for the sewer service permit shall notify the Board when
the customer service line is ready for inspection.  When the customer service
line has been installed, inspected and approved prior to the installation of
the Board's lateral, the connection of the customer service line to the lateral
shall be made by the Board.  When the Board's lateral has been installed prior
to installation of the customer service line, the connection of the customer
service line to the lateral shall be made by the customer subject to the
Board's inspection.  Inspection and testing of the customer service line shall

customer service line may be permitted to serve a school, mobile home park,
apartment house or other permanent multiple unit property, provided that such
multiple unit property is owned by a single owner and is occupied on a rental
basis.
 
   (i)   Where an improved property, at the time connection to a public sewer
is required, shall be served by its own sewage disposal system or device, the
existing sewer line shall be broken on the structure side of such sewage
disposal system or device and attachment shall be made, with proper fittings,
to continue such sewer line as a customer service line.  The Board may, at its
discretion, permit the utilization of an existing sewer line as a customer
service line provided an inspection discloses that it is reasonably true to
grade and alignment and in good condition.  In case of an existing sewer line
utilizing a type of sewer pipe not specified herein, the Manager shall have the
right to require the owner to uncover the full extent of the pipe to determine
its condition and may require its replacement with approved pipe as outlined
herein if the inspection discloses such pipe to be deteriorated in any manner. 
The cost of replacing the pipe where necessary shall be the sole responsibility
of the owner thereof.
 
   (j)   No customer service line shall be covered until it has been inspected
and approved by the Manager or his representative.  Every customer service line
shall be maintained in a sanitary and safe operating condition by the owner of
such improved property.
(Ord. 92-35.  Passed 9-1-92.)
921.06  SEWER USER CHARGES.
   (a)   Rates.  Sewer user charges or rates are imposed upon and shall be
collected from the contracting customer of each improved property which is
connected with the sanitary sewer system, for use of the sewer system, whether
such use is direct or indirect.  The sewer user charges shall commence and
shall be effective as of the date of connection of each such improved property
to the sewer system, and shall be payable as provided herein, in accordance
with the rate ordinance as adopted by Council.
 
   (b)   Surcharge for High Strength Users.  Users discharging any water or
wastes with a BOD and/or TSS in excess of 300 mg/l BOD (2.5 pounds per 1,000
gallons) and 300 mg/l TSS (2.5 pounds per 1,000 gallons) shall be charged for
waste or wastewater contributions in excess of these amounts in addition to the
base sewer user charges.  Additional charges (C) shall be determined by the
following formula:
 
Cs = Bc(B) + Sc(S) + Pc(P) Vu
 
where
 
   B   =   Concentration of BOD from a user above a base level (300 mg/l)
   Bc   =   O & M (operation and maintenance) cost for treatment of a unit of
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
   S   =   Concentration of suspended solids from a user above a base level
(300 mg/l)
   Sc   =   O & M cost for treatment of a unit of suspended solids
   P   =   Concentration of any pollutant from a user above a base level.
   Pc   =   O & M cost for treatment of a unit of any pollutant
   Vu   =   Volume contribution from a user per unit of time
 
(Ord. 92-35.  Passed 9-1-92.)
 
   (c)   The Board shall review user charges annually and revise them
periodically to reflect actual treatment works operation and maintenance costs.
(Ord. 11-16-82.)
921.07  DEPOSITS FROM CUSTOMERS.
   The Board may require the applicant (or customer) to make a deposit as a
guarantee of the payment for sewer service.  Such deposit shall be in
accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Public Service
Commission of West Virginia.
(Ord. 92-35.  Passed 9-1-92.)
921.08  TIME AND METHOD OF PAYMENT.
   (a)   All bills for sewer user charges shall be rendered in accordance with
the applicable rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission of West
Virginia.
 
   (b)   Owners of improved properties which are first connected to the sewer
system during any billing period shall pay a prorated user charge for service
for the balance of the billing period in which the connection is made.
 
   (c)   Sewer user charges shall be due and payable upon the applicable
billing date as provided for herein and the appropriate amount computed shall
constitute the net bill.  If sewer user charges are not paid within twenty
calendar days after each billing date, three percent (3%) of such charge shall
be added to the net bill; which net bill, plus such additional charge, shall
constitute the gross bill.  This delayed payment penalty is not interest but is
a penalty for late payment and is only to be collected once for each bill where
it is appropriate.  Payments personally made or mailed and received on or
before the last day of such twenty calendar-day period shall constitute payment
within such period.  If the end of such twenty calendar-day period falls on a
national holiday or on a Sunday, payment made on or mailed and received on the
next succeeding weekday which is not a holiday shall constitute payment within
such period.  Any bill not paid within such twenty calendar-day period shall be
deemed delinquent.
 
   (d)   Every contracted customer which is connected to the sewer system shall
provide the Board with and thereafter shall keep the Board advised of his or
her correct address.  Failure of any person to receive bills for sewer user
charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor shall such failure
result in an extension of the period of time during which the net bill shall be
payable.
(Ord. 92-35.  Passed 9-1-92.)
921.09  CONNECTION PERMIT FEES.
   (a)   No person shall connect any property with any part of the sewer system
without first making application for and securing a permit, in writing, from
the Board, as provided for herein.  Such application shall be made on a form to
be provided by the Board.
 
   (b)   For all those applications for sewer service permits filed with the
Board, a sewer connection charge in the amount and according to the terms
established in the then existing rate ordinance shall be due and payable on the
day that application is made.  Such sewer connection charge shall be paid upon
application and no such connection shall be made until the charge has been
deposited with the Board.  The sewer connection charge shall be paid whether or
not such connection to the sewer system is made on a voluntary or compulsory
basis.
(Ord. 11-16-82.)
921.10  LIENS AND PENALTIES FOR NONPAYMENT.
   (a)   Sewer user charges or other charges imposed by this article shall be a
lien on the improved property connected to and served by the sewer system; and
any such sewer user charges or other charges which are delinquent for a period
of sixty days shall be filed as a lien against the improved property and
premises so connected to and served by the sewer system, which lien may be
filed in the office of the Clerk of the County Commission of Monongalia County,
West Virginia, and shall be collected in the same manner now provided by law
for the enforcement of tax liens on real property.  Such liens shall be of
equal dignity, rank and priority with a lien on such premises for state,
county, school and municipal taxes.
 
   (b)   At the discretion of the Board, it may request that the water service
to any improved property may be shut off for nonpayment of sewer user charges
if the bill for sewer user charges is delinquent.  Water service shall be shut
off in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Public
Service Commission of West Virginia governing water utilities.
(Ord. 92-35.  Passed 9-1-92.)
921.11  ACCESS TO PROPERTIES.
   (a)   The Board and its Manager shall have the right of access at reasonable

Federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR, Part 403).
   The objectives of this article are:
   (a)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
   (b)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system;
   (c)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system;
   (d)   To provide the equitable distribution of the cost of operating the
Municipal wastewater system.
   (e)   To protect both Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) personnel who
may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and
the general public; and
   (f)   To enable the City to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other Federal or State laws to which the Publicly Owned Treatment Works
(POTW) is subject.
   This article provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors
to the Municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain
nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the other
users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user
reporting, assumes that an existing customer's capacity will not be preempted
and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs
resulting from the program established herein.

923.05  FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter
N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated.
   (a)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
General Manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
   (b)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the General Manager
shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40
CFR 403.6(e).
   (c)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in
40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical
pretreatment standard.
   (d)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical Pretreatment
Standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Section. 
      (1)   Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the Industrial User's intake water in accordance with
this Section. Any Industrial User wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the [City]. Upon request of the Industrial
User, the applicable Standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of subsection (d)(2) hereof are met.
      (2)   Criteria.
         A.   Either:
            1.   The applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards contained in
40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net
basis; or
            2.   The Industrial User demonstrates that the control system it
proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards would,
if properly installed and operated, meet the Standards in the absence of
pollutants in the intake waters.
         B.   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the Industrial User demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the User's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         C.   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with Standard(s) adjusted under this
Section.
         D.   Credit shall be granted only if the User demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The Board may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
   (e)   The Board may grant removal credits if all requirements of 40 CFR
403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the West Virginia Division of
Environmental Protection is obtained.  (Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.06  POLLUTANT LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   The General Manager is authorized to establish local Limits pursuant
to 40 CFR 403.5(c).
   (b)   Limitations for specific pollutants of concern that may cause pass
through, inhibition or cause a degradation of sludge quality have been
developed by the Board for specific pollutants of concern.  The limits are
derived from a mass basis and are allocated on a mass proportion basis to each
individual industrial user.  The Board also reserves the right to convert mass
allocations to concentration based permit limitations and to impose limitations
as monthly average, daily maximum, or instantaneous maximum limitations.  The
Board may derive daily maximum limits by applying a factor of approximately 1.5
to the monthly average limits.  Specific limitations for any individual
industrial user are delineated in the user's contribution permit.
   The following specific total pollutant mass limitations are available to
industrial users.  These total pollutant mass limitations are monthly average
limits.  Individual mass limitations are fractional amounts of the listed
totals and are proportionally based on the individual industry's
contributions.  Pollutants not listed may be regulated by the industry's
specific wastewater contribution permit.
 
Cadmium        0.11 lbs./day
Total Chromium 0.90 lbs./day
Copper      2.30 lbs./day
Cyanide        1.60 lbs./day
Lead           1.10 lbs./day

apply in any case where they are more stringent than Federal requirements and
limitations or those in this article. 
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.08  CITY’S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The City reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if
deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in Section
 923.01.
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.09  EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation developed by the City or State.
   Conventional pollutant discharge of BOD and TSS in excess of 300 mg/l BOD
(2.5 lbs. per 1000 gallons), and 300 mg/l TSS (2.5 lbs. per 1000 gallons) shall
be permitted by the Board.  Contributing industries shall be charged for
wastewater contributions in excess of these amounts at the current unit cost
for treatment of the excessively discharged pollutant.
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.10  PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical Pretreatment
Standards, Local Limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section
923.04 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the Board,
whichever is more stringent.  Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the User's expense.  Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
General Manager for review, and shall be acceptable to the General Manager
before such facilities are constructed.  The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of
modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to
Board under the provisions of this article.  (Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.11  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG CONTROL PLANS.
   Each user shall provide protection from any accidental or slug discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article.  Facilities
to prevent accidental or slug discharge of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. 
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Board for review and shall be approved by
the Board before construction of the facility.  All existing users shall
complete such a plan 180 days from enactment of this article.  No user who
commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this article

period.  In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a
Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the User
must submit documentation required by the General Manager or the Pretreatment
Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User.  All
periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Section
923.23(m).
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge.  Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times.  The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results  are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the General Manager,
using the procedures prescribed in subsection (j) and (k) hereof, the results
of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (e)   Changed Discharge Report.   All industrial users shall promptly notify
the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of
pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under
40 CFR 403.12(p).  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes
include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or
greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
      (1)   The General Manager may require the User to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section
923.15 of this article.
      (2)   The General Manager may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit under Section
923.21 of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under
Section
923.16 of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.
   (f)   Notice of Violations Disclosed by Self Monitoring and Resampling
Reporting.  If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user
must notify the Board within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the
violation.  The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Board within thirty days after becoming
aware of the violation.  The user is not required to resample if the Board
monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the Board samples
between the user's initial sampling and when the user received the results of
this sampling.
   (g)   Accidental/Slug Discharge Reports.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the General
Manager of the incident.  This notification shall include the location of the
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective
actions, taken by the user.
      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the General Manager, submit a detailed written report describing the
causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences.  Such notification shall not relieve the user of
any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (g)(1) hereof.  Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the General
Manager immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for
a Slug Discharge. 
   (h)   Reports from Unpermitted Users.  All Users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
General Manager as the General Manager may require.
   (i)   Record Keeping.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under
Section
923.23(d).  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses.  These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years.  This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user,
the Board or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the General Manager.
   (j)   Analytical Requirements.   All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard.  If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the
EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
General Manager or other parties approved by EPA.
   (k)   Sample Collection.
      (1)   Except as indicated in subsection (k)(2-3) hereof, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques during the discharge period.  In the event flow proportional
sampling is infeasible, the General Manager may authorize the use of time
proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged.  In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance
with instantaneous discharge limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90 day
compliance reports required in Section
 923.23(a) and
923.23(b) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must
be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
General Manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by
paragraphs Section
923.23(d) (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
   (l)   Date of Receipt of Reports.   Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked.  For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (m)   Certification Statements.  Certification of Permit Applications, User
Reports and Initial Monitoring Waiver-The following certification statement is
required to be signed and submitted by Users submitting permit applications in
accordance with Section
923.15(c); Users submitting baseline monitoring reports under Section
 923.23(a)(2)F.; Users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical
Pretreatment Standard deadlines under Section
923.23(c); Users submitting periodic compliance reports required by Section
923.23(d). The following certification statement must be signed by an
Authorized Representative as defined in Section
923.02(3):
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete.  I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.24  MONITORING FACILITIES.
   The Board may require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense,
monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the
internal drainage systems.  The monitoring facility should normally be situated
on the user's premises but the Board may, when such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.  The facility
and sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operation condition at the expense of the user.
   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the Board's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.  Construction shall be completed within ninety days following
written notification by the Board.
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.25  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The Board shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied
with.  Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the Board or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of its
duties.  The Board, Approval Authority or EPA shall have the right to set up on
the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.  Where a user has
security measures in force which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry into his premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the Board, Approval Authority or EPA will be
permitted to enter without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific
responsibilities.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the User at the written or verbal request of the General Manager and shall
not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the User.
Unreasonable delays in allowing personnel from the Board, Approval Authority or
EPA access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.  If the
Board has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any
part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there
may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the Board
designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued
hereunder, to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the Board may seek issuance of a search warrant from the
Circuit Court of Monongalia County.
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.26  PRETREATMENT.
   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply
with this article and shall achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within the time limitation as specified by the Federal
Pretreatment Regulations.  Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a
level acceptable to the Board shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
user's expense.  Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the Board for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Board before construction of the facility.  The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the Board under the provision of this article.  Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be accepted by the Board prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.27  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user under applicable State
law.  Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data.
   When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available immediately
upon request to the DEP, EPA and other governmental agencies for uses related
to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
Permit, State Disposal System Permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided
however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the State
or any State agency in judicial review  or enforcement proceedings involving
the person furnishing the report.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics
shall not be recognized as confidential information.  (Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-
11.)
923.28  PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Board shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published
in the City where the POTW is located, a list of the Users which, at any time
during the previous twelve (12) months, were in Significant Noncompliance with
applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.  The term Significant
Noncompliance shall be applicable to all Significant Industrial Users (or any
other Industrial User that violates paragraphs (c), (d) or (h) of this Section)
and shall mean:
   (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
Instantaneous Limits as defined in Section
923.02;
   (b)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including
Instantaneous Limits, as defined by Section
923.06 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (c)   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by Sections
923.04,
923.05, or
923.06  (Daily Maximum, long term average, Instantaneous Limit, or narrative
standard) that the General Manager determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, Interference or Pass Through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (d)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the General Manager's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (e)   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
   (f)   Failure to provide within forty five (45) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic self monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (g)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (h)   Any other violation(s) which the General Manager determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
      (Ord. 11-21. Passed 6-7-11.)
923.29  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT.
     (a)   Emergency Suspension.  The Board may suspend the wastewater
treatment service and/or the wastewater contribution permit when such
suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Board, in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the
environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the City to violate any
conditions of its NPDES permit.
   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/
or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution.  In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the Board shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals.  The Board shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/
or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge.  A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Board within fifteen
days of the date of occurrence.  Exercise of this option by the General Manager
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against this user.
   (b)   Revocation of Permit.  Any user who violates the following conditions
of this article or applicable State and Federal regulations, is subject to
having his permit revoked:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Sections
923.04,
923.05,
923.06 and
923.07.
   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (f) hereof why the
proposed action should not be taken.  Exercise of this option by the Board
shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user.
   (c)   Notification of Violation.  Whenever the Board finds that any user has
violated, or is violating, this article, Wastewater Contribution Permit, or any
prohibition, limitation or requirements contained herein, the Board, or its
designated agent may serve upon such a person a written Notice of Violation
stating the nature of the violation.  Said notice is to be served by certified
mail, return receipt requested.  Within thirty days of the date of the notice,
a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the Board
by the user.  Submission of this plan in no ways relieves the user of liability
for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation.  Issuance of a notice of violation shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
   (d)   Administrative Orders.  When the General Manager finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the General Manager may issue an order to
the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into
compliance within a specified time.  If the User does not come into compliance
within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated.  Administrative orders also may contain other requirements
to address the noncompliance, including additional self monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged
to the sewer.  An administrative order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does an
administrative order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including
any continuing violation.  Issuance of an administrative order shall not be a
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   (e)   Administrative Fines.
      (1)   When the General Manager finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement, the General Manager may fine such User in an amount not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000).  Such fines shall be assessed on a per-
violation, per-day basis.  In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after forty-five (45)
calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the
unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of five percent
(5%) per month.  A lien against the User's property shall be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the General Manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine.  Where a
request has merit, the General Manager may convene a hearing on the matter.  In
the event the User's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User.  The General Manager
may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as
notices and orders, to the fine.
      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   (f)   Show Cause Hearing.
      (1)   The Board may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized
discharge to show cause before the Board why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken.  A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place of a hearing to be held by the Board regarding the violation, the
reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action and
directing the user to show cause before the Board why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken.  The notice of the hearing shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at
least ten days before the hearing.  Such notice may be served on any Authorized
Representative of the User as defined in Section
923.02 (3) and required by Section
923.15(c).  A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for taking any other action against the user.
      (2)   The Board may itself conduct the hearing and take evidence or may
designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the Board to:
         A.   Issue in the name of the Board notices of hearing requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in such hearings;
         B.   Take the evidence;
         C.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Board for
action thereon.
      (3)   At any hearing held pursuant to this article testimony taken shall
be under oath and recorded stenographically.  The transcript, so recorded shall
be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon
payment of the actual cost thereof.
      (4)   After the Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified
time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed on existing
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly
operated.  Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may
be issued. 
   (g)   Consent Orders.  The General Manager may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance.  Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document.  Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
subsections (d) and (h) hereof.
   (h)   Cease and Desist Orders.  When the General Manager finds that a user
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
General Manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.30  JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT.
     (a)   Injunctive Relief.  When the General Manager finds the user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the General Manager may petition the Circuit Court of
Monongalia County through the Board's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary
or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user.  The General
Manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation.  A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (b)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be liable to
the Board for a maximum civil penalty of not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation, per day. 
In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The General Manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the Board.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the User's violation, corrective
actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
   (c)   Criminal Prosecution. 
      (1)   A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be punishable by a fine
of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation, per day, or
imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days, or both.  The criminal
misdemeanor penalties within this article shall be enforced by the issuance of
a summons from the Municipal Court of the City of Morgantown upon a complaint
filed therein by the General Manager.  The Court shall add to said fines the
appropriate cost for issuance and service of said summons.  Criminal
prosecution shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
      (2)   A User who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage be subject to a
penalty of at least one thousand dollars ($1000), or be subject to imprisonment
for not more than thirty (30) days, or both.  This penalty shall be in addition
to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available
under State law.
      (3)   Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation
or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document
filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, or wastewater
contribution permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall
be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or imprisoned not more
than thirty days, or both.  A penalty for falsifying information shall not be a
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (d)   Enforcement Nonexclusive.    The remedies provided for in this article
are not exclusive.  The Board may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user.  Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the Board's enforcement response plan. 
However, the Board may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant.  Further, the Board is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 11-21.  Passed 6-7-11.)
923.31  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the User.  An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the
requirements of subsection (a)(2) hereof, are met.
      (3)   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         B.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         C.   The User has submitted the following information to the General
Manager within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five (5) days]:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (b)   Prohibited Discharge Standards.  A User shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in Section
923.04(a) or the specific prohibitions in Sections
923.04(b)(3) through (18) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference and that either:
      (1)   A Local Limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the Pass Through
or Interference; or
      (2)   No Local Limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge when
the Board was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
Interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (c)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this Section:
         A.   Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a User's treatment facility.
         B.   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.  Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of subsections (c)(3) and (4) hereof.
      (3)   Bypass Notifications.
         A.   If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the General Manager, at least ten (10) days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
         B.   A User shall submit oral notice to the General Manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.  A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User
becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The General Manager
may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has
been received within twenty four (24) hours.
      (4)   Bypass.
         A.   Bypass is prohibited, and the General Manager may take an
enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The User submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3)
hereof.
         B.   The General Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the General Manager determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)A. hereof.

         (Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.03  STORMWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   Users connected to or draining into the public stormwater system shall
pay an equitable share of the actual cost of the operation, maintenance of,
improvements to, and necessary additions to the stormwater system.  Therefore,
all owners or tenants of real property in the City of Morgantown and the City
watershed shall be charged for the use of the  stormwater system based on the
amount of stormwater and rate of flow of stormwater which is projected to
discharge into the stormwater system from the property.
   (b)   The City Council shall, by ordinance, set fees which will recover from
users their fair share of costs for use of the stormwater system by property
within and outside the corporate limits of the City of Morgantown and within
the City watershed.  Such fees will be for the operation and maintenance of,
improvements to, and necessary additions to, the stormwater system. 
(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.04  PROPERTY AFFECTED.
   Except as provided in this article, all real property shall be subject to
the stormwater service charges regardless of whether privately or publicly
owned.
(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.05  FLAT RATE CHARGES.
   The monthly service charge for users occupying a single family residential
dwelling, as defined by the Director, shall be five dollars and eighty-eight
cents ($5.88).  City Council may, from time to time, by ordinance, change these
service charges.  Residential dwellings in the Forest-Poplar watershed, as
defined by the Director, shall monthly pay, in addition to the monthly service
charge, a debt service surcharge of $13.28, which amount shall be solely
dedicated to the cost of capital improvements for stormwater management
completed in this watershed under and/or related to MUB Contract 1-2014 A.  The
debt service surcharge will be evaluated annually and in the event that a
change in the number of customers results in a five percent (5%) change in the
rate, the rate will be adjusted.  Ten (10) years following the effective date
of this surcharge, and/or upon full funding of the debt service reserve, the
surcharge shall be reduced by ten percent (10%).  Upon full satisfaction of the
debt, this surcharge shall expire.  (Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)

property, as determined by the Director.  Properties in the Forest-Poplar
watershed, as defined by the Director, shall monthly pay, in addition to the
monthly service charge, an additional debt service surcharge of $5.31, per
1,000 square feet of impervious area upon the property, which amount shall be
solely dedicated to the cost of capital improvements for stormwater management
completed in this watershed under and/or related to MUB Contract 1-2014 A.  The
debt service surcharge will be evaluated annually and in the event that a
change in the number of customers results in a five percent (5%) change in the
rate, the rate will be adjusted.  Ten (10) years following the effective date
of this surcharge, and/or upon full funding of the debt service reserve, the
surcharge shall be reduced by ten percent (10%).  Upon full satisfaction of the
debt, this surcharge shall expire.
   (b)   Service charges for a multi-unit property shall be billed to each
individual tenant upon the property in a fair and proportionate share of the
total property service charge, if said tenant has an individual drinking water
service meter.  At the discretion of the property owner, or if the individual
tenants do not have individual drinking water service meters, service charges
for a multi-unit property may be billed to the property owner.  A property
owner exercising this choice must complete a written agreement as required by
the Director.
   (c)   The Director may assign discount credits to those newly constructed
properties employing volumetric flow reduction facilities.  The Director may
further assign discount credits to those existing properties employing rate of
flow reduction practices.  Such credits may be provided only for additional
volumetric flow reductions achieved voluntarily above and beyond the levels
otherwise required by this Article.
   (d)   The City Council may, from time to time, by ordinance, change these
rate charges.  (Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)

   Unpaid stormwater service charges shall constitute just cause for
disconnection of public water service to the non-paying property.  The Director
shall ensure sufficient notice of disconnection is issued no later than thirty
(30) days prior to the scheduled disconnection, and that notice of
disconnection is posted on the affected property no later than five (5) days
prior to the scheduled disconnection.  Water service shall be reactivated only
upon full payment of the stormwater service charges or other payment
arrangements approved by the Director.  In the alternative, the Director may
take appropriate legal action to collect unpaid charges.
(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.09  USE OF FUNDS.

or,
      (9)     The stormwater system to violate its NPDES permit or applicable
receiving water standards and all other Federal, State, and local regulations.
   (e)   Any person or entity engaged in activities which will or may result in
pollutants entering the storm drain system shall undertake best management
practices to reduce or eliminate such pollutants.  Examples of such activities
include, but are not limited to, ownership and/or operation of facilities that
may be a source of pollutants, such as paved parking lots, gasoline stations,
industrial facilities, and private roads/streets.  The Director may designate
these areas as “Hot Spots” within the water shed.  “Hot Spot” requirements are
addressed in the Morgantown Utility Board Stormwater Management Design Manual.
   (f)   No person shall throw, deposit, leave, maintain or cause to be thrown,
deposited, left or maintained any refuse, rubbish, garbage, grease, petroleum
products, or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles and accumulations
in or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, storm drain inlet, catch basin, conduit
or other drainage structures, parking area, or upon any private or public plot
of land so that the same might become a pollutant, except where the pollutant
is being temporarily stored in properly contained waste receptacles or is part
of a well defined compost system.
   (g)   No person shall cause or permit any dumpster, solid waste bin, or
similar container to leak such that any pollutant is discharged into any
street, alley, sidewalk, storm drain, inlet, catch basin, conduit or other
drainage structure, or upon any public or private plot of land in the urban
watershed.
   (h)   No person shall use the stormwater system for discharge from any
environmental cleanup that is regulated under federal or state law unless
approved by the Director. Approval by the Director must be conditioned upon the
discharge meeting all criteria for discharge under this article. Approval
conditions may provide for measures appropriate to prevent harm due to possible
exfiltration into the ground adjacent to the system or failure of any
pretreatment system for the discharge.
   (i)       No person shall alter the configuration or condition of the
stormwater system, or create a configuration or condition within the stormwater
system, which adversely affects the function of the stormwater system.
   (j)       No person shall purposefully discharge or purposefully cause the
discharge of stormwater from their property without the use of an approved
connection to the City stormwater system. The intent of this item is to leave
natural drainage unregulated, but to regulate any change to the natural
drainage caused by manmade actions. Any person found to be in violation of this
prohibition shall take appropriate action, subject to the approval of the
Director, to stop and to prevent such discharge. 
      (1)     If unable to achieve compliance through their own means, such
person shall apply and pay for an extension of the City stormwater system to
his/her property. In such cases, the work necessary within the private property
to collect the stormwater and to connect to the City stormwater system shall be
performed by and at the expense of the private party.
      (2)    Any party receiving a Notice of Violation from the Director
requiring correction of such conditions may appeal as provided in Section
929.32. 
         (Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.11  ILLICIT CONNECTIONS.
   It is prohibited to establish, use, maintain or continue illicit connections
to the municipal stormwater system, or to commence or continue any illicit
discharges to the municipal stormwater system. 
(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.12  OUTDOOR STORAGE AREAS.

substances in a manner that will or may result in such substances entering the
stormwater system. In outdoor areas, no person shall store motor vehicles,
machine parts, or other objects in a manner that may leak grease, oil, or other
hazardous substances to the stormwater system. To prevent the discharge of
hazardous substances to the stormwater system, the Director may require the
installation of a spill containment system.  Spill containment systems may
consist of a system of dikes, walls, barriers, berms, or other devices as
required.  No person shall operate a spill containment system such that it
allows incompatible liquids to mix and thereby create a hazardous condition. 
(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.13  EROSION AND SEDIMENT FROM CONSTRUCTION SITES.
   (a)     Any person performing construction work in the watershed of the City
of Morgantown Stormwater Utility shall comply with the provisions of this
Article and shall provide erosion and sediment controls and flow controls that
effectively prevent discharges of pollutants to the stormwater system and
protect neighboring properties from uncontrolled runoff.  For the purposes of
this section, construction shall mean any man-made activity which, either
temporarily or permanently, disturbs, alters, creates, cuts, fills, grades,
excavates, occupies or otherwise affects the land such that the soil, or any
other natural non-vegetative earthen material, is exposed and/or potentially
transported into the water environment through the mechanisms of erosion and
sedimentation. 
   (b)     The Director may establish standards and guidelines for implementing
BMP's intended to provide erosion and sediment control for construction sites.
Such standards and guidelines shall be at least as stringent as those, if any,
provided by the WV Division of Environmental Protection.
   (c)     The following activities shall be exempt from the requirements of
this section.
      (1)   Residential gardens and/or flower beds of less than 1000 square
feet of actual disturbed area;
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing detached single-family
dwellings of a size less than 1,000 square feet of actual disturbed area; and
      (3)   Activities that result in an actual disturbed area of less than
1,000 square feet.  However, a phased construction project shall be measured by
the size of all planned or contemplated phases.  Each phase may be required to
meet the requirements of this article.
              (4)   Any exemption provided under this section shall relieve
only the requirement to apply for and obtain a MUB Stormwater Permit. The
activity must still be conducted in such a manner that pollution from erosion
and sedimentation as a result of the activity is prevented. 
   (d)    All construction work subject to the provisions of this article shall
be required to obtain a MUB Stormwater Permit unless exempted under the
provisions of Section
929.13(c).  The Director shall issue a MUB Stormwater Permit for plans that
meet the requirements of this section and any other requirements of this
article.
      (1)   No City grading permit shall be issued without the approval of a
MUB Stormwater Permit issued under the provisions of this article, unless the
Director has issued a formal Determination stating that a MUB Stormwater Permit
is not required. Processing of the application for a MUB Stormwater Permit
shall be coordinated with other City permits as provided in Section
929.22.
      (2)   No City building permit that includes work subject to the
provisions of this section shall be issued without the approval of a MUB
Stormwater Permit issued under the provisions of this article, unless the
Director has issued a formal Determination stating that a MUB Stormwater Permit
is not required. Processing of the application for a MUB Stormwater Permit
shall be coordinated with other City permits as provided in Section
929.22.
   (e)     Any construction work for which a MUB Stormwater Permit is required
shall implement the measures required by the MUB Stormwater Permit as the first
item of work to be performed, before any other aspect of the construction is
begun.
      (1)   In the event that unique site conditions  require some other aspect
of the construction to be accomplished prior to implementation of the measures
required by the MUB Stormwater Permit, the Permittee shall be required, as a
condition of the MUB Stormwater Permit, to provide and maintain temporary and /

(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.20  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND COMPREHENSIVE DRAINAGE PLANS.
   (a)   Stormwater Management and Comprehensive Drainage Plans are required to
obtain a MUB Stormwater Permit and shall be in accordance with this article and
the Morgantown Utility Board Stormwater Management Design Manual as described
in Section
929.21.
   (b)   The requirements and standards of this section shall apply to all new
developments and redevelopment projects.  The intent of these regulations is to
minimize the discharge and transport of pollutants to storm drain systems and
prevent the deterioration of water quality.    
   (c)   All new developments and redevelopment projects within the City
watershed shall include stormwater management plans and comprehensive drainage
plans as described in this section.  These plans shall be subject to the review
and approval of the Director.
   (d)   The following activities shall be exempt from the requirements of this
section, except that no activity shall be exempt from the management of the
discharge of sediment or any other form of water pollution that may leave any
parcel or site.
      (1)   Agricultural land management activities;
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing detached single-family
dwellings of a size less than 1,000 square feet; and
      (3)   Activities that result in impervious surface area of less than
3,000 square feet, regardless of the ratio of impervious surface area to total
site area.  However, a phased construction project shall be measured by the
size of all planned or contemplated phases.  Each phase may be required to meet
the requirements of this article.
   (e)   All new development and redevelopment projects subject to the
provisions of this article shall be required to obtain a MUB Stormwater Permit
unless exempted under the provisions of Section
929.20(c).  The Director shall issue a MUB Stormwater Permit for plans that
meet the requirements of Article
929, and design requirements contained within the MUB Stormwater Management
Design Manual.  No City grading permit, or building permit which includes work
subject to the provisions of this section, shall be issued without the approval
of a MUB Stormwater Permit issued under the provisions of this article, unless
the Director has issued a formal determination stating that a MUB Stormwater
Permit is not required.  Processing of the application for a MUB Stormwater
Permit shall be coordinated with other City permits as provided in Section
 929.22.
      (1)     Any work for which a MUB Stormwater Permit is required, the
Permittee shall implement the Erosion and Sediment Control Best Management
Practices and Flow Control best management practices required by the MUB
Stormwater Permit as the first item of work to be performed, before any other
aspect of the construction is begun.
      (2)   In the event that only an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan is
required to obtain a MUB Stormwater Permit, the measures required by the
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall be implemented first so that no other
aspect of the construction is begun until all stormwater permit requirements
have been implemented.  The Erosion and Sediment Control Plan must contain best
management practices for Flow Control during construction to protect
neighboring properties from runoff.
      (3)   In the event that unique site conditions  require some other aspect
of the construction to be accomplished prior to implementation of the measures
required by the MUB Stormwater Permit, the Permittee shall be required, as a
condition of the Permit, to provide and maintain temporary and/or phased
measures so that the intent of this section is accomplished. In such cases,
site work shall be planned and prioritized so that implementation of the full
measures of the Permit shall be accomplished as soon as possible.
      (4)   Any permit issued under the provisions of this article shall be
posted at the subject site  during the time that such work is being performed,
in such manner and at such place on such premises as the same may be readily
seen and inspected by the police officers and other agents and  officials of
the City.  In the event that any such permit so posted shall be removed, lost
or destroyed, a duplicate thereof shall immediately be applied for to the
Director.
   (f)   Technical, administrative or procedural matters may be modified by the
Director as needed to meet the objectives and policies defined in this article,
so long as such modifications are not contrary to or beyond the intent of the
objectives and policies included in this article.
   (g)   Uniform requirements shall be applied to each regulated project site. 
These requirements shall be based upon the criterion that post development
stormwater peak runoff rates of flow must not exceed the pre-development peak
runoff rates of flow.  In redevelopment projects, a peak runoff rate of flow
reduction of ten percent (10%) from the preexisting peak runoff rate of flow
must be achieved.  However, no reduction shall be required beyond the peak
runoff rate of flow that would occur from the parcel in its natural,
undeveloped state.
   (h)   For any new construction that results in impervious area of 3,000
square feet or more and for any redevelopment project, an Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan and a Stormwater Management and comprehensive drainage plan will
be required in order to qualify for a MUB Stormwater Permit.  The plan shall
include all requirements listed in the MUB Stormwater Management Design Manual.
   (i)   No construction shall be performed in a manner that will negatively
impact the water environment in the vicinity of construction or in other areas,
regardless of whether this impact is manifested by flow restrictions, increased
runoff, diminishing channel or floodplain storage capacity, harm to aquatic
life or any other manifestation of negative impact. 
   (j)   New construction or redevelopment projects shall begin with the
installation of all approved Erosion and Sediment Control best management
practices and Flow Control best management practices.  The Director may halt
construction, void a permit, or take other enforcement actions consistent with
this section upon a finding of inadequate Erosion and Sediment Control best
management practices or inadequate Flow Control best management practices upon
a site or property subject to the provisions of this section.
   (k)   All active construction sites shall be inspected by the owner no less
than weekly and within 24 hours after a 0.25 inch rain event to ensure and
verify effective erosion and sediment control.  The owner or site manager shall
maintain records of these inspections on site in an inspection log.  The
Director may halt construction on properties that do not provide satisfactory
proof of compliance with this requirement.
   (l)   The Owner of a completed new development and/or redevelopment
construction shall submit to the Director within thirty (30) days of
substantial project completion an "as-built" plan of the stormwater management
facilities located upon the property/site.
   (m)   Waivers for Providing Stormwater Management.
      (1)   Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required
by this ordinance unless a waiver of these requirements is granted by the
Director.  A written request for waiver must be submitted to the Director in a
form that he/she prescribes.
      (2)   The Director may waive the minimum requirements for stormwater
management, except that any requirement waived shall not cause any degradation
of water quality.
      (3)   Any requirements described in Article
929 and/or the MUB Stormwater Management Design Manual may be waived by the
Director, if the Director finds that meeting the minimum on-site stormwater
management requirements is not feasible due to the unique natural or existing
physical characteristics of a site, or that the property owner would suffer an
undue hardship if required to meet the full requirements of this regulation. 
To be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must also demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Director that the waiver will not result in any of the
following impacts to downstream waterways:
         A.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
         B.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         C.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or,
         D.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and/or
property.
      (4)   Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site stormwater
management is waived, the applicant shall satisfy stormwater management
requirements by accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the Director. 
Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Alternative means for on-site management of stormwater discharges
that have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been
approved by the Director.
         B.   The creation of appropriately designed and constructed stormwater
management facility or drainage improvements on other properties, public or
private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities.  This
alternative facility must provide a level of stormwater control that is equal
to or greater than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices
and there must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long-term
operation and maintenance of the off-site practice.  The Director shall, to the
maximum extent practical, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site
practice shall be realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management
practice.
         C.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City or
the grant of an easement to the City, to be dedicated to preservation,
reforestation, and/or the creation of green space, wetlands, or permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat.
   Any mitigation measure shall provide a level of environmental protection
and/or improvement that is, in the sole discretion of the Director,
approximately equal to or greater than that which would have been provided by
the waived practice.
   (n)   Fee in Lieu of Stormwater Management Practices.
      (1)   Where the Director waives all or part of the minimum stormwater
management requirements, and the applicant does not complete an approved
mitigation project, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in lieu of
stormwater management practices, in an amount as determined by the Director. 
This amount shall be approximately equal to the cost of stormwater management
and based on the cubic feet of storage required for stormwater management of
the development in question. All of the monetary contributions shall be
credited to an appropriate stormwater capital improvements program project, and
shall be made by the applicant prior to the issuance of any stormwater permit
for the development.
   (o)     Impervious areas measured for determining the requirements of this
section, or for assessing compliance with the requirements of this section,
shall be determined using the highest combination of proposed/constructed
impervious area plus any additional proposed/actual disturbed area in excess of
the proposed/constructed impervious footprint. 
   (p)      Disturbed areas measured for determining the requirements of this
section, or for assessing compliance with the requirements of this section,
shall include areas for which vegetative cover has been, or will be, altered,
reduced, or eliminated and for which a change in runoff characteristics may be
reasonably determined.
(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.21  STORMWATER DESIGN MANUAL.
   (a)   The Stormwater Utility may furnish additional policy, criteria and
information including specifications and standards, for the proper
implementation of the requirements of this article and may provide such
information in the form of a Stormwater Design Manual.
   (b)   This manual may include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment
practices, including the specific design criteria for each stormwater
practice.  The manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the
discretion of the Stormwater Utility, based on improvements in engineering,
science, monitoring and local maintenance experience.  Stormwater treatment
practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and
sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance
standards. 
(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.22  PLAN SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS.
   (a)   The plan submission and review process shall be coordinated with and
integrated into the City planning and permitting process.  Persons applying to
the City for a grading permit, and/or a building permit that includes work

Board Stormwater Permit Application simultaneously with the submission of their
other City permit application(s).  The City shall promptly forward all such
applications for a MUB Stormwater Permit to the Director for review and further
action.
      (1)   Applicants may choose to submit their MUB Stormwater Permit
application directly to the Director in advance of their application for a City
grading permit and/or building permit, but in such case the applicant shall
include a copy of their MUB Stormwater Permit Application with their eventual
submission to the City, and the City shall forward the copy of the MUB
Stormwater Permit Application to the Director as confirmation.
      (2)   Applicants for projects located outside of the municipal boundaries
of the City shall submit their MUB Stormwater Permit Application directly to
the Director.
   (b)   The City shal not issue any grading permit, or any building permit
that includes work subject to the provisions of this article, unless and until
the appropriate stormwater permit(s), has (have) been approved and issued.
(Ord. 18-07.  Passed 2-20-18.)
929.23  MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER FACILITIES.

inform the owner, by letter, that the water service to the owner’s premises
will be terminated within a period not to exceed five days.  In the event the
owner informs the Utility Board of extenuating circumstances as to why the
correction has not been made, a time extension may be granted by the Utility
Board, but in no case may said extension exceed an additional thirty days from
the time of the second re- inspection.
      (5)   If the Morgantown Utility Board determines at any time that a
serious threat to the public health exists as a result of an actual or
suspected cross-connection, the subject water service shall be terminated
immediately.
      (6)   The Morgantown Utility Board shall conduct an inspection program to
determine the nature of existing or potential hazards.  Initial focus will be
on high hazard industries and commercial premises.
   (b)   Owner.
      (1)   The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
cross- connections located within the served premises.
      (2)   The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the

maintain, and test, or have tested, any and all backflow preventers located
within the served premises.
      (3)   The owner shall immediately correct any malfunction or deficiency
of a backflow preventer that is revealed by periodic testing.
      (4)   The owner shall inform the Morgantown Utility Board of any proposed
or modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which
the owner is aware, but have not been found by the Utility Board.
      (5)   The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer
unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass.  Owners
who cannot shut down operation for testing of a backflow preventer must supply
additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
      (6)   The owner shall install only backflow preventers of a design and in
a manner approved by the Morgantown Utility Board or the West Virginia Board of
Public Health.

West Virginia Board of Public Health.
         (Ord. 05-13.  Passed 5-17-05.)
930.07  DEGREES OF HAZARD.
   The City recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from
cross- connections.  All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and
will require the installation of approved backflow prevention devices, in a
manner and within a time period appropriate for said degree of hazard. 
(Ord. 05-13.  Passed 5-17-05.)
930.08  EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed to continue in service
unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the
present backflow preventer, or otherwise results in an unreasonable risk to the
public health.  Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a
residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing
backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or
a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no
backflow device is present. 
(Ord. 05-13.  Passed 5-17-05.)
930.09  PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.

West Virginia Board of Public Health.  This testing will be done at the owner’s
expense.
   (c)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced.  When repairs are necessary, the repaired device will be
retested at owner’s expense to insure correct operation.  High hazard
situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow
preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately.  In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty days after the test date
will be established.  The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools,
or a replacement device.  Parallel installation of two devices is an effective
means of the owner ensuring the uninterrupted water service during the testing
or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such
continuity.
   (d)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested more frequently than
specified in subsection (a) hereof, in cases where there is a history of test
failure and the Morgantown Utility Board finds that the degree of hazard
involved warrants additional testing.  The cost of any additional test(s) will
be borne by the owner.
(Ord. 05-13.  Passed 5-17-05.)
930.10  RECORDS.
   (a)   The Morgantown Utility Board shall maintain the following information:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections.
      (2)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections.
      (3)   Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the West Virginia Board

1149.01  PURPOSE; PUBLIC NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   Council may, by resolution, abate anything which, in the opinion of a
majority of Council, constitutes a public nuisance after due notice to all
parties that could be affected and after such hearings as Council deems
necessary to ascertain a factual and rational basis for the abatement of any
such public nuisance.
(Ord. 15-24.  Passed 5-19-15.)
1149.02  APPLICATION.
   The provisions of this article shall apply to all public nuisances as
hereinafter designated which are now in existence or which may hereafter exist
in the City.
(Ord. 15-24.  Passed 5-19-15.)
1149.03  DEFINITION; PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   (a)   A public nuisance is one which affects an indefinite number of
persons, or the residents of a particular locality, or people coming within the
extent of its range or operation, although the extent of the annoyance or
damage inflicted upon individuals may be unequal.  Such public nuisance
endangers the health, safety and welfare of the community and is dangerous and
detrimental to the public health, may violate the laws of the City and/or State
as well as obstructs the community from reasonable and comfortable use of
property.
   (b)   A public nuisance may arise from the unreasonable, unwarrantable or
unlawful behavior associated with the property, either real or personal, which
hinders the neighboring community and the general public from enjoying the
common and public rights enjoyed by the general community in like areas where
no such public nuisance exists.
   (c)   For purposes of this article a continuing public nuisance is an
uninterrupted or periodically recurring public nuisance, not necessarily a
constant or unceasing injury, but a nuisance which occurs so often and is so
necessarily an incident of the use of property complained of that it can fairly
be said to be continuous.  Such a nuisance may be of such character that its
continuance is necessarily an injury which will continue without change.
   (d)   A continuing public nuisance may be found to be a permanent public
nuisance when its continuance is necessarily an injury which will continue
without change, unless Council takes such action to cease any like nuisance
from becoming established and re-occurring at the particular location.  It is
not enough to show a slight interference to the public welfare and such will
not be restrained unless the type of business or manner of operation is
injurious to the public health, safety and welfare of the community or has a
tendency to promote unlawful behavior or behavior which is considered by the
City Administration, including its health and/or safety officials, to be a
menace to public order and safety.
   (e)   The procedure by which the City of Morgantown will address public
nuisances is set forth in the remaining sections of this article.
(Ord. 15-24.  Passed 5-19-15.)
1149.04  REPORT, RECOMMENDATIONS TO COUNCIL AND HEARING.
   Public safety and law enforcement officers, as well as affected members of
the community, shall report findings and recommendations to the City Manager,
and if the City Manager ascertains from the report and findings that the
condition presents a public nuisance, as defined within this Article, the City
Manager shall make his recommendation to City Council that just cause exists to
abate the nuisance.  Whereupon by a majority vote of City Council, a hearing
shall be held after at least ten days notice is provided to the property owner,
tenant, business manager and/or licensee of the time and place of such hearing,
which notice shall contain a statement or specifications of the charges,
grounds or reasons for such proposed contemplated action, and which shall be
served upon the property owner, tenant, business manager and/or licensee as
notices under the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure or by certified mail,
return receipt requested, and shall, in addition, be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises as well as within 100 feet surrounding such premises
affected by the recommendation.  The term “cause” shall include the going or
omitting of any act or permitting any condition to exist which causes a public
nuisance as defined in this article.  At which time and place, so designated in
the notice, City Administration shall put forth its evidence in support of the
recommendation made to City Council as well as the property owner, tenant,
business manager and/or licensee shall have the right to appear and produce
evidence in his/her/its behalf, and to be represented by counsel.  At the
conclusion of the hearing, City Council shall render a decision.
(Ord. 15-24.  Passed 5-19-15.)
1149.05  FINDINGS OF CITY COUNCIL.
   (a)   At the conclusion of the hearing described in Section
1149.04, City Council will issue its findings on the matter.  In doing so, it
may determine that a public nuisance does not exist, or that a public nuisance
does exist and in such case, what corrective action the property owner, tenant,
business manager and/or licensee must take to eliminate the public nuisance and
the time period in which such action must take place.  Additionally, upon a
showing that there has been a continuing nuisance of similar character and
circumstances at a particular location which meets the criteria for a permanent
nuisance as set forth in Section
1149.03 of this article, City Council may declare such a permanent public
nuisance and prohibit similar acts, occupations, types of businesses or
structures at such location.  In determining whether or not a permanent public
nuisance exists, City Council shall consider reports of City administration,
safety, and law enforcement officials, as well as public comment and complaints
of the community spanning, at a minimum, a three year period immediately
preceding the date of the hearing. 
 
   (b)   Should any property owner, tenant, business manager and/or licensee
fail to take the corrective action prescribed by City Council in the time
period allotted, the City employees and/or agents of the City necessary to
abate the nuisance may enter upon the property constituting a public nuisance
and abate the conditions creating the nuisance, regardless of whether such
nuisance constitutes a threat to public safety.
 
   (c)   If the City abates a nuisance as permitted by Section
1149.05(b), the City shall be entitled to a lien against the real property on
which such nuisance was abated for all costs incurred in abating the nuisance,
including the actual value of labor expended to abate the nuisance, without the
necessity of obtaining a court order for such lien.  The City may collect on
such lien in the same manner as provided for liens for taxes or paving
assessments, or by an action at law, or in any other manner provided by law for
the collection of debts due to a municipality. 
(Ord. 15-24.  Passed 5-19-15.)
1149.06  RECONSIDERATION OF PERMANENT PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   Should City Council declare a location to be a permanent public nuisance,
any further use of that same location for the same use shall not be allowed;
however, reconsideration by City Council of its Declaration of Permanent
Nuisance may occur if such reconsideration request is filed in writing with
City Council within three (3) months of City Council’s decision on the matter. 
The relief requested in the petition for reconsideration may be granted by City
Council if, in its opinion, the petitioner has presented it with sufficient
information demonstrating that, more likely than not, the elements making up
and causing the nature of the permanent public nuisance in question will be
eliminated.  The order of City Council in granting any such petition shall
indicate that the use of the premises/realty at issue will be considered
probationary for a period of one year from the date the use commences, and that
any reoccurrence of similar activity which lead to the prior declaration of a
permanent public nuisance or would lead to a new nuisance violation shall
automatically reactivate City Council’s previous determination that the site is
a permanent public nuisance.  In that event, upon written notice by the City
Manager to and received by the Petitioner, such usage of the site shall cease
immediately.
(Ord. 15-24.  Passed 5-19-15.)
1149.07  APPEALS AND ENFORCEMENT.
   In the event that such property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee may be aggrieved by such decision of City Council, which may include
and not be limited to revocation or suspension of any licensures and/or the
restricted use of such property having been declared a nuisance, petition for
such review must be filed with the circuit court within a period of thirty days
from and after the date of final action by Council.  Any person, firm,
corporation, landowner, licensee so affected has the right to apply to the
circuit court for a temporary injunction pursuant to the provisions of the W.
Va. Code.  The Municipality is also entitled to any and all appropriate
judicial relief against public nuisances.
(Ord. 15-24.  Passed 5-19-15.)
1149.08  STATE BUILDING CODE AND FIRE CODE.
   This article shall not supersede those requirements and procedures set forth
in either the West Virginia State Building Code or the West Virginia State Fire
Code.
(Ord. 15-24.  Passed 5-19-15.)
1149.09  SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, provision, clause or phrase of this article or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held unconstitutional
or invalid, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect other
sections, subsections, provisions, clauses or phrases or applications of this
article and to this end each and every section, subsection, provision, clause
and phrase of this article is declared to be severable.  This article is in
addition to and not dependent upon other articles of this Code.

1155.01  TITLE.
   This article shall be known as the "Morgantown Clean Indoor Air Article".
(Ord. 17-06.  Passed 3-21-17.)
1155.02  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   The United States Surgeon General has determined that involuntary
inhalation of tobacco smoke:
      (1)   Is a cause of numerous diseases in healthy nonsmokers; and
      (2)   Is a major contributor to indoor air pollution; and
      (3)   Places children, unborn children of pregnant women, elderly people,
and individuals with cardiovascular and/or respiratory disease at special risk;
      (4)   Is a trigger for acute episodes of respiratory distress and
myocardial infarction;
      (5)   Increases the lifetime exposure to carcinogenic tobacco smoke of
both smokers and non-smokers;
      (6)   Burdens the health care system by increasing the number and
frequency of required hospital admissions and emergency visits thereby
increasing the public and private expenditures required for the treatment;
      (7)   Reduces the life expectancy of persons consistently exposed to
secondary smoke; and
      (8)   Causes substantial losses in productivity through smoking related
absences from work and school.
   (b)   High-tech smoking devices, commonly referred to as electronic
cigarettes, or “e- cigarettes”, closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act
of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat
through an electronic ignition system.  After testing a number of electronic
cigarettes, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) determined that various
samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known
carcinogens and toxic chemicals, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines and
diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze.  The FDA’s testing also
suggested that “quality control processes used to manufacture these products
are inconsistent or non-existent”.  Electronic cigarette emissions are made up
of a high concentration of ultrafine particles, and the particle concentration
is higher than in conventional tobacco cigarette smoke.  Electronic cigarettes
produce an aerosol or vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances,
which may appear similar to the smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. 
Their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco
products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties
in enforcing the smoking prohibitions.  The World Health Organization (“WHO”)
recommends that electronic smoking devices not be used indoors, especially in
smoke-free environments, in order to minimize the risk to bystanders of
breathing in the aerosol emitted by the devices and to avoid undermining the
enforcement of smoke-free laws.
   (c)   Accordingly, the purposes of this article are:
      (1)   To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in
enclosed public places;
      (2)   To prohibit smoking in places of employment;
      (3)   To recognize that where the need to breathe smoke-free air
conflicts with the desire to smoke, the need to breathe smoke-free air shall
have priority.
      (4)   To facilitate smoking cessation by active smokers; and
      (5)   To discourage non-smokers from taking up the habit and thereby
developing a nicotine addiction.
         (Ord.17-06.  Passed 3-21-17.)

1321.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of major, secondary
and minor streets and highways shall conform with the Major Thoroughfare Plan
for the City which is on file in the office of the City Manager and with the
provisions of these Subdivision Regulations. Streets not contained in the Major
Thoroughfare Plan should conform to the recommendation of the Planning
Commission based on existing and planned streets, topography, public safety and
convenience and proposed uses of land.
   Planned unit type development is encouraged by the Commission. Where large
subdivisions designed on the basis of neighborhood units are being reviewed,
consideration will be given to the placement of commercial areas and public
areas, in relation both to the neighborhood unit being developed and to other
units that might be developed. Where small subdivisions are being reviewed, the
Commission shall coordinate such subdivisions, to the extent practicable, into
units so that the same relationship with respect to commercial areas and public
areas may be realized. These design standards shall be required in all areas
except where special provisions are made for planned unit developments and for
hillside area in excess of sixteen percent (16%) of slope. Exceptions to the
provisions in this article which  are made for hillside development are
specified in Article
1325  and for planned unit developments in Article
1327 .
(1967 Code Sec. 30-23.)
1321.02  STREETS.
   (a)    Design and Arrangement.
      (1)    The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make
provision for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
areas (or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided)
insofar as they may be deemed necessary for public requirements. Every
subdivision shall have access to a public right of way.
      (2)    The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek
to provide for convenient access to it. Residential streets shall be so
designed as to discourage through traffic, but offset streets with an offset of
less than 150 feet should be avoided.
      (3)    The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets
should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. All other streets
should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible.
      (4)    The minimum curb radius shall be twenty feet to face of curb.
Without curb the minimum pavement radius shall be thirty feet to edge of
pavements. Curb and gutter shall be required for all areas of fifteen percent
(15%) or greater slope.
      (5)    Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through
traffic which may otherwise use secondary or major highways, and whose origin
and destination are not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending
for considerable distance, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be
avoided.
      (6)    Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 150 feet shall
be avoided.
   (b)    Alignment.
      (1)    Vertical. For main thoroughfares, profile grades shall be
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to twenty times the
algebraic difference between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per 100; for
secondary and minor streets and alleys, fifteen times.
      (2)    Minimum horizontal. The radii of centerline curvature:
 
               Degrees            Feet
Primary thoroughfare      15       475
Secondary thoroughfare      19       300

               500 feet on main thoroughfares measured on centerline
               300 feet on secondary thoroughfare measured on centerline
               200 feet on all other streets measured on centerline.
         C.    A clear sight triangle shall be provided at all street
intersections. Within such triangle no vision obstruction objects shall be
permitted which exceed a height of thirty inches above the elevation of the
abutting streets. Such sight triangles shall be established from a distance of:
            1.    100 feet from point of intersection of the street center
               lines for major streets and
            2.    75 feet from point of intersection of the street center lines
for primary streets and
            3.    50 feet from point of intersection of the street center
lines  for all other streets.
   (c)    Street Type and Width.
      (1)    Width of major thoroughfares. The width of all major thoroughfares
shall conform to the width designated on the Major Thoroughfare Plan of the
City.
      (2)    Minimum right of way.  The minimum right-of-way widths of all
collector streets shall be sixty feet.
      (3)    Width of local streets.  The minimum width of local streets

local streets serving apartment dwellings shall be sixty feet and the pavement
width shall be thirty-six feet.
      (4)    Location.  When a proposed subdivision is adjacent to or contains
a State highway, the Commission will seek information from the Commissioner of
Highways as to the status of the highway in reference to width and direction,
and also to access of such highway.
      (5)    Half streets.  Dedication of new half streets shall not be
permitted. Where a dedicated or platted half street or alley exists adjacent to
the tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted, if deemed
necessary by the Planning Commission.
      (6)    Cul-de-sacs.  Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turnaround
having a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty feet. The outside of the road
surface within the turnaround right of way shall have a minimum radius of
thirty-eight feet. The maximum length for a cul-de-sac shall be 600 feet except
where topographical conditions require a longer length which shall be subject
to the approval of the Commission.
      (7)    Dead-end streets.  Dead-end streets, designated to be so
permanently, shall not be permitted. Any dead-end street of a temporary nature,
if longer than 200 feet or fronted by existing lots, shall have a surfaced
turning area equal in diameter to the right-of-way width of such street at its
termination.
      (8)    Marginal access streets.
         A.    Where a subdivision adjoins a major street, and the greater
dimension of the block fronts along such major street or  highway, a marginal
access street shall be designed to provide access to subdivided parcels. Points
of access to the major street or  highway shall be kept to a minimum interval
of 300 feet.
         B.    A planting strip of minimum width of twenty feet shall be
provided between the pavement of the major street or highway  and the pavement
of the marginal access street.
         C.    The minimum  width of the marginal access street shall be thirty
feet.
      (9)    Street grades.  Street grade shall not exceed the following with
due allowances for reasonable vertical curves:
 
                 Desirable (Percent)  Maximum (Percent)
Primary thoroughfare          6          8
Secondary thoroughfare        8          10
Minor streets and alleys      10           13
Streets shorter than 500 feet
   and cul-de-sacs      12           15
      (10)    Street and subdivision names.  The proposed name of the
subdivision and proposed street names shall not duplicate or too closely
approximate, phonetically, the name of any other subdivision or street in the
area covered by these Subdivision Regulations. Proposed streets which are
obviously in alignment with existing streets or are extensions of existing
streets shall bear the name of the existing street. All street names shall be
subject to approval by the Municipality or Commission.
         (1967 Code Sec. 30-24.)
1321.03  ALLEYS.
   Alleys should be avoided in single or two-family districts. They may,
however, be required in multiple dwelling developments where they should have a
minimum width of twenty feet. Alleys are required in the rear of all commercial
and industrial lots, if no other provisions are made for adequate service
access or for parking. The rights of way of such alleys shall not be less than
forty-five feet and dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
(1967 Code Sec. 30-25.)
1321.04  BUILDING LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)    Building Lines.  Building lines shall be established according to the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the City.
   (b)    Easements.  Easements of at least five feet in width shall be
provided on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where
necessary, for poles, wires, conduits and gas mains. Easements may also be
required along or across lots where engineering design or special conditions
may necessitate the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights
of way. A two-foot easement shall be required on one side of an alley to
accommodate pole lines.
(1967 Code Sec. 30-26.)
1321.05  BLOCKS.
   (a)    No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet nor less than 500 feet,
except in unusual circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway,
the greater dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to
minimize the number of points of ingress or egress.
   (b)    Where blocks are over 750 feet in length a crosswalk easement not
less than ten feet in width on or near the halfway point may be required, if
necessary to provide proper access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers
and other facilities.
(1967 Code Sec. 30-27.)
1321.06  LOTS.
   (a)    The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all sublots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
   (b)    All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines except where a variation to this rule will
provide a better street and lot layout. Lots with double frontage except when
paralleling major highways will be avoided.
   (c)    No lot shall have less area or width at the building line than is
required by the zoning regulations applying to the area in which it is located.
   (d)    "Panhandle lots" or "flag lots" may be permitted where topographic
conditions or property configurations indicate such lots to be necessary and
desirable provided that the main portion of the lot conforms to the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)    In case of unusual soil conditions or other physical factors which
may impair the health and safety of the neighborhood in which a subdivision may
be located, upon recommendation of the County Health Officer or Engineer, the
Planning Commission may require larger lot widths and lot areas as deemed
necessary .
   (f)    No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy-five feet. Either of the two sides of a corner lot fronting on a street
may be designated the front of a lot, provided the rear yard shall always be
opposite the frontage so designated. Dwellings may be placed diagonally on a
corner lot in which case the frontage shall be on both streets.
   (g)    The corners of lots at street intersections, shall have a curve with
a minimum radius of twenty feet joining the two sidelines of such rights of
way.
(1967 Code Sec. 30-28.)
1321.07  PUBLIC LANDS.
   (a)    Consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably
located and of adequate size for playgrounds, school sites, parks and other
outdoor recreational facilities as indicated on the Comprehensive Plan and to
be made available by one of the following methods:
      (1)    Dedication to public uses.
      (2)    Reservation of land for the use of property owners by deeds or
covenants.
      (3)    Reservation for acquisition by a public agency within a period of
three years. Such reservation shall be made in such a manner as to provide for
a release of the land to the subdivider in the event no public agency proceeds
with the purchase.
   
   (b)    Due regard shall be shown for preserving outstanding cultural,
historic or natural features such as scenic spots, watercourses or
exceptionally fine groves of trees. Dedication to and acceptance by a public
agency is the preferred means of assuring their preservation.
   (c)    Whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is located
within the area being subdivided the subdivider shall provide a permanent
easement dedicated to the proper authority for the purpose of widening,
deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream for drainage or
public use.
   (d)    As a safety measure for the protection of the health and welfare of
the people of this City, the Planning Commission shall reserve the right to
disapprove any subdivision which is subject to flooding, during normal annual
peak stream flows, contains extremely poor drainage facilities or has other
physical impairment. However, if the subdivider agrees to make such
improvements as will make the area completely safe for residential occupancy,
provided that in lieu of the improvements the subdivider shall furnish a surety
bond or a certified check covering the cost of the required improvements, the
subdivision may be approved, subject, however, to the approval of the County
Health Officer and the Engineer.
(1967 Code Sec. 30-29.)
1321.08  TREES.
   Street trees when planted shall be located outside of the street right of
way or any sewer or water easements that may be adjacent to the street right of
way and planted in such manner as not to impair visibility at any corner or
corners.  All subdividers or developers should retain existing trees which are
in satisfactory condition and plant trees in each lot.  The Planning Commission
will cooperate in giving advice on species of trees which are acceptable for
planting (See Table 1367.11.01 “Approved Street Tree and Shrub List”).

1323.01  REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY.
   These minimum required improvements shall be required in all areas except
where special provisions are made for hillside areas in excess of sixteen
percent (16%) of slope. Any exceptions to the provisions in this section which
are made for hillside development are specified in Article
1325 .
   Prior to the granting of final approval the subdivider shall have installed
or shall have furnished a performance bond for the amount of the estimated
construction cost of the ultimate installation of improvements listed and
described herein. The performance bond or cash deposit submitted to the office
of the City Manager will assure the City that the subdivider, his heirs,
successors and assigns, their agent or servants will comply with all applicable
terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of these Subdivision
Regulations; and will faithfully perform and complete the work of constructing
and installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with such laws and
regulations. Before such bond is accepted it shall be approved by the proper
administrative officials.
   The subdivider or developer shall submit a set of construction plans for the
improvement of the road, street or alley, prepared by a registered professional
engineer. The construction plans shall include title of plan, typical sections,
plan and profile view, miscellaneous engineering details and estimate of
quantities. Cross sections will be submitted upon request by the Engineer. All
typical sections and major engineering details to be used on any particular
road, street or alley shall be approved in advance by the Engineer or his
representative before .completion of the plans. When the subdivider or
developer submits for approval a construction plan for street improvements for
a part of a proposed subdivision area, preliminary street grades and proposed
drainage facilities for the entire subdivision area shall also be presented.
   When deemed desirable the Engineer or his representative may require the
construction or vacation of part or all of any intersecting roads, streets or
alleys in order to assure that no hardship or added expense be endured by
abutting property owners or the County at some future date.
   All of the required improvements shall be made in full compliance with the
specifications for each of the various units of work as required by the
Engineer or the County Health Officer, according to the nature of the
improvements. Upon final approval of the construction plans, two sets of the
prints will be required for the use of the Engineer.
(1967 Code Sec. 30-31.)
1323.02  MONUMENTS.
   Permanent markers shall be placed at all corners where permanent corners do
not exist, if practical, otherwise as directed by the Engineer. These shall be
permanent markers made of concrete at least two feet long and six inches square
or six inches in diameter, with appropriate markings on top. The location and
description of each of these markers shall be shown on the subdivision plat.
(1967 Code Sec. 30-32.)
1323.03  UTILITY AND STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)    Water Supply.
      (1)    Public water supply.  The subdivider shall provide the
subdivision  with a complete water main supply system, which shall be
connected  to a municipal or community water supply approved by the City  Water
Commission, except that when such municipal or community water supply is not
available, the subdivider shall provide an individual water supply on each lot
in the subdivision in accordance with minimum requirements of the County Health
Department.
      (2)    Plans for water supply systems.  The plans for the installation of
a water main supply system shall be provided by the subdivider and approved by
the City Water Commission and the County Health Department. The water main
supply system shall not be installed until the plans for the system have been
approved, in writing, by the City Water Commission. Upon the completion of the
water supply installation, the plans for such system as built shall be filed
with the Planning Commission.
      (3)    Private water supply.
         A.    Test wells. Where public water supply is not available at least
one test well shall be made in the area being platted for each  100 lots or
each twenty-five acres of area, whichever is the  smaller. In cases where
copies of the logs of existing wells located within the area being platted are
available, this may be submitted in lieu of making test wells. Test wells shall
be at least twenty-five feet in depth and shall produce safe potable drinking
water at a rate of not less than five gallons per minute per family.
   A copy of the well log, which shall include the name and  address of the
well driller, shall be submitted with the plat  to the Commission.
         B.    Location and construction of individual private wells.
Individual  private wells shall be located at least twenty-five feet from 
property lines; seventy-five feet from all septic tanks; approximately 100 feet
from all tile disposal fields and other sewage  disposal facilities; ten feet
from all cast iron sewer lines; thirty feet from any vitrified sewer tile
lines; and shall not be located  within any flood plain.
   As a precaution against seepage, a water-tight seal shall be  provided
around the pump mounting.  All abandoned wells shall be sealed in a manner that
will render them water-tight.
   In all cases where it has been determined that individual water  supplies
from private wells are not feasible, a public water distribution system will be
required.
   (b)    Sanitary Sewage Disposal.
      (1)    Types of installation. The subdivider shall provide the highest
type of sanitary sewage disposal facility consistent with the existing soil,
physical and other geological conditions. The following types of sanitary
sewage disposal facilities are listed in order of desirability:
         A.    Public sanitary sewer and treatment plant system;
         B.    Community sanitary sewer system with a temporary sewage
treatment plant;
         C.    Capped sewers with temporary, approved on-site facilities; and
         D.    Septic tank with tile field.
      (2)    Sanitary sewers.  If a subdivision can be reasonably served by the
extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the
Commission, the subdivider or developer shall provide a system of sanitary
sewer mains and shall provide lateral connections for each lot. Whenever main
lines are installed, sewer and water shall be extended to property lines.
Connections to public sanitary sewer lines shall be subject to the approval of
and according to the specifications of the Engineer.
      (3)    On-site sewage disposal facilities. All lots which cannot be
connected with a public or community sanitary sewage disposal system at the
time of construction of a principal building shall be provided with an on-site
sanitary sewage disposal system consisting of septic tanks connected with a
tile disposal field, and which shall, as a minimum requirement, meet the design
standards of the State Department of Health. If on-site sanitary sewage
disposal facilities are to be utilized, the Commission may require that the
subdivider submit a report relative to economic feasibility of off- site sewage
disposal if the Commission considers that the proposed on- site facilities are
not the highest type consistent with existing soil, physical and geological
conditions. Such report shall compare the cost of providing such facilities and
the cost of providing such higher type of facility as the Commission shall
specify. Where on-site sanitary sewage disposal facilities are to be utilized,
each lot so served shall be of a size and shape to accommodate the necessary
length of tile field at a safe distance from, and at a lower elevation than,
the proposed buildings.
   Whenever a subdivider proposes that individual on-site sanitary sewage
disposal systems shall be utilized within the subdivisions, the subdivider
shall either install such facilities or shall require (by deed restriction or
otherwise), as a condition of the sale of each lot or parcel within the
subdivision that such facilities shall be installed by the purchaser of such
lot or parcel at the time that a principal building is constructed, and in
accordance with these Subdivision Regulations.
   Where studies by the Commission or the County indicates construction or
extension of sanitary trunk sewers to serve property being subdivided appears
probable within a reasonably short time (up to five years), the Commission may
require the installation and capping of sanitary sewer mains and house
connections, in addition to the  installation of temporary, individual, on-site
sanitary sewage disposal systems. Capped sewers however, will not be required
if completed plans and profile of trunk sewers are not available. It shall be
the responsibility of the County or other such appropriate agency to supervise
design and installation of such capped sewers, and the acceptance of such
responsibility shall be prerequisite to the Commission's requirement of such
installation.
   The Health Officer shall certify the adequacy of the community or on-site
sanitary sewage disposal system proposed. Such certification shall accompany
all final plat applications.
      (4)    Soil percolation test requirements.  Soil percolation tests shall
be performed for all subdivisions wherein buildings at the site of construction
will not be connected to a public or community sanitary sewage disposal system.
   Soil percolation tests shall be made, in accordance with the procedure
requirement by the State Department of Health by a registered professional
engineer, at the rate of one test site for each acre of the property being
subdivided.
   If the analysis of the soil percolation test results reveals the soil is
unsuitable for the intended use at the first site proposed, the Commission may
require that the lot sizes be increased in accordance with the test results or
that additional tests be made on each proposed lot at the location of the
contemplated disposal facilities, and the data submitted for approval.
   (c)    Drainage.  All necessary facilities, including underground pipe lets,
catch basins or open drainage ditches shall be installed to provide for the
adequate disposal of subsurface and surface water maintenance of natural
drainage courses. All storm drainage facilities within the subdivision shall
connect to an adequate drainage outlet. A drainage plan shall be submitted
simultaneously with the plat of any subdivision, showing the proposed scheme of
surface drainage.
      (1)    Standards and specifications for drainage facilities.  The
construction of storm water drainage improvements shall be subject to the
approval of the engineer.
      (2)    Storm sewers and storm water.  A drainage system adequate to serve
the needs of the proposed new streets and the entire subdivision will be
required in the new subdivisions. Where an adequate public storm sewer main is
available at the plat boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer
system and connect with such storm sewer main. If such storm sewer systems are
not accessible, adequate storm water drainage shall be provided by natural
drainage channels with easements of adequate width as approved by the engineer.
      (3)    Culverts and bridges.  When natural drainage channels intersect
any street right of way it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to
have satisfactory bridges and culverts designed and constructed. Culverts shall
be constructed in accordance with the standards established by the engineer.
      (4)    Protection of cuts and fills.  Wherever cuts and fills are to be
made in a subdivision, the subdivider shall provide for the interception and
diversion of surface waters away from the tops of the cuts and fills and into
approved drainage ways.
      (5)    Terraces.  Terraces shall not be permitted in subdivisions when
geological evidence shows the possibility of pressure heads developing in shale
layers beneath the terrace surfaces; provided that the Commission may approve,
or require as a condition of approval, the construction of retaining walls
where necessary to retain cut or fill slopes within rights of way or easements.
   (d)    Street Improvements.  All streets and thoroughfares shall be graded
to their full width, including side slopes, and improved in accordance with the
standards outlined in the following table: 
Construction Standards and Requirements for Streets
 
               Width (in feet)
Type of Street       Right-of-way*    Pavement*
Major             80          48
Secondary street or highway    70          38

   *   For right-of-way and pavement widths for areas where the average
topographic slope is fifteen percent (15%) or greater refer to hillside
regulations in Article
1325 .
   All construction and installations shall be in accordance with applicable
City standards.
   The subdivider or developer shall present a plan and profile showing
proposed street and road grades and drainage structures.
   (e)    Utilities and Other Improvements. Electrical service, gas mains and
other utilities should be provided within each subdivision. Whenever such
facilities are reasonably accessible and available they may be required to be
installed within the area prior to the approval of the final plat.
   (f)    Street Name Signs.    Street name signs, conforming to the standard
in use throughout the City, shall be erected at all intersections.
   (g)    Provisions for Maintenance and Operation.  Where the subdivision
contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas,
street trees or other physical facilities necessary or desirable for the
welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit and which are of
such character that the City or other public agency does not desire to maintain
them, provisions shall be made by trust agreements, which are a part of the
deed restrictions and which are acceptable to the Commission for the proper and
continuous maintenance and supervision of such facilities by the lot owners in
the subdivisions.

the City Limits, except where specifically exempted by State law.
1327.05  INCLUSION AND RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ORDINANCES.
   (A)    The Zoning Ordinance shall be interpreted to include any and all
other provisions of the Morgantown City Code, which are necessary for an
understanding of this ordinance and   the attainment of its purposes. The City
Council of the City of Morgantown, West Virginia, intends that all Morgantown
City Code provisions relating to land use, and all orders, rules, and
regulations established pursuant to said provisions, be read as part of a
uniform system of Morgantown land use regulation.

application directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall
have been rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder
of these regulations or the application thereof to other persons or
circumstances. The City hereby declares that it would have enacted the
remainder of these regulations even without any such part, provision or
application.
1327.08  COMPUTATION OF TIME.

1327.13  TRANSITION RULES.
   In determining the applicability of this Zoning Ordinance with respect to
the previously applicable zoning regulations, the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   When a use lawfully existing on the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance was classified as a permitted use prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance, and such use is classified as a conditional use by this
Zoning Ordinance, such use shall be deemed a lawful nonconforming use. Such use
may be granted a conditional use permit in the manner prescribed by Article
1379 of these regulations or, alternatively, may continue subject to the
nonconforming use provisions of Article
1373 of these regulations.
   (B)   When a use lawfully existing as a permitted use on the effective date
of this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, or any building, structure
or lot lawfully existing that does not meet all development standards set forth
in this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, or is no longer classified
as permitted, such use building, structure, or lot shall be deemed lawfully
nonconforming and shall be subject to the nonconforming use provisions of
Article
1373 of these regulations.
   (C)   When, before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, a complete
application has been filed for a Building Permit for a building or structure
which conforms to all applicable regulations in effect prior to the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance, the building or structure may be completed in
accordance with the plans on the basis of which the application was submitted,
subject to the provisions of Article
1373 of these regulations. Upon completion, said building or structure may be
occupied for the use which was specified on the Building Permit application,
provided said use at the time of application was classified as permitted, or if
classified as a conditional use or as a special exception use, had been
approved by the Planning Commission and/or Board of Zoning Appeals. Provided,
also, if the use originally intended no longer complies with all requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance such use shall be a lawful nonconforming use subject
to the nonconforming use provisions of Article
1373 of these regulations or, alternatively, as a conditional use subject to
the conditional use provisions of Article
1379 of these regulations. However, in the event that said application or
permit expires or is suspended or revoked in accordance with Article
1391 of these regulations, any new permit application that is submitted after
the effective date of this ordinance shall be subject to the regulations in
this ordinance.
   (D)   All variances granted prior to the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance shall remain in full force and effect subject to the conditions of
variance approval. However, such variance shall apply only to the specific
development standard granted.
   (E)   All conditional use permits granted prior to the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance shall remain in full force and effect subject to the
conditions of conditional use approval. Expansion or change in use shall
require compliance with this Zoning Ordinance.
   (F)   For Planned Unit Developments, an outline plan approved under the
previous zoning ordinance and shown on the previous zoning maps shall
constitute an approved outline plan subject to the standards and conditions of
outline plan approval. Subsequent development plans for the site shall comply
with the previous zoning ordinance provisions concerning development plans or,
alternatively, the developer may choose to comply with the development plan
provisions of this ordinance, provided that the proposed development plan does
not conflict with the standards and conditions applicable to the approved
outline plan. A development plan approved under the previous ordinance shall
constitute an approved development plan subject to the standards and conditions
of development plan approval. Where an outline plan has been approved but has
expired, prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, the outline plan
shall be void and may not provide a basis for development plan approval.
   (G)   A preliminary and/or final plat approved and recorded prior to the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, shall remain in full force and effect,
subject to the standards and conditions of plat approval. Final plats may be
recorded as approved in accordance with the Subdivision Control Ordinance.
Preliminary plats shall be entitled to final plat approval subject to the
conditions of preliminary plat approval and subject to the subdivision control
ordinance and the zoning ordinance provisions that were in effect at the time
of preliminary approval. Lots in such subdivisions shall be established in
their platted size and configuration as lots of record. All subsequent
resubdivision, vacation and/or amendment of such plats shall be made under the
provisions of the current comprehensive land use plan, the current subdivision
control ordinance and this Zoning Ordinance. A full and complete application
for preliminary plat approval conforming to all applicable regulations in
effect at the time of application shall be entitled to review under the
regulations in effect at the time of application with respect to lot size and
configuration. Upon approval, lots in such plats shall be established in their
platted size and configuration as lots of record.
1327.14  APPLICABILITY.
   This Zoning Ordinance, unless otherwise noted, shall apply to all public,
private and institutional development unless otherwise exempted by State or
Federal law.

1331.02  ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING MAP.
   The Official Zoning Map adopted with this ordinance is hereby established as
the Official Zoning Map and Zoning Districts (hereinafter “Official Zoning
Map”) of  Morgantown, West Virginia. The Official Zoning Map designates the
respective zoning districts in accordance with this ordinance.
 
1331.03  DETERMINATION AND INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   In determining the boundaries of districts, and establishing the
provisions applicable to each district, due and careful consideration has been
given to existing conditions, the character of buildings erected in each
district, the most desirable use for which the land in each district may be
adapted, and the conservation of property values throughout the City.
 
   (B)   Where uncertainty exists as to the exact boundaries of any district as
shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Unless otherwise indicated, the zone boundary lines are the center
lines of streets or such lines extended; and
      (2)   In the case of further uncertainty, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall interpret the intent of the Zone Map as to the location of the boundary
in question.
 
1331.04  ANNEXATION.
   (A)   Zoning annexed areas. Prior to the filing of a petition for
annexation, the petitioner should petition the Planning  Commission for a
recommendation as to said parcel’s zoning designation. If no such petition is
presented to the Planning Commission, the Commission may:
      (1)   Direct planning staff to study the area proposed for annexation and
prepare a report and recommendation for zoning, or
      (2)   Initiate the establishment of the R-1, Single Family Residential
District designation for the area proposed for annexation, which shall remain
in place until such time as a formal rezoning petition can be submitted and
acted upon.
 
   (B)   Comprehensive Plan as zoning guide.  On future annexation, the
Planning Commission shall give careful consideration to the principles and
directives of the Comprehensive Plan of the City, as amended, in making zone
district classification recommendations to the Council. If the area under
consideration is not addressed in the Comprehensive Plan, the Commission should
give careful consideration to the character of existing land uses, and the
capacity of existing and future infrastructure serving the area.

incorporated in this section and are adopted as the basic land use regulations

Table and read across the use row to find the zoning district column
designations.

club located  within the establishment.

personal to the applicant, is not transferable to any other person, and does
not apply to any other business of the applicant.
      (b)    A HOME OCCUPATION CLASS 2 is considered a conditional use, and is
personal to the applicant, is not transferable to any other person, and does
not apply to any other business of the applicant.
      (c)    The following regulations apply to both classes of home
occupations:
         (i)    A home occupation shall be compatible with residential uses of
the dwelling, shall not change the residential character of the dwelling, and
shall not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood.
         (ii)    A home occupation shall produce no detectable fumes, odors,
dust, heat, noise, vibration, glare, electro-magnetic field, electrical

percent of the floor area of the principal structure, and shall not require

of a new application.

   (27)   A RESTAURANT, in the B-1 and B-4 Districts, which seeks to obtain a
state license as a private club for dispensing alcoholic beverages per the Code
of the State of West Virginia, Chapter 60, Article 7, Section 1 et seq., shall
be subject to the following conditions upon approval of its conditional use
application as a RESTAURANT, PRIVATE CLUB:
      (a)   Such private club shall have as its principal purpose the business
of serving meals on its premises to its patrons and to members of such club and
their guests.  For the purposes of this section, the term “meal” shall be
consistent with that of the State of West Virginia as defined in its
Legislative Rules and Regulations pertaining to Private Club License and shall
not include packaged potato chips and similar products; packaged crackers;
packaged nuts; packaged desserts (fruit pies, cakes, cookies, etc.); and bar
sausages and similar products.
      (b)   Such private club with a bar shall post a sign not smaller than
three (3) square feet in a prominent location near the bar that states the
following:  “It is a violation of City Ordinance to serve wine or liquor
beverages after 1:00 a.m.”
      (c)    No such applicant may be licensed as a private club under this
conditional use that has not been in operation for at least one year as a bona
fide restaurant before making application for a license under this conditional
use. However, when an applicant owns another bona fide restaurant the same as
the one being proposed, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider the proposed
restaurant application on the basis of the existing restaurant which has been
in operation for at least one year. In the B-4 district the Board of Zoning
Appeals may waive the requirement, to be in business for one year as a bona
fide restaurant, when the applicant’s written description of the business
operations, menu, and floor plans, demonstrate clearly that the establishment
will meet the criteria in this subsection.
      (d)    In the B-4 district a full-service hotel, convention or conference
center which serves meals and services to private functions shall be exempt
from the requirements of this section when the areas where liquors are served
are only accessible from an internal part of the building. Such a hotel’s bar
facilities may serve to the general public after 9 p.m.
      (e)    Food and non-alcoholic beverages shall comprise a minimum of 60
percent of total gross sales of all food and drink items in each calendar
month.
      (f)    Such private club shall provide a seating capacity for at least
fifty (50) persons, at a table or counter maintained for the principal purpose
of serving meals. Seats at a bar, which is primarily for the serving of
alcoholic beverages, shall not be counted as meeting the minimum seating
capacity of the establishment. Liquor or wine may be served either at seats
intended primarily for dining, or at any bar area within the restaurant, with
or without an accompanying meal.
      (g)    Liquor or wine shall not be served later than 1:00 a.m., except on
New Year's Eve.
      (h)    The private club shall, at the time of each sale or at the time of
payment, record the amount of revenue derived from the sale of liquor and wine
beverages separately from the amount of revenue derived from the sale of food
and nonalcoholic beverages.
      (i)    During each calendar month, the private club shall maintain and
preserve accurate and adequate records including those required by paragraphs
(e) and (h) above, to prove compliance to the City's Finance Director, and
shall make all such records available for review and audit promptly upon
request by the Finance Director. The records for each month shall be preserved
for not less than twenty-four (24) months next following.
      (j)    Quarterly, the private club shall send to the City Finance
Director summaries showing the amount of revenue derived from liquor and wine
beverages versus the amount derived from the sale of food and non- alcoholic
beverages.
      (k)    In addition to the above requirements, in the B-4 district the
following shall apply:
      (i)    The August 2, 1994 City ordinance which created this regulation
stated that the specific locations at which private club licenses existed on
the date of the August 2, 1994 ordinance shall become legal non-conforming uses
and subject to the nonconforming provisions of the City’s Zoning Ordinance,
except that such use shall not be permitted to expand within the building it
occupies. Effective November 11, 2003, this regulation is amended to permit the
expansion of a private club location which became a legal nonconforming use in
the B-4 district on August 2, 1994, and still exists as a legal nonconforming
use within the structure that it occupied as of August 2, 1994 subject to the
requirements of this Ordinance, and provided that no structural alterations are
made within the building in order to allow the use to expand, except those that
may be required by the Building Inspections Department. No such nonconforming
use location shall be allowed to increase the number of private clubs existing
within it beyond that existing as of August 2, 1994. Nothing herein shall
prohibit the location of a restaurant/private club by conditional use within
any such nonconforming use location in addition to a private club, which may
already exist.
      (ii)    Existing non-conforming uses may apply to become approved
conditional uses under the requirements of this ordinance. For purposes of this
subsection, any location which had a private club license for the year 1993-
94, and expiring on June 30, 1994, will have sixty (60) days from the adoption
of this subsection to obtain State and City Private Club licenses for 1994-95
and thereby remain a legal non-conforming use.

furniture, and open space on private property.
      (1)   All sidewalks, pedestrian walks, open space areas and recreation
facilities shall be suitably paved or surfaced for their respective uses,
landscaped with trees and/or shrubs and other appropriate plant materials, and
provided with benches, trash receptacles, and lighting to coordinate with
street furniture already in place.
      (2)   Street furniture includes such items as benches, trash receptacles,
ATM and telephone enclosures, vending boxes, planters, light standards,
bollards, drinking fountains, and other similar improvements.  Such furnishings
should be integrated into the overall design of the streetscape, and new
furnishing shall match existing examples already installed, where practical.
      (3)   Where possible, the various elements should be clustered to
eliminate visual clutter.  Elements on poles, such as light standards,
planters, traffic signs, and light should be installed in cluster to avoid
forming unnecessary pedestrian barriers or conflicting with curb parking.  When
street furnishings or planting areas are added, sidewalks should be wide enough
to accommodate both the improvement and pedestrian traffic.
      (4)   Obstacles, such as obsolete signposts, parking meter standards,
post or vending boxes, and other items no longer in use, should be removed from
sidewalks, and any holes or other scars to the pavement repaired.  Previous
patching or repairs that do not match current paving should be replaced with
materials that blend with the overall color, texture, and pattern of the
pavement materials.  Whenever possible, replace entire sidewalk segments.
      (5)   Sidewalks are to have a safe and even walking surface, and areas
that have settled or are otherwise damaged shall be repaired and/or replaced to
provide an even and safe surface.  Sidewalks that are replaced or repaired
shall be constructed of material consistent with existing materials and shall
be in conformity to the Downtown Comprehensive Revitalization Plan model.  Any
historic sidewalk paving material should be repaired and retained rather than
replaced.
   
   (C)   Private parking facilities shall comply with the following:
      (1)   All parking areas shall be designed to City standards, with a hard
paved, permanent surface such as asphalt, concrete, or pavers, and shall be
properly lighted (minimum of 2 foot candles).  All parking areas shall
incorporate concrete curbs, gutters and adequate storm drain systems.  Parking
areas shall be designed with adequate ingress and egress from a public right-
of-way or private street.
      (2)   Points of potential conflict between pedestrian and vehicular
traffic, such as crosswalks, parking lots, and alleys shall be clearly
identified by a contrast in color and/or texture and /or material as
appropriate.  Parking spaces shall not be closer than twenty (20) feet to such
crossing.
      (3)   Parking structures shall be designed with building-like facades and
architectural context that will complement the scale, facades and materials
found within the district.  Where feasible, the design of parking structures
shall incorporate street level retail or service uses to ensure pedestrian
viability of the block.
   (D)   Curb Cuts.  No part of a driveway leading from a public street shall
be nearer than thirty-five (35) feet to the street right-of-way line of any
intersecting street, nor nearer than thirty (30) feet to the end of a curb
radius at an intersecting street, nor shall the driveway be nearer than thirty
(30) feet to any other part of another driveway entering a public street.  The
maximum width of any driveway leading from a public street shall not exceed
twenty-six (26) feet at the curb line or twenty-two (22) feet at the street
right-of-way line.  Driveways that cross pedestrian walks shall be designated
to allow for barrier free pedestrian travel.

drives from parking lots enter a street or alley, a clear vision triangle is
required as determined by the City Engineer.
   (F)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Any land not covered by buildings or pavement shall be suitably
landscaped and maintained.  Plans for treatment of landscape areas shall be
submitted for approval in accordance with Article
1367. 
      (2)   For perennial plantings adjacent to public streets, street trees
must be pruned sufficiently to allow pedestrian movement under the canopy.  All
perennial plant materials used shall meet the following criteria:
         (a)   Plants selected shall be tolerant of urban conditions, and with
low/minimum maintenance.
         (b)   Plants selected shall be hardy species chosen on the basis of
their height, form, color and visual interest.
         (c)   Plant materials should visually complement the building facades
and public improvements.
         (d)   Plants selected should have deep root systems to avoid damage to
road and sidewalk pavement.
            (Ord. 06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
   (G)   Vacant Lots.
      (1)   Street frontages where vacant lots have been created as a result of
building demolition shall be either fenced or landscaped to avoid “gaps” in the
architectural or urban facades/streetscapes.
      (2)   If the site is to be landscaped, a continuous evergreen shrub and/
or tree screen shall be planted, with an installed minimum height of thirty-six
(36) inches. 
(Ord. 09-14.  Passed 4-7-09.)

side setbacks while incorporating measures to preserve the continuity of the
predominant street wall, etc.  Site plan applications for buildings taller than
three (3) stories must include the following:
      (1)   An air flow analysis conducted by a licensed architect or
professional engineer, describing and illustrating the estimated impact of the
proposed building on existing patterns of air flow in the general vicinity; and

1357.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The purpose of the planned unit development is to encourage flexibility in
the development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to
improve the design, character and quality of new developments; to encourage a
harmonious and appropriate mixture of uses and/or housing types; to facilitate
the adequate and economic provision of streets, utilities and city services; to
preserve critical natural environmental and scenic features of the site; to
encourage and provide a mechanism for arranging improvements and sites so as to
preserve desirable features; and to mitigate the problems which may be
presented by specific site conditions. It is anticipated that Planned Unit
Developments will offer one or more of the following advantages:
   (A)    Serve to implement the goals, objectives, and strategies of The
Morgantown Comprehensive Plan specific to the district or neighborhood in which
the PUD is to be located;
   (B)    Apply the design principles of new urbanism, neo-traditionalism, and
other emerging smart growth principles, urban development patterns and best
management practices;
   (C)    Promote development patterns that maximize compatibility of differing
adjacent land uses to avoid the necessity of extensive buffering;
   (D)    Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by conserving areas of
special natural beauty, steep slopes, ecological importance, flood prone areas,
and natural green spaces where appropriate, while understanding that land
within urban areas is best suited for urban densities and development patterns;
   (E)    Counteract poor urban design and mitigate congestion on streets;
   (F)    Promote architecture that is compatible with the community
vernacular, and/or the surroundings;
   (G)    Promote design principles that allow differing types of land uses to
coexist while preserving property values and minimizing potential negative
consequences;
   (H)    Promote appropriate urban densities that will help make alternative
forms of transportation economically and socially feasible; and
   (I)    Promote and protect the environmental integrity of the site and its
surroundings by providing suitable design responses to the specific
environmental constraints of the site and surrounding area.
1357.02  REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   A Planned Unit Development is an area under single ownership or control to
be developed in conformance with an approved development plan, consisting of 1)
a map showing the development area and all proposed improvements to the
development area, 2) a text which sets forth the uses and the development
standards to be met, and 3) exhibits setting forth any aspects of the
development plan not fully described in the map and text. The map, exhibits,
and text constitute a development plan. The uses and standards expressed in the
development plan constitute the use and development regulations for the Planned
Unit Development site in lieu of the regulations for the underlying district.
   (A)    The area designated in the Planned Unit Development map must be a
tract of land at least two (2) acres in size and under single ownership or
control, except in the area of the City bounded by Campus Drive / Stewart
Street on the south, Eighth Street on the north, and the Monongahela River on
the west. To the east, the area is bounded by Jones Avenue from Stewart Street
to Highview Place, then continuing along Highview Place to its end, then
continuing westward to University Avenue, following University Avenue to its
intersection with Eighth Street. Inside this area, commonly known as Sunnyside,
Planned Unit Developments may contain not less than one (1) acre of land under
single ownership or control. The property contained within a Planned Unit
Development should be under single ownership and control. However, multiple
ownership is permissible provided that all owners are co-applicants for the
Planned Unit Development designation. In cases of multiple ownership, covenants
and agreements shall be executed that provide for the identification of one
person or corporation responsible for representing the application and having
the authority to act as agent for all owners for all aspects of the Planned
Unit Development process. Such agreements shall accompany the application for
Planned Unit Development designation.
   (B)    The Outline Plan shall indicate the land use, development standards,
and other applicable specifications of the Zoning Ordinance of Morgantown, West
Virginia, which shall govern the Planned Unit Development. If the Outline Plan
is silent on a particular land use, development standard, or other
specification of the Zoning Ordinance, the standard of the underlying district
or the applicable regulations shall apply.
   (C)    The Planned Unit Development map shall show the location of all
improvements. The location of Planned Unit Developments shall be designated on
the Zone Map and adopted pursuant to rules and regulations governing amendments
of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (D)    The Planned Unit Development must comply with all required
improvements, construction standards, design standards, and all other
engineering standards adopted and enforced by the City of Morgantown, and any
other pertinent regulations, except where specifically varied through the
provisions of this Section of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (E)   Designation and Conveyance or Ownership of Permanent Open Space.
      (1)    Definition. Permanent open space shall be categorized as one of
two types:
         (a)    Improved Open Space is defined as parks, playgrounds, swimming
pools, ball fields, plazas, landscaped green spaces, and other areas that are
created or modified by man. At least thirty (30) percent of the total permanent
open space in any given Planned Unit Development shall be of the Improved Open
Space type.
         (b)    Natural Open Space is defined as areas of natural vegetation,
water bodies, or other landforms that are to be left undisturbed. Creation of a
graded and surfaced walking trail through areas of Natural Open Space shall
constitute disturbance of the area in the amount of the length of the walking
trail multiplied by its width. Neither definition of open space shall include
schools, community centers or other similar areas in public ownership.
      (2)    Designation. Within all Planned Unit Developments, a minimum of
ten (10) percent of the proposed Planned Unit Development area shall be
designated as permanent open space. No plan for a single- or multi- family
residential Planned Unit Development shall be approved unless such plan
provides for permanent landscaped or natural open space.
      (3)    Proximity.
         (a)    In the case of mixed-use Planned Unit Developments, permanent
open space shall be allocated to the property in proportion to the  uses
assigned to the Planned Unit Development and shall be located within reasonable
proximity (within one-quarter of a mile) to those uses. Provided, however, the
permanent open space need not be located in proximity to the use in the case of
preservation of existing features.
         (b)    In the case of mixed-use Planned Unit Developments located
within the boundaries of the Sunnyside neighborhood, permanent open space may
be located within reasonable proximity (within  one quarter of a mile) of the
PUD with the approval of City Council. As an alternative, a payment in lieu of
the open space provision may be made to the City for the purchase or provision
of permanent open space on a separate parcel within one quarter of a mile of a
Sunnyside PUD.
      (4)    Proportion. If the Outline Plan provides for the Planned Unit
Development to be constructed in stages, open space must be provided for each
stage of the Planned Unit Development in proportion to that stage.
      (5)    Conveyance. Permanent open space shall be conveyed in or owned by
one of the following forms:
         (a)    To a municipal or public corporation; or
         (b)    To a nonprofit corporation or entity established for the
purpose of benefiting the owners and tenants of the Planned Unit Development
or, where appropriate and where approved by the Municipal Planning Commission
and the City Council, adjoining property owners, or both. All conveyances
hereunder shall be structures to insure that the grantee has the obligation and
the right to affect maintenance and improvement of the common open space; and
that such duty of maintenance and improvement is enforced by the owners and
tenants of the Planned Unit Development and, where applicable, by adjoining
property owners; or
         (c)    To owners other than those specified in Subsections (a) and (b)
above, and subject to restrictive covenants describing and guaranteeing the
open space and its maintenance and improvement, running with the land for the
benefit of residents of the Planned Unit Development or adjoining property
owners, or both; or
         (d)    Included in single-family residential lots under the individual
control of lot owners.
      (6)    Uses permitted in a Planned Unit Development may be any use that
is found in the Zoning Ordinance in any district, subject to the approval of
the Municipal Planning Commission and City Council. However, the City reserves
the right to require that a PUD consist of only residential uses when
circumstances warrant. Examples of such circumstances may include, but are not
limited to: significant infrastructure constraints that could cause practical
difficulties in supporting nonresidential uses, the character and land use
pattern of surrounding neighborhoods, and possible deleterious changes in
traffic circulation patterns in the immediate area. A developer may also
initiate a request to limit his or her PUD to residential uses.
   (F)    For purposes of determining overall project size, two or more parcels
of land owned by the applicant that are wholly or partially separated by a
public street or other right-of-way may be considered contiguous and thus may
be counted in fulfilling the minimum acreage requirement, provided that the use
and development of the property is incorporated into, and is an integral part
of the project plans; and provided that there is no other property not owned by
the applicant separating the parcels in question. Where there is uncertainty in
determining a parcel's qualification to be included in the PUD, the Planning
Commission shall resolve the issue and make a determination as to the project
boundaries, after considering the advice of the Planning Director and the
request by the applicant.
1357.03  PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)    Introduction. Applications shall be accompanied by all plans and
documents required by Section
1357.02. A three-step application process shall be used. The steps in the
process are:
      (1)    Pre-application Conference;
      (2)    Outline Plan Approval; and
      (3)    Development Plan Approval.
   (B)    Pre-application Conference. Prior to filing a formal application for
approval of a Planned Unit Development, the applicant shall schedule a pre-
application conference with the Planning Director. The purposes of the pre-
application conference shall be to:
      (1)    Allow the applicant to present a general concept and to discuss
characteristics of the development concept in relation to adopted municipal
plans and policies.
      (2)    Allow the Planning Director to inform the applicant of pertinent
policies, standards and procedures for the Planned Unit Development.
      (3)    The pre-application conference is intended only for the above
purposes; neither the developer nor the City of Morgantown is bound by any
decision made during a pre-application conference.
   (C)    Procedure for Outline Plan Approval. Based upon the pre-application
conference, the applicant shall develop and submit an Outline Plan for the
proposed Planned Unit Development.
      (1)    The Outline Plan and application for the Planned Unit Development
shall be submitted to the Planning Director who, after certifying the
application package to be complete, shall initiate a review of the proposed
development.
      (2)    The application and the results of the review shall then be
forwarded to the Municipal Planning Commission for its consideration, public
hearing and recommendations together with the Planning Department's report and
such other documents as may be pertinent to the Planned Unit Development.
      (3)    The Municipal Planning Commission shall hold a special Ward
Meeting in the Ward where the proposed project is located. If the project
crosses Ward boundaries, the meeting shall be held in the Ward where the
majority of the property is located. The hearing shall be conducted at least
seven (7) days prior to the regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting at
which the formal public hearing will be held. The Planning Department will
place an advertisement in the newspaper specifying the time and location of the
Ward Meeting, at least five (5) days prior to meeting.
      (4)    Where there are environmentally sensitive features on the site or
the Development Plan is expected to be complex, or there are other important
planning implications involved, the Municipal Planning Commission may reserve
the right to review the Development Plan. And, where the Municipal Planning
Commission recommends denial of an Outline Plan and the City Council approves
the plan, the Municipal Planning Commission shall review the Development Plan.
      (5)    Upon completion of its review, the Municipal Planning Commission
shall forward the application to the City Council with (a) a favorable
recommendation, (b) an unfavorable recommendation, or (c) no recommendation.
   (D)    Effect of Approval of Outline Plan:
      (1)   When an Outline Plan for a Planned Unit Development has been
approved by the City Council, the Plan shall become effective and its location
shall be shown on the Zone Map. The Zone Map shall be amended to designate the
site as a Planned Unit Development (PUD).
      (2)    Upon such amendment of the Zone Map, the use and development of
the site shall be governed by the Planned Unit Development Outline Plan,
subject to approval of a Development Plan.
      (3)    No permit of any kind shall be issued until the Development Plan
has been approved.
      (4)    Development Plan:
         (a)    Purpose of Development Plan Approval. The purpose of the
Development Plan is to designate the controls for development of the Planned
Unit Development. The Development Plan shall show the exact location of each
building and improvement to be constructed and a designation of the specific
internal use or range of uses for each building.
         (b)    Time Limit for Approval of Development Plan. The Development
Plan shall be submitted to the Planning Department not more than eighteen (18)
months following City Council approval of the Outline Plan. The Outline and
Development Plans may be submitted as a single plan if all requirements of
Section
1357.02 are satisfied. The Development Plan may be submitted and approved in
stages, with each stage representing a portion of the Outline Plan, at the
discretion of the Municipal Planning Commission. The time limit for submitting
each stage for approval may be set forth in the Outline Plan, in which case
that schedule shall control the timing of development, rather then the time
period contained in this paragraph. The Municipal Planning Commission may
extend the time for application for approval of Development Plan for good
cause, consistent with the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance.
         (c)    Expiration of Time Limit. Periodically, the Planning Director
shall report to the Municipal Planning Commission on Planned Unit Developments
with time limits that have expired. The original applicants or current
developers of the Planned Unit Development shall be notified by the Planning
Director. The Municipal Planning Commission shall determine whether to consider
extending the time or to initiate action to amend the Zone Map so as to rescind
the Planned Unit Development designation.
         (d)    Relationship of Development and Outline Plan. The Development
Plan shall conform to the Outline Plan as approved.
         (e)    Procedure for Approval of a Development Plan: The applicant
must have the Development Plan approved prior to issuance of any building
permit.
            (i)    Development Plan Submission. The Development Plan and
supporting data shall be filed with the planning staff.
            (ii)    Review. The Planning Director shall review the Development
Plan to include site plan review, in accordance with the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance.
            (iii)    Staff Approval. It shall generally be the responsibility
of staff to review Development Plans unless the Municipal Planning Commission
reviews the Development Plans, or where no Development Plan is required.
            (iv)    Municipal Planning Commission Review. If the Municipal
Planning Commission has retained Development Plan approval authority, the
Municipal Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with
its rules and regulations for amendments. The Commission may 1) approve, 2)
deny or 3) approve with modifications.
         (f)    Expiration of Development Plan. The Development Plan shall
expire 2 years after approval, unless grading and/or building permits have been
obtained and are still current and valid on that date. This rule shall also
apply to each stage of a Development Plan approved in stages. The applicant may
request, in writing, an extension of time, and the approving authority may
extend the time limit where deemed appropriate. Such extension may be
considered at the time of Development Plan approval.
         (g)    Effect of Approval of Development Plan. No permit of any kind
shall be issued for any purpose within a Planned Unit Development except in
accordance with the approved Development Plan, and after acceptance by the City
of Morgantown of all required guarantees for improvement.

1357.05  REVIEW CONSIDERATIONS.
   In their consideration of a Planned Unit Development Outline Plan, the
Planning Director in his report to the Municipal Planning Commission, the
Municipal Planning Commission in their recommendation to City Council, and the
City Council in its decision, shall evaluate the project in light of as many of
the following objectives as may be relevant to the specific proposal:
   (A)    The extent to which the Planned Unit Development meets the purposes
of the Zoning Ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan, and any other adopted planning
objectives of the City of Morgantown.
   (B)    The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements,
standards, and stated purpose of the Planned Unit Development regulations.
   (C)    The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property, including
but not limited to, the density, dimension, bulk, use, required improvements,
and construction and design standards and the reasons why such departures are
or are not deemed to be in the public interest.
   (D)    The proposal will not be injurious to the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
   (E)    The physical design of the Planned Unit Development and the extent to
which it makes adequate provision for public services, provides adequate
control over vehicular traffic and promotes alternative forms of
transportation, provides for and protects designated permanent open space, and
furthers the amenities of urban ambience, light and air, recreation and visual
enjoyment.
   (F)    The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to the
adjacent properties and neighborhood, and whether the proposed plan would
substantially interfere with the use or diminish the value of adjacent
properties and neighborhoods.
   (G)    The desirability of the proposed plan to the City of Morgantown's
physical development, tax base and economic well-being. At the discretion of
the Planning Commission and City Council, special consideration in the form of
increased development flexibility may be given to projects that are intended to
rehabilitate or replace dilapidated areas, brownfields, or other areas of
general visual or economic blight. Such special consideration shall not be
granted to projects intended for construction on lands that consist of 60
percent or more previously undeveloped lands.
   (H)    The proposal will not cause undue traffic congestion, and can be
adequately served by existing or programmed public facilities and services.
   (I)    The proposal preserves significant ecological, natural, historical,
and architectural resources to the extent possible.
   (J)    The proposal will enhance the appearance, image, function, and
economic sustainability of the community at large.
   (K)    Projects which are designed to a more human scale, support multi-
modal transportation options, preserve useful open space, provide significant
amenities to residents, and incorporate architectural detailing, massing and
scale that is consistent with historical community norms shall have a
significant advantage in the review process over those that merely seek to
maximize inappropriate forms of density, circumvent customary development
standards, or promote a pattern of development that can be generally recognized
as “urban sprawl,” as defined in the definition section of the zoning
ordinance. Projects that fail to achieve these objectives will likely result in
a recommendation for denial by the Planning Director and/or Planning
Commission.
   (L)    The proposal makes reasonable accommodations in housing, recreational
amenities, and pedestrian facilities for individuals with disabilities.
   (M)    The proposal dedicates and provides a percentage of the total number
of dwelling units to be offered at sale or rental prices deemed affordable to
individuals of low and moderate income, as defined by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. Generally, between 3 to 5 percent of all units
should meet this goal.
   (N)    For PUD’s containing only residential uses, clustering of units
should be utilized (and may be required by the City) in order to preserve
meaningful open space and/or recreational amenities for the residents. In
addition, such projects shall be required to provide a mixture of different
dwelling types and sizes. Examples of dwelling types include townhouses, row
houses, patio homes, zero lot line houses, single-family detached housing,
apartments, duplexes, condominiums, etc.

1359.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Interstate Sign Overlay District is to provide an area
within 500 feet of a Federal Interstate Highway right-of-way within which on-
premise pole or pylon signs or billboard signs may be erected for the
convenience of the motoring public. This overlay district may not be applied
over any residentially zoned property.
(Ord. 13-08.  Passed 3-5-13.)
1359.02  GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Conditional use approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
required for on-premise pole or pylon signs and billboard signs.
   (b)   No more than one pole or pylon sign or billboard sign may be located
on a parcel.
   (c)   Spacing.
      (1)   Billboard signs shall not be located within 1,000 feet of any other
billboard sign.  This distance requirement shall include in its calculation any
billboards located outside the corporate boundaries of the City.
      (2)   Billboard signs shall not be located within 200 feet of a
residential zoning district.  If illuminated by internal, external or digital/
electronic means, said signs shall not be located within 300 feet of a
residential zoning district. 
      (3)   No such spacing limit shall apply for on-premise pole or pylon
signs.
   (d)   Height.  Maximum sign height for on-premise pole or pylon signs or
billboard signs shall be determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals, after
considering evidence supplied by the applicant that clearly demonstrates, to
the satisfaction of the Board, that the requested height is necessary. The
Board shall take into account the horizontal distance the sign will be from the
travel lanes of the roadway, the difference in elevation between the property
grade and the roadway grade, and the advice of the City Engineer and/or
Planning Director. The Board may approve the height requested by the applicant,
or any other height that it deems is warranted given the facts of the case.
   (e)   Area.  The maximum area for on-premise pole or pylon signs shall not
exceed 250 square feet; for billboard signs 450 square feet; or, whatever
smaller area the Board of Zoning Appeals approves, considering the same
criteria as for height. This shall be in addition to any other signs permitted
by these regulations.  For the purposes of this section, the surface display
area of a pole or pylon sign or a billboard sign shall be measured to include
the entire area within a regular geometric form or combinations thereof
comprising all of the display area of the sign, including all of the elements
of the matter displayed.  Frames and structural members, excluding necessary
supports or uprights, shall be included in computation of the surface display
area.  In the case of a sphere, spheroid, or similar shaped sign (e.g. a ball),
the total surface display area shall be divided by two for determine the
maximum surface display area permitted.  The regulations regarding computation
of sign area for double-sided and V-type signs in Article 1369 shall apply.
   (f)   Setback.  No on-premise pole or pylon sign or billboard sign may be
located within 15 feet of any parcel boundary line of the property on which the
subject sign is located.
   (g)   Distance requirements provided in this section shall be measured
radially from the leading edge of the sign face.
   (h)   No on-premise pole or pylon sign or billboard sign may be located on
top of, cantilevered over or otherwise suspended above any building or
structure.
   (i)   An on-premise pole or pylon sign or billboard sign having more than
one surface display area which are tandem (side-by-side) or stacked (one above
the other) are considered two billboards and are prohibited.
   (j)   Illumination.  On-premise pole or pylon signs may only be internally
illuminated.  Billboard signs may be illuminated provided such illumination is
consistent with the requirements for a digital billboard as set forth herein,
or is concentrated on the surface of said sign and is located so as to avoid
glare or reflection onto any portion of an adjacent street or highway, the path
of oncoming vehicles or any adjacent premises.
   (k)   Appearance.
      (1)   Except for time and temperature signs or digital billboards as
otherwise regulated herein, all on-premise pole or pylon signs and billboard
signs must be static or stationary and may not contain any visible moving
parts, alternating or moving messages or have the appearance of having moving
parts or messages.  Provided, each message or copy displayed on a mechanically
changed billboard sign (e.g., tri-action, etc.) shall remain fixed for at least
ten (10) seconds; must accomplish the change between messages within an
interval of two (2) seconds or less; and must contain a default design that
will freeze the sign in one position if a malfunction occurs.
      (2)   Under no circumstances may any type of on-premise pole or pylon
sign or billboard sign contain a message or display that appears to flash,
undulate, pulse, move, scroll, or portray explosions, fireworks, flashes of
light, or blinking lights or otherwise appears to move toward or away from the
view, expand or contract, bounce, rotate, spine twist or make other comparable
movements.
      (3)   The frames, borders, and all structural members of a billboard sign
shall be black, with no illumination and no writing or symbols other than the
identification (name and/or logo) of the sign owner/operator.
   (l)   Permitting.  Every on-premise pole or pylon sign and billboard sign
requires a City building permit before installation or modification.  Permits
shall be reviewed and issued consistent with the terms of this section as well
as all other applicable ordinances of the City as amended from time to time. 
Every applicant for an on-premise pole or pylon sign or billboard sign shall
file with the building permit application a certificate of insurance naming the
City as coinsured and certifying that the applicant and City are insured
against bodily injury and for property damage arising out of the erection,
maintenance, repair, and replacement of the sign.  Each applicant, if the
permit is granted, shall be required to maintain said insurance and keep a
certificate of insurance currently effective on file with the City so long as
the sign is in existence.  The certificate shall provide that the City shall
receive ten (10) days written notice in case of cancelation of the policy.  Any
on-premise pole or pylon sign or billboard sign in violation of the insurance
requirements of this section shall be removed immediately and the cost of such
removal shall be charged against the owner/operator of the sign.
   (m)   Other Applicable Requirements and Laws.  An on-premise pole or pylon
sign or billboard sign must otherwise comply with all other relevant
regulations and ordinances of the City and comply with all applicable
provisions of federal and state law.
(Ord. 13-08.  Passed 3-5-13.)
1359.03  DIGITAL OFF-PREMISE AND BILLBOARD SIGN REGULATIONS.
   The City recognizes that billboards are, by their nature, different in scope
and purpose from other types of signage in the City.  Billboards are
significantly larger in size than other types of signage allowed in the City
and their principal purpose is to dramatically attract the attention of the
travelling public.  The potential impact of a billboard on adjacent areas is
significantly greater than other types of signage.  Advancements in technology
and efficiencies enable signs to change static message or copy electronically
(e.g. utilizing an LED or digital type of sign).  These newer technologies
exacerbate the potential impact of a billboard in terms of adversely dominating
the environment in which they operate due to light spillover and light
pollution, unless regulated in a reasonable fashion.  The intent of this
section is to establish standards and regulations for billboards, including
addressing those utilizing these newer technologies, in order to minimize the
secondary effects that can accompany the unregulated display of these types of
signs; preserve the character and repose of adjacent areas, with a principal
focus on residential neighborhoods; protect property values in all areas of the
City; and, reduce traffic and similar hazards caused by undue distractions.
   (a)   Locations.  In addition to the spacing and setback standards provided
in this section, digital or electronic billboard signs are prohibited on the
same site as a National Register designated historic structure or within a
National Register designated historic district.  Digital or electronic
billboard signs are prohibited within 500 feet of a National Register
designated historic structure, except where a federal interstate highway
separates the digital or electronic billboard sign from the National Register
designated historic structure.
   (b)   Display.
      (1)   The display or message on a digital billboard sign may change no
more frequently than once every ten (10) seconds.  Any change in message or
copy shall be completed instantaneously.
      (2)   The display, message, or copy must otherwise comply with subsection
1359.02(k) and the digital billboard sign must have a light sensing device to
adjust brightness as ambient light conditions change in order to insure that
the message meets the following brightness standard.
Maximum brightness levels for digital billboards shall not exceed 0.2 (two
tenths) foot-candles over ambient light levels measured within 150 feet of the
sign.  Certification must be provided to the City demonstrating that the sign
has been preset to automatically adjust the brightness to these levels or
lower.  Certified re-inspection and recalibration shall be annually required by
the City, in its reasonable discretion, at the sign owner/operator's expense to
ensure that the specified brightness levels are maintained at all times.
      (3)   Brightness of digital billboards shall be measured as follows:
         A.   At least 30 minutes following sunset, a foot-candle meter shall
be used to obtain an ambient light reading for the location.  This is done
while the sign is off or displaying black copy.  The reading shall be made with
the meter aimed directly at the sign area at the pre-set location.
         B.   The sign shall then be turned on to full white copy to take
another reading with the meter at the same location.
         C.   If the difference between the readings is 0.2 (two tenths) foot-
candles or less, the brightness is properly adjusted.
      (4)   Consecutive messages on a single digital or electronic sign face
(digital slots) are prohibited when the second message answers a textual
question posed on the prior slot, continues or completes a sentence started on
the prior slot, or continues or completes a story line started on the prior
slot.  Nothing in the subsection shall prohibit consecutive messages by the
same advertiser or consecutive messages for the same product or service;
provided, that the second of such advertisements does not answer a textual
questions posed on the prior advertisement slot, continue or complete a
sentence stared on the prior advertisement slot, or continue or complete a
story line started on the prior advertisement slot.  For example, consecutive
advertisements by a single grocery store advertising the same or multiple
products are permitted provided that such advertisements do not answer textual
questions from one slot to the next slot, continue or complete a sentence from
one slot to the next slot, or continue or complete a story line from one slot
to the next slot.
      (5)   The sign shall have a default mechanism or setting that will cause
the sign to turn off or show a "full black" image if a visible malfunction or
failure occurs.
      (6)   The sign shall not be configured to resemble a warning or danger
signal.  The sign shall not resemble or simulate any lights or official signage
used to control traffic.
   (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, in reviewing the conditional use
application, may require, as a reasonable condition, that an approved digital
billboard sign be turned off or display a "full black" image during nighttime
hours to preserve the character and repose of adjacent residential areas.
   (d)   The owner/operator of the digital billboard sign shall maintain a
secure electronic communication network that controls the display and display
changes.
   (e)   Prior to the issuance of a permit for construction of a digital
billboard sign, the owner/operator of the sign shall enter into an agreement
with the City providing for public service announcements or a regular basis
without charge.  Such announcements shall be provided as specified in the
agreement and shall include messages of significant public interest related to
safety and traffic matters (e.g. AMBER Alerts, Cop Killer Alerts, severe
weather, disaster, evacuation bulletins/notices, etc.).
      (Ord. 13-08.  Passed 3-5-13.)
1359.04  CONDITIONAL USE APPLICATION.
   (a)   As part of the conditional use application for on-premise pole or
pylon signs and billboard signs, the applicant shall provide a certified land
survey prepared by an engineer or surveyor licensed to practice in West
Virginia that shows the following:
      (1)   The parcel boundaries for the property on which the proposed sign
is to be located.
      (2)   The right-of-way boundary of the Federal Interstate Highway used to
establish the applicable ISOD Overlay District.
      (3)   The exact location of the proposed sign.
      (4)   The distances between the subject Federal Interstate Highway right-
of-way, the property on which the proposed sign is to be located, and the exact
location of the proposed sign.  If the parcel is entirely contained within the
500-foot ISOD Overlay District boundary, the survey shall so indicate. If only
a portion of the parcel falls within the 500-foot ISOD Overlay District
boundary, the survey must indicate which portions of the property fall within
it, and which are outside of the boundary.
      (5)   The location of any existing or proposed buildings, structures, and
other on-premise pole or pylon and billboard signs on the subject property.
      (6)   Floodplain boundaries, as may be required by the City Engineer.
   (b)   In addition to the survey, the applicant must submit the following:
      (1)   A scaled photo simulation of the proposed on-premise pole or pylon
sign or billboard sign from no less than two (2) points of view, the locations
of which must be agreed to by the Planning Director.
      (2)   The proposed height, square footage, and construction details of
the proposed sign.  Signs shall be designed by a licensed engineer and shall
conform to the regulations of the West Virginia State Building Code and design
standards provided herein.
      (3)   If the proposed sign is a billboard sign, a map must be submitting
illustrating the following:
         A.   Any and all billboard signs within 1,500 feet, measured radially,
of the proposed billboard sign location along with the distances between same.
         B.   The distance of the proposed billboard sign, measured radially,
to the closest residential zoning district.

      (1)   Erection of a new structure; and/or,
      (2)   Addition to or increase in the height of an existing structure;
and/or,
      (3)   Establishment, erection and/or maintenance of any use, structure,
or object (natural or manmade).
   (b)   Prior to the issuance of any building permit within this Airport
Overlay District, the applicant shall submit documentation to the City
demonstrating compliance with the federal requirement for notification of the
proposed construction or alteration, a valid aeronautical evaluation, and a
copy of the FAA's determinations to said notification.
   (c)   If the FAA returns a determination of no penetration of protected
airspace, the building permit request shall be considered in compliance with
the intent of this Airport Overlay District.  If the FAA returns a
determination of a penetration of protected airspace, the permit shall be
denied, and the applicant may seek a variance from such regulations as outlined
in Section
1360.07.
   (d)   Exceptions.  In the following circumstances, the filing of a Notice of
Construction or Alteration with the FAA within the Airport Overlay District
shall not be required:
      (1)   To make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of existing
structures which do not enlarge or increase the height of an existing
structure.
      (2)   Within the Primary Surface, Approach Surface, and Transitional
Surface Zones, when construction and/or alteration of a structure is below
1,248 feet above mean sea level.
      (3)   Within the Horizontal Surface and Conical Surface Zones, when the
construction and/or alteration of a structure is below 1,398 feet above mean
sea level.
   (e)   In addition to the height restrictions of this Airport Overlay
District, no structure or obstruction shall be permitted within the corporate
limits of the City of Morgantown that would cause a Minimum Obstruction
Clearance Altitude, a Minimum Descent Altitude, or a decision height to be
raised.
(Ord. 14-49.  Passed 11-5-14.)
1360.07  VARIANCE FROM HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   In addition to provisions set forth in Article 1381 "Variances" of the
City's Planning and Zoning Code, any request for a variance to the height
restrictions of this Airport Overlay District shall include documentation in
compliance with 14 CFR Part 77 Subpart B.
   (b)   Applicants seeking variance relief to height restrictions of this
Airport Overlay District must, as a part of the variance application, submit
all documentation concerning the applicant's Notice of Construction or
Alteration (FAA Form 7460-1, as amended or replaced) filed with the FAA, a
valid aeronautical evaluation, and the FAA's determinations to said
notification.
   (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals' considerations of whether to grant a
variance to the height restrictions of this Airport Overlay District must
include the determinations made by the FAA as to the effect of the proposed
construction and/or alteration on the operation of air navigation facilities
and the safe, efficient use of navigable air space.  In particular, the request
for a variance shall consider which of the following categories the FAA has
placed the proposed development in:
      (1)   No Objection - The subject construction and/or alteration is
determined to not exceed obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not
required to mitigate potential hazard.  Under this determination a variance
shall be granted, as it relates to relief from the height restrictions of this
Airport Overlay District.
      (2)   Conditional Determination - The proposed construction and/or
alteration is determined to create some level of encroachment into an airport
hazard area which can be effectively mitigated. Under this determination, a
variance shall be granted, as it relates to relief from height restrictions of
this Airport Overlay District, contingent upon implementation of mitigating
measures as described in Section
1360.10 - Obstruction Marking and Lighting and in consultation with the FAA.
      (3)   Objectionable - The proposed construction/alteration is determined
to be a hazard and is thus objectionable.  A variance, as it relates to relief
from the height restrictions of this Airport Overlay District, shall be denied
and the reasons for this determination shall be outlined to the applicant.
   (d)   Such requests for variances from height restrictions of this Airport
Overlay District shall be granted where it is duly found that a literal
application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary
hardship and that relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest,
will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and
will be in accordance with the intent of this Airport Overlay District.
(Ord. 14-49.  Passed 11-5-14.)
1360.08  USE RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Airport Overlay District,
no use shall be made of land or water within this Airport Overlay District in
such a manner as to:
      (1)   Create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft:
      (2)   Make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and others;
      (3)   Impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport;
      (4)   Create wildlife hazards; or,
      (5)   Otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the Morgantown Municipal Airport (MGW).
   (b)   Runway Protection Zone (RPZ).
      (1)   The following uses are permitted to enter the limits of the RPZ:

         E.   Unstaffed NAVAIDs and associated facilities.
      (2)   Prior to the granting of any approval or permit for new or modified
development not included in Section
1360.08(B)(1), the City shall consult with the FAA Airports District Office to
determine whether or not the land use and/or development proposed to enter the
limits of the RPZ is acceptable based on a Land Use Compatibility and
Alternatives Analysis.  Table
1360.08.01 generally identifies development that typically requires analysis.
Table 1360.08.01:  Development Typically Requiring Analysis
 
•   Buildings and structures including, but not limited to:  residences, schools,
churches, hospitals or other medical care facilities, commercial/industrial
buildings, etc.
•   Recreational land uses including, but not limited to:  golf courses, sports
fields,  amusement parks, other places of public assembly, etc.

type of solar panel installation.
 
      (3)   The land use compatibility and alternatives analysis shall identify
and document the full range of alternatives that include:
         A.   Avoidance of introducing the land use issue within the RPZ.
         B.   Minimizing the impact of the land use in the RPZ (i.e., routing a
new roadway through the controlled activity area, move farther away from the
runway end, etc.).
         C.   Mitigating risk to people and property on the ground (i.e.,
tunneling, depressing and/or protecting a roadway through the RPZ, implement
operational measures to mitigate any risks, etc.).
      (4)   Documentation of the alternatives should include:
         A.   A description of each alternative including a narrative
discussion and exhibits or figures depicting the alternative.
         B.   Full cost estimates associated with each alternative regardless
of potential funding sources.
         C.   A practicability assessment based on the feasibility of the
alternative in terms of cost, constructability and other factors.
         D.   Identification of the preferred alternative that would meet the
project purpose and need while minimizing risk associated with the location
within the RPZ.
         E.   Identification of all Federal, State and local transportation
agencies involved or interested in the issue.
         F.   Analysis of the specific portion(s) and percentages of the RPZ
affected, drawing a clear distinction between the Central Portion of the RPZ
versus the Controlled Activity Area, and clearly delineating the distance from
the runway end and runway landing threshold.
         G.   Analysis of (and issues affecting) the City's control of the land
within the RPZ.
         H.   Any other relevant factors for FAA consideration.
      (5)   Any new or modified development described in Table
1360.09.01 that would enter the limits of the Runway Protection Zone shall be
categorized a Type III Site Plan - Major Development of Significant Impact. 
The land use compatibility and alternatives analysis and FAA's related response
must be included with the Type III Site Plan application for it to be
considered complete.
   (c)   Educational Facilities.  No educational facility of a public or
private K-12 school shall be permitted within the Educational Facility
Restriction Zone.  Exceptions approving construction of an educational facility
of a public or private K-12 school within the Educational Facility Restriction
Zone shall only be granted when the Planning Commission makes specific
findings, as a part of a Type III Site Plan for a Development of Significant
Impact, detailing how the public policy reasons for allowing the construction
outweigh public health and safety concerns prohibiting such a facility.
   (d)   Landfills.  In accordance with the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment
and Reform Act for the 21st Center (Ford Act) (Pub. L. No. 106-181, April 5,
2000), codified at 49 U.S.C. §40101 et seq., the construction of a new

1361.02   Definitions.
1361.03   Design and performance standards common to all Sunnyside Overlay
Districts.
1361.04   Design and performance standards specific to each Overlay District.
 
1361.01  PURPOSE.
   The Sunnyside neighborhood, pursuant to recommendations contained within the
Sunnyside Up Comprehensive Revitalization Plan (Fall 2004), will be divided
into three (3) overlay districts: the Sunnyside Central (SCOD), Sunnyside South
(SSOD), and Beechurst Corridor (BCOD) overlay districts. The design and
performance standards herein shall supersede or supplement those provided in
other parts of this Ordinance where conflicts exist.
1361.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this Article, the following definitions apply:
   (A)   Primary Street – Include Beechurst Avenue, University Avenue, First /
Stewart Street and Third Street.
   (B)   Secondary Street – Any paved, two-lane street in the Sunnyside
planning area not listed as a primary street.
   (C)   Transparency – A term describing the relative ability of an average
person to see inside a building. Those facades with significant window openings
are more transparent than those with fewer window openings. The term also takes
into account issues such as tinting of window glass. A related concept is
fenestration ratio, which is an exact measurement of the percentage of window
opening to solid wall in any given facade.
   (D)   Build-to line – The distance that a building must be set back from a
right-of-way line or property line.
   (E)   Articulation – The extent to which a building appears to be oriented
vertically (taller than it is wide), or horizontally (wider than it is tall).
   (F)   Proportion – The extent to which windows appear to be oriented
vertically (taller than they are wide), or horizontally (wider than they are
tall).
   (G)   Drivit – An exterior insulation and finishing system commonly known as
synthetic stucco. 
(Ord. 07-03.  Passed 3-6-07.)
1361.03  DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS COMMON TO ALL SUNNYSIDE OVERLAY
DISTRICTS.
   The following design and performance standards are held in common and shall
apply to the SCOD, SSOD, and BCOD overlay districts.
   (A)   Buildings shall be oriented with the front facing the lot’s primary
street, or the Monongahela River if the parcel has frontage on the river.
   (B)   Buildings should be designed to overlook streets and public open
spaces so as to create a “self-policing” environment.
   (C)   Buildings shall not be oriented with the front facing parking or
service areas.
   (D)   On primary streets, street trees shall be provided at a minimum of
thirty-five (35) feet on center.
   (E)   Building facades that are adjacent to public streets and/or open
spaces shall have a high degree of ground floor transparency (at least sixty
(60) percent).
   (F)   The siting of buildings should avoid the creation of unusable open
spaces and should respect and complement view corridors to and from the
hillside and the riverfront.
   (G)   Building massing should be the tallest at street corners.  In order to
achieve this, buildings constructed on a corner of two primary streets should
be at least five (5) stories in height, provided that all other requirements of
the zoning ordinance are adhered to.
   (H)   Ground floor retail and service-type uses located within mixed-use
buildings along primary streets shall not be included in height calculations.
   (I)   For buildings taller than four (4) stories or seventy-five (75) feet
in height, any additional floors in excess of four (4) stories shall be
recessed or set back at least twelve (12) feet from the build-to line.
   (J)   A minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the length of a building
face shall be constructed at the build-to line, if established herein, along a
primary street. The remaining twenty-five (25) percent may be set back a
maximum of ten (10) feet from the build-to line.
   (K)   Land between the front facade of a building and a public street shall
be landscaped to integrate with the neighborhood’s sidewalk system.  In any
area or setback between a building and sidewalk, one or a combination of the
following shall be provided:
      (1)   Landscaping/planting beds consisting of shrubbery and /or trees, or
      (2)   Special paving areas designed as plaza space. No grass or sod areas
shall be allowed in this space.
   (L)   On primary streets, sidewalks shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in
width.
   (M)   Front yard setbacks along secondary streets shall be a minimum of five
(5) feet, and a maximum of fifteen (15) feet.
   (N)   Within areas of single family and two family dwellings, front yard
setbacks of in- fill development shall not deviate by more than five (5) feet
from the average front yard setbacks of the neighboring residences.
   (O)   Building Form and Scale:
      (1)   Total fenestration shall be at least fifty (50) percent for
building facades facing primary streets and/or public open spaces.  For the
ground floor, the ratio shall be at least sixty (60) percent.
      (2)   All ground floor retail areas along primary streets and/or public
open spaces shall have awnings over entrances and ground floor windows,
extending out at least four (4) feet from the facade. Such awnings may be
extended to cover public sidewalks, provided they are set back at least
eighteen (18) inches from the curb line of the street.
      (3)   Overall building widths along primary streets may vary, but
building facades shall be designed in ten (10) to twenty (20) foot increments,
so as to achieve the appearance of a series of distinct, adjoining buildings.
      (4)   The articulation of buildings, and window proportions, shall be
vertical for buildings constructed along primary streets.
      (5)   The minimum building height for a parcel on a primary street, shall
be three (3) stories.  On secondary streets, the minimum building height shall
be two (2) stories.
      (6)   The majority of window openings shall be slightly recessed (4-
8 inches) from the exterior building wall to create a distinct and uniform
shadow line for the building’s primary facade.
      (7)   Unless no feasible alternative exists, fire escapes shall not be
constructed on or attached to the front facade of any building or structure.
The City of Morgantown Fire Department shall be the determining authority as to
whether a feasible alternative exists.
   (P)   Building Materials:
      (1)   Except for single and two family dwellings, the first two (2)
floors of a building shall be constructed of natural materials.  Natural
materials include stone, brick, and wood siding, but do not include materials
such as, or similar to, wood roof shingles, reflective glass, split faced
concrete block, imitation stone, and imitation stucco or Drivit.  Thirty-five
(35) percent of the remaining building facade(s) on the public right-of-way or
any facade(s) facing a single-family residence shall also be constructed of
natural materials.
      (2)   Vinyl siding or other composite materials shall not exceed thirty-
five (35) percent of a building face that abuts a right-of-way.
      (3)   In general, brick and a recessed window vocabulary should
predominate along the northern end of Beechurst and along University Avenue. 
Materials should transition into a mixed palette of brick, metal and glass
toward the southern end of Beechurst. The Riverfront should utilize more
contemporary materials such as metal and glass.
      (4)   Building materials which promote energy efficiency and
sustainability should constitute a minimum of thirty-five (35) percent of the
total materials used to construct a building.
   (Q)   Street Hierarchies and Land Use:
      (1)   Except for single and two family dwellings, buildings constructed
along primary streets shall have sixty (60) percent or more of their ground
floor space dedicated to retail, restaurant, office or personal service uses. 
Residential uses shall be permitted on the ground floor in the remaining space,
but shall not enfront the primary street.
          (Ord.  06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
      (2)   The minimum number of off-street parking spaces for multi-family
dwellings shall be one-half a space (0.5) per occupant as determined by the
West Virginia State Building Code and adopted and implemented by the City.  The
minimum number of off-street parking spaces for mixed- use dwellings shall be
one-half a space (0.5) per occupant as determined by the West Virginia State
Building Code and adopted and implemented by the City plus required spaces for
nonresidential use(s).
         (Ord.  18-24.  Passed 7-10-18.)
      (3)   Surface parking lots between buildings shall be designed as
interior landscaped courtyards where cars are screened from the right-of-way;
surface lots shall not be constructed where two (2) public rights-of-way
intersect.
      (4)   Parking structures abutting open spaces or fronting on primary
streets shall be designed with building-like facades.
      (5)   Parking garages three (3) stories or higher shall provide ground
floor retail or service uses in an amount not less than thirty-five (35)
percent of the ground floor area, located along the frontage of the garage.
      (6)   Private parking areas shall be accessed from secondary streets and/
or alleys. Access from primary streets shall only be utilized when other
options are not available.
      (7)   To minimize curb cuts along primary and secondary streets,
residential garages or car ports or driveways shall be located at the rear of
the property and accessed from an alley, when available.
      (8)   Parking areas and properties containing multifamily or commercial
buildings shall provide linkages of similar design and quality to adjacent off-
site pedestrian amenities such as sidewalks, bike paths, etc.
      (9)   Parking areas containing ten (10) or more stalls shall be lighted
to create safe, attractive nighttime environments.  Such lighting shall not be
designed or situated in such a manner as to cause spillover glare onto
adjoining properties. Building entrances and significant architectural or
landscape features should be illuminated with low-intensity, indirect lighting
sources directed toward the feature.
         (Ord. 07-03.  Passed 3-6-07; Ord. 15-29.  Passed 6-2-15.)
1361.04  DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS SPECIFIC TO EACH OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Sunnyside South Overlay District:
      (1)   Buildings that contain non-residential uses on the ground floor may
have a maximum height of eighty-eight (88) feet, provided all other
requirements of the zoning ordinance are met.

equipment, parking spaces, uncovered decks, patios and, only if adequately
screened, composting or garbage disposal equipment.
      (3)    For adjoining lots under single ownership, setback requirements
may be determined from the perimeter of the adjoining lots, ignoring interior
lot  lines, as shown in Graphic 1363.02.01, provided that only one main
structure  and its accessory structures shall be allowed within the perimeter
of such adjoining lots and, the following notation is first placed on the
recorded deed to each such adjoining lot: "For planning and zoning purposes,
the lot described herein shall be considered as part and parcel of the adjacent
lot(s) owned by [insert owner's name] pursuant to a deed (or deeds) recorded at
Deed Record [#s] page [#s], in the Office of the Clerk of the County Commission
of Monongalia County. The real estate described herein shall not be considered
to be a separate parcel of real estate for land use, development, conveyance or
transfer of ownership, without having first obtained the expressed approval of
the Morgantown City Planning Commission. This restriction shall be a covenant
running with the land.”

         (Ord.  06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
   (C)   Developed Blocks. If seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the lots in
a block, on the same side of the street, are occupied by principal buildings,
the following regulations shall apply:
      (1)   Principal Buildings in Residential Zoning Districts. To preserve
the rhythm of the predominant building line along developed blocks in
residential zoning districts, the following shall supersede the normal minimum
and maximum front setback standards or prevailing overlay district, if
applicable.
         (a)   The front setback of the principal building to be constructed
shall vary by not more than six (6) feet from the average front building line
of the nearest two (2) principal buildings on either side; provided, the
principal building to be constructed shall not have a front setback less than
the principal building included in the averaging calculation having the least
front yard depth.  This superseding requirement shall also be applicable to
additions onto existing principal buildings that extend into the front yard.
            i.   When subject lot is a corner lot, the average front building
line will be computed on the basis of the two (2) adjacent principal buildings
that front the same street as the subject lot.
            ii.   When the subject lot abuts a corner lot fronting the same
street, the average front building line will be computed on the basis of the
principal building on the abutting corner lot and the nearest two (2) principal
buildings that front the same street as the subject lot.
            iii.   Principal buildings fronting a different street than the
subject lot or separated from the subject lot by a street or alley may not be
used in computing the average front building line.
            iv.   The Planning Director may choose to disregard principal
buildings from the front building line averaging calculation that have
extraordinarily unusual front setbacks relative to the others included in the
calculation.
      (2)   Principal Buildings in Nonresidential Zoning Districts.  Principal
buildings in nonresidential zoning districts shall adhere to the normal minimum
and maximum front setback standards of the respective zoning district or the
prevailing overlay district, if applicable.
         (Ord.  18-25.  Passed 8-7-18.)
1363.03  SAFETY AND VISION.
   The following regulations provide for the maximum safety of persons using
sidewalks and streets as determined by the City Engineer:
   (A)   On any corner lot at street intersections or where driveways enter a
street or alley, a wall, fence, sign, structure, display of merchandise or any
plant growth, which obstructs measured sight distance, shall not be placed or
maintained within a clear vision triangle.
   (B)   Sight distance for vehicles entering the street from another street or
from a driveway shall meet the minimum stopping sight distance for the
operating speed on the adjacent roadway as shown in Table 1363.03.01 “Safe
Stopping Sight Distances Required at Different Operating Speeds” and should be
as long as can be justified economically.  The operating speed is normally
assumed to be the posted speed limit.  If a traffic study establishes that the
operating speed is lower than the posted speed limit, then the lower speed may
be used to determine the safe stopping distance.

   The sight distance values in Table 1363.03.01 are for passenger vehicle and
single-unit trucks only.  If the driveway entrance is classified as an
industrial driveway, then additional sight distance shall be provided as
recommended in the current edition of American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and
Streets”.
   (C)   The applicant is expected to perform whatever work is necessary within
the property and frontage boundary lines to meet the minimum requirements
specified in Table 1363.03.01.  If the minimum distance cannot be met by such
work, the City Engineer may, but is not required to, determine a lesser
distance as acceptable. 
(Ord. 16-17.  Passed 4-5-16.)
1363.04  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The following special requirements are established to clarify certain
conditions pertaining to the use of lots and access points:

1365.01  PURPOSE.
   The regulations of this section are designed to alleviate or prevent
congestion of the public streets by establishing minimum requirements for on-
site storage of motor vehicles, in accordance with the use for which the
property is occupied.
1365.02  SCOPE.
   (A)    Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided and
maintained in accordance with the provisions of this section for all buildings,
structures or premises used in whole or in part for purposes permitted by this
Code.
   (B)    When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, beds,
seating capacity, or other unit of measurement, parking and loading facilities
as required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
   (C)    For any non-conforming use which is hereafter damaged or partially
destroyed, and which is lawfully reconstructed, re-established, or repaired,
off-street parking and loading facilities equivalent to those maintained at the
time of such damage or partial destruction shall be restored and continued in
operation; provided, however, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or
maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this Code
for equivalent new uses.
   (D)    No building permit shall be issued, no use shall be established or
changed, and no structure shall be erected, enlarged or reconstructed unless
the applicant has presented satisfactory evidence via parking lot design, that
the off-street parking and loading spaces herein are provided in the minimum
amounts and maintained in the manner specified; provided, however:
      (1)    For the enlargement of a structure or for the expansion of a use
of structure or land there shall be required only the number of additional off-
street parking and loading spaces as would be required if such enlargement or
expansion were a separate new structure or use; and
      (2)    For a change in the class or use of a structure or land, the
number of additional off-street parking and loading spaces required shall be
equal to the number required for the new use, less the number of spaces which
would have been required for the previous use if it had been established in
conformance with this section; but in no case shall the total number of spaces
furnished be required to exceed the minimum required for the new use.
   (E)    Off-street parking or loading facilities in existence at the time of
the effective date of this article shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if
already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a
similar new use under the provisions of this Code.
   (F)    Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary
establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing
use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations herein governing the
location, design, and operation of such facilities are
adhered to.
   (G)    Off-street parking and loading facilities provided to comply with the
provisions of this Code shall not subsequently be reduced below the
requirements of this Code.
1365.03  GENERAL PARKING REGULATIONS.
   (A)    Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided on the same
lot as the use served, except as otherwise provided in this Code, and may be
situated as one or more individual areas.
   (B)    Off-street parking facilities required herein shall be utilized
solely for the parking of passenger automobiles or light trucks with not more
than two axles, belonging to patrons, occupants or employees of specified uses.
Said parking facilities shall not be used for the storage, display, sale,
repair, dismantling or wrecking of any vehicle, equipment or material, unless
such facilities are enclosed in a building and otherwise permitted in the
district, and unless such display is conducted upon stalls that are otherwise
considered surplus to the requirements herein.
1365.04  DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SPACES REQUIRED.
   (A)   In determining the minimum required number of off-street parking or
loading spaces, the following instructions shall be applicable in such
computations:
      (1)   If the unit of measurement is any fraction of the unit specified in
relation to the number of spaces to be provided, said fraction, if less than
one half or less than 0.5, the fraction shall be disregarded, however if the
fraction is more than one-half or more than 0.5, then the fraction shall be
considered as being the next unit and shall be counted as requiring one space.
      (2)   In sports arenas, churches and other places of assembly in which
patrons occupy benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, each twenty-
two (22) inches of such seating shall be counted as one (1) seat for the
purpose of determining requirements hereunder. In the special case of mosques
or other facilities where religious services are offered without seating, the
parking requirement shall be one (1) stall for each sixty (60) square feet of
the main prayer hall or room, exclusive of stages or raised daises.
         (Ord. 06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
   
   (B)   Shared Parking Facilities.
      (1)   Shared parking facilities for two or more separate but adjacent
buildings or mixed uses may be permitted as a conditional use provided that:
         (a)   The total number of spaces used is not less than the sum
required for various buildings or uses if computed separately.
         (b)   That the lot is in the same zoning district as the principal
use, or in a district that permits principal use parking lots or principal use
parking structures as a principal or conditional use.
         (c)   Each use of the shared spaces shall function as if having been
provided separately. 
(Ord. 16-44.  Passed 9-6-16.)
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, upon recommendation from the Planning
Commission may allow a reduction of total parking requirement up to 25 percent
if the applicant can satisfactorily demonstrate the parking spaces will be
shared with another adjacent land use and the lack of overlap between the peak
parking needs of the land uses justifies such a reduction.
   (C)   Shared Parking Facilities in the B-4 District.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall
apply:
         (a)   Daytime Use – A land use whose primary customer and employee
traffic occurs during the morning and afternoon hours (before 6:00 p.m.),
Monday through Friday.  Such uses include, but are not limited to: conference
facilities, professional offices, restaurants serving primarily lunch, retail
uses that customarily close at or before 6:00 p.m., manufacturing uses,
schools, and the like.
         (b)   Nighttime Use – A land use whose primary customer and employee
traffic occurs during the evening (after 5:00 p.m.) and weekend hours.  Such
uses include, but are not limited to: hotels, restaurants whose majority of
customers are served during dinner hours and on weekends, retail uses that are
consistently open past 6:00 p.m., residential uses, entertainment uses
(theaters, bowling alleys, private clubs and the like), dance schools, martial
arts studios, arts and crafts instruction, auditoriums that are accessory to a
school, and churches.
         (c)   Substantial Overlap – Where the hours of operation and/or peak
traffic generation times of two different land uses overlap by six (6) or more
hours in a given 24 hour period.
      (2)   Shared parking facilities for two or more uses, whose main traffic
generation peak times do not substantially overlap, may be approved as a
conditional use provided that:
         (a)   Shared parking may be off-site or on-site.
         (b)   Uses may share parking without providing the minimum number of
required spaces for each use based on the following calculation:
            (i)   Compute the total number of stalls that would normally be
required for all daytime uses, as defined herein.
            (ii)   Compute the total number of stalls that would normally be
required for all nighttime uses, as defined herein.
            (ii)   The larger of the two numbers shall be considered to be the
baseline parking requirement.
            (iv)   Add 25 percent of the required parking of the lesser number
to the baseline number to achieve the total parking requirement for the shared
uses.
(Ord. 06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
         (c)   This reduction may, with the approval of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, be in addition to the reductions allowed for proximity to public
transit and/or motorcycle parking.
            (Ord. 16-42.  Passed 9-6-16.)
         (d)   No other reductions shall be permitted.
      (3)   Shared parking facilities for two or more uses, whose main traffic
generation peak times substantially overlap, may be approved as a conditional
use provided that:
         (a)   Shared parking may be off-site or on-site.
         (b)   A reduction not to exceed 15 percent of the combined minimum
parking requirement for all uses.  (Ord. 06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
         (c)   This reduction may, with the approval of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, be in addition to the reductions allowed for proximity to public
transit and/or motorcycle parking.
            (Ord. 16-42.  Passed 9-6-16.)
         (d)   No other reductions shall be permitted.
   
   (D)   Shared Parking Facilities – Performance.
      (1)   An approved shared parking facility must be owned by the owner of
one or more of the uses.  A legal agreement detailing the shared parking
arrangement (if approved) shall be executed and filed with the City Planning
Department and recorded in the County Clerk’s office.  In lieu of ownership,
the parking lot may be leased by the owner of one of the uses, provided that
the duration of any such lease and sublease subsequent be not less than 20
years.
      (2)   No changes shall be made to the approved shared parking facility
which would reduce the parking provided for the uses, unless the owner of one
or more of the uses makes other arrangements to provide parking in conformance
with minimum parking requirements.  No such changes shall be made without prior
approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (3)   Any proposed change in the use of a structure or land utilizing an
approved shared parking facility shall provide evidence satisfactory to the
Board of Zoning Appeals that adequate parking is available to accommodate any
such use change.
      (4)   The City of Morgantown reserves the right to deny or revoke a
certificate of occupancy to any land use, in the following situations:
         (a)   If a land use utilizing a shared parking facility changes from a
daytime use to a nighttime use (or vice-versa); or changes to a use that
requires more parking than the previous use, and the resulting change in
parking requirements cannot be satisfied in the shared parking facility.
         (b)   If a land use utilizing a shared parking facility loses the
legal right, whether through voluntary or involuntary actions and
circumstances, to continue using the shared parking facility; and such use
cannot make arrangements to provide required parking elsewhere in conformance
with minimum parking requirements.  The exception to this shall be in the event
of a public construction project that temporarily (one year or less) makes use
of the shared facility impossible, or reduces effective use of the facility.
      (5)   Shared parking facilities shall provide signs on the premises
indicating the availability of the facility for the patrons of the
participating uses.
      (6)   Parking spaces to be shared must not be reserved for a specific
person, or use, on a twenty-four hour basis.  This shall not be construed so as
to limit the development of parking for persons with disabilities.
   (E)    Required off-street loading and unloading spaces shall not be
construed as being part of the required off-street parking spaces.
   (F)    No part of any alley or street or other public right-of-way shall be
used to meet the minimum parking requirements of this code, unless otherwise
provided for herein.
   (G)    For purposes of determining off-street parking requirements under
this section, gross floor area shall mean the total horizontal areas of the one
or several floors of the building or portion thereof devoted to a particular
use, including accessory storage areas located within selling or working space
such as counters, racks, or closets and any basement floor area devoted to
retailing activities, to the production or processing of goods or to offices;
provided, however, gross floor area shall not include that area devoted
entirely and permanently to storage purposes, parking and loading facilities,
or space used for restrooms, utilities, stairwells or elevator shafts.
   (H)    Number of employees indicates the number of employees on the largest
shift, unless otherwise indicated. 
(Ord. 08-06.  Passed 3-4-08.)
   (I)    In all non-residential districts the maximum number of parking lot
spaces provided shall not exceed 115 percent of the minimum parking
requirement, except for research and development centers and parking
structures, where there shall be no maximum.
   (J)    Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with Table
1365.04.01, Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements.
   (K)    Every company car, truck, tractor or trailer normally stored at a
business site shall be provided with an off-street parking space. Such space
shall be in addition to the parking requirements listed in Table
1365.04.01.
   (L)    For uses not specified in this section, or in such instance when the
requirement for an adequate number of spaces is unclear or not specified in
another part of this section for Conditional Uses, Shopping Center Plan, etc.,
the number of parking spaces shall be determined by the Planning Director on
the basis of similar requirements, the number of persons served or employed,
and the capability of adequately serving the visiting public. Such
determination may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (M)    In case of conflict between the provisions of this section, the
higher requirement shall govern.
   (N)    Any land use which requires a minimum of 50 parking spaces shall be
required to provide a pedestrian circulation plan for the proposed site.
   (O)    In the B-1 districts, uses may provide less than the required number
of off-street parking spaces, but in no case shall a use provide less than 75
percent of the minimum number of off-street parking spaces in accordance with
Table
 1365.04.01.
   (P)   In the B-4 district, minimum parking requirements may be reduced as a
conditional use under one or more of the following provisions:
      (1)   By a factor of ten (10) percent if the land use is located within
500 feet, measured from the closest edge of the building, of a parcel
containing a fixed public transit stop, whether a bus, trolley, or Personal
Rapid Transit (PRT) station.
      (2)   By a factor of ten (10) percent if the land use is located within
500 feet, measured from the closest edge of the building, of a parcel
containing 25-50 publicly owned and controlled parking spaces.  If within 500
feet of a parcel containing more than 50 public parking stalls, the reduction
may be a factor of fifteen (15) percent.
      (3)   By a factor of one (1) automobile parking space for each dedicated
motorcycle parking space, up to a maximum reduction of three (3) automobile
parking spaces.  This reduction shall not be permitted for uses that are
required to provide six (6) or fewer parking stalls.  Nor shall this reduction
be permitted for uses that primarily sell large, bulky merchandise not
typically transported via motorcycle.

1365.07  OFF-SITE PARKING FACILITIES.
   (A)    In Business, Industrial and Multi-Family Districts, the Board of
Zoning Appeals may grant Conditional Use Approval to provide required spaces on
a site that is:
      (1)    Within 300 feet of the principal use, and
      (2)    Within a district that permits principal use parking lots or
principal use parking structures as a principal or conditional use.
      (3)   B-4 District - within 500 feet of the principal use, but not within
a residential district or within the B-4 Neighborhood Preservation Overlay
District (B-4NPOD). 
(Ord. 16-44.  Passed 9-6-16.)
   (B)    A site plan for such off-site parking facility shall be filed with
the Board of Zoning Appeals as a required exhibit accompanying the Conditional
Use application, and shall be made part of the conditions of any approval
therefor. Said site plan shall demonstrate compliance with Parking requirements
and Standards of this ordinance, shall be amended and re-approved to indicate
any change or other modification of uses served, or number of parking spaces
provided therefor, and shall indicate:
      (1)    Adjacent streets, alleys and lots.
      (2)    All individual primary uses to be served, including the location
of the  use and number of parking spaces for each such use.
      (3)    A layout drawn to scale of 1"=50' or larger of aisles and
driveways, entrances, exits and turn-off lanes, parking spaces, setbacks,
drainage facilities, and landscaping and buffer screening.
      (4)   Type of lighting and pavement proposed, and identification signs,
including location, size and design thereof.
   (C)    Offsite parking facilities shall be encumbered by an easement or
similar agreement duly executed and acknowledged, which specifies that the land
upon which the off- site parking facility is located is encumbered by the
parking use. Said instrument shall specify and bind the time period to the
anticipated life of the building or use to which the parking facilities are
accessory. Said instrument shall be filed in the applicable Building Permit
files of the Department of Planning, and placed on public record in the Office
of the Clerk of the County Commission of Monongalia County, WV.
(Ord. 06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
 
   (D)    It is the responsibility of the business owner to maintain current
and valid parking as required by this Ordinance. Evidence of such parking is
required prior to approval and proof of current leases shall be made available
at the request of the Planning Director. Each leased space shall have a sign
noting the business for which the space is reserved. Signs shall be 12 inches
wide by 18 inches tall and shall be mounted between three feet and five feet
above the finished surface of the parking stall. The text on the sign shall
state "This space is reserved for patrons of [name of the business] only, per
City Code
1365.07(D)." All leased stalls shall be improved, paved and striped.  Leasing
of stalls shall not reduce the available parking below the minimum requirement
for uses sharing the lot, except in conditions of shared parking as described
in Section
1365.04(B) of the City Code.
(Ord. 16-44.  Passed 9-6-16.)
   (E)    Offsite parking facilities shall be developed in accordance with the
provisions of the Parking Development Standards section. Further, said
facilities shall be developed under such conditions imposed by the Board of
Zoning Appeals as to protect residential districts and maintain at a minimum
the disturbance to nearby residential uses.
   (F)   If the pedestrian access between the off-site parking facility and the
use(s) is to cross an arterial street, appropriate safety measures, as
determined by the Planning Director and City Engineer, must be in place to
ensure pedestrian and vehicular safety.
(Ord. 08-06.  Passed 3-4-08.)
1365.08  PARKING AND STORAGE OF CERTAIN VEHICLES.
   (A)    Automotive Vehicles.  Automotive vehicles or trailers of any type
without current license plates and inspection sticker or in an inoperable
condition so as to be deemed dead storage shall be prohibited in residential
districts other than within completely enclosed buildings, and shall not be
parked or stored in any zone district unless specifically authorized under the
terms of this Ordinance.
   (B)    Commercial Vehicles on Private Property.  The parking of a commercial
vehicle in residential zone districts shall be prohibited, except that one
commercial vehicle of not more than three (3) tons capacity may be parked on
any lot on which there is located a principal building, provided, however, that
such vehicle is parked in an enclosed garage, accessory building or rear yard
and is used by an occupant of the premises. This requirement shall not be
interpreted to prohibit commercial vehicles from temporary loading and
unloading in any residential district.
1365.09  PARKING DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   All off-street parking areas for four or more automobiles shall be developed
in accordance with the standards of this section, except in the case of one and
two-family dwellings, agricultural and rural uses, and storage of vehicular
merchandise not counting toward the minimum requirements as set forth in this
Code.
   (A)    Dimensions.
      (1)    Each required off-street standard parking space shall be at least
eight and one half (8.5) feet in width and at least eighteen (18) feet in
depth, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns, or office or work
areas.  Such space shall have adequate vertical clearance.
      (2)   Up to ten (10) percent of the total number of required parking
spaces may be designed for compact cars; provided, compact spaces are limited
to employees or residents only and the property owner/manager assigns and
enforces such spaces accordingly.  Compact spaces shall be grouped together and
identified as “compact cars only” with pavement stenciling and/or signage. 
Compact spaces should be located furthest from building entrances to discourage
use by noncompact vehicles.  Each compact space shall be at least eight (8)
feet in width and at least fifteen (15) feet in depth, exclusive of access
drives or aisles, ramps, columns, or office or work areas.  Such space shall
have adequate vertical clearance.
      (3)    Except on lots occupied by one and two-family dwellings, each off-
street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway at least
twelve (12) feet wide or such additional width and design in accordance with
Table
1365.09.01, so as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to
such parking space. Such aisle or driveway shall be unobstructed and allow for
the passage of emergency vehicles at all times. This requirement may be waived
by the Planning Director where such waiver will not cause a hazard.
      (4)    All required parking spaces and aisles shall be provided wholly
within the property lines and shall not extend into any public right-of-way.

   (B)    Layout and Design.
      (1)    All off-street parking or loading facilities shall be designed
with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or an alley in a manner
which will least interfere with traffic movement.
      (2)    Driveway entrances or exits shall be no closer than 15 feet to an
adjoining residential property line or 5 feet to an adjoining non- residential
property line or designed in such a manner as to least interfere with traffic
movement. No driveway across public property at the right-of-way line of the
street shall exceed a width of 22 feet, unless a greater width is specifically
approved by the City Engineer. No driveway shall be located closer than 30 feet
of the nearest point of the intersection of two streets.
      (3)    Connections between parking lots or reservations of land for
future such connections may be required at the discretion of the Planning
Director.
      (4)    Required off-street parking spaces shall be so designed, arranged
and regulated so that:
         (a)    Such parking areas are lined or designated to insure the most
efficient use of the parking spaces.
         (b)    Individual spaces on lots with 5 percent average slope or
greater are provided with anchored bumper guards or wheel guards. Under no
circumstances shall parking spaces be provided on lots in excess of 10 percent
slope.
         (c)    Parking spaces are unobstructed and have access to an aisle or
driveway so that any automobile may be moved without moving another, and so
that no maneuvering directly incidental to entering or leaving a parking space
shall be on any public right- of-way or walkway, unless otherwise permitted at
the direction of the Planning Director.
         (d)    With the exception of drive-through windows and related
stacking lanes, all parking spaces and maneuvering aisles shall be physically
separated from any wall of a building by a vertical curb, maintained planting
strip, and/or other suitable barrier.
      (5)    Off-street parking spaces may be open to the sky or enclosed in a
building. In any instance when a building is constructed or used for parking
facilities on the lot, said building shall be treated as any major structure
and subject to all requirements thereof.
      (6)    All parking lots abutting residential uses or districts, and all
parking lots in any district containing more than four (4) spaces shall be
subject to the landscaping and screening requirements for such parking lots as
set forth in Article 1367, Landscaping and Screening.
      (7)    Any lighting facilities used to illuminate off-street parking
areas shall be so located, shielded and directed upon the parking area in such
a manner that they do not reflect or cause glare onto adjacent properties or
interfere with street traffic. In no instance shall bare, unshaded bulbs be
used for such illumination. 
(Ord. 06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
   (C)    Surfacing and Drainage.
      (1)    All open off-street parking areas shall be surfaced with an all-
weather, dust-free concrete or asphalt material, and shall be maintained in
good condition and free of weeds, dirt, trash and debris; except that, a gravel
surface may be used for a period not exceeding six months after the date of
granting the Certificate of Occupancy where ground conditions are not
immediately suitable for permanent surfacing as specified above.
      (2)    A gravel surface in the area of storage or handling may be used
permanently in association with industries that handle liquids or chemicals
which create a potential hazard if containment should be lost and where
absorption into  the ground through a loose surface material would eliminate or
alleviate such hazard.
      (3)    Such parking areas shall be graded and properly drained in such a
manner that there will be no free flow of water onto either adjacent property
or public sidewalks. Further, any run-off generated by such improved areas
shall be disposed of in accordance with the stormwater management ordinance and
other City regulations.
      (4)    Other surface materials and designs may be utilized when
specifically approved by the City Engineer, for purposes of reducing storm
water runoff or other environmental and aesthetic considerations.
         (Ord. 13-33.  Passed 7-2-13.)
1365.10  LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   Uses and buildings with a gross floor area of 5,000 square feet or more
shall provide off-street loading spaces in accordance with Table
1365.10.01 provided that loading spaces shall not be required for uses which do
not receive or transmit goods or wares by truck delivery.
   (A)    Location.  All required off-street loading berths shall be located on
the same lot as the use to be served, and no portion of the vehicle shall
project into a street or alley. No permitted or required loading berth shall be
located within thirty (30) feet of the nearest point of intersection of any two
streets, nor shall it be located in a required front yard or side yard
adjoining a residential use or district.
   (B)    Each required off-street loading space shall be of a size not less
than that required for an off-street parking space but scaled larger to
delivery vehicles expected to be used, logically and conveniently located for
bulk pickups and deliveries, and accessible to such vehicles when required off-
street parking spaces are filled, provided that the off-street area required
for the receipt or distribution by vehicles of materials or merchandise is held
to be as follows:
      (1)    For local pick-up and delivery trucks: twelve (12) feet in width
by thirty (30) feet in length with a forty-five (45) foot maneuvering apron,
and a twelve (12) foot height clearance.
      (2)    For over-the-road tractor-trailers: fourteen (14) feet in width by
sixty (60) feet in  length with a sixty (60) foot maneuvering apron, and a
fourteen (14) foot height clearance.
   (C)    Paving regulations for loading areas shall be in accordance with the
paving regulations for parking areas as set forth in the development standards
section. Drainage regulations shall be in accordance with the City’s stormwater
management ordinance and other City ordinances.
   (D)    Loading berths shall be screened by either building walls, a solid
fence, densely planted shrubbery, or any combination thereof, none of which may
be less than 6 feet in height at maturity, unless located at the rear of the
building.

1367.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Section is to establish minimum standards for the
provision, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings in order to
achieve a healthy, beautiful, and safe community.
1367.02  APPLICABILITY.
   A.    These landscape regulations shall apply to two-family, multi-family,
commercial, office, industrial, and institutional development. Previously
approved development need not comply unless new site development approval is
being sought.
   B.    If a proposed addition or renovation to an existing structure equals
or exceeds 50% of the assessed value of the structure, the site must be brought
into compliance with the landscaping requirements of this section; provided,
that where it is clearly demonstrated that compliance with this section will
reduce the minimum number of required parking spaces for the use, compliance
with this section shall be required only to the degree that the minimum parking
requirement can still be met.
1367.03  ENFORCEMENT.
   Wherever site plan review is required by this Zoning Ordinance, a landscape
plan shall be a required part of such site plan. No permanent certificate of
occupancy shall be issued without completion of all landscaping shown on the
landscape plan required herein. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be
issued for the building for a period of one year when weather conditions do not
permit landscape installation. Failure to implement the approved landscape
plan, including preservation of existing features, or to maintain the
landscaping as long as incompatibility of adjoining uses exists, shall be a
violation of this Zoning Ordinance subject to the penalties outlined in Article
1393.
1367.04  CONTENT OF LANDSCAPE PLAN.
   Where required, a landscape plan shall conform to the following
requirements:  All landscape plans submitted for approval as a component of a
required site plan shall show the entire zoning lot to scale and shall contain
the following information:
   (A)    The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures,
parking lots and drives, roadways and right-of-way, sidewalks, bicycle paths,
ground signs, refuse disposal areas, freestanding electrical equipment,
recreation facilities, utility lines and easements, freestanding structural
features, and other landscape improvements, such as earth berms, walls, fences,
screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights, and courts or paved
areas;
   (B)    The name, address and phone number of the owner, developer, and plan
preparer, the date the plan was prepared, scale, and north arrow;
   (C)    The location, quantity, size, and common name of all proposed
planting materials;
   (D)    The location, size, and common name of existing trees over 8"
diameter at breast height, areas of dense trees or shrubs, and other natural
features, indicating which are to be preserved and which are to be removed;
   (E)    Existing and proposed grading of the site, including proposed
berming;
   (F)    Specification of the type and boundaries of all proposed vegetative
ground cover;
   (G)    Design of fences and other significant accessory structures;
   (H)    Planting and installation details as necessary to ensure conformance
with all required standards; and;
   (I)    Details indicating specific grading measures or other protective
devices where trees are to be preserved in areas of cut and fill.
1367.05  PRESERVATION OF EXISTING FEATURES.
   (A)    Trees and shrubs already existing on land subject to the provisions
of this section should be preserved wherever feasible. Criteria for judging the
feasibility of retaining existing vegetation include:
      (1)    The practicability of arranging site plan components around
existing features. In general, plans for groups of structures should be
designed so as to preserve tree masses, individual tree specimens, and small
stands of trees or shrubs;
      (2)    The condition of the vegetation with respect to continued
vitality;
      (3)    The practical and economic possibility of designing the location
and grades of proposed structures and paving to preserve existing vegetation;
      (4)    The desirability or lack thereof of a particular tree or species
by reason of its appearance; historic or ecological significance; botanical
characteristics; and the function the vegetation would fulfill as a site plan
component;
      (5)    Interference with utility services or encroachment into the
traffic visibility triangle; and,
      (6)    The possibility of preserving the vegetation while meeting the
development needs through pruning rather than removal.
   (B)    Existing trees that are preserved will contribute to the required
landscaping. For each tree that is preserved, which is greater than 8-inch
caliper, and is found on the approved list, the amount of new trees to be
installed shall be reduced by two trees.
   (C)    Substantial barriers shall be specified on the Landscape Plan and
shall be placed at or beyond the drip line of trees to be protected. These
barriers shall remain in place during heavy construction on the site, and no
vehicle, machinery, tools, chemicals, construction materials, or temporary soil
deposits may be permitted within the barriers, nor may any notice or other
object be nailed or stapled to protected trees.
1367.06  GENERAL LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)    All land areas that are not covered with buildings and pavement or
used for agricultural purposes shall be appropriately landscaped in accordance
with the requirements of this section. Landscaping shall be provided in the
areas specified and of the minimum intensity, specified below.
   (B)    The scale and nature of landscape materials shall be appropriate to
the size of the structures and the available space. Materials shall be located
to avoid interference with overhead and underground utilities and utility
easements or vehicular or pedestrian movement and visibility. Growth
characteristics should be carefully considered.
   (C)    Trees shall be planted to maintain a minimum of ten (10) to fifteen
(15) feet clearance between the tree trunk and structures, building overhangs,
walls, fences, and other trees.
   (D)    Plantings should be arranged to promote energy conservation wherever
practicable; e.g. use of tall deciduous trees on the south and west sides of
buildings to provide shade from the summer sun and planting evergreens on the
north of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
   (E)    All trash dumpsters, trash pads, loading areas consisting of two or
more loading spaces, loading docks, building service and outside storage areas
shall be screened from land in a residential zone and must be screened if
visible from a public street. Such screening may be achieved by using a minimum
six feet high, completely opaque fence or wall, a six feet high berm, or a six
foot high evergreen screen. Height of screen shall be measured from the grade
of the nearest street.
   (F)    Grass and other vegetative ground cover shall be used for all open
space, including parking lot islands, except for:
      (1)    Decorative mulch planting beds containing trees and/or shrubs.
      (2)    Inert stabilization in areas subject to severe runoff, erosion, or
ponding.
   (G)    Where stone or other inert materials are to be used for ground cover,
they shall be specifically identified on the landscape plan. Any area not so
designated shall be required to have grass or vegetative ground cover.
   (H)    All landscaping shall conform to the regulations established for
visibility triangles to maintain safe sight distances and intersections and
points of access as designated in Section
1363.03, Safety and Vision.
   (I)    All landscaped areas at the front line of off-street parking spaces
shall be protected from encroachment or intrusion of vehicles.
   (J)    In no case may a tree or shrub be planted within a drainage, sewer or
utility easement.
1367.07  BUFFERYARD LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   New non-residential buildings that abut a residential property (zoned
or used) or new multi-family residential buildings that abut a single or two-
family residential property (zoned or used) shall provide a landscape buffer
ten (10) feet wide planted with five (5) medium to large trees and ten (10) to
fifteen (15) shrubs per 100 linear feet of transitional yard between the new
non-residential and residential uses or new multi-family and single or two-
family uses.  This requirement may supersede the minimum setback requirement
for the district.
 
   (B)   Developed lots or lots with unexpired building permits at the time of
adoption of this ordinance are exempt from this requirement.

   (C)    Undeveloped properties, expansions of more than 40 percent of
existing floor area, and rezoned property are subject to the provisions of this
section.
(Ord. 06-37.  Passed 11-8-06.)
1367.08  PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   The following landscape requirements applied to parking lots are intended to
screen parking areas from the street, prevent large expanses of unbroken
paving, and provide shade to cool paved areas during the hot summer months.
   (A)    General Provisions.
      (1)    Parking lots with (four) 4 stalls or less are exempt from the
requirements of this section. If only (four) 4 stalls are required per this
Ordinance and the applicant chooses to provide more parking, then the
requirements of this section shall apply.
      (2)    All remaining unpaved areas of the parking lot shall be grassed or
planted in ground cover, unless otherwise specified.
   (B)    Development with No Parking Between Building Line and Street.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4795.gif]
If there is no parking anywhere between the established building line,
projected from corner of building to property lines:
      (1)    A four (4) foot perimeter buffer shall be provided, along the
sides and rear yard of the property, that contains at least one two inch (2")
caliper tree every twenty (20) feet and at least three (3) shrubs of at least
three (3) gallons in size clustered between each two (2) trees.
      (2)    If the proposed parking lot contains twenty (20) stalls or more,
an additional five (5) percent of the parking lot area shall be reserved for
interior landscaping. Planting beds running adjacent to and parallel with the
building, perimeter landscaping and buffer requirements shall not count towards
this requirement.
   (C)    Development with Parking Located Between Building and Street.  If any
parking is located between the street and the building line, the following
shall apply:
      (1)    A ten-foot wide buffer shall be provided for the length of any
parking area abutting the street. The buffer area shall contain at least one
(1) two inch (2") caliper trees for every twenty (20) feet and at least three
(3) shrubs of at least three (3) gallons in size clustered between each two (2)
trees.
      (2)    A six (6) foot side and rear yard buffer shall be provided that
shall contain at least one two inch (2") caliper tree for every twenty (20)
feet and three (3) shrubs of at least three (3) gallons in size clustered
between each two (2) trees.
         (Ord. 06-01.  Passed 1-3-06.)
   (D)    Design Standards for Interior Landscaping.
      (1)    All interior landscaping required by this ordinance shall be in
addition to any perimeter buffers required in Sections
1367.07 and
1367.08.
      (2)    All rows of parking spaces, when a lot contains 20 or more parking
stalls, shall provide a terminal island with concrete curbs and at least 130
square feet of area to protect parked vehicles, provide visibility, confine
moving traffic to aisles and driveways, and provide space for landscaping.
These islands may count toward fulfilling the 5 percent internal landscaping
requirement.
      (3)    Landscaped islands with concrete curbs and at least 130 square
feet of area shall be provided every ten spaces or less within a row of spaces
for multi- family residential sites and every 15 spaces or less within a row of
spaces for commercial developments. Planting islands should be evenly spaced
throughout the parking lot to consistently shade paved areas. Islands shall be
utilized where needed to control vehicular circulation and define major drives.
These islands may count toward fulfilling the 5 percent internal landscaping
requirement. To prevent cars from parking too close to trees or damaging
shrubs, an extended curb or wheel stop must be provided. Planting islands
parallel to parking spaces must be a minimum of five feet wide to allow car
doors to swing open.
         (Ord. 09-28.  Passed 7-7-09.)
1367.09  MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)    Under conditions where a strict interpretation of requirements may be
either physically impossible or create practical difficulties, an alternative
compliance procedure may be used to maintain the spirit—rather than the
letter—of the law. The proposed solution must equal or exceed standard
landscaping requirements. Requests to the Planning Director for use of
alternative landscaping schemes may be justified only when one or more of the
following conditions apply:
      (1)    The sites involve space limitations or unusually shaped parcels;
      (2)    Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are such
that full compliance is impossible or impractical;
      (3)    Due to a change of use of an existing site, the required
bufferyard is larger than can be provided;
      (4)    Existing utility lines or easements complicate the placement of
required plant materials.
      (5)    The applicant must provide a justification statement that
describes which of the requirements established by the Landscaping Ordinance
will be met with modifications, which project conditions justify using
alternatives, and how the proposed measures equal or exceed normal compliance
   (B)    Where compliance is required as a result of change in use or
expansion of an existing building and compliance with this section will
necessitate removal of existing pavement, the Planning Director may approve a
reduction of minimum planting areas, provided that proposed plantings, screens,
and other landscape features are substantially equivalent to the minimum
requirements in terms of landscaping.
   (C)    After initial approval of the landscape plan the Planning Director
may approve any substitute landscape proposal that he/she deems to be
equivalent to the approved
landscape.
   (D)    Occasionally, plant substitutions for species specified on approved
landscape plans are required due to seasonal planting problems and a lack of
plant availability. Minor revisions to planting plans can be approved by the
Planning Director if there is no reduction in the quantity of plant material,
no significant change in size or location of plant materials, and if the
substitute plants are of the same general category and have the same general
design characteristics as the plants originally approved. Proposed materials
must also be compatible with the microclimate of the site to ensure healthy
plant growth.
1367.10  INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)    Plant materials shall conform to the requirements described in the
latest edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock, which is published
by the American Association of Nurserymen. Plants shall be nursery grown.
   (B)    Plants shall conform to the measurements specified below:
      (1)    Caliper measurements shall be taken six inches above grade for
trees under four inches in diameter and 12 inches above grade for trees four
inches or larger in diameter.
      (2)    Minimum size for shade trees shall be 2 inches in caliper.
      (3)    Minimum size for ornamental trees shall be 1.5 inches in caliper.
      (4)    Minimum size for evergreen trees shall be 4 feet above grade.
   (C)    After cultivation, all plant materials shall be mulched with a two to
three inch layer of shredded bark, peat moss, or another suitable material over
the entire area of the bed.
   (D)    The owner of the premises shall be responsible for the maintenance,
repair, and replacement of all landscaping materials on the premises at the
owner’s expense. All landscape areas shall be kept free of refuse and debris.
Fences, walls, and other barriers shall be maintained in good repair. It is the
responsibility of each private property owner to remove any dead, diseased, or
dangerous trees or shrubs, or parts thereof, which overhang or interfere with
line of sight, traffic control devices, public sidewalks, rights-ofway, or
property owned by the City. The City shall have the authority to order the
removal of any such trees or shrubs.
1367.11  APPROVED STREET TREE AND SHRUB LIST.
   (A)   Table 1367.11.01 “Approved Street Tree and Shrub List” identifies the

1369.01  PURPOSE.
   (A)    The purposes of these sign regulations are:
      (1)    To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of
communication in the City; to maintain and enhance the pleasing look of the
City, which attracts to the City continued economic investment; to preserve
Morgantown as a community that is attractive to business, to residents and to
visitors;
      (2)    To improve pedestrian and traffic safety;
      (3)    To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public
and private property;
      (4)    And to implement relevant provisions of the comprehensive plan, as
updated periodically.
   (B)    In that context, the City continuously invests in parks, trails,
landscaping, quality public facilities and other features and amenities that
enhance the attractiveness of the community; a major purpose of this ordinance
is to ensure that signs in the community are compatible with the high quality
image that the City seeks and in which the City continuously invests.
1369.02  APPLICABILITY.
   A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created or maintained
in the City only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions and
other requirements of this  ordinance and other applicable City codes. Signs
exempt from regulation under Section
1369.05, Signs Exempt from Regulations, shall not otherwise be subject to this
Ordinance.
1369.03  EFFECT.
   The effect of this Ordinance, as more specifically set forth herein, is:
   (1)    To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in
commercial and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones,
subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this Ordinance;
   (2)    To allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive and incidental to
the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to
the substantive requirements of this Ordinance, but without a requirement for
permits;
   (3)    To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
   (4)    To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Ordinance; and
   (5)    To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance.
1369.04  RULES OF INTERPRETATION.
   (A)    Area Computation of Individual Signs.  The area of a sign face (which
is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be
computed by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme
limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with
any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display
or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which
it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, base, bracing or
decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the
regulations of this Ordinance and is clearly incidental to  the display itself.
   (B)    Area Computation of Multi-faced Signs.  Where the sign faces of a
double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 60
degrees or less, only one display face shall be measured in computing sign
area. If the two faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the area of
the sign shall be the area of the larger face. In all other cases, the areas of
all faces of a multifaced sign shall be added together to compute the area of
the sign. Sign area of multifaced signs is calculated based on the principle
that all sign elements that can be seen at one time or from one vantage point
should be considered in measuring that side of the sign.
   (C)    Sign Height Computation.  The height of a sign shall be computed as
the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be
the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling,
berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In
cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level, sign height shall
be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the
base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of
a public or private street.
1369.05  SIGNS EXEMPT FROM REGULATIONS.
   The following signs shall be exempt from regulation under this Ordinance:
   (A)    Any official or public notice or warning required by a valid and
applicable federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance, by a public
utility company or by order of a  court of competent jurisdiction; or signs
erected by any public entity that is statutorily exempt from local zoning.
   (B)    Traffic signs on private property, such as Stop, Yield and similar
signs, which meet the standards contained within the federal Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices and contain no commercial message;
   (C)    Signs hanging or standing inside a building, not attached to a window
or door, visible from a public street.
   (D)    Any sign inside an athletic field or other enclosed outdoor space;
   (E)    Works of art with no commercial message;
   (F)    Holiday decorations with no commercial message displayed between
November 15 and January 15.
   (G)    On-premise real estate signs indicating for sale, for lease, etc.
   (H)    Lettering attached to the window or door of a business that only
describes hours of operation, street address, or other non-commercial copy/
logos.
   (I)    Yard sale signs.
   (J)    Signs attached to or painted onto service vehicles.
   (K)    Signs on fuel pumps that cannot generally be read from off the
premises.
   (L)    Political signs.
   (M)    Signs erected by any entity legally exempt from municipal zoning.
1369.06  PERMITTED SIGNS; LOCATION, SIZE, NUMBER.
   Signs shall be permitted in accordance with Table
1369.06.01 and the supplemental regulations following Table
1369.06.01 and subject to the height limits shown in Table
1369.09.01. The character "" in the row for a sign and in the column for a
particular group of zoning districts shall indicate that the sign type is
permitted in that district in accordance with the provisions of this section.
The symbol “--" in any cell indicates that the sign type listed is not allowed
in that district under any circumstances. The references in the “Supplemental
Regulations” column refer to permit requirements, which shall apply to that
sign in accordance with its terms.

1371.01  PURPOSE.
   It is the goal of this section to provide guidance to developers in
implementing minimum requirements for lighting for all non-residential projects
and multi-family developments. The City recognizes that inappropriate and
poorly designed or installed outdoor lighting causes unsafe and unpleasant
conditions, limits residents’ ability to enjoy the nighttime sky, and results
in unnecessary use of electric power. Conversely, the City also recognizes that
some outdoor lighting is appropriate and necessary in areas such as civic,
commercial and industrial centers. To ensure appropriate lighting while
minimizing its undesirable side effects, the following regulations are
established.
1371.02  APPLICABILITY.
   Lighting facilities shall be required for all off-street parking areas and
off-street loading areas and for all driveways providing ingress and egress
thereto for all non-residential and multi-family developments. In the approval
of any development plan, the Planning Director or Planning Commission shall
have the authority to require lighting to be incorporated for other uses or
locations where in their reasonable discretion such lighting is warranted.
1371.03  GENERAL PROVISIONS AND STANDARDS.
   (A)    All exterior lights and illuminated signs shall be designed, located,
installed and directed in such a manner as to prevent glare from encroaching
onto adjoining properties or public rights-of-way.
   (B)    Uplighting of any architectural feature of a building or of a sign is
permitted, but such lighting may consist only of low wattage fixtures (designed
for bulbs not exceeding 75 watts) trained directly onto the surface intended to
be illuminated. Internally lit signs are acceptable in certain zoning districts
provided that they meet the requirements of this ordinance.
   (C)    All non-essential lighting will be required to be turned off after
business hours, leaving only the necessary lighting for security. Non-essential
lighting applies to display, aesthetic, parking and sign lighting.
   (D)    When outdoor lighting installation or replacement is part of a
development proposal for which site plan approval is required under these
regulations, the Planning Commission  shall review and approve the lighting
installation as part of its site plan approval.
   (E)    The applicant shall submit sufficient information, in the form of an
overall exterior lighting plan, to enable the Planning Director or Planning
Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals, as the case may be, to determine that
the applicable provisions will be satisfied.
   (F)    When an outdoor lighting installation is being modified, extended,
expanded or added to, the entire outdoor lighting installation shall be subject
to the requirements of this section.
   (G)    Where practicable, electrical service to outdoor lighting fixtures
shall be underground.
   (H)    Temporary holiday lighting during the months of November, December
and January shall be exempt from the provisions of this section, provided that
such lighting does not create dangerous glare on adjacent streets or
properties.
   (I)    The Planning Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals may modify or
waive the requirements of this section if it determines that in so doing, it
will not jeopardize the intent of these regulations.
1371.04  INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)    Electrical feeds to lighting standards shall be run underground, not
overhead.
   (B)    Lighting fixtures shall be maintained by the property owner so as to
always meet the requirements of this ordinance.
1371.05  EXEMPTIONS.
   The following uses shall be exempt from the provisions of this ordinance:
   (A)    Roadway and airport lighting and lighting activated by motion sensor
devices.
   (B)    Temporary circus, fair, carnival, or civic uses.
   (C)    Construction or emergency lighting, provided such lighting is
temporary and is discontinued immediately upon completion of the construction
work or abatement of the emergency necessitating said lighting.
   (D)    Temporary lighting.

1373.01  INTENT.
   (A)   Within the zoning districts established by this article and amendments
thereto, there exists lots, features and/or uses of land and structures which
were lawful at the time of their establishment but are prohibited, regulated or
restricted under the existing district and/or zoning ordinance.  These
nonconformities are declared incompatible with the zoning district and/or
zoning ordinance because they do not conform to the requirements of the zoning
district in which they are located and/or the zoning ordinance.
   (B)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this article shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
or site legally established.  The intent of this article is to set forth the
conditions under which these nonconformities may continue to exist until such
time they are abandoned.
((Ord. 17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1373.02  ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEGAL NONCONFORMITY AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   A party asserting the existence of a lawfully established
nonconforming lot, use, feature or structure has the burden of proof that the
lot, use, feature or structure was not substandard in meeting the requirements
of the zoning district and/or the zoning ordinance or in compliance with
applicable laws which were in effect at its creation.
   (B)   The rules of this article are applied by first reviewing which
provisions are applicable to the nonconformity.  (Does the nonconformity
involve a lot, use, structure, feature or a combination?)  When a combination
of nonconforming lot, use, structure or feature exists, each segment of the
nonconformity is reviewed independent of the others.
(Ord. 17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1373.03  ANNEXATION.
   Lots, structures, uses of land and/or structures that were legally in
existence prior to annexation to the City, but that do not conform to the
requirements of the zoning district in which they are located and/or the zoning
ordinance following the date of annexation, shall become a legal nonconformity
subject to the requirements of this article.
(Ord. 17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1373.04  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   The following provisions shall apply to all lots meeting the definition of
NONCONFORMING LOT:
   (A)   Continuation and Development.  A nonconforming lot may be developed
for any use allowed by the zoning district, provided the development meets,
through design or by approved variance, the requirements of the zoning district
in which it is located.
   (B)   Nonconforming Lot Modifications or Split.  The following is applicable
to all lots:
      (1)   No lot may be modified, divided or adjusted in a manner that would
violate dimensional, area, or other requirements of the zoning district in
which it is located unless a departure is authorized by the Planning Commission
as provided in Section
1315.07.
      (2)   A government agency may lawfully modify a lot in a manner that
would result in nonconformity, if portions of a lot are acquired and used for a
permitted public use or purpose of the government agency.
         (Ord. 17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1373.05  NONCONFORMING USES.
   The following provisions shall apply to all uses meeting the definition of
NONCONFORMING USE:
   (A)   Continuation.  Any legally established nonconforming use may be
continued until abandoned as prescribed in subsection (D) or (E) of this
section.
   (B)   Change of Use.  A structure or property containing a nonconforming use
may be changed to a use that conforms to the requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located or related zoning regulations.  When the
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the nonconforming use may
not thereafter be resumed.
   (C)   Expansion.  A nonconforming use may not be expanded or enlarged,
except under one (1) of the following circumstances:
      (1)   Alterations are permitted only within the existing physical space
of the building occupied by the nonconforming use, or as permitted by Paragraph
(C)(2) of this section.
      (2)   Residential dwellings may have the building area expanded if the
number of dwelling units is not increased above or below the requirements of
the zoning district in which it is located, there is no decrease in the number
of off-street parking spaces below the minimum requirements, and the addition
complies with all zoning requirements other than permitted use classifications.
      (3)   The acquisition of additional accessory off-street parking is not
an expansion of a nonconforming use.
   (D)   Abandonment.  A nonconforming use that is abandoned shall have its
legal nonconforming status terminated and any subsequent use of the property or
building shall conform to the requirements of the zoning district in which it
is located or related zoning regulations.  In addition to any other
circumstances constituting abandonment, a nonconforming use shall be considered
abandoned if any of the following circumstances apply:
      (1)   The nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use;
      (2)   The nonconforming use has ceased for a period of one (1) year.
   (E)   Damage or Destruction.  If a structure containing a nonconforming use
experiences substantial destruction, it shall constitute a discontinuation of
the nonconforming use; except the nonconforming use may be allowed to continue
if the structure has suffered substantial destruction as a result of fire,
flood, explosion or similar unplanned event resulting in damage not
intentionally or negligently caused by the owner or tenant and a completed
building permit application for reconstruction of the structure is filed within
one (1) year of such event.
   (F)   Repair and Maintenance.  A building or structure containing a
nonconforming use may be repaired and maintained if the work does not restore
it from substantial destruction.  Normal repair and maintenance work to a
building or structure containing a nonconforming use may be performed that
maintains continued safe and sanitary conditions.  If repair, maintenance, or
alterations are performed to the structure containing a nonconforming use with
the specific purpose of bringing the structure into further compliance with the
West Virginia Building Code, and if such repair, maintenance or alterations are
ordered by the Code Enforcement Department, and if such alterations necessitate
the temporary abandonment of the nonconforming use, then the Board of Zoning
Appeals, upon prior written request, may extend the 12-month abandonment clause
for a reasonable period of time to effectuate said repairs, maintenance or
alterations.  Applicants seeking an extension of the 12-month abandonment
clause must submit a schedule for such repair, maintenance or alterations.
Normal repair and maintenance work that maintains continued safe and sanitary
conditions may be performed on a structure without constituting abandonment of
the nonconforming use therein.
      (Ord. 17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1373.06  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   The following provisions shall apply to all structures and buildings meeting
the definition of NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE:
   (A)   Continuation.  Any legally established nonconforming structure may be
continued until abandoned as prescribed in subsection (C) of this section.
   (B)   Expansion.  Structure may be expanded, provided:
      (1)   A nonconforming structure may be enlarged, extended or structurally
altered, provided the enlargement or alteration complies with the setback,
height, lot coverage, and other site development requirements of the zoning
district in which the structure is located.
      (2)   A nonconforming structure may not be enlarged, extended or
structurally altered in such a manner that increases the extent of its
nonconformity unless a variance from the terms of this article is obtained from
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (C)   Damage or Destruction.  A nonconforming structure experiencing
substantial destruction shall be considered abandoned and have its
nonconforming status terminated.  Any subsequent repair or reconstruction of
the structure shall comply with the requirements of the zoning district in
which it is located and related zoning regulations, with the following
exception:
      (1)   The nonconforming structure may be allowed to be rebuilt within the
same footprint and size if the structure has suffered substantial destruction
as a result of fire, flood, explosion or similar unplanned event resulting in
damage not intentionally or negligently caused by the owner or tenant, and a
complete building permit application for reconstruction is filed within one (1)
year of such event.
   (D)   Partial Damage or Destruction.  A nonconforming structure suffering
from less than substantial destruction may have its nonconforming status
suspended for a reasonable time period determined by the Planning Director and
be considered conforming for the purpose of improvements and repair, if:
      (1)   The structure is damaged by fire, flood, explosion or similar
unplanned event resulting in damage not intentionally or negligently caused by
the owner or tenant and a complete building permit application is filed within
one (1) year of such event; and
      (2)   The building permit must remain active and if it is allowed to
expire, then legal nonconforming status shall terminate and subsequent repairs
and improvements shall comply with the requirements of the zoning district in
which it is located and related zoning regulations.
   (E)   Repair and Maintenance.  Normal repair and maintenance work on a
nonconforming structure may be performed that maintains continued safe and
sanitary conditions.  If repair, maintenance or alterations are performed on
the nonconforming structure with the specific purpose of bringing the structure
into further compliance with the West Virginia Building Code, and if such
repair, maintenance or alterations are ordered by the Code Enforcement
Department, and if such alterations necessitate the temporary abandonment of
the nonconforming structure, then the Board of Zoning Appeals, upon prior
written request, may extend the 12-month abandonment clause for a reasonable
period of time to effectuate said repairs, maintenance or alterations. 
Applicants seeking an extension of the 12-month abandonment clause must submit
a schedule for such repair, maintenance or alterations.
      (Ord. 17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)

   (A)   Applicability.  This section applies to the maintenance, repair as
appropriate, and removal of nonconforming signs.
   (B)   Maintenance and Repair of Off-Premises Signs.  Any nonconforming off-

zoning ordinance, when one (1) or more of the following events occur:
      (1)   Alterations to Sign.
         (a)   Any structural alteration to an off-premises sign shall result
in the loss of its nonconforming status.  This does not include re-facing the
sign.  (Ord. 17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)

improvements, the sign shall lose its nonconforming status under any of the
following circumstances:
         (a)   The on-site renovation, construction or other site improvements
exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the assessed improvement value of the site;
or
         (b)   On-site construction/improvements costs exceed fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000); or
         (c)   Unless the structure was damaged by fire, flood, explosion or
similar unplanned event resulting in damage not intentionally or negligently
caused by the owner or tenant and a building permit is applied for within one
(1) year of such event.
   (C)   Maintenance and Repair of On-Premises Signs.  Any nonconforming on-
premises sign shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming designation and be
removed or brought into conformity with related sign regulations of this zoning

      (1)   Alterations to Sign.
         (a)   If alterations are made to the sign that exceed twenty-five (25)
percent of the replacement cost of the sign, it shall lose its nonconforming
status; or
         (b)   For freestanding signs, re-facing the sign with a new message is
permitted; however, if the cabinetry housing the sign is removed, or is
intended to be replaced, the sign shall lose its nonconforming status; or (Ord.
17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)
         (c)   In no case shall a nonconforming on-premises sign be permitted
to be expanded or enlarged unless a variance from the terms of this article is
obtained from the Board of Zoning Appeals.
            (Ord. 18-09.  Passed 3-6-18.)
      (2)   Alteration to Associated Business or Site.  Should a business with
a nonconforming sign undergo remodel or site improvements, the sign shall lose

(1) year of such event.
   (D)   Abandonment.  Any sign, including its frame and support structures,
related to a use or business that ceases to exist or operate for a continuous
period of 90 days shall be considered nonconforming and shall not be reused for
sign purposes unless and until it is in full conformity with the sign
regulations of this zoning ordinance, subject to the issuance of a new sign
permit.  This requirement shall apply whether the property owner has been
specifically informed of the 90-day lapse, or not.
(Ord. 17-29.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1373.08  UNLAWFUL USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS.
   (A)   Nothing in this article shall be interpreted to be authorization for,
or approval of the continuation of the use of a structure that is in violation
of any ordinance in effect at the time of the passage of the ordinance codified
in this article.  The intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or
structures shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a
nonconforming use, structure and/or lot.
   (B)   Any use, structure or lot which did not comply with the zoning
requirements at the time it was established or constructed and does not comply
with the current zoning regulations is illegal and shall be brought into

manufacturing use, shall not apply to property or land uses within the City of
Morgantown, in accordance with authority duly granted pursuant to the Municipal
Home Rule Pilot Program.
(Ord. 17-52.  Passed 12-19-17.)

1375.01  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   It shall be the duty of the Planning Director, or his or her designee, to:
   (A)    Perform zoning reviews of building permit applications as necessary
to determine compliance with the provisions of this ordinance.
   (B)    Maintain permanent and current records of all applications for all
reclassification, variances, special permits, amendments, and other zoning
related records required by this ordinance and of the hearings and actions
thereon.
   (C)    Conduct investigations as necessary to determine compliance with or
violation of this ordinance.
   (D)    Participate in the abatement of violations of this ordinance and aid
in the prosecution of such violations.
   (E)    Maintain in current status the official zoning maps.
   (F)    Provide information on zoning upon request by citizens and public
agencies.
1375.02  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)    No commission, board, agency, officer, or employee of the City shall
issue, grant, or approve any permit, license, certificate, or any other
authorization for any construction, reconstruction, alteration, enlargement, or
relocation of any building or structure, or for any use of land or building,
that would not be in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance.
   (B)    In administering the provisions of this ordinance, the standard rule
of rounding numbers to the nearest whole shall apply. When the unit of
measurement results in a fraction less than one-half (0.5), the fraction shall
be disregarded; fractions of one-half (0.5) or more shall be rounded up to the
next whole number.
1375.03  ZONING REVIEWS.
   (A)    No Building Permit pertaining to the construction, enlargement,
moving, remodeling, reconstruction of a structure or change of use shall be
issued unless approval of the site plan has been granted by the Planning
Director or the Planning Commission. The Planning Director shall permit
approvals only in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance except when
he receives a written order from the Planning Commission, Board  of Zoning
Appeals, or a court of law in the form of an administrative review, variance,
or judgment as provided in this ordinance.
   When required, a change of land use permit must be acquired prior to
issuance of a certificate of compliance with the zoning ordinance.
   (B)    For projects that are reviewed administratively, the Planning
Director shall make every reasonable effort to review the application and
report to the applicant by the end of 30 working days following the day on
which a completed application is received. See Site Plan Review Article
1385.
1375.04  FEES.
   (A)    Fee Requirement and Payment.  The Schedule of Fees for zoning
applications shall be maintained on file with the Planning Department. The
appropriate fee shall be paid by the applicant when the application is
submitted for review. An application shall not be considered complete until the
appropriate fee is paid in full to the Planning Department. The Planning
Department may waive fees in unusual or extreme circumstances, with permission
from the City Manager.
   Approvals shall not be granted nor zoning certificates of compliance issued
until the appropriate fee is paid to the Planning Department.
   (B)    Applications and petitions filed pursuant to the provisions of this
ordinance shall be accompanied by the filing fees in the amount provided on the
current “Plan Review and Permitting Fee Schedule” published by the City.
   (C)   No part of any filing fee paid pursuant to this section shall be
returnable to the applicant or petitioner.  (Ord. 18-10.  Passed 3-20-18.)
1375.05  ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS.
   (A)    Authority.  The Planning Director, subject to the procedures,
standards, and limitations of this article, may render written interpretations,
including use interpretations, of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and
of any rule or regulations issued pursuant to it. The Planning Director may
forward requests for interpretations to the Board of Zoning Appeals, where, in
the opinion of the Planning Director, the proposed use is not sufficiently
similar to a use expressly listed as a permitted or conditional use on the
Permitted Land Use Table
1331.05.01 to allow staff interpretation.
   (B)    Purpose.  The interpretation authority established by this section is
intended to recognize that the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, though
detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every specific
situation to which they may have to be applied. In particular, certain
categories of uses are listed as either Conditional or Permitted uses, but
certain specific proposed uses may not clearly fall within the common meaning
of any of the listed uses. Many such situations can be readily addressed by an
interpretation of the specific provisions of this Zoning Ordinance in light of
the general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted.
Because the interpretation authority established is an administrative rather
than a legislative authority, an interpretation shall not have the effect of
adding to or changing the essential content of this Zoning Ordinance, but is
intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific
cases.
   (C)    Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations.  Applications for
interpretations may be filed by any person having a legal or equitable interest
in property that gives rise to the need for an interpretation, provided that
interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical
circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an
advisory opinion.
   (D)   Procedure.
      (1)    Application.  Applications for interpretations of this Zoning
Ordinance shall be filed on a form provided by the Planning Department and
shall contain information describing the nature of the requested information.
      (2)    Action on Application.  The Planning Director shall inform the
applicant in writing of his or her interpretation, stating any specific
precedent, the reasons, and the analysis upon which the determination is based.
   (E)    Standards for Use Interpretations.  The following standards shall
govern the Planning Director and the Board of Zoning Appeals (on appeals from
the Planning Director) in issuing use interpretations:
      (1)    Any listed use defined in Article
1329, Definitions, shall be interpreted as therein defined;
      (2)    No use interpretation shall authorize any use in any district
unless evidence is presented demonstrating that it will comply with the general
district regulations established for that particular district.
      (3)    No use interpretation shall authorize any use in a particular
district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses specifically
listed as permitted or conditional in such district and is more similar to such
uses than to other uses listed as permitted or conditional in another zoning
district.
      (4)    If the proposed use is most similar to a use allowed only as a
conditional use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any
use interpretation authorizing such use shall be subject to the issuance of a
conditional use permit pursuant to Article
1379 of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (5)    No use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use
that would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in
question, unless such use meets the standards of Subsections (E)(3) and (4)
hereof.
   (F)    Effect of Favorable Use Interpretations.  Use interpretations shall
only authorize a use in a specific district and shall not allow the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure. Use interpretations shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and
approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City,
including, but not limited to, a Building Permit, a Certificate of Occupancy,
Subdivision Approval, and Site Plan Approval.
   (G)    Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations. 
      (1)    A use interpretation finding a particular use to be Permitted, or
allowed as a conditional use in a particular district, shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use for which it is issued, and such
interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for
which a separate use interpretation has not been issued.
      (2)    Once a use interpretation is made for a particular use in a
particular district, that use shall be permitted as a conditional use for the
entire district and shall be available for other property owners in that
district through the conditional use process.
   (H)    Appeals from Planning Director Decisions.  The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall, pursuant to Article
1383 of this Zoning Ordinance, hear and decide appeals from any administrative
interpretations by the Planning Director acting pursuant to the authority and
duties under this section.
1375.06  NOTICE OF ZONING AMENDMENTS ALTERING DWELLING UNIT DENSITY.
   (a)   Prior to adoption of any amendment to the zoning map or zoning text
that would    change the allowed dwelling unit density of any parcel of land,
the City will provide notice of the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance
in a local newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the zoning
ordinance, as a Class II-0 legal advertisement, in accordance with the
provisions of West Virginia Code Chapter 59, Article 3.
   (b)   The provisions of Paragraph (b)(1) of West Virginia Code section 8A-7-
8, and any related or successor provision or amendment, requiring delivery of
notice by certified mail to landowners whose property is directly involved in a
zoning amendment that would change the allowed dwelling unit density of any
parcel of land, shall not apply to zoning amendments within the City of
Morgantown, in accordance with authority duly granted pursuant to the Municipal
Home Rule Pilot Program.  (Ord. 17-53.  Passed 12-19-17.)

1377.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A) Proposed amendments to this ordinance may be presented by the Planning
Commission to Council requesting an amendment, supplement, repeal or change of
the regulations of the Zoning Ordinance. Prior to submission to Council of a
Planning Commission petition or a report on a proposed ordinance, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing. After the public hearing, the Planning
Commission shall make its report on the proposed ordinance to Council.
Thereafter, Council shall proceed to take such action on the proposed ordinance
as it deems proper.
   (B)    The City Council may, from time to time, amend, supplement, or change
the rules and regulations and districts fixed by the Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)    Before amending the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map, City Council with
the advice of the Planning Commission, must find that the amendment is
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. If the amendment is inconsistent, then
City Council with the advice of the Planning Commission, must find that there
have been major changes of an economic, physical or social nature within the
area involved which were not anticipated when the Comprehensive Plan was
adopted and those changes have substantially altered the basic characteristics
of the area.
   (D)    Zoning Map amendments (i.e., rezonings) often become issues of
significant contention between applicants and residents living adjacent to and
in the vicinity of the property to be rezoned. Too often this results in
difficult and argumentative public hearings before the Municipal Planning
Commission and City Council. In most cases, opposition to a rezoning request is
based on legitimate concerns over the well-being and preservation of a
neighborhood, but sometimes opposition results from a simple lack of
communication and understanding between the applicant and the neighborhood
residents. The City,  therefore, strongly advises any person that is
considering applying for a zoning map amendment (i.e., rezoning) to discuss the
proposal with residents living within 200 feet of the property to be rezoned
and with the leadership of any organized neighborhood organizations that
represent the area before making application to the Planning Department. The
Department can assist by providing contact information for individuals who
should be consulted.
1377.02  AUTHORITY AND PROCEDURES.
   Whenever public necessity or the public health, safety, and general welfare
require, City Council may, by Ordinance and after receipt of recommendation
thereon from the Planning Commission and subject to the procedures below,
amend, supplement, change, or repeal the regulations, restrictions, and
boundaries or classifications of property.
1377.03  APPLICATION PROCEDURES.

of the Monongalia County Assessor. The applicant must also submit the tax map
and parcel numbers for the list of properties along with a stamped and
addressed envelope for each of the names and addresses of property owners in
the affected area. If the list includes a lot within a subdivision, the

an affected subdivision and submitted by the applicant will be mailed no later
than 10 days prior to the meeting.
      (4)    The Planning Director shall cause official zoning notification
signs to be placed in a prominent location on the property not later than 10
days prior to the meeting.
      (5)    The Planning Commission will hold a duly scheduled public hearing
on the rezoning request, prepare a report, and make a recommendation to
Council.
      (6)    City Council will hear the case according to its rules and
procedures.
      (7)    If the request for rezoning is approved by Council, the applicant
shall receive approval and will be formally notified by mail by the Planning
Department. The Planning Department shall amend the zoning map to reflect the
approved rezoning.
      (8)    If the request for rezoning is denied by Council, the applicant is
formally notified in writing by the Planning Department of the denial and the
right to appeal the decision to Monongalia County Circuit Court.
      (9)    Any person who feels aggrieved by an approval or denial of a
rezoning may appeal the decision to the Circuit Court of Monongalia County.
   (B)    Amendment to the Zoning Ordinance Text.
      (1)    A request for an amendment, or change, to the text of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be filed on prescribed forms with the Planning Department. The
Planning Director shall furnish the applicant a copy of a sample or previously
approved text amendment, composed in the format required by the City Attorney
for text amendments, so that the applicant will have a model by which to
compose his or her proposed amendment.
      (2)    The Planning Department will conduct a formal review of the
completed application.
      (3)    The Planning Department will publish a legal advertisement
describing the request for a text amendment in a local newspaper of general
circulation at least 15 days prior to the scheduled public hearing before the
Planning Commission.

County
      (8)    If the request for the text amendment is denied by Council, the

unless the Planning Director determines that there have been significant
changes in conditions in the area proximate to the parcel in question.
1377.04  COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AMENDMENT.
   Amendments, supplements or changes of the rules and regulations of the

1379.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)    Purpose.  It is the purpose of this article to recognize that there
may be cases where community and Comprehensive Plan goals are met by a flexible
and individual regulation of land uses within a zoning district. The
establishment of a conditional use permit procedure provides Morgantown with
such flexibility to provide for certain uses which shall be permitted only if
adequate conditions exist or can be imposed that will make such uses compatible
with the purposes of this ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan. The conditional
use permit procedure shall provide for some measure of individualized judgment
and the imposing of conditions on certain uses, in order to make them
compatible with uses in the surrounding area. It is further intended that the
conditional use permit, through a site plan review process, shall provide a
method whereby it can be determined whether or not a use would cause any
damage, hazard, nuisance, or other detriment to persons or property in the
vicinity.
   (B)    Standards and Requirements.  All such uses are declared to possess
characteristics of such unique and special form that each specific use must be
considered as an individual case. Consideration by the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall be based on adopted standards and requirements. These considerations
shall be both general, applying to all conditional uses, and specific, applying
to individual types of conditional uses. The standards and requirements
stipulated in this article shall be made a condition of approval. In addition,
the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose additional, reasonable conditions to fit
the particular use and site under review.
   (C)    Limits of Authorization.  A conditional use permit shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use specified in the permit. (Ord. 06-01.  Passed
1-3-06.)
   (D)    Review.  Any person seeking to establish a use designated as a
conditional use for the zoning district in which it is located shall apply to
the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use permit.  If a conditional use
permit meets the thresholds for a Development of Significant Impact (DSI) as
set forth in Section
1385.05, the reviewing authority will then be the Planning Commission and Board
of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 17-28.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1379.02  APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE APPROVAL.
   (A)    The applicant shall file a formal and complete application for a
conditional use permit with the Planning Department. The application shall
include:

County Assessor. The subject property also shall be included in the affected
area. The applicant must also submit the tax map and parcel numbers for the
list of properties along with a stamped and addressed envelope for each of the
names and addresses of property owners in the affected area. If the list
includes a lot within a subdivision, the applicant must submit the name of the
president of the subdivision’s homeowners’ association along with a stamped and
addressed envelope for the individual.
      (4)    Any other information deemed helpful by the applicant or necessary
by the Planning Department or Board of Zoning Appeals to explain the nature of
the proposed use and its consistency with the standards established by the
article for conditional use permits.  When the Planning Director, or the
Director’s designee, determines it is necessary, he/she may require that in the
case of accessory structures or minor additions, all dimensions shown on plans
relating to the size of the lot and the location of the structure(s) thereon be
based on an actual survey by a registered land surveyor or registered design
professional licensed by the State of West Virginia and as authorized by West
Virginia State law, said survey to be provided by the applicant.

      (5)   Traffic Impact Study.  A traffic impact study shall be submitted,
if required by the City Engineer.  Approved WV Division of Highways Permit and/
or Agreement, if applicable, is not required for Board of Zoning Appeals
conditional use review, but shall be required prior to issuance of a building
permit.  In the event a traffic analysis or traffic impact study is required
and the review of same involves WV Division of Highways, written/electronic
correspondence from WV Division of Highways documenting its approval of the
traffic analysis or traffic impact study must be presented to the Board of
Zoning Appeals by the applicant prior to conditional use permit approval.
   (C)   The Planning Director, or his/her designee, will conduct a formal

shall be accepted unless it is complete and is verified as to the correctness
of information given by the signature of the applicant attesting thereto.
   (D)   The Planning Director, or his/her designee, shall publish a legal
advertisement describing the request for a conditional use permit in a local

right to seek review of the decision in the Circuit Court of Monongalia County
within thirty (30) days.
(Ord. 17-28.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1379.03  STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL.
   (A)    The Board of Zoning Appeals should consider the following objectives
when evaluating each conditional use application:
      (1)    The proposed conditional use is compatible with the goals of the
adopted comprehensive plan.
      (2)    The proposed conditional use is compatible with the appropriate
and orderly development of the district, taking into consideration the location
and  size of the use, the nature and intensity of the operations involved in or
conducted in connection with such use, the size of the site in relation to  the
use, the assembly of persons in connection with the use, and the location of
the site with respect to streets giving access to the site.
      (3)    The proposed site development, if applicable, is such that the
proposed conditional use will not hinder nor discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings, taking into consideration
the location, nature and height of  buildings, the location, nature and height
of walls and fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping on the site.
      (4)    Neighborhood character and surrounding property values are
reasonably safeguarded.
      (5)    Operations in connection with the proposed conditional use are not
offensive, dangerous, destructive of property values and basic environmental
characteristics, or detrimental to the public interest of the community. The
proposed conditional use is not more objectionable to nearby properties by
reason of fumes, noise, vibration, flashing of or glare from lights, and
similar nuisance conditions than the operations of any permitted use not
requiring a conditional use permit in the district.
      (6)    The character and appearance of the proposed conditional use,
buildings, structures, and/or outdoor signs should be in general harmony or
better, with the character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood.
   (B)   No conditional use permit application under the terms of this article
may be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless it finds that the
conditional use is within the fitting character of the surrounding area and is
consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance as set
forth in Section
1389.04.  Provided, the Board may substitute findings where such findings are
relevant to a unique conditional use classification (e.g., Class 2 Home
Occupation, etc.) and are uniformly applied to such unique conditional use
classification.
   
   (C)    Other Conditions and Restrictions.  The Board shall have the
authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly
related to and incidental to the proposed conditional use permit.
   (D)   The Planning Director may require the lot and location of the building
(s) thereon to be staked out on the ground before construction is begun.  The
Planning Director, where deemed appropriate, may require the same for accessory
structures or minor additions.  In any case, it shall be the owner’s
responsibility to ensure that a structure is placed on his/her property
according to his/her approved conditional use permit and as required by any
applicable City ordinance.
   (E)   Conditional use permits approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals may
authorize only the use, arrangement and construction set forth in the approved
permit.  Furthermore, the approval of a conditional use permit shall not be
construed to be approval of any violation of the provisions of this zoning
ordinance.  The issuance of a building permit based upon conditional use permit
approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall not prevent the Planning
Director, or his/her designee, from thereafter requiring the correction of
errors in said plans or from preventing operations from being carried on
thereunder when in violation with this zoning ordinance.  Conditional use
permit approval does not eliminate the need to obtain an approved building
permit nor the applicant’s responsibility to meet all other requirements
established by local, state and federal regulations.
   (F)   One copy of plans associated with the approved conditional use permit,
if applicable submitted for a building permit as required in subsection (E)
above for the Planning Department shall be returned to the applicant after the
Planning Director has marked such copy as either approved or disapproved as to
the provisions of this zoning ordinance and attested to same by his/her
signature on such copy.  The original, similarly marked, shall be retained by
the Planning Director.  (Ord. 17-28.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1379.04  CONDITIONAL APPROVAL.
   A conditional use approval may be denied or revoked where the applicant
fails to comply with specific conditions made a part of the approval by the
Board, or fails to comply with a reasonable request of the Board or the
Planning Director for furnishing specific information related to the proposed
use. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval shall constitute a
violation of the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 17-28.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1379.05  EXPIRATION.
   In the case where a Conditional Use Permit has not been used within twelve
(12) months after the granting thereof, then without further action it shall be
null and void. This time period may be extended at the discretion of the Board
of Zoning Appeals by successive twelve (12) month time periods, up to three (3)
years from the date of the original expiration.  A request for an extension
shall be in writing stating the justification for the extension, and shall be
submitted prior to the expiration of the Conditional Use Permit.  The word
“used” shall mean that the approved Conditional Use Permit has been activated
as evidenced by the issuance and continuation of any related development permit
and substantial construction started, if construction is involved in the
conditional use permit.
(Ord. 17-28.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1379.06  MISCELLANEOUS GUIDELINES.
   If there are other valid reasons for denying a conditional use application,
the denial may be sustained even if the proposed conditional use constitutes
the highest and best use, which can be made of the subject property. The Board
may not deny a permit solely for the purpose of limiting the number of similar
uses in an area. However, the Board may require that reasonable minimum
distances be maintained between similar uses as a condition of approval.

schedule and announce the date and time of the Board of Zoning Appeal's hearing
on the application. At the time the hearing is scheduled, the Planning Director
shall provide the applicant with written notice of the hearing date and time.
   (B)    Prior to the Board of Zoning Appeals hearing on the application, the
Planning Director shall review the application for compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance. Following such review and prior to the hearing, the Planning
Director shall prepare and provide the Board of Zoning Appeals and the
applicant with the Planning Director's written comments and recommendation on
the application, including the Planning Director's opinion as to any effect the
proposed variance might have upon the integrity of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (C)    The Board of Zoning Appeals, and its representatives, at its
discretion, may visit the subject property at any reasonable time during the
review process.

variance approval may be denied or revoked where the applicant fails to comply
with specific conditions made a part of the approval by the Board, or fails to
comply with a reasonable request of the Board or the Planning Director for
furnishing specific information related to the proposed variance. Failure to
comply with the conditions of approval shall constitute a violation of the
Zoning Ordinance.
1381.05  EXPIRATION.

after the granting thereof, then without further action it shall be null and
void.  This time period may be extended at the discretion of the Board of
Zoning Appeals by successive twelve (12) month time periods up to three (3)
years from the date of the original expiration.  A request for an extension
shall be in writing stating the justification for the extension, and shall be
submitted prior to the expiration of the variance approval.  The word "used"
shall mean that the approved variance has been activated as evidenced by the
issuance and continuation of any related development permit and substantial
construction started, if construction is involved in the variance.  (Ord. 17-
28.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1381.06  RELATIONSHIP TO SUBJECT PROPERTY.

1385.01  SITE PLAN REVIEW REQUIRED.
   No land within the jurisdiction of the City of Morgantown shall be developed
or altered for the purpose of constructing buildings or establishing uses
without first having received site plan approval from either the Planning
Department staff, or the Morgantown Planning Commission or the Morgantown Board
of Zoning Appeals. It shall be the duty of the Planning Director, or his/her
designee, in conjunction with other appropriate departments and agencies, to
perform complete and thorough review of all plans submitted to the Planning
Department.
(Ord. 15-31.  Passed 6-2-15.)
1385.02  APPLICATION.
   (A)   All applications for site plan review shall be made on application
forms prescribed by the Planning Department and follow established submittal
deadlines.
   (B)   Major development projects often become issues of significant
contention between applicants and residents living adjacent to and in the
vicinity of the property to be rezoned. Too often this results in difficult and
argumentative public hearings before the Municipal Planning Commission and City
Council. In most cases, opposition to a rezoning request is based on legitimate
concerns over the well-being and preservation of a neighborhood, but sometimes
opposition results from a simple lack of communication and understanding
between the applicant and the neighborhood residents. The City, therefore,
strongly advises any person that is considering applying for a Development of
Significant Impact (DSI) to discuss the proposal with residents living within
200 feet of the property to be rezoned and with the leadership of any organized
neighborhood organizations that represent the area before making application to
the Planning Department. The Department can assist by providing contact
information for individuals who should be consulted.
   (C)   All site plans for development in the B-4 District also shall be
submitted to the Downtown Design Review Committee for review and
recommendations prior to any formal public hearing or final approval.
(Ord. 15-31.  Passed 6-2-15.)
1385.03  DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENTS REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Requirements, standards and specifications for engineering design for
construction of improvements for site plans shall be equal to or greater than
the minimum requirements, standards, and specifications established for design
and improvements by the City Engineer. In addition to the plan sheets specified
below, the applicant shall submit a complete drainage report, including
calculations and justifications. The City Engineer may approve and/or require
other engineering designs or practices when deemed necessary.
   (B)   The proper management of storm water runoff is essential in the land
development process. The City has adopted a separate storm water management
ordinance that considers criteria related to total disturbed area, total/
modified impervious area, sedimentation and erosion control and other criteria.
Development plans are reviewed for, and must demonstrate compliance with this
article.
(Ord. 15-31.  Passed 6-2-15.)
1385.04  SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   There are three (3) types of site plan reviews which have different
application requirements and approval procedures. Types II and III shall be
reviewed by an internal technical review team, whose membership shall include
the City Manager or his designee, the Chief Code Enforcement Officer, the City
Engineer, a representative from the Morgantown Utility Board, and the City's
Fire Department. The types of review are:
   Type I      Administrative Review, by the Planning Director, of Simple Site
Plans
   Type II   Administrative Review, by the Planning Director, of Detailed Site
Plans
   Type III   Planning Commission Review of Developments of Significant Impact
(Ord. 17-28.  Passed 7-5-17.)
1385.05  REVIEW THRESHOLDS.
   In order to determine what type of review a project receives, the following
standards have been established and noted for specific land uses in the land
use table of this article.
   (A)   Type I Site Plan Review: Single-family and two-family residential
primary and secondary structures that do not constitute a Development of
Significant Impact.

the projected traffic impact of the use would result in a two (2) full letter
grade decline in the existing Level of Service (e.g., going from a Level of
Service B to a Level of Service D) of any dedicated City street directly
serving the use, such finding may be considered sufficient grounds for denial
of the project, or a requirement that sufficient improvements be made to said
streets, at the developer’s expense, or that the project be reduced in size and

Division of Highways, written/electronic correspondence from the WV Division of
Highways documenting its approval of the traffic analysis or traffic impact
study must be presented to the Planning Commission by the applicant prior to
DSI site plan approval.
      (3)   Transportation Route Plan.  A transportation route plan shall
include a map of routes and roads for equipment, supplies, chemicals or waste
products used or produced by the development.  The plan shall include a list of
the length of all public roads that will be used for site ingress and egress to
Morgantown corporate limits.  The map shall also show the location or any areas
within the City along the transportation route proposed for truck staging or
storage related to the development’s operations.  The City may restrict the
hours of operation of vehicles when the proposed transportation route passes
through a designated school zone, heavily used roadways or intersections, or
along local residential streets. In the event of construction detours, roadway
closure or roadway deterioration along an approved transportation route, the
City Engineer may amend the approved transportation route plan.
      (4)   Transportation Route Protection Agreement. For development which,
in the opinion of the City Engineer may damage or create excessive
deterioration to dedicated City roadways, rights-of-way, or improvements, the
City may require a transportation route protection agreement. The agreement
shall stipulate that the City roadways, rights-of-way, and improvements shall
be maintained equal to or better than the original condition; stipulate any
required major improvements and restrictions; stipulate the manner in which
dirt, dust, mud and debris is to be controlled from leaving the development
site; and, required bond.

Official or his/her designee within 30 days after the structure meets the
definition of a Vacant Building and on each subsequent July 1st when a Vacant
Building is present on the Owner(s)’ property.
   (b)    Registration is required annually, and at the time the vacant
structure is registered, the registration form must be accompanied by a
registration fee in the amount prescribed by this Section.  The registration
form shall require information from the registrant deemed necessary by the
Building Official, Fire Chief, and Police Chief of the City,  to ensure that
the purpose of this article is met.  The contents of the form shall enable City
Officers to determine the structural integrity of the building, any repairs
necessary to ensure its structural integrity, that it will be safe for entry,

The above named officers, or their designees, shall have the authority to issue

   (c)       Registration statement and fees; local agent. 
      (1)     A registration statement in the form prescribed by the City must
be filed by the Owner or Owner's local agent for all Vacant Buildings. 
Registration and payment of fees does not exonerate the owner, agent or
responsible party from penalties for failure to comply with any building,
housing, or fire code requirement.  One registration statement may be filed to
include all Vacant Buildings of an Owner, but a separate fee is assessed for
each Vacant Building. 
      (2)   The Owner(s) of the property on which a Vacant Building exists at

registration statement also shall provide the name and address of a person who
resides within the state and who is authorized to accept service of process on
behalf of the property owners and who shall be designated as a responsible
local agent for purposes of notification in the event of an emergency affecting
the public health, safety or welfare and for purposes of service of any and all

his/her designee within 30 days after the property meets the definition of a
Vacant Property and on each subsequent July 1st when the property qualifies as
a Vacant Property.  Registration is required annually but no registration fee
shall be required.  A registration statement in the form prescribed by the City
must be filed by the Owner for all Vacant Property.  Registration does not
exonerate the owner or responsible party from penalties for failure to comply
with any building, housing, or fire code requirement.  One registration
statement may be filed to include all Vacant Property of an Owner.

be made to notify the owner of the time and place of inspection. If the owner
fails or refuses to consent to and arrange for an inspection, the City will
seek a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction to authorize
inspection of the premises for the purpose of determining compliance with this
Article, the structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to
insure its structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire
fighters and police officers in time of emergency, and that the building and
its contents do not present a hazard to the public during the time that the
building remains vacant.  Additional inspections of any Vacant Building or
Vacant Property may be conducted according to these procedures when such
inspection is deemed necessary by the Building Official, Fire Chief, and Police
Chief.
   (b)     The owner of each Vacant Building or Vacant Property shall maintain
it in compliance with all applicable laws and codes, including without
limitation the Fire Code and Building Code.  (Ord. 17-42.  Passed 10-17-17.)

taken by the Owner or his agent.
   (b)     The notice of corrective action shall be served in accordance with
the law of the State of West Virginia concerning the service of process in
civil actions, except that personal service of the notice may be made by a code

(d)(1)(D) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure and delivery of the
notice is refused, the code enforcement agency official, promptly upon the
receipt of the notice of the refusal, shall mail to the person or entity being
noticed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the summons and
complaint. If the first class mailing is not returned as undeliverable by the
U. S. Postal Service, service of the notice is presumed to have been
effectuated.
   (c)     If the Owner fails to take the corrective action upon expiration of
the time period specified in the notice, the City may, but shall not be
required to, act to bring the Vacant Building or Vacant Property into
compliance with the standards set forth in this Article, or otherwise eliminate
the public nuisance caused by any noncompliant conditions. 
   (d)     The cost of any and all repairs, demolition, or maintenance, and all
related legal and administrative costs, incurred by the City in the enforcement
of this Section shall be paid to the City by the Owner.  The City may institute
civil proceedings to collect any such costs.
(Ord. 17-42.  Passed 10-17-17.)

that the determination was incorrect and contrary to law, in whole or in part. 
The City Manager shall review the appeal and provide for any necessary hearing,
render a decision on the appeal and promptly notify the Property Owner of such

enforce the determination subject of the appeal except to address an emergency
condition presenting an imminent danger to the life, health, or safety of the

a determinate period of time.  In order to obtain such exemption, the Property
Owner shall submit a written request for exemption to the City Manager for
delivery to the City Council stating all reasons showing good cause that the
building cannot be occupied and identifying the time period for which it cannot
be occupied.  City Council shall consider the request at its next regular

   (a)   The Code Enforcement Agency may order the repair, alteration,
improvement, closing, demolition or removal of any dwelling, building or

inspections, perform investigations, obtain search warrants, issue notices,
require corrective measures, present complaints to the municipal judge, and
exercise all other powers and duties authorized by West Virginia Code Section
8-12-16, as it may be amended.
   (c)   The powers and duties granted in this Article

1719.04   INSPECTION.
   For purposes of inspections performed pursuant to this Article
1719, the following rules shall apply:

the investigation shall be conducted in a way that minimizes the inconvenience
to the owner or persons in possession.
   (b)   Except in exigent circumstances and as permitted by law, the
enforcement agency shall provide reasonable advance notice of the inspection to
the owner and request permission from the owner to enter the property.
   (c)   If the owner cannot be located after reasonable inquiry by the code
enforcement agency, or if the owner refuses entry, the code enforcement agency
may obtain an administrative search warrant from either the municipal court or
the Monongalia County Magistrate Court.  Before obtaining an administrative
search warrant, a code enforcement agency official is required to make a sworn
statement and prima facie case showing that the code enforcement agency was
unable to gain access to the structure, dwelling or building after reasonable
and good faith efforts, and that there is a legitimate and substantial safety
concern involving the structure, dwelling or building that supports the
requested entry.
   (d)   If the administrative search warrant is granted by the court, and if
the owner can be located, the code enforcement agency shall provide the owner a
copy of the administrative search warrant five days before entering the
property.  If there is a tenant or other person in possession of the structure
who is not the owner, and if such person(s) can be located, the code
enforcement agency shall also provide such person(s) a copy of the
administrative search warrant five days before entering the property.
   (e)   Any entry pursuant to this section shall be made for the sole purpose
of inspection of the structure, dwelling or building for unsafe or unsanitary
conditions and not for the purpose of criminal prosecution or gathering
evidence for use in any criminal charge or proceeding unrelated to the unsafe
or unsanitary condition of the structure, dwelling or building.
      (Ord. 17-47.  Passed 11-28-17.)

is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or
welfare, the City may take corrective action by causing it to be vacated,
closed, removed, demolished or repaired, either directly or by the use of third

the Building Code Board of Appeals; provided that this statement shall only be
required if the corrective action is required based on a determination pursuant
to the Building Code and such notice of appeal has not already been provided;
and
            (ix)   The allotted time the owner has to apply to the circuit
court for a temporary injunction or other similar relief restraining action by

1719.09(b).
         C.   If the code enforcement agency cannot effect personal service on
the owner, a code enforcement agency official shall subscribe a written

followed the procedures set forth herein; provided, that the City acted in good
faith, can demonstrate that the structure, dwelling or building falls within
one of the categories set forth in Section
1719.05(a)(2)A. or B. followed the procedures set forth in this section, and
had adopted the state building code at the time the closure, demolition or

removing or demolishing any dwelling or building.
   (b)   In addition to any other rights provided by law, the City may file a

in the state building code.
   (b)   Any violation of this Article

shall be initiated by a complaint presented to and sworn or affirmed before a
municipal judge or other municipal official with lawful authority to hear and
determine violations of municipal code in the municipality where the offense is
alleged to have occurred.  Unless otherwise provided by statute, the
presentation and oath or affirmation shall be made by a code enforcement agency
official or municipal attorney showing reason to have reliable information and
belief.  If from the facts stated in the complaint the municipal judge or other
municipal official with lawful authority to hear and determine violations of
municipal code finds probable cause, the complaint becomes the charging
instrument initiating a criminal proceeding.  A complaint lawfully authorized
by this subsection along with a summons setting forth the date, time and place
of appearance before a municipal judge and or other municipal official with

enforcement agency official, promptly upon the receipt of the notice of the
refusal, shall mail to the person or entity being notified, by first class
mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the summons and complaint.  If the first class
mailing is not returned as undeliverable by the U.S. Postal Service, service of
the summons and complaint is presumed to have been effectuated.  Upon service
of the summons and complaint consistent with this subsection, the violation may
be prosecuted consistent with state and local law.

1743.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   (a)   The Floodplain District shall include all areas subject to inundation
by the waters of the 100-year flood.  The areas are shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map and described in the Flood Insurance Study for the City of
Morgantown, Monongalia County, West Virginia, as prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), January 20, 2010 or the most recent
revision thereof.
   (b)   The identified floodplain area shall also be those areas of the City
of Morgantown which have been identified as flood hazard areas by the City of
Morgantown by use of historic or other technical data and shown on the City of
Morgantown "Local Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as
appropriate with the level of technical data described below and shall be
managed accordingly.
   (c)   Subdistricts.  The Floodplain District shall be comprised of four
specific areas as follows:
      (1)   Floodway (F1).  That portion of the Floodplain District required to
carry and discharge the waters of the 100-year flood without increasing the
water surface elevation at any point more than one foot above existing
conditions, as demonstrated in the Flood Insurance Study referenced above.  The
term shall also include floodway areas identified in other studies for the
approximated area discussed in subsection (c)(4) hereof.   
   In floodplain areas for which no regulatory floodway has been designated,
the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not incorporating
significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the community, be
considered to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a
distance of one-half the width of the floodplain as measured from the top of
the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the 100 year floodplain
boundary.
      (2)   Floodway Fringe (F2).  Those portions of land within the Floodplain
District subject to inundation by the 100-year flood, lying beyond the floodway
in areas where detailed study data and profiles are available.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway (F3)  shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-
year flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   Approximated Floodplain Area (F4).  Those portions of land within
the Floodplain District subject to inundation by the 100-year flood, where a
detailed study has not been performed, but where a 100-year floodplain boundary
has been approximated.  For these areas, elevation and floodway data from other
federal, state or other acceptable sources shall be used when available.  Where
other acceptable information is not available, the elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of the point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest to the construction site or other
methods as determined by the Floodplain Administrator. When hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered
professional engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of
findings in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc.
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by
the Floodplain Administrator.
   (d)   Changes.  The delineation of the Floodplain District may be revised,
amended and modified by Council in compliance with the National Flood Insurance
Program when:
      (1)   Changes,  through natural or man-made events, have occurred and/or
more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission, or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such damages.
      (2)   Changes are indicated by future detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
studies.
      (3)   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the community shall notify the NFIP Administrator of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (4)   The City of Morgantown may identify and regulate new flood hazard
or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated using locally derived technical
information such as flood of record, historic high water marks and/or
topographic data. 
   All such changes shall be subject to the review and approval of the Federal
Insurance Administrator.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the Base Flood Elevation
specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the structure shall not be required to
conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-
related development codes in Section
1743.05.  Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.  The applicant is advised to
apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the Special Flood
Hazard Area designation removed from the parcel or structure. 
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site
shall be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this Ordinance.
   (f)   Boundary Dispute.  Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Chief Building Inspector. 
Any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City Manager.  The
burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
(Ord. 10-03.  Passed 1-5-10.)
1743.04  UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT. 
   (a)   Floodway (F1).
      (1)   General requirements within any floodway area. No encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development
shall be permitted which would result in any increase in the base flood
elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.  When a developer
proposes to offset the effects of development in the floodway area by
construction of stream improvements, he shall submit an engineering study
prepared by a registered professional engineer which fully evaluates the
effects of such construction.  The report shall use the base flood as herein
defined as the basis of analysis.  All adjacent communities and the State
Coordinating Office shall be notified by the  developer by certified mail of
all such intended activities prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse and shall submit copies of such notification to the Federal
Insurance Administrator.  In addition, the developer shall assure the City
Manager, in writing, that the flood- carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse in question will be maintained.  All uses,
activities and other developments shall be undertaken in strict compliance with
the flood proofing and related provisions contained herein, and in all other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters, the floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below,
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the encroachment before a permit is issued. 
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative, the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   Manufactured Homes.  In the floodway, the placement of any
manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured home park or
manufactured home subdivision, shall be prohibited.  For any existing
manufactured home park or subdivision within the floodway, the owner or
operator of the manufactured home park or subdivision shall file with the
disaster preparedness authorities of the County and the City an evacuation plan
which indicates alternate vehicular access routes and escape routes.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain Area (F4).  In the
Floodway Fringe and Approximated Floodplain Area, any development and/or use of
land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/or
development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations. For any manufactured home park or subdivision
within the Floodway Fringe or Approximated Floodplain Area, the owner or
operator of the manufactured home park or subdivision shall file with the
disaster preparedness authorities of the County and the City an evacuation plan
which indicates alternate vehicular access routes.
        (1)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments
which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the
Approximated Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or
two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation
data.
      (2)   This data may be available from an authoritative source, such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource
Conservation Service or state and local water resource department.
      (3)   If the required data is not available from other sources, the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. 
   (c)   AE Area Without Floodway (F3).  Within any AE area without floodway,
no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of
the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.  This requirement can
be satisfied by utilization of the floodway area where determined.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a watercourse
within the Floodplain Area, the developer shall notify in writing by certified
mail the City of Morgantown, all adjacent communities and the State
Coordinating Office of all such intended activities prior to any alteration or
relocation of the watercourse, and shall submit copies of such notification to
the Federal Insurance Administrator.  In addition, prior to issuing the local
permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Morgantown in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained.  The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment.  If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by professional engineers, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator. 
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage.  These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1743.99.
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
         (Ord. 10-03.  Passed 1-5-10.)
1743.05  CRITERIA FOR BUILDING PERMIT AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   Building permits are required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified floodplain, floodway or other flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from debris impact,
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (3)   Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage as outlined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) or the most
recent revision thereof.
      (4)   Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (5)   Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   (b)   The basic format of the building permit shall include the following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant;
      (2)   Name and address of the owner of land on which proposed
construction is to occur;
      (3)   Names, addresses, and valid West Virginia license numbers of all
contractors working at the building site, or affidavits stating that work is
being performed by individuals exempt from contractor licensing as set forth in
Title 28, Series 2, Section 3.9(b) of the West Virginia Code of State
Regulations or the most recent revision thereof.
      (4)   A description of site location sufficient to locate the project
including tax map and parcel number and most recent deed book and page number;
      (5)   Brief description of proposed work and estimated cost;
      (6)   A plan of the site showing the exact size and location of the
proposed construction as well as any existing buildings or structures.  The
site plan shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of
flow, the lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill,
the Base Flood Elevation and the location of the floodway boundary when
applicable.
      (7)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to pay any and all fees
associated with the permitting process as set forth in Section
1743.08.
      (8)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to allow authorized

Floodplain Administrator for review within five (5) business days of contract
signing.  The community does not require and will not keep copies of the
contracts or addendums.  Failure to present contract or addendums for review
shall void the permit.  If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work
is of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) including
materials and labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the
estimated value will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the building permit for work within the Floodplain
District:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated to the base flood elevation:
           A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the existing ground, proposed
finished ground and lowest floors certified by a registered professional
engineer, licensed professional surveyor or architect.
         C.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structures,

of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made, this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the community determines that the area below the first floor could be
converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below
base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more).  This agreement shall state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this Ordinance.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement.  It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature.  A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1743.99.
      (2)   For structures to be floodproofed to the base flood elevation (non-
residential structures only):
All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing 
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this Ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all floodproofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer or architect, and showing the size of the
proposed structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of existing ground, proposed
finished ground, lowest floors and floodproofing limits, certified by a
registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or architect.
         C.   A Flood proofing certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer or architect who
prepared the plans in subsection (c)(2) A. hereof, that the structure in
question, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed
so that:
            1.   Below the base flood elevation, the structure is watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures and other factors associated with the base flood.
   (d)   For all structures in the floodplain: electrical, heating,
ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service
facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
   (e)   For structures constructed of flood resistant materials - used solely
for parking of vehicles, or storage, (Appurtenant Structures only):
      (1)   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others
of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground, proposed
finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of proposed
flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the floodway
boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present on the
site.
      (2)   An elevation report or certificate, based on finished construction,
must be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
         A.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of flood waters.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1743.99.
         (Ord. 10-03.  Passed 1-5-10.)
1743.06  DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Minimum Flood Proofing Standards.  In order to prevent excessive
damage to buildings, structures, and related utilities and facilities, the
following restrictions shall apply to all development, subdivision proposals,
manufactured home parks, new construction and to construction of substantial
improvements, and the repair of substantial damage,  to existing structures
occurring in the Floodplain District.
   (b)   Basements and Lowest Floors.
      (1)   Residential structures.  All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork, and utilities, elevated to the base flood elevation. 
      (2)   Non-residential structures.  All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork, and utilities, elevated to base flood elevation; or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be designed so that below the
base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting debris impact,  hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effects of buoyancy.
   (c)   Enclosures Below a Structure, Lowest Floor.  For all new construction,
relocation, substantial improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood
waters.  Designs for meeting this requirement shall either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or shall meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:  A minimum of two openings having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject
to flooding shall be provided.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot above grade.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of flood waters.
   (d)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant on all
flood-proofed structures and any elevated structures when the community
determines that the area below the first floor could be converted to a non-
conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below base flood elevation
that are 5 ft. high or more).  This agreement shall state:
      (1)   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for use
other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as detailed in
this Ordinance.
      (2)   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence
of the non-conversion agreement.  It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized
signature. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1743.99.
   (e)   Fill. The City of Morgantown officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods.  Placement of fill in the floodplain area is discouraged and should be
minimized.
   In the floodway, no fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements
of Section
1743.04.
   All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the following
standards:
      (1)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties.  The City of Morgantown may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties.  When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts.  The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed
and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings
in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the City
of Morgantown.  During permit review, the community shall consider the
following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent
properties:
         A.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
         B.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
         C.   Deflection of flood waters onto adjacent existing structures.
         D.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating erosion
problems.
         E.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when determining
whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property including, but not
limited to subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream blockages, and steep
topography adjacent to the channel.
      (2)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or flood ways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
      (3)   Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding).
      (4)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance  to
provide acceptable access.  For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection (e)(7) hereof.  For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended
use.  At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen feet beyond the
building line, shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of
the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
      (5)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock materials only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted.  No trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
      (6)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary stability
and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling.  Fill compaction standards
must be appropriate to proposed post fill use.  Particular attention is
necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
      (7)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two
horizontal  unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (8)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
         A.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less must be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
         B.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
      (9)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Manufactured Homes.  Certain unique characteristics of
manufactured homes installed in flood hazard areas pose an elevated risk of
substantial damage to the property.  Thus:
      (1)   All manufactured homes to be sited within the identified flood
hazard areas of the City of Morgantown shall be installed by a contractor
possessing a valid West Virginia Manufactured Home Installer's license. The
installer shall use an installation design engineered to withstand flood
hazards specific to the particular home site. Manufactured homes to be placed
or substantially improved within the flood hazard areas shall be installed in
accordance with the following standards: 
         A.   The lowest floor, ductwork and utilities including HVAC/heat pump
shall be elevated to the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Adequate surface drainage and access for a manufactured home
hauler shall be provided.
         C.   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent foundation,
or shall use foundation elements of at least equivalent strength engineered for
use in a flood hazard area. Installation designs incorporating dry stacked
block piers shall not be used in flood hazard areas.
         D.   When manufactured homes are to be elevated on piers, lots shall
be large enough to permit steps, piles shall be placed in stable soil no more
than ten feet apart, and reinforcement shall be provided for pilings more than
six feet above ground level.
         E.   Manufactured homes shall be placed on permanent foundations.
         F.   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10.1, 10.2, and
10b as authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-4.  The anchoring shall be
adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to the over-the-top and
frame ties, attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not
be adequate to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement
is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces.
         G.   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings; this type of skirting can collapse during
floods and compromise supporting piers. The openings must be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces by allowing for entry and exit
of flood waters.  Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of flood waters.
         H.   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly anchored
and vented.
      (2)   The licensed West Virginia Manufactured Home Installer placing the
unit shall perform a site inspection and certify in writing that the
manufactured home has been installed to the standards set forth in this
Ordinance.
   (g)   Appurtenant Structures.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (g)(2) below, appurtenant
structures shall be located out of the floodplain area or elevated to two feet
above the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         A.   Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size and
valued at less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
         B.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
         C.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to minimize
flood damage.
         D.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         E.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         F.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         G.   The venting requirements contained in Section
1743.05(e) are applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
Ordinance.  The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence
of this agreement.  It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature.  A copy of
all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.  Failure
to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
 1743.99.
   (h)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.  Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any floodplain area shall either: 
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or,
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions; or,
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
   (i)   Placement of Buildings, Structures and Other Development .
      (1)   All buildings, structures, and other developments shall be
constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the
flow of  water and shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon
the flow and height of flood water.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (2)   The following shall not be placed or caused to be placed in the
designated floodway: fences, except two-wire fences, other  matter which may
impede, retard or change the direction of the  flow of water or that will catch
or collect debris carried by such water, or that is placed where the natural
flow of the stream or flood waters would carry the same downstream to the
damage or detriment of either public or private property adjacent to the
floodplain.
   (j)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All buildings, structures, and other developments including stream
crossings shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering
practices to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement, thus reducing
the threat to life and property, and decreasing the possibility of the blockage
of bridge openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the base flood elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (3)   All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement by providing over-the-top and frame ties to ground
anchors. Specifically:
         A.   Over-the-top ties shall be provided at each of the four corners
of the manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate
locations, and manufactured homes less than fifty feet long requiring one
additional tie per side.
         B.   Frame ties shall be provided at each corner of the home with five
additional ties per side at intermediate points, with manufactured homes less
than fifty feet long requiring four additional ties per side.
         C.   All components of the anchoring system shall be capable of
carrying a force of 4,800 pounds.
         D.   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly anchored.
   (k)   Storage.
      (1)   No new construction which stores materials that are buoyant,
flammable, explosive or in times of flooding could be injurious to human,
animal or plant life shall be stored below base flood elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill" material
shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this subsection.
   (l)   Utility and Facility Requirements.  For all proposed subdivisions,
manufactured home parks or subdivisions or other development the Floodplain
Administrator shall require:
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems, located in the Floodplain
District, whether public or private, shall be flood proofed to the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, located within
the Floodplain District, whether public or private, shall be flood proofed to
the base flood elevation.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be elevated or floodproofed to the base flood elevation.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (m)    Drainage.  Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
   (n)   Backflow Preventers.  Backflow prevention valves shall be used for all
enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain.
(Ord. 10-03.  Passed 1-5-10.)
1743.07  SITE PLAN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Requirements Generally.  The owner or developer of any proposed
development, including subdivision, commercial development, manufactured home
park or subdivision or other development, shall submit a preliminary site plan
to the Floodplain Administrator which includes the following information:
      (1)    Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to the Municipality's flood-prone areas, proposed lots
and sites, fills, flood or erosion protective facilities and areas subject to
special deed restriction.  In addition, it is required that all subdivision
proposals and other proposed new developments, which are proposed to take place
either fully or partially within the approximated floodplain(F4) and which are
greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall
include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a floodway.  If FEMA has
completed a Flood Insurance Study (FIS), that data must be used to substantiate
the base flood.  Otherwise, the developer may submit data provided by an
authoritative source, such as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological
Survey, Natural Resources Conservation Service, state and local water resource
departments, or technical data developed using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts.
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lie partially or
completely in the floodplain areas, the plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites.  All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify
accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas.
      (4)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the floodplain area and all proposed development including fill will take place
on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the floodplain boundary
depicted on the map, development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not
be necessary.  In these cases the site plan for the proposed development must
show contours at intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet and clearly delineate
the area to be developed and the location of the floodplain areas as depicted
on the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
         (Ord. 10-03.  Passed 1-5-10.)

approval by the Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made
to the application, permit or any of the plans, specifications or other
documents submitted with the application without the written consent or
approval of the Floodplain Administrator.
   (e)   Permit Placards.
      (1)    In addition to the building and floodplain permit, the Chief
Building Inspector shall issue a placard which shall be displayed on the
premises during the time construction is in progress. This placard shall show

ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or misrepresentation by
any applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a "Stop Work Order",
revoke the building permit and request a temporary injunction.  The Floodplain
Administrator or other authorized official may inspect any development covered
by this or previous ordinance to determine whether any portion of the
development has been altered to be in non-compliance with the requirements of
this Ordinance.
   (i)   Certificate of Occupancy.

Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the Certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this Ordinance or local administrative procedures,
and any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood
proofing certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as
a condition of permit approval.
         (Ord. 10-03.  Passed 1-5-10.)

established by the Floodplain Administrator may be handled at the discretion of
the City Manager.  All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this
article not covered in subsection (a) hereof shall adhere to the following
criteria:
      (1)   An affirmative decision shall not be issued by the City Manager
within the designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result.
      (2)   A decision may be issued by the City Manager for the construction
and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood elevation in conformance with the procedures of paragraphs
(3) to (6) of this subsection (b).
      (3)   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the City Manager upon
a showing of good and sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant
the appeal would result in an exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a
determination that the granting of an appeal will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict
with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued upon determination that
it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered sufficient
justification to grant an appeal.
      (5)   The City Manager shall notify the applicant, in writing, over the
signature of a community official, that the issuance of a decision to allow
construction of a structure below the base flood elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance and that such construction below
the base flood elevation increases risks  to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions as required in
paragraph (6) of this subsection (b).
        (6)   The City Manager shall maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and report such decisions issued in
its annual report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration.

whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this
Ordinance which shall remain in full force and effect and for this purpose the
provisions of this Ordinance are hereby declared to be severable.
   (b)   The granting of a permit or approval of a subdivision or development
plan in an identified flood-prone area, shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee or warranty of any kind by the City or by any official or employee
thereof of the practicability or safety of the proposed use, and shall create
no liability upon the City, its officials or employees.  All applicants
proposing development in or near a flood hazard area are urged to locate
development as far away from, and as high above, all flooding sources as
possible.
(Ord. 10-03.  Passed 1-5-10.)
1743.99  PENALTY.

shall, upon conviction, pay a fine to the City of Morgantown of not less than
fifty dollars ($50.00)  or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost
of prosecution.  Each day during which any violation of this article continues
shall constitute a separate offense.  In addition to the above penalties, all
other actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this article.  The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or noncompliance with, this article shall not excuse the
violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall
