Upon having received all evidence and hearing all sworn testimony relating
to the petition, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the site plan,
existing and proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring land

the land in question.
(2) The experiencing of unnecessary hardships or practical difficulties
on the land in question either presently or in the future.
(3) That these hardships or difficulties are the result of the
aforementioned special conditions existing on the land and are not
self-inflicted.
(4) That the existence of these special conditions will restrict the use of
the land if the Zoning Ordinance is applied literally so as to render
land useless.
(5) That the limitation on the use of the land does not apply generally
to other properties in the district.
(6) That limiting the use of the property will not afford compensating
gains to the public health, safety and welfare.

needed to alleviate difficulties or hardships.
(8) That the use of the parcel in question presently does conform to

District, see § 420-131 of Chapter 420, Zoning Ordinance.
C. A variance may be granted, for example, for reasons of topography,

obtaining a variance is to obtain a more profitable use of the property,
personal inconvenience, construction errors, economic reasons, selfcreated

altering the sanitary requirements of Chapter 420, Zoning Ordinance,

officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to
the people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper
channels of the governmental structure; that the public office not be
used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the
integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is
hereby established in this chapter a Code of Ethics for all Village of
Pleasant Prairie officials and employees, whether elected or appointed,

standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting
forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests
of the Village of Pleasant Prairie and by directing disclosure by such
officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters
affecting the Village. The Village Board believes that a Code of Ethics
for the guidance of elected and appointed officials and employees will
help them avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their
public responsibilities, will improve standards of public service and will
promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the citizens of this
Village in their elected and appointed officials and employees. The
Village Board hereby reaffirms that each elected and appointed Village
official and employee holds his or her position as a public trust, and any

engage in any business or transaction or shall act in regard to
financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is

public interest contrary to the provision of this chapter or which
would tend to impair independence of judgment or action in the
performance of official duties.
(2) Any member of the Village Board who has a financial interest or
personal interest in any proposed legislation before the Village
Board shall disclose on the records of the Village Board the nature
and extent of such interest; such official shall not participate in
debate or vote for adoption or defeat of such legislation. If the

indirectly, any gift or gifts from any person who is known by said

guest's immediate family, was a Village official or employee.
Participation in celebrations, grand openings, open houses,
informational meetings and similar events are excluded from this
prohibition. This subsection further shall not be construed to
prevent candidates for elective office from accepting hospitality

family under unusual circumstances shall be referred to the Village
Board within 10 days of receipt for recommended disposition. Any

violation of this section, shall, within 10 days, disclose the details
surrounding said offer to the Village Board. Failure to comply with

§ 108-6 ADULT-ORIENTED USES AND § 108-8
108:89
A. Time limit.
(1) The Village Board shall decide each application for an initial adultoriented
use license, or for an amendment or renewal of such a
license, within 45 days after a complete application and the
applicable fee for such application are filed with the Community
Development Department, unless the operator or an authorized
representative of the operator agrees to an extension of time at a
Village Board meeting, which extension is contained in the minutes
of such meeting, or is memorialized in a writing signed by the
operator or an authorized representative of the operator; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing time limit, the Village
Board may toll the remaining time for decision until the next
regularly scheduled meeting that is conducted by the Village Board
if:
(a) A required site and operational plan approval under Article IX
of Chapter 420, Zoning Ordinance (including the
determination of the applicable physically separate defined
area), has not yet been issued with respect to the proposed
adult-oriented use(s) and any other use(s) to be located and
conducted together with such adult-oriented use(s) in the same
physically defined separate area of a building; or if
(b) A required amendment of Chapter 420, Zoning Ordinance, has
not yet been enacted and the application for such amendment
is not ripe for decision by the Village Board; or if
(c) The operator or a knowledgeable representative of the
operator authorized to speak for and bind the operator fails to
appear at a meeting of the Village Board at which
consideration of the application is duly scheduled, and if the
Village Board has any questions about the application or the
proposed use(s) to which it reasonably requires answers before
deciding the application, or if the operator or the operator's
authorized representative are unable to answer such questions
without an adjournment.
(2) If the Village Board fails to decide an application for an adultoriented
use license within the time limits established by this
chapter, the license shall be deemed to be issued on the basis of the
information provided in the application.
B. Notice and opportunity to be heard. The Village Board shall cause a
written notice to be issued to the operator, not less than 10 days prior to
the date of the Village Board meeting at which the operator's
application is proposed to be considered, stating the date, time and
place of the meeting, the operator's obligation to be present in person
or by knowledgeable representative authorized to speak for and bind
the operator, and optionally, any additional information that the Village
Board or staff believes is necessary or desirable to decide the
§ 108-8 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 108-8
108:90
application. The operator shall be given an opportunity to present its
application and to respond to any concerns that members of the Village
Board have which might be the basis for denial or the imposition of any
special limiting condition.
C. Approval. The Village Board shall approve an application for an adultoriented
use license if the application and the proposed adult-oriented
use(s) and establishment satisfy all of the requirements of this chapter
and if the Village Board does not find that there is a reasonable
probability that the operator will fail to comply with the requirements of
this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this chapter, based on a
substantial pattern of noncompliant behavior during the five years
immediately preceding the date of the application or other clear and
convincing information.
D. Conditions. The Village Board may impose reasonable requirements
and conditions to ensure compliance by the operator with the
requirements of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this
chapter, and for such purposes may incorporate by reference in its
decision all or portions of the operator's application or other
documents. The Village Board shall specify whether any condition
imposed on its approval is a condition precedent (must be satisfied
before the license takes effect) or a condition subsequent (must be
satisfied after the license takes effect to avoid a subsequent suspension
and possible termination) and may specify a reasonable period of time
within which to satisfy any such condition. For existing adult-oriented
uses or establishments that are allowed uses pursuant to Chapter 420,
Zoning Ordinance, conditions precedent shall be avoided unless they
are required to remedy serious health or safety problems or serious
adverse secondary effects in the surrounding area.
E. Physically separate defined area. In the event that the physically
separate defined area to be occupied by an existing allowed adultoriented
use and any related interior accessory use(s) involved in the
adult-oriented use license application has not been determined and will
not be determined pursuant to Article IX of Chapter 420, Zoning
Ordinance, in connection with a then-currently-required site and
operational plan approval, the Village Board shall determine the
physically separate defined area of such use(s) as part of the license
decision.
F. Denial. The Village Board shall deny the license application if it finds
that the proposed adult-oriented use(s) or establishment fail to satisfy
the requirements of this chapter, or if it finds that there is a reasonable
probability that the operator will fail to comply with the requirements of
this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this chapter, based on a
substantial pattern of noncompliant behavior during the five years
immediately preceding the date of the application or other clear and
convincing information. The Village Board may deny a license
application for lack of specific information, which it reasonably needs to
decide the application, if the operator has been given a reasonable
§ 108-8 ADULT-ORIENTED USES AND § 108-8
108:91
§ 108-9. License.
The Community Development Department shall issue an adult-oriented use
license within five business days after Village Board approval of the
application, if there are no conditions precedent, or Community
Development Department certification that all conditions precedent to the
Village Board approval have been satisfied pursuant to § 108-10A of this
chapter. If the Department fails to act timely pursuant to this § 108-9, the
license shall be deemed to be issued for purposes of the operator's right
to operate, but a subsequently issued license shall be valid and binding.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no violation of this
chapter shall result from an operator of an existing adult-oriented use
or establishment that is an allowed use pursuant to Chapter 420, Zoning
Ordinance, continuing to operate such use or establishment during the
period between Village Board's approval of an adult-oriented use license for
such use or establishment, which is not subject to any conditions precedent,
and the issuance of such license to the operator. An adult-oriented use
license shall be personal to the operator and site-specific to the approved
location, shall not run with the land, shall not be transferable or assignable
and shall not be applicable to an adult-oriented use or establishment at
a location different than the approved location. A transfer or assignment
of an adult-oriented use license shall automatically terminate such license.
(A simple name change by an operator shall not be deemed to involve an
assignment and require a new license, but the merger or acquisition of an
operator shall be deemed to involve an assignment and shall require a new
license.) Except as provided in § 108-11 or 12 below, any initial, renewed
or amended adult-oriented use license shall automatically expire one year
after the date of issuance unless it is sooner invalidated or terminated.
§ 108-10. Satisfaction of license conditions.
opportunity to supply such information. The Village Board shall
specifically state its reasons for denying any adult-oriented use license
application.
G. Minor modifications. Applications for minor modifications of adultoriented
use licenses may be informally granted in writing by the
Community Development Director or the Director's staff designee
pursuant to § 108-13 below.
A. Conditions precedent. The operator of a proposed adult-oriented use or
establishment shall satisfy all conditions precedent imposed by the
Village Board on its approval of an application for an adult-oriented use
license within the time specified by the Village Board in its decision, or
if the time was not specified by the Village Board, within 270 days after
the date of approval. The operator shall notify the Community
Development Department, in writing, within the time prescribed, of the
satisfaction of any conditions precedent and shall either provide proof
of satisfaction with such notice or request in such notice an inspection
of the premises. The Community Development Department shall make
§ 108-8 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 108-10
108:92
any requested inspection within three business days after receipt of
such notice and shall certify to the Village Board satisfactory
compliance with any condition precedent and issue the license (or
notify the operator in writing why a condition has not been satisfied)
within three business days after receiving such proof or after making
an inspection. In the event that the operator fails to satisfy a condition
precedent within the time prescribed, the Village Board's approval shall
be automatically suspended. If the operator thereafter satisfies the
condition precedent within one year after the Village Board's approval,
and files with the Community Development Department an updated
application in which the operator certifies that the updated information
is accurate and complete, together with the fee required for a renewal
application, the Community Development Department shall certify to
the Village Board satisfactory compliance with the condition(s)
precedent and issue the license within three business days, unless
facts have changed materially or the requirements of this chapter have
changed materially in the interim, in which event the Department shall
issue a notice to the operator within three business days that the
updated application is being treated as an application for renewal. If
the Department fails to act timely pursuant to this Subsection A, the
action in favor of the operator shall be deemed to have been taken
timely.
B. Conditions subsequent. The operator shall satisfy any conditions
subsequent to the license and obtain the Department of Community
Development's certification of such satisfaction within the time
specified in the license or, if such time is not specified, within 60 days
after the date of issuance. The operator shall notify the Community
Development Department in writing, within the time prescribed, of
satisfaction of any conditions subsequent and provide proof of
satisfaction with such notice or request in such notice an inspection of
the premises. The Community Development Department shall inspect
the premises within three business days after receiving notice and a
request for inspection. The Community Development Department shall
certify the satisfaction to the Village Board (or notify the operator in
writing why the condition has not been satisfied) within three business
days after receiving such proof or conducting such an inspection. In the
event that an operator fails to satisfy a condition subsequent and obtain
the Department's certification of such satisfaction within the time
prescribed, the license shall be automatically suspended. During any
such suspension, operations shall be prohibited. Any such suspension
shall be automatically lifted upon the Community Development
Department's certification to the Village Board of satisfactory
compliance with the condition(s) subsequent. If the Department fails to
act timely pursuant to this Subsection B, the action in favor of the
operator shall be deemed to have been taken on the last day of the time
prescribed for such action.

a complete renewal application with the Community Development
Department, together with the renewal license application fee specified in
§ 108-7 of this chapter, not later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the
existing license. The timely filing of a complete renewal application and the
required application fee shall entitle an operator to continue operating an
adult-oriented use or establishment during the pendency of the application,
even if the application is not decided until after the expiration of the existing
license, and until the license is issued if the Village Board approves the
application without conditions precedent. Any amendments to this chapter
that are enacted before the Village Board's decision shall be applicable
to a renewal application. The application for renewal of an adult-oriented
use license shall contain all of the information and documents required for
an initial adult-oriented use license. Such an application may incorporate
by reference specific information filed by the operator in or attached to
the most recent application on the basis of which an adult-oriented use
license was approved by the Village Board, provided that such previous
application and any applicable attachments thereto are attached to the
renewal application or are on file with the Village and readily available to
the Community Development Director, if the operator specifies the date of
such prior application and certifies that such information has not changed
and is up to date, accurate and complete as of the date of the application.
Any information that has changed since the previous application or which
was incorrectly stated in the previous application shall be updated and
corrected by the operator so that all of the information filed with the Village
is accurate and complete as of the date of the application. Sections 108-8
through 108-10 of this chapter shall apply to license renewal.
§ 108-12. License amendment.
An operator desiring to amend a valid adult-oriented use license shall file an
application for amendment of the license with the Community Development
Department, together with the amended license application fee specified
in § 108-7 of this chapter, after requesting and participating in any
preapplication staff conference required by § 108-5 of this chapter. Any
amendments to this chapter that are enacted before the Village Board's
decision shall be applicable to an amendment application. The application
for amendment of an adult-oriented use license shall contain all of the
information and documents required for an application for an initial adultoriented
use license and shall contain a complete and detailed description
of any proposed changes in use, operation, physical layout or license
provisions and a scale drawing showing any physical changes in layout.
Such an application may incorporate by reference specific information filed
by the operator in the most recent application on the basis of which an
adult-oriented use license was approved by the Village Board, provided
that such previous application and any applicable attachments thereto are
attached to the application, or that such documents are on file with the
Village and is readily available to the Community Development Director, if
§ 108-11 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 108-12
108:94
the operator specifies the date of such application and certifies that such

§ 108-13. Minor modification of license.
An operator desiring a minor modification of a valid adult-oriented use

fee specified in § 108-7 of this chapter, after requesting and participating
in any preapplication staff conference required by § 108-5 of this chapter.
The Director of the Community Development Department or the Director's
staff designee shall be authorized but not obligated to grant a minor
modification, and if practicable, the Director or the Director's staff designee
shall give guidance to the operator during the preapplication staff
conference whether an application for a minor modification is advisable.
The application for minor modification shall contain a complete, detailed
and accurate description of the proposed minor modification(s) of the
operation, physical layout or license provisions and a scale drawing showing
any proposed physical modification(s) in layout, any information required to
update or correct any changes or inaccuracies or incomplete statements in
the information filed with the most recent application on the basis of which
the Village Board approved an adult-oriented use license so that all of the
information filed with the Village is accurate and complete as of the date of
the application, together with the certification by the operator that all such
information is accurate and complete as of the date of the application, and
any other information reasonably required by the Director or the Director's
staff designee to determine whether any proposed modification is a minor
modification. Any application for a minor modification of an adult-oriented
use license which the Director of the Community Development Department
or the Director's staff designee declines or fails to issue in writing within
10 business days after the filing of the application shall be deemed to be
denied. If the operator still desires to effect the proposed modification(s) in
the license, the operator shall file an application for an amended license.
§ 108-14. Suspension, adjustment or termination of license.
A. Upon receipt of information providing a reasonable basis to believe that
a serious violation of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this
chapter has occurred (for purposes of this section, "serious violation"
shall include any violation which involves criminal activity, involves the
presence of an individual of less than 18 years of age inside the
physically separate defined area of a building within which an adultoriented
use is located, or is of a type reasonably likely to result in
harmful secondary effects in the surrounding area) or that a pattern of
§ 108-12 ADULT-ORIENTED USES AND § 108-14
108:95
violations of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this chapter
has occurred which reasonably suggests intentional violation by the
operator or a lack of concern about compliance on the part of the
operator or that materially false, misleading or incomplete information
was provided by the operator in or with an adult-oriented use
application; the Village Board may schedule a hearing to determine
whether such violations occurred (unless a court has already made such
determination), whether the operator committed or was responsible
for such violation(s), and whether adjustments in the operation,
supervision, layout or other aspects of the licensed adult-oriented
use(s) or establishment are required, or whether adjustments in the
adult-oriented use license provisions are required, to prevent similar
violations in the future, and with respect to materially false, misleading
or incomplete information provided in or with a license application,
what the accurate and complete information is and whether, how and
to what extent any such false, misleading or incomplete information
affected the Village Board's decision to approve the license application
and whether the license should be adjusted or terminated in light of
such information.
B. The Village Board shall cause a written notice of any such hearing to be
served upon the operator or upon the individual apparently in charge of
the adult-oriented use or establishment in the manner of serving a
summons under §§ 801.10 and 801.11(1), Wis. Stats., not less than 10
days before the date of the hearing. The notice shall specify the alleged
violation(s), state the reason for the hearing, and state the date, time
and place of the hearing.
C. If the Village Board finds that adjustments in the adult-oriented use
license provisions are required to ensure that further similar violations
are prevented, or in light of complete and accurate information, it may
impose such additional or further requirements or conditions on the
license as are reasonably designed to prevent further similar violations
or to deal with the situation presented by complete and accurate
information, and may suspend such license for a reasonable period of
time while such adjustments are being made and while related
requirements or conditions are being implemented or satisfied. If the
Village Board finds that the operator has intentionally committed,
authorized, approved or knowingly acquiesced in a serious violation of
the provisions of this chapter or of a license issued pursuant to this
chapter, or if a felony has been committed at the adult-oriented use or
establishment for which the operator is responsible pursuant to
§ 108-17AA of this chapter, or if the Village Board finds, based on a
substantial pattern of violations of this chapter or of a license issued
pursuant to this chapter committed by the operator or for which the
operator is responsible pursuant to § 108-17AA of this chapter, that a
reasonable probability exists that violations will continue, it may
terminate the license. If the Village Board finds, in a situation where the
operator provided materially inaccurate, misleading or incomplete
information in or with a license application, that it would not grant an
§ 108-14 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 108-14

§ 108-15. Appeal.
At the option of the operator, any denial by the Village Board of an initial
adult-oriented use license application or of an application to renew or
amend such a license, or any adjustment, suspension or termination of such
a license by the Village Board, or the imposition of any requirement or
condition by the Village Board, or any determination by the Community
Development Department that a condition of approval has not been
satisfied, may be appealed by the operator to the Village Zoning Board of
Appeals in accordance with the procedure and with the effect set out in
Chapter 18, Article V, Zoning Board of Appeals, but if the operator wishes
to challenge any such denial, condition or determination directly in court,
the Village Board shall waive any defense based on the operator's failure
to exhaust administrative remedies. Any denial by the Village Clerk of an
adult-oriented use work permit may similarly be appealed by the applicant
to the Village Zoning Board of Appeals, but if the applicant wishes to
challenge such denial directly in court, the Village shall waive any defense
based on the applicant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
§ 108-16. Inspection.

to be open to any customers or members of the public shall be subject
to inspection by Village inspectors or police officers at any time such use

adult-oriented use license based on the current information (or lack
thereof) that it has, or if the license it would grant would have different
provisions in light of such information or the lack thereof, it may
terminate or adjust the license, and may suspend the license until
satisfactory information is provided and/or for a reasonable period
of time while such adjustments are being made and while related
requirements or conditions are being implemented or satisfied.
D. The operator may be represented by legal counsel at such a hearing
and may make legal arguments, present evidence and call, examine and
cross-examine witnesses. The proceedings shall be recorded by a
recording device or stenographer. Exhibits shall be marked and

terminate a license. If a license is terminated pursuant to this § 108-14,
the operator shall not file an application for a new license within one
year after the date of termination.
E. The procedures of this § 108-14 shall be in addition to any other

hearing before the Village Board or does not request permission to
remove the dog in accordance with § 119-2E(7) of this chapter, the

by the Police Chief or by the Village Board.

adoption of this chapter shall immediately be impounded by the Police
Department. The owner or keeper of the vicious animal shall have 10 days

days, if the owner or keeper does not consent to the dog being humanely
destroyed or does not make arrangements for the dog to be removed from

the owner.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 132-1. Authority.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to authority of §§ 66.0415 and 61.34(1),
Wis. Stats.
§ 132-2. Findings.
The Village Board finds that while rock quarries and other operations
utilizing blasting produce socially beneficial products and results, such
operations, when conducted in a rapidly developing and urbanizing
community such as the Village and its environs, can constitute offensive
industry, produce nuisance conditions, adversely affect the public health,
safety, prosperity and general welfare, and otherwise result in a
deterioration of the quality of life and aesthetically pleasing surroundings
that are important to the continued growth, development and prosperity of
the Village, unless such operations are rigorously regulated and controlled.
In addition to the obvious safety hazards associated with blasting and the
potential physical injury and damage that can result from flyrock, ground
vibration, airblast, noise and dust produced by blasting operations, such
operations can also result in unreasonable annoyance and serious indirect
impacts on neighboring properties and the community as a whole, such as
diminution of property values, resultant property tax loss and the shifting of
development patterns so as to be at odds with long-range land use planning.
If not prevented or controlled, such adverse effects of blasting operations
can far outweigh the beneficial aspects of such operations.
§ 132-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and control all blasting operations
and related activities within the Village and within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction area identified in § 132-6, except as is specifically provided in
§ 132-7.
§ 132-4. Greater restrictions to control.
It is not intended that this chapter will repeal any preexisting ordinance
provisions affecting blasting operations, but whenever this chapter imposes
greater or more stringent requirements or restrictions on blasting
operations than do preexisting ordinances' provisions, the provisions of
this chapter shall control. Whenever this chapter imposes greater or more
stringent requirements or restrictions on blasting operations than does Ch.
COMM 7 ("Explosive Materials"), Wis. Adm. Code, the provisions of this
chapter shall control.
§ 132-5. Interpretation.
The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Village.
§ 132-1 BLASTING REGULATIONS AND LICENSING § 132-5

Headings in this chapter are provided only for convenience and ease of
reference. They are not intended to be referred to for the purpose of
interpreting the provisions of this chapter. Words or phrases that are
defined in § 132-7 shall have the meaning stated in the definitions.
Undefined words or phrases shall have their common, ordinary meaning
unless a particular meaning is clearly suggested by the context in which

the proposed controlled blasting site area, and to the last known address of
all owners of real property located within 300 feet of the boundaries of the
blasting site. This requirement of actual notice to persons other than the
operator and the owner(s) of the proposed controlled blasting site area is
precatory, and the failure to mail or receive such notice shall not invalidate
any action taken by the Village Board. At the hearing, the Village Board
shall hear and receive information or recommendations presented by the
Village Plan Commission, staff, and consultants, information presented by
the applicant or the applicant's authorized agents and consultants, and
information presented by members of the public. If the Village Board
determines that additional time or information is required, the public
hearing may be adjourned or continued from time to time at the direction
of the Board. The applicant shall be given an opportunity to respond to any
adverse information or recommendations.
§ 132-14. Action on application.
After the hearing, the Village Board shall either grant or deny the license
application on the basis of express findings and conclusions. The Village
Board may condition any permit granted upon compliance with specified
operational requirements, including without limitation the minimum
requirements of this chapter, except as such requirements may be
appropriately varied by the Board under § 132-21, and the requirements
of all other applicable federal, state, and local statutes, rules, regulations,
ordinances and permits relating to blasting. The Board may impose
requirements which are in addition to or more stringent than the minimum
requirements of this chapter and shall consider the imposition of such
requirements if the controlled blasting site area or any part thereof is
within, adjacent to or less than 300 feet from a residential zoning district.
In granting a permit, the Board shall specify all aspects of the proposed
blasting plan which are not approved. No application shall be granted
unless the Board first finds that the approved operation, as conditioned,
will result in no significant loss, harm or damage to neighboring property
owners, to the Village, or to the public health, safety or welfare, nor serious
risk of any such loss, harm or damage. In deciding upon an application
regarding a blasting operation that preexisted the effective date of this
chapter and was active and actual on the effective date of this chapter, the
Village Board shall take into account the nature, extent, circumstances and
past performance of the operation and shall modify the requirements of this
chapter to the extent necessary to ensure that the license requirements are
reasonable under the particular circumstances.
§ 132-15. Term.
Licenses shall be granted by the Village Board for a maximum term of two
years for ongoing blasting operations or operations that will be conducted
for a period of more than 15 days or will be recurring from time to time in
essentially the same location. Licenses may thereafter be renewed by the
Board for successive terms of not more than two years each. Temporary
licenses may be granted by the Village Board for a maximum term of 15
§ 132-13 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 132-15
132:142
days, which may be extended in writing, upon good cause shown, by the
Village Administrator for a period not to exceed seven days. Any license
issued pursuant to this chapter shall automatically terminate upon the
abandonment of the blasting operation.
§ 132-16. Renewal.
Applications for the renewal of a license shall be filed with the Village
Clerk not later than 45 days prior to the expiration date. Applications
for the extension of a temporary license shall be filed with the Village
Clerk prior to the expiration of the temporary license. Any information
or materials required for an initial license application shall be supplied
with the application for the renewal to the extent that such information or
materials were not supplied with the previous application or to the extent
that the previously supplied information or materials are out of date or no
longer accurate and complete. The applicant for a renewal license shall
certify that any previously submitted information or materials that is not
updated or resubmitted continues to be accurate and complete. Such an
application shall be processed in the same manner as an initial permit
application. In the event that a timely renewal application is not decided
by the expiration date of the license, the license shall be deemed to be
extended to the date of the Board's decision.
§ 132-17. Amendment.
In the event that the operator desires to make any substantial modification
in the licensed blasting operation, the operator shall file with the Village
Clerk an application for an amendment of the license, together with the
appropriate fee. Such application shall describe in detail the proposed
modification; explain the effects of the proposed modification; supplement
and update the information and materials submitted with the prior
application; and make the certification required for renewal applications.
Such an application shall be processed in the same manner as an initial
license application.
§ 132-18. Security.
As a condition of any blasting operation license issued pursuant to this
chapter, the Village Board shall require, and the operator shall deposit with
the Village prior to the issuance of the license, an irrevocable letter of
credit, cash, a bond or other security in an amount adequate to secure
the obligation of the operator to perform conditions imposed by the Village
Board, when compliance cannot reasonably be assured by the usual
enforcement procedures or when the Village may reasonably be exposed
to substantial cost or liability in the event of noncompliance. Any security
instrument shall be in a form satisfactory to the Board or its designees and
shall be issued by a person satisfactory to the Board or its designees, but the
Board's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any cash deposited
with the Village shall be deposited in a segregated interest-bearing account
and shall be used only for the purposes specified in this section. Any
§ 132-15 BLASTING REGULATIONS AND LICENSING § 132-18
132:143
security shall be promptly released or returned to the operator, with any
accrued interest, upon the termination of the blasting operation, less any
costs incurred by the Village. The termination, expiration, or release of
a security instrument or security deposit, in the absence of a renewal or
replacement thereof or the making of other arrangements satisfactory to
the Village Board, shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the
operator's license.
§ 132-19. Transfer.
Licenses issued under this chapter may be transferred only with the prior
written approval of the Village Board. Such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, but the Board shall not approve any transfer in the
absence of satisfactory arrangements regarding security and the prompt
correction of any prior failure to comply with license requirements, and
satisfactory assurances of future compliance.
§ 132-20. Suspension, denial of renewal or revocation of license.
The Village Board, after notice to the operator and a hearing, may suspend
a license if it finds that the operator is guilty of a pattern of repeated
violations after similar violations have been brought to the attention of
the operator, or of violations involving a serious risk of personal injury,
substantial property damage or substantial harm to the public health, safety
or welfare, or for the reasons set out in § 132-18 of this chapter, and may
deny renewal of a license or revoke a license if it finds that the operator is
guilty of a pattern of repeated violations involving a serious risk of personal
injury, substantial property damage or substantial harm to the public health,
safety or welfare.
§ 132-21. Variances.
A. The Village Board may grant variances from the literal requirements of
this chapter, when it is not otherwise expressly authorized to modify
requirements, after publication of a Class 1 notice and a public hearing,
if it finds that:
(1) Because of special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
requirements of this chapter will result in practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardship;
(2) Granting a variance will not result in any significant loss, harm or
damage to neighboring property owners or to the Village; and
(3) The spirit of this chapter will be observed by the variance, the
public health, safety and welfare will be secured and substantial
justice will be done.
B. Specific conditions may be imposed by the Board upon the grant of any
variance.

poles policy for aesthetic purposes shall be considered. Where existing
utility service for telephone and electrical service is underground, cable
lines shall also be underground in that area.
B. The Village shall require all developers of future subdivisions, when
making provisions for or restrictions of utilities in the subdivision plat,
to include cable television services. It is intended by this subsection to
include cable television services in the same class as public utilities.
The fact that cable television services are classed as public utilities
under this chapter shall not prevent any owner of any residential,
commercial, industrial or other structure from refusing to approve or
permit the grantee from installing any wires, antennas or equipment of
any type or from physically occupying such owner's property in any
fashion, even if cable service is requested by such owner's tenant or
tenants.
C. The right to use and occupy such streets, as set forth above, shall not be
exclusive and the Village reserves the right to grant a similar use of
such streets to any person at any time during the period of this
franchise.

(1) Interference. All transmissions and distribution structures, lines
and equipment erected by the grantee within the Village shall be so
located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of
streets, alleys and other public ways and places and to cause
minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience
of property owners who join any of the streets, alleys or other
public ways and places. Cables, wires and other equipment in
connection with the system shall only be installed and operated on
or under the public right-of-way, upon poles or in underground
conduit and equipment of the existing utilities within the Village,
and their successors or assigns, where conduits exist and space in
installed conduits is available. Installation of any additional poles,
conduit or other equipment for the installation of cables, wires or
§ 143-2 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 143-3
143:156
other overhead equipment and underground equipment in the
public rights-of-way in connection with the system shall be subject
to authorization of the Village Board or its designated
representative. In reaching a decision as to such additional poles
or equipment, the suggestions, if any, of the utility companies
servicing or planning to service such area may be considered by
the Village Board or its designated representative. Underground
installation shall always be preferred.
(2) Restoration. In case of disturbance of any street, sidewalk, alley,
public way or paved area, the grantee shall, at its own cost and
expense and in a manner approved by the Village Superintendent
of Streets or other appropriate office, replace and restore such
street, sidewalk, alley, public way or paved area in as good a
condition as before the work involved in such disturbance was
done. The grantee will also pay all cost incurred by the Village in
regards to the regulation of the cable television system, if any.
(3) Removal. The grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support,
temporarily or permanently disconnect, relocate in the same public
right-of-way, or remove from a public right-of-way, any property

of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway and
street construction, change or establishment of street grade,
installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines and tracts,
or any other type of structure or improvements by governmental
agencies when acting in a governmental capacity. The Village shall
provide the grantee notice of its intention to make changes which
might otherwise cause grantee expense, pursuant to this section,
and the grantee shall have an opportunity to comment.
(4) Poles or other fixtures. Any poles or other fixtures placed in any
public way by the licensee shall be placed in such manner as not to
interfere with the usual travel on such public way.
(5) Moving buildings. The grantee shall, on the request of any person
holding a building moving permit issued by the Village, temporarily
raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The
expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires
shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee
shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The
grantee shall be given not less than three working days' advance
notice to arrange for such temporary changes.

overhanging upon any streets, alleys, sidewalks and public ways
and places of the Village so as to prevent the branches of such trees

grantee.

sections of the Village where the cables, wires or other like
facilities of public utilities are placed underground, the grantee
shall place its cables, wires or other like facilities underground to
the maximum extent that existing technology reasonably permits
the grantee to do so.

the grantee without prior approval of the Village Board with
regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect.

the grantee shall be a vested interest, and such poles or
structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its
own expense wherever the Village Board determines that the
public convenience would be enhanced thereby.
(b) Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing
for use in serving the Village are available for use by the
grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the
Village Board may require the grantee to use such poles and
structures if it determines that public convenience would be
enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the
grantee are just and reasonable.
(c) Where the Village or a public utility service desires to make
use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the
grantee, but agreement with the grantee cannot be reached,
the Village Board may require the grantee to permit such use
for such consideration and upon such terms as the Board shall
determine to be just and reasonable, if the Board determines
that the use would enhance the public convenience and would
not unduly interfere with the grantee's operations.
B. Compliance. All installations by the grantee of cables and incidental
equipment shall comply in all respects with all laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, the state
or any agency or department thereof, and of the Village or any agency
or department thereof, now or hereafter in effect.
C. Condition of equipment. The grantee shall provide and maintain its
equipment in such condition and of such quality so that none of its
service will adversely affect radio and television reception.

that standard color signals shall be transmitted with reasonable and
acceptable fidelity to all subscribers. When the signals the grantee
distributes are received in color, they shall be distributed in color where

shall preclude grantee from advertising or selling any merchandise or
services.
F. Inspections. The grantee shall submit to inspections by duly authorized
personnel of the Village and shall make available to such inspectors or
duly authorized personnel its facilities and equipment wherever
situated. The Village reserves the right to enact reasonable regulations
regarding the installation and maintenance of the facilities of the
grantee.

Streets and Sidewalks, of this Code, specifically Articles II and III and
§§ 305-2, 305-3 and 305-7.

written consent of the Village Board and approved only if the

advisable, and detailing the expected changes in the operation of the
system. Information as to the legal, character, financial capability,
technical and other qualifications of the party or parties to whom the
franchise is to be transferred, assigned or sold, or by whom the same is
to be operated, shall also be provided. This section shall apply to any
transfer, assignment or sale of greater than 25% of the ownership,
operation or management of the franchise. The Village Board shall not
withhold approval or consent regarding the transfer, assignment or
sale, without cause and unless it is shown that the operation or
management of the system will be affected to the detriment of the
public by approving such transfer, assignment or sale. The provisions

respect to any mortgages or the remedies therein.
§ 143-3 CABLE TELEVISION § 143-6
143:159
§ 143-7. Responsibilities upon termination or expiration.
Should a grantee's franchise be terminated or expire and there is no judicial
or administrative review of the termination or expiration taking place, the
grantee shall begin removal within 90 days of termination or expiration all
property owned by him and placed on a public right-of-way unless permitted

to a purchaser.
§ 143-8. Completion of construction and extension of system.
A. The term of a franchise shall be for a period of 15 years and shall be in
full force and effect for such term, subject to the provisions of this
chapter.
B. Every two years during the term of a franchise, during the month of
January, at a regular or special Village Board meeting, the Village and
the grantee, at either party's option, may meet to discuss application of
new technologies, system performances, services provided,
programming offered, customer complaints and judicial and FCC
rulings affecting the operation of the system. The parties shall compare
the services offered by a grantee to those of other stand-alone systems
in similar market situations and, if then appropriate, the parties may
renegotiate any of the above provisions, provided that such changes do
not adversely affect economic viability of the franchise or adversely
affect programming and maintenance services to the subscribers.
C. At the 12th year of the franchise, or if mutually agreed by the Village
and a grantee during one of the review and renegotiations described in
Subsection B above, the Village and the grantee shall consider
extension of a franchise for 15 additional years. The purpose of this
provision is to allow for maximum flexibility in the financial planning on
the part of a grantee and for the Village in anticipating future services.
It is further the purpose of this provision to encourage the Village to
examine a grantee's performance and to plan for the future in providing
cable television service as well as-to reward the satisfactory
performance of a grantee. The Village may, at any time, reward a

such increase. In no event shall the rates exceed those charged to residents
of the City of Kenosha.
B. The Village may, in its discretion, extend the time for grantee, acting in
good faith, to perform any act required hereunder. The time for
performance shall be extended or excused, as the case may be, for any
period during which grantee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Village Board that grantee is being subjected to delay or interruption
due to any of the following circumstances, if reasonably beyond his
control:
(1) Necessary utilities rearrangements or pole change-outs.

extensions.
D. The grantee shall be allowed to furnish service from the headend to
other areas in the Village; provided, however, that the construction or
provision of services to areas other than the Village does not prohibit,
impede or delay the substantial completion date of the system in the
Village. If any such program service provided to such areas shall be in
any manner superior to the program service provided within the
Village, then such program service shall be provided to the Village.
A. The rates and charges for television and radio signals distributed
hereunder shall be fair and reasonable and no higher than necessary to
meet a fair return on the original cost, less depreciation, of the

this franchise or otherwise, the Village reserves the right to terminate
and cancel this franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee
hereunder if the grantee:
(1) Violates any provision of this franchise or any rule, order or
determination of the Village or Village Board made pursuant to this

§ 148-1. Findings
A. After notice and hearing, the grantee may be subject to a forfeiture, as
provided in Chapter 1, § 1-4, of this Code, if such grantee fails to
provide the service specified in this chapter or any applicable
government regulation. The grantee is not responsible for failure to
provide adequate service which is caused by acts of God, strikes,
governmental or military action or other conditions beyond its control.
B. Upon interruption of service, except for acts of God, strikes,
governmental or military action, or with express prior permission of the
Village, any subscriber whose service is interrupted for more than 48
consecutive hours shall be entitled to a rebate of the subscriber's
monthly bill prorated on a daily basis for each twenty-four-hour period
of continuously interrupted service.
A. The management of stormwater and other surface water discharges
within and beyond Village borders is a matter that affects the public
health, safety and welfare of the Village, its citizens and businesses and
others in the surrounding area. The development of land increases
impervious surfaces and results in increased stormwater runoff. Failure
to effectively manage this increased stormwater runoff affects the
sanitary sewer utility operations of the Village by, among other things,
increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow in the sanitary sewer.
In addition, surface water runoff may create erosion of lands, threaten
businesses and residences with water damage and create
sedimentation and other environmental damage in the Village.
B. The federal Water Pollution Control Act also known as the "Clean Water
Act," requires communities to manage stormwater in accordance with
federal and state regulations.
C. The cost of operating and maintaining a utility to manage stormwater,
ensuring regulatory compliance, and financing necessary plans,

§ 148-5. Rates and charges.
A. By this chapter, the Village Board is establishing the basis for the rates
that will be used to calculate and impose a charge upon each parcel
within the Village for services and facilities provided by the Clean Water
Utility consistent with this chapter, with the exception of exemptions
including agricultural land, public right-of-way, and as prescribed by
state law. Charges imposed under this chapter are in addition to
assessments imposed under Chapter 148 of the Village of Pleasant
Prairie Municipal Code.
B. The amount of each charge to be imposed shall be made by resolution.
All rates established pursuant to this chapter will be fair and
reasonable. The current rates will be on file with the Village Clerk.
C. Charges shall be imposed to recover all or a portion of the costs for the
Clean Water Utility. Such charges shall include the following
components:
(1) Base charge. The base charge shall be imposed on all property in
the Village with the exception of exemptions including agricultural
land, public right-of-way, and as prescribed by state law. The base
charge is designed to reflect the fact that all properties benefit
from Clean Water Utility activities of the Village and that all
properties contribute in some way to the clean water discharge
§ 148-4 CABLE TELEVISION § 148-5
143:171
§ 148-6. Credits.
that must be managed by the Village. The base charge will be
designed to collect the administrative costs of the Clean Water
Utility operations.
(2) Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) charge. The ERU charge shall be
assessed for each property or parcel in the Village based upon the
ratio of calculated runoff from the property as set forth in § 148-7 to
the standard ERU.
(3) Project evaluation fee. A charge shall be imposed on a property that
is converted from undeveloped to developed or when a property is
part of a lot split. The fee will be established by resolution.
D. The Village Board may make such other classifications in accordance
with § 148-6 as will be likely to provide reasonable and fair distribution
of the costs of the Clean Water Utility.
E. Exemptions. The following areas of property shall be exempt from
paying charges under this section:
(1) Agricultural land, but not farmstead home sites.
(2) Wetlands, ponds and lakes.
(3) Undeveloped parcels within the Floodplain Overlay District
(§ 420-131) and which are zoned C-1, as defined in § 420-128.
[Added 9-16-2013 by Ord. No. 13-42]
(4) Undeveloped parcels within the Floodplain Overlay District
(§ 420-131) and which are zoned PR-2, as defined in § 420-127.1.
[Added 9-16-2013 by Ord. No. 13-42]
A. The Village Administrator or Village Engineer may provide credits
against the ERU, but not the base charge. Such adjustments of
stormwater fees shall not be made retroactively.
B. To be entitled to consideration for a credit, the property owner shall file
an application, together with a review fee, with the Village Engineer
that is supported by documentation from a professional engineer
registered in the State of Wisconsin and demonstrates the conditions of
this section have been met. The application is subject to review and
approval of the Village Engineer. If the Village Engineer needs
additional engineering expertise to complete his review, the Village
Engineer can deny the application unless the property owner agrees to
pay for the necessary engineering services.
C. Credits may be provided under the following circumstances:
(1) A nonresidential property owner may seek a credit on the ERU
charge where he or she has installed and maintained facilities that
result in the retention and treatment of stormwater on site that
§ 148-5 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 148-6
143:172
§ 148-7. Calculation of ERU charges.
exceeds a suspended solids removal level established by the Village
Engineer. Credits to a maximum of 30% of the ERU charge will be
based on the percent of suspended solids removed over the limits
established by the Village Engineer.
D. The Administrator may revoke the credit if the basis for the credit has
materially changed. The Administrator shall provide at least 30 days'
advance written notice of any proposed revocation.
E. A denial or revocation of any credit may be reviewed pursuant to
§§ 148-10 and 148-11.
A. Basis for ERU charge. The Village shall calculate the actual runoff value
for each property within the Village except for those portions of
property which are exempt. The ERU charge shall be the multiple of the
actual runoff value for each property compared to the standard ERU
value.
B. Calculation of actual runoff value.
(1) For each property or parcel within the Village, the Village shall
calculate the ratio of impervious area to total property size based
upon data from the Village's Geographic Information System (GIS),
or where such data is not available or is out of date, the Village
Engineer may calculate the ratio from other reliable data. In the
case where a property or parcel does not have any impervious area,
the calculations shall be performed without an impervious area.
(a) For residential property, impervious area is calculated as the
actual area of principal structures and out buildings and an
average value of 750 square feet for driveways, sidewalks and
other impervious areas.
(b) For nonresidential property, impervious area is calculated as
the actual area of all impervious surfaces.
(2) The Village shall calculate a runoff curve (CN) value for each
property by applying the ratio of impervious area to total lot size to
the calculated runoff curve for the Village. For composite CN
values, the most recent aerial photo or as determined from other
reliable and confirmable information shall be used. Ponds, lakes,
agricultural and wetlands will not be included in the calculations of
a composite CN value. Woods, brush and meadows will use the
lowest CN value as published in the TR55 publication.
(3) The Village shall calculate the actual runoff value for each property
applying the CN value and a two-inch rain event to the TR-55 runoff
model.
C. Calculation of ERU value.
§ 148-6 CABLE TELEVISION § 148-7
143:173
§ 148-8. New construction.
§ 148-9. Billing and penalties.
§ 148-10. Reconsideration.
(1) The standard ERU value is based upon the runoff value from an
average residential parcel of 15,100 square feet with an average
impervious area of 18.21%.
(2) The charge is the ERU multiple of the calculated runoff value under
Subsection B above to the average runoff value under Subsection
C(1) above.
A. The property owner shall be responsible for submitting a clean water
utility service application at the time a building permit is issued or a
site plan review is conducted. The application shall be made on a form
prescribed by the Village and provided with each application for a
building permit or application for site plan review. Failure to submit
such clean water utility service application or providing false
information on such form shall be a violation of this chapter.
B. A person violating Subsection A above shall, upon conviction, pay a
forfeiture not to exceed $500 for each offense, in addition to the costs of
prosecution which are allowed by law. Each day during which a
violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
A. Clean Water Utility charges will be billed monthly, with said charges to
appear on the bill issued for municipal water, sanitary sewer and solid
waste service. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude
the Clean Water Utility from billing on a quarterly or annual basis for
properties with minimum charges.
B. The bills for Clean Water Utility charges shall be mailed to the
designated utility bill recipient, but this mailing shall not relieve the
owner of the property from liability for rental property in the event
payment is not made as required in this chapter. The owner of any
property served which is occupied by tenants shall have the right to
examine collection records of the Village for the purpose of determining
whether such charges have been paid for such tenants, provided that
such examination shall be made at the office at which the records are
kept and during the hours that such office is open for business.
C. If Clean Water Utility charges remain unpaid after a period of 30 days
from the date of the utility billing, such bill shall be determined
delinquent. The Village may collect delinquent charges under
§§ 66.0821(4) and 66.0809(3), Wis. Stats.
D. All delinquent charges shall be subject to a penalty of 1% per month in
addition to all other charges, including prior penalties or interest that
exist when the delinquent charge is extended upon the tax roll.

143:174
§ 148-11. Appeals.
A. The Clean Water Utility charge, a determination of ERUs or ERU credits
may be reconsidered by filing a written request for reconsideration with
the Village Clerk prior to the utility charge due date if not paid, or

The Administrator shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of any

or capability of the contractor or subcontractor, or its sensitivity to the
necessity of performing work on public improvement projects in such a
way as to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public and to
minimize any disturbance, inconvenience or annoyance to the public, which

qualification are not reasonable. The Village Board may reverse, affirm or
modify the determination of the Administrator, and the Board's decision
shall be final. The Village Board shall promptly notify the appellant of its
findings in writing.

including any additional, updated or supplemental information, filed by
a person pursuant to this chapter shall be confidential and shall not be
disclosed except upon the written order of such person, or for necessary use
by the Administrator or the Village Board in qualifying such person, or in

standard relate to sprinkler installations and their required water
supplies only. They are not intended to be a general classification of
occupancy hazards.
(a) Light-hazard occupancies: occupancies or portions of other
occupancies where the quantity and/or combustibility of
contents is low and fires with relatively low rates of heat
release are expected.
(b) Ordinary-hazard occupancies:
[1] Group 1: occupancies or portions of other occupancies
where combustibility is low, quantity of combustibles is
moderate, stockpiles of combustibles do not exceed eight
feet in height, and fires with moderate rates of heat
release are expected.

that new development bears an appropriate share of the cost of capital
expenditures necessary to provide public facilities within the Village and its
service areas.

Village is responsible for and will meet, through the use of general Village
revenues, all capital improvement needs associated with existing
development. Only needs created by new development will be met by impact
fees. Impact fees shall be spent on new or enlarged capital facilities
improvements required by new developments that pay the fees.
§ 181-4. Authority.
Authority for this chapter is provided by Wis. Stats. § 66.0617. The
provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of the
Village to adopt any ordinance or fee pursuant to any other source of local
authority or to utilize any other methods or powers otherwise available
for accomplishing the purposes set forth herein, either in lieu of or in
conjunction with this chapter.
§ 181-5. Applicability; effective date.
This chapter shall be uniformly applicable to all new development that
occurs within the Village. The effective date of this chapter shall be August
1, 2005. Any building permit application filed on or after August 1, 2005,
will be liable for impact fees imposed under this chapter.

As used in this chapter, the following words and terms shall have the
following meanings, unless the context indicates another meaning is clearly
intended:
BUILDING PERMIT  The permit required for new construction and
additions pursuant to Pleasant Prairie Municipal Code. However, the term

existing structure or rebuilding a damaged or destroyed structure, provided
there is no increase in the number of dwelling units resulting therefrom.
CAPITAL COSTS  The capital costs to construct, expand or improve public
facilities, including the cost of land, and including legal, engineering and
design costs to construct, expand or improve public facilities, except that
not more than 10% of capital costs may consist of legal, engineering and
design costs.
DEVELOPMENT  The construction or modification of improvements to
real property that requires issuance of a building permit and either creates
additional residential dwelling units within the Village or its service areas
or that result in new nonresidential uses, either of which create a need for
new, expanded or improved public facilities within the Village or its service
areas.
IMPACT FEE  Any charge, fee or assessment levied pursuant to this
chapter to be collected at the time of issuance of a building permit.
NEEDS ASSESSMENT  The needs assessment prepared by Virchow,

bathroom(s), kitchen(s) and/or living area for the purpose of providing
a separate and distinct living space, or as otherwise may reasonably be
designated as separate by the Village. (Examples: a single-family home

new development if that development promotes other policies
established by the Village Board from time to time, including, but
not limited to, the provision of affordable housing. However, no
amount of the impact fee for which the waiver or reduction is
provided may be shifted to any other portion of the development in
which the waiver or reduction has been granted, nor may it be
shifted to any other land development in the political subdivision.

estimated valuation shall be value at the time of application for a
building permit as determined by the Village Assessor, using the
Villages current copy of the Marshall & Swift Commercial
Estimator cost estimation software. The estimated value shall be
determined by the Village Assessor based on the final building
plans and specifications.
B. Payment due. The total impact fee assessment for residential and
nonresidential developments shall become due and payable in full
within 14 days of the issuance of a building permit.
C. Annual review. The Village may annually review the impact fee and
make such modifications as are deemed necessary as a result of:
development occurring in the prior year; capital improvements actually
constructed; changing facility needs; inflation; revised cost estimates
for capital improvements; changes in the availability of other funding
sources applicable to public facility projects; and such other factors as
may be relevant.
D. Segregated account. Upon receipt of impact fees, the funds shall be
placed into a separate impact fee account. At the discretion of the

and distinct development or capital improvements projects. All such
accounts shall be interest-bearing accounts and be held in a bank
authorized to receive deposits of Village funds. Interest earned shall be

capital costs for which they were imposed shall be refunded on a
prorated proportional basis as determined by the Village Board, to the
current record owner(s) of property on which the impact fee was
originally imposed. The seven-year time limit for using impact fees may
be extended for three years if the Village adopts a resolution stating
that due to extenuating circumstances a hardship in meeting the sevenyear
limit exists and it needs an additional three years to use the impact
fees collected. [Amended 7-5-2005 by Ord. No. 32]
B. Refund petition. The applicable owner(s) of record may apply for a
refund of all or part of such fee as follows:

(3) Within one month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the
Village Administrator or his or her duly designated agent must
provide the petitioner, in writing, with a decision on the refund
request, including the reasons for the decision. If a refund is due to
the petitioner, the Village Administrator or his or her duly
designated agent shall request that a refund payment be made to
petitioner.
(4) Petitioner may appeal the determination of the Village
Administrator to the Village Board.
A. The applicant seeking appeal must file a written notice of appeal with
the Village Board within thirty (30) days following either: the denial of

capital improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or
other regulations of the Village, which shall be operative and remain in full
force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development.
§ 181-13. Impact fee as additional and supplemental requirement.
The impact fee is additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of,
any other requirements imposed by the Village on the development of land
or the issuance of building permits. It is intended to be consistent with and
to further the objectives and policies of the Master Plan or Comprehensive
Plan, the capital improvements plan and other Village policies, ordinances
and resolutions by which the Village seeks to ensure the provision of public
facilities in conjunction with the development of land. In no event shall a
property owner be obligated to pay for capital improvements in an amount
in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this chapter; provided,
however, that a property owner may be required to pay, pursuant to Village
ordinances, regulations or policies, for other capital improvements in
addition to the impact fee for capital improvements as specified in this
section.

agreement for a rental term of two months or more, rental
payments shall, at the option of the tenant, be payable in equal
monthly installments.
(3) The operator shall, at the time the rental agreement is entered into,
and throughout the term of the rental agreement, make available to
the tenant the name, address, and telephone number of a person

181:292
mobile home community, unless such restrictions are required by
law or are uniformly applied manufactured/mobile home
community requirements made a condition of the tenant's original
rental agreement. Any such restrictions, however, may not be
instituted during the occupancy of an original tenant under the
same, an amended, a renewed or a new rental agreement. Not

home steps are required by law to be replaced, the community
operator may require that they be made to comply with current

agent named by the operator will give the purchaser an advantage
over others in the rental or continued occupancy of a site.
(3) Discriminate or threaten to discriminate in rental charges or in any
other respect against a tenant for failure of the tenant to purchase
a manufactured/mobile home from the operator or any dealer,
manufacturer, or agent named by the operator.

charges or in any other charges to a tenant who purchase a

seller of a manufactured/mobile home for agreeing to rent a site to
the purchaser of such manufactured/mobile home.
(6) Solicit or receive any payment or other thing of value from any
person upon the representation or understanding that such
consideration will give that person an advantage over others in the
rental or continued occupancy of a site.
§ 221-5 IMPACT FEES § 221-5
181:293
(7) Use a manufactured/mobile home site to display a manufactured/
mobile home offered for sale, or rent a site to a manufactured/
mobile home dealer for purposes other than accommodation of a
manufactured/mobile home occupied as a residence, if the use or
rental of the site results in there being no site in the manufactured/
mobile home community available to a prospective tenant who does
not purchase a manufactured/mobile home from the operator or
renting dealer.
F. Manufactured/mobile home relocation.
(1) No tenant shall be required to relocate a manufactured/mobile
home within a community during the term of the rental agreement,
or to assume the cost of any required relocation under a new or

agreement. This does not apply to a manufactured/mobile home
which has been vacated by the tenant.

by written notice setting forth the reason for such relocation.
Notice shall be given within the time period required under Ch.
704, Wis. Stats., for termination of tenancies.

(1) An operator may not deny a resident the opportunity to enter into
or renew, and may not include, exclude or alter any terms of, a
lease to continue to locate a manufactured/mobile home in the
community solely or in any part on the basis of the age of the
manufactured/mobile home.
(2) An operator may not require the removal of a manufactured/mobile
home from a community solely or in any part on the basis of the age
of the manufactured/mobile home, regardless of whether the

changed or will change.
(3) It shall be considered a prohibited consideration of the age of a
manufactured/mobile home to require a tenant to make alterations,
modifications or improvements to a manufactured/mobile home as
a condition of renewal of a lease or a change in the ownership or

manufactured/mobile home is otherwise in good repair and it is in
conformance with applicable governmental regulations.
(4) It shall be considered a prohibited consideration of the age of a
manufactured/mobile home to require a tenant to make alterations,
modifications or improvements to a manufactured/mobile home
that is older that five years, when the mobile home is otherwise in
good repair and in conformance with applicable governmental
regulations, and the manufactured/mobile home is in compliance
§ 221-5 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 221-5
181:294
with community rules and regulations in effect at the time the
manufactured/mobile home originally entered the community.
H. Prohibited consideration of change in ownership or occupancy of
manufactured/mobile home.
(1) An operator may not require the removal of a manufactured/mobile
home from a community solely or in any part because the

home occupant for any other lawful reason.
(2) It shall be considered a prohibited consideration of a change in
ownership or occupancy of a manufactured/mobile home to require
a tenant to make alterations, modifications or improvements to a
manufactured/mobile home as a condition of permitting a
manufactured/mobile home to remain in a community at the time of
a change in ownership or occupancy, when the manufactured/
mobile home is otherwise in good repair and it is in conformance
with governmental regulations.
I. No interest in real estate; screening permitted. Neither § 710.15(3)(b)
nor § 710-15(4), Wis. Stats., creates or extends any interest in real
estate or prohibits the lawful screening of prospective residents and
manufactured/mobile home occupants by an operator.
J. Changes in rental terms or community rules.
(1) If any change or increase in rent or fees, or any other substantial
change in the terms or conditions of tenancy, is to be made in
connection with the renewal of any rental agreement, a copy of the
proposed new agreement, or amendments to the existing
agreement, shall be furnished to the tenant, in writing, at least 28
days prior to the date on which the proposed new agreement is to
take effect. All changes shall be specifically brought to the tenant's
attention by a separate statement on the proposed rental
agreement or in a separate written document attached to the rental
agreement. The operator or a representative of the operator shall
meet with tenants, or any group of tenants, on the proposed
changes, at their request. Nothing in this section shall be construed
as interfering with the operator's right to terminate any tenancy in
accordance with § 710.15 and Ch. 704, Wis. Stats., and § ATCP

(2) Rules and regulations which substantially affect the rights or duties
of tenants or the operator under§ 710.15, Wis. Stats., or this
chapter may not be created or changed during the term of the
rental agreement. This includes but is not limited to:

utility services provided through the operator's facilities shall be
set forth in the rental agreement under § ATCP 125.03(1)(b).

facilities, if not included in the rent, shall be competitive with retail

additional charge may be assessed for the service by the operator.

water and sewer service and resells the service to the occupants of
the manufactured/mobile home community, the maximum
allowable water and sewer bill to the average user within the
manufactured/mobile home community may not exceed the lesser
of the manufactured/mobile home community's water and sewer
bill, plus 30%, divided by the number of occupied lots within the
community, or the retail rates of the local municipality's water and
sewer operation applied to the average user.
(6) A manufactured/mobile home community operator may establish
water and sewer rates in excess of those set forth in Subsection

manufactured/mobile home by the tenant or an agent of the
tenant's own choosing.

owned or operated by the operator, any manufactured/mobile home
purchased from a tenant who was prohibited from selling the home
directly for placement in the manufactured/mobile home
community.
(4) Refuse to rent a manufactured/mobile home site to the purchaser of
a tenant's manufactured/mobile home except for a reason specified
under § 710.15(5m), Wis. Stats. This section does not prohibit the
screening of prospective tenants by an operator.
(5) Limit a tenant's ability to post, on the tenant's manufactured/
mobile home or on the site on which the manufactured/mobile
home is located, a "for sale" sign or other advertisement

181:298
announcing the tenant's offer to sell the tenant's manufactured/

person, including the operator and any manufactured/mobile home
dealer, who sells or offers to sell a manufactured/mobile home on
site in the manufactured/mobile home community.
(6) This section does not create or extend any interest in real estate or
prohibit the lawful screening of new tenants by the operator.
O. Termination of tenancy.

upon the expiration of a lease, to renew the lease or to enter into a
new rental agreement, the operator shall provide the tenant with
written notice setting forth the reason for such termination or
refusal. Notices of termination shall comply with the requirements
of § 710.15 and Ch. 704, Wis. Stats., as applicable. If the rental

125.03(1) (introduction) and (2), the operator shall comply with the
notice requirements of § 704.17(2), Wis. Stats., when terminating a
tenancy, unless the community operator or tenant proves that other
notice requirements under § 704.17(1) or (3), Wis. Stats., are
applicable.
(2) No operator shall terminate a rental agreement or refuse, upon
expiration of a lease, to renew the lease or to enter into a new
rental agreement for the reason that:
(a) The tenant has reported a violation, by the operator, of this
chapter or any other law to any governmental authority or filed
suit alleging such violation. Any termination, refusal to renew a
lease, or refusal to enter into a new lease shall be presumed to
be retaliatory if committed within six months after the tenant
has reported a violation by the operator of this chapter or any
other law, to any governmental authority or within six months
after the tenant has filed suit alleging such violation. In order
to overcome this presumption that such termination or refusal
is retaliatory, the operator must show by a preponderance of
evidence that such termination was based on good cause.
(b) The tenant is a member of a tenants' union or association.
(c) The operator wishes to make a site available to a person
purchasing a manufactured/mobile home from the operator or
an agent of the operator.

Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit or prevent the
licensing of any manufactured/mobile home community existing on

home communities wish to expand, they shall then be compelled to bring
their additional community area into compliance with the provisions of the
Village's ordinances.
§ 221-7. Inspection and enforcement.
No manufactured/mobile home community license shall be issued until the
Village Clerk has notified the Village Board and the Village Board shall
have inspected each application and the premises on which manufactured/
mobile homes will be located to insure compliance with the regulations,
ordinances and laws applicable thereto. No license will be renewed without
a reinspection of the premises. For the purposes of making inspections and
securing enforcement, such officials or their authorized agents shall have
the right and are hereby empowered to enter on any premises on which a
manufactured/mobile home is located, or about to be located, and to inspect
the same and all accommodations connected therewith at any reasonable
time. Each premises on which a licensed manufactured/mobile home is
located shall have at least one sanitary inspection per year.
(1) Make any false, deceptive, or misleading representation to induce a
manufactured/mobile home sale or site rental or make any
representation inconsistent with or contrary to the written rental
agreement.
(2) Impose any term or condition, any rule or regulation which the
operator knows or reasonably ought to know is in conflict with this
chapter or applicable law.

manufactured/mobile home community or any of its facilities or
assess any separate charge therefor.
(4) Enter a tenant's manufactured/mobile home without the tenant's
permission and reasonable notice to the tenant. This does not
prohibit the operator from entering a tenant's manufactured/
mobile home if the tenant cannot be contacted and the operator
reasonably believes that entry is necessary because of emergency
or to preserve and protect the manufactured/mobile home or
community.
(5) Unreasonably limit a tenant's ability to post, on the tenant's
manufactured/mobile home or on the site on which the
manufactured/mobile home is located, any sign complying with
Village ordinances and which supports any candidate or political
position.

meanings indicated:
COMPRESSION RELEASE ENGINE BRAKING SYSTEM  A device that
modifies the timing on the exhaust valves of a diesel engine in such a
manner that the exhaust valve opens right as the piston reaches the
top of the compression stroke, gathering the energy as the compressed
air is released, causing the release or loss of compressed power in the
compression stroke.
COMPRESSION RELEASE ENGINE BRAKING SYSTEM ZONE  The
area of the Village of Pleasant Prairie where the use of compression
release engine braking systems is permitted is defined follows:
(1) The I-94 frontage roads.
(2) STH 165 between 1-94 and STH 31.
(3) CTH "H" between Bain Station and 116th Street.
(4) STH 31 between Bain Station Road and 128th Street.
(5) 80th Avenue between 95th Street and 116th Street.
(6) 116th Street between STH 31 and CTH "H."
(7) 95th Street between STH 31 and CTH "H."

manufactured by Jacobs Vehicle Systems or its brand name product.
10.0L DISPLACEMENT ENGINE  A diesel engine description used
extensively to describe the engine used in heavy trucks. Federal
transportation regulations require that all vehicles manufactured since
1978 are required to emit sounds less than 80 dBa as they drive by,
measured at a distance of 50 feet from the roadway. 10.0L displacement
engine trucks manufactured after 1978 that have modified or defective
exhaust systems, such as straight or gutted stacks, will emit a sound
louder than 80 dBa when a compression release engine braking system
is engaged.

A. No illuminated sign, yard light, area light, parking lot and service area
light or other illumination shall be permitted or maintained in the
Village without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Building
Inspector. Before the Building Inspector issues a permit, the applicant
shall submit data on fixtures and locations in sufficient detail to fully
determine the nature and extent of the work proposed. The Building
Inspector shall examine the data to determine if the same complies with
the Electrical Code. The Building Inspector may require such further
descriptive detail as he may deem necessary.
B. All lighting and glare-producing processes shall be installed so that
direct rays from a light-emitting element or surface shall be shielded by
suitable skirtings, louvers or recessed housings or locations and by
directing fixtures so that the emitted direct rays are not visible beyond
the property line or a parking lane or alley adjacent to the site.
C. Lighting with low surface brightness prisms having a forty-five-degree
under cutoff may be acceptable in some cases without shielding. Bulb,
strip or tube lighting shall not be acceptable unless fully shielded so
that all direct lighting is retained within the property. The brightness

determining the suitability of any light in those situations where it
complies with the Electrical Code.
E. Existing lighting for yards and buildings shall be inspected by the

Health Officer shall enforce those provisions of this article that come
within the jurisdiction of their offices and they shall make periodic
inspections and inspections upon complaint to ensure that such
provisions are not violated. No action shall be taken under this section
to abate a public nuisance unless the officer has inspected or caused to
be inspected the premises where the nuisance is alleged to exist and
has satisfied himself that a nuisance does in fact exist.
B. Summary abatement. If the inspecting officer determines that a public
nuisance exists within the Village and that there is great and immediate
danger to the public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, the
Chairman may direct the proper officer to cause the same to be abated
and charge the cost thereof to the owner, occupant or person causing,
permitting or maintaining the nuisance, as the case may be.
C. Abatement after notice. If the inspecting officer determines that a
public nuisance exists on private premises but that such nuisance does
not threaten great and immediate danger to the public health, safety,
peace, morals or decency, he shall serve notice on the person causing or
maintaining the nuisance to remove the same within 10 days. If such
nuisance is not removed within 10 days, the proper officer shall cause
the nuisance to be removed as provided in Subsection B.

hereunder shall not use force to obtain access to private property to
abate a public nuisance but shall request permission to enter upon

cost of abating a public nuisance by the Village shall be collected as a debt
from the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the

advanced training in the investigation of crimes against persons and
property, including but not limited to death investigation, fraud and white
collar crime investigation, arson, burglary and sensitive crimes
investigation.
§ 254-11 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 260-2
260:382
MINIMUM STAFFING LEVEL  The minimum number of full-time police
officers, including the Chief of Police, to be employed by the Village, deemed

and investigation of crimes occurring in the community, enforcement of
state laws and local ordinances, arrest of offenders, control of traffic and
enforcement of traffic regulations and provision of certain ancillary services
intended to prevent or reduce the number of crimes.
§ 260-3. Organization of Police Department.
A. The Police Department of the Village shall be comprised of a Chief of
Police and such other full-time police officers, and such part-time police
officers, that the Village Board may from time to time authorize. The
Chief and officers of the Department shall be employees of the Village
and subject to all applicable laws of the State of Wisconsin and Village
ordinances. The Chief of Police and subordinates shall be appointed as
set forth in § 18-31 of the Village Code.

Administration unless such staffing would cause a significant fiscal
hardship on the Village. The Village Board may increase this ratio as the
growth of the Village and other circumstances require, but may not
decrease the number below 1.5 full-time officers per 1,000 residents
except by a vote of majority of the Village Board because the staffing at
that level would cause a significant fiscal hardship on the Village.

Subsection C, approximately 12% of such officers shall be investigative
personnel as defined in § 260-2 of this chapter, unless such staffing

59.03(2)(e) Wis. Stats., unless all of the following conditions are met:
E. Primary law enforcement services shall be provided by the Village
Police Department. This does not preclude the Chief of Police from
entering into agreements with other agencies for the provision of
specialized services, nor does it in any way limit the authority of the
Chief of Police or his or her designee(s) from requesting or providing
mutual assistance.
F. It is the policy of the Village of Pleasant Prairie that the Village Police
Department shall collaborate and cooperate with other law
enforcement agencies insofar as it is practical to do so and does not

duty of the Chief of Police to cause the public peace to be preserved,
and to see that all the laws and ordinances in the Village are enforced.

good conduct of the Department, and shall have the authority to
promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary to accomplish
the good government of the Police Department.

§ 260-3 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 260-5
260:384
Prairie shall have achieved for a minimum of three years prior to the
date of the submission of the response, and shall maintain during the
consideration of the proposal and the life of the contract, a minimum
overall Part - I crime clearance rate of 50% as reported annually by the
Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance, or, in the event such statistic is
no longer reported, a sufficiently similar indicia of reliability reported
by a state entity.
C. The successful respondent to a request for proposal to provide contract
police services shall have achieved for a minimum of three years prior
to the date of the submission of the response and shall maintain during
the consideration of the proposal and the life of the contract an average
response time of less than four minutes to calls for service of a serious
nature, including but not limited to in-progress crimes and motor
vehicle crashes. The proposed contract provider shall submit
documentation to the Village in order to fulfill this requirement initially

officers per 1,000 residents, excluding the Chief of Police appointed by
the Village of Pleasant Prairie, based upon the most recent population
figures supplied by the Wisconsin Department of Administration. Such
officers shall be based in the Village and shall perform their duties
exclusively within the Village except when leaving the Village is
necessary to carry out those duties or to fulfill a request for mutual aid.
This contractual requirement shall not apply in the event that the
Village Police Department is not meeting this threshold, but in that case
the proposed contract shall provide for at least equivalent staffing to
that provided by the Village Police Department.
E. Of the total number of officers provided by the contract provider
pursuant to Subsection D above, a minimum of 12% of those officers
shall be trained and experienced investigative personnel with no less
than three years experience at the rank of detective or above and shall
also be based within the Village and shall be dedicated exclusively to
Village investigations. Nothing in this subsection precludes these
officers from leaving the Village when necessary to carry out their
duties. This contractual requirement shall not apply in the event that
the Village Police Department is not meeting this threshold, but in that
case the proposed contract shall provide for at least equivalent staffing
to that provided by the Village Police Department.
F. The officers assigned to the Village shall be under the direct supervision
of the contract provider. The offices of the Chief of Police shall continue
to be located within the corporate limits of the Village of Pleasant
Prairie. The Chief of Police shall not be assigned duties by the contract

require further or renewed testing at the contract provider's expense.
H. All selected officers approved by the Village Police and Fire Commission
shall be assigned by the contract provider to the Village and shall not be
reassigned outside the corporate limits of the Village of Pleasant Prairie
without the consent of the Village Board.
I. Selected officers shall serve during good behavior and may be
suspended or removed for cause by the Pleasant Prairie Police and Fire
Commission. If an officer is removed or a position becomes vacant, the
contract provider shall nominate alternative personnel to replace them.
The contract provider may assign personnel from within the provider's
agency to fill any temporary or permanent vacancy or to satisfy any
temporary assignment necessitated by illness, leave or absence,
vacation or other temporary situation, but in no case shall a temporary
assignment exceed 30 days without approval of the Police and Fire
Commission and the Village Board.
J. The contract shall not take effect until the expiration of any collective
bargaining agreement covering existing officers of the Village of
Pleasant Prairie Police Department and in any event shall not take
effect or be enforceable against the Village until at least one year after
it is approved by all parties in the manner set forth below in Subsection
M, and, if applicable, Subsection N.
K. The contract shall not be for a period of less than five years.
L. If the contract is terminated or not renewed for reasons by either a
contractor or its subcontractor, the contract provider shall indemnify

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 270-1. Authority.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to authority granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes, including, without limitation, §§ 66.0415 and 61.34(1) Wis. Stats.
It is intended, in the event that any of these sources of authority is
abrogated or limited by future enactments of the State Legislature, that
this chapter shall be based upon and construed in light of all other then
available authorities.
§ 270-2. Findings.
The Village Board finds that while quarries and other nonmetallic mining
operations produce socially beneficial products, and add incrementally to
the economic well-being of the community, such operations, when
conducted in a rapidly developing and urbanizing community such as the
Village and its environs, constitute offensive industry, produce nuisance
conditions, adversely affect the public health, safety, prosperity and general
welfare, and otherwise result in a deterioration of the quality of life and
aesthetically pleasing surroundings that are important to the continued
growth, development and prosperity of the Village, unless such operations,
and the reclamation of the site of such operations, are rigorously regulated
and controlled. In addition to the potential direct impacts of noise, dust,
ground vibration, airblast, fly rock, heavy truck traffic, groundwater
drawdown, erosion, pollution of surface and groundwater and attractive
nuisance conditions that result from quarry and other nonmetallic mining
operations, such operations also result in serious indirect impacts on
neighboring properties and the community as a whole, such as diminution
of property values and resultant property tax loss, damage to infrastructure
such as streets and highways, the shifting of development patterns so as to
be at odds with long-range land use planning and the resultant inability to
recapture in a fair and equitable manner infrastructure investments made
in reliance upon such planning, and large areas of land left in unproductive,
aesthetically displeasing and dangerous condition and the attendant loss of
future property tax revenue. If not prevented or controlled, such adverse
effects can far outweigh the beneficial aspects of quarries and other
nonmetallic mining operations.
§ 270-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and control all quarry and other
nonmetallic mining operations, and as a part of such regulation, to require,
regulate and control the reclamation of all quarry and other nonmetallic
mining sites.
§ 270-1 QUARRIES AND NONMETALLIC MINING § 270-4
270:389
§ 270-4. Greater restrictions to prevail.
It is not intended that this chapter will repeal any preexisting ordinance
provisions affecting quarries or other nonmetallic mining operations, but
whenever this chapter imposes greater or more stringent requirements
or restrictions on quarry or other nonmetallic mining operations than do
preexisting ordinances provisions, the provisions of this chapter shall
control.
§ 270-5. Interpretation.
The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Village.
Headings in this chapter are provided for convenience and ease of
reference. They are not intended to be referred to for the purpose of
interpreting the provisions of this chapter. Words or phrases that are
defined in this chapter shall have the meaning stated in the definitions.
Undefined words or phrases shall have their common, ordinary meaning
unless a particular meaning is clearly suggested by the context in which
a particular word or phrase is used. As used in this chapter, "shall" is
mandatory.
§ 270-6. Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to all quarries and all other nonmetallic mining
operations located within the corporate limits of the Village or within the
four-mile extraterritorial jurisdiction area outside of the Village limits
established by § 66.0223, Wis. Stats., including, without limitation,
unreclaimed portions of the sites of such quarries or other nonmetallic
mining operations that were mined prior to the effective date of this
chapter.
§ 270-7. Exempt activities.
This chapter does not apply to the following activities:
A. Excavations or grading by a person solely for domestic use at his or her
residence.
B. Excavations or grading conducted for highway construction purposes
within the highway right-of-way.
C. Grading conducted for farming, preparing a construction site or

§ 270-12 QUARRIES AND NONMETALLIC MINING § 270-12
270:399
§ 270-13. Public hearing.
Upon receipt of a complete permit application, the Village Clerk shall refer
the application to the Village Plan Commission for its recommendations and
schedule a public hearing on the application before the Village Board. The
hearing shall be scheduled not earlier than 60 days nor more than 90 days
after receipt of the application, but the Village Board, for good cause shown,
may order a modification of this requirement. Notice of the public hearing
shall be published as Class 2 notice in a newspaper of general circulation
within the Village. In addition, notice of the public hearing shall be mailed
to the operator, the owner of the site, and to the last known address of all
owners of real property located within 500 feet of the boundaries of the
site. This requirement of actual notice to persons other than the operator is
precatory, and the failure to mail or receive such notice shall not invalidate
any action taken by the Village Board. At the hearing, the Village Board
shall hear and receive information or recommendations presented by the
Village Plan Commission, staff, and consultants, information presented by
the applicant or the applicant's authorized agents and consultants, and
information presented by parties in interest and members of the public.

appropriate methods to eliminate or mitigate potential adverse impacts
and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed reclamation.
M. Waiver of application requirements. The Village Board may waive any
specified information required to be submitted with the application for
a permit, if it is satisfied that such information is not relevant or is
unnecessary to a full and effective evaluation of the proposed operation
and reclamation, or if the cost of producing certain information is
unreasonable in comparison to the usefulness of the information in the
evaluation process. The Village Board's designees may preliminarily
waive any application requirements on the same grounds, but such a
preliminary waiver may be reversed by the Village Board. In
determining whether to waive application requirements, the Village
Board and its designees shall take into account, without limitation, the
nature and extent of the proposed operations, the surrounding existing
and anticipated land uses, and whether and to what extent the
operation preexisted the effective date of this chapter. It shall be the
obligation of the applicant to request in writing any such waiver. Such
request shall set forth the justification for such waiver.
§ 270-12 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 270-14
270:400

to blasting, mining, land use, highway access, air pollution, water pollution,
contamination of the ground, solid waste disposal, navigable waters,
groundwater, wetlands, floodplains, shorelands and other environmental
matters. The Board may impose requirements which are in addition to or
more stringent than the minimum requirements of this chapter. In granting
a permit, the Board shall specify all aspects of the proposed plan of
operations and plan of reclamation which are not approved. No application
shall be granted unless the Board first finds that the approved operations,
as conditioned, will result in no significant loss, harm or damage to
neighboring property owners, to the Village, or to the public health, safety
or welfare, nor serious risk of any such loss, harm or damage, and that the
approved reclamation will result in a safe, useful and aesthetically pleasing
site. In deciding upon an application regarding an operation that preexisted
the effective date of this chapter, and was active on the effective date of
this chapter, the Village Board shall take into account the nature, extent,
circumstances and past performance of the operation and shall modify the
requirements of this chapter to the extent necessary to ensure that the
permit requirements are reasonable under the particular circumstances.
§ 270-15. Term.
Permits shall be granted for an initial term of two years. Thereafter, permits
may be renewed by the Village Board for terms of not more than five years.
In determining the term of a renewed permit, the Board shall take into
account the nature, extent, stage and prior performance of the operation
and the likelihood of future problems. Any permit issued pursuant to this
chapter shall automatically terminate upon the abandonment of the quarry
or other nonmetallic mining operations.
§ 270-16. Renewal.
Applications for the renewal of a permit shall be filed with the Village
Clerk not later than 90 days prior to the expiration date. Any information
or materials required for an initial permit application shall be supplied
with the application for renewal to the extent that such information or
materials were not supplied with the prior application or to the extent that
the previously supplied information or materials are out of date or no longer
accurate and complete. The applicant for a renewal permit shall certify that
any previously submitted information or materials that are not updated or
resubmitted continues to be accurate and complete. Such an application
shall be processed in the same manner as an initial permit application. In
the event that a timely renewal application is not decided by the expiration
date of the permit, the permit shall be deemed to be extended to the date of
the Board's decision.
§ 270-14 QUARRIES AND NONMETALLIC MINING § 270-17
270:401
§ 270-17. Amendment to permit.
In the event that the operator desires to make any material modification
in the permitted operation or reclamation, the operator shall file with
the Village Clerk an application for an amendment to the permit. Such
application shall describe in detail the proposed modification, explain the
effects of the proposed modification, supplement and update the
information and materials submitted with the prior application and make
the certification required for renewal applications. Such an application shall
be processed in the same manner as an initial permit application.
§ 270-18. Permit fees.
The applicant shall file with the application for an initial permit fee in the
amount of $3,000, or $50 per acre for each acre contained in the site,
whichever is greater. With any application for the renewal or amendment of
a permit, the applicant shall file a permit fee of $500, or $10 per acre for
each acre contained in the site, whichever is greater.
§ 270-19. Security.
As a condition of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter, the Village
Board shall require, and the operator shall promptly deposit with the
Village, an irrevocable letter of credit, cash, a bond or other security in
an amount adequate to secure the obligation of the operator to restore the
site to a safe, useful and aesthetically pleasing condition, in accordance
with the approved restoration plan, to the extent of the mining operations
if the operations were abandoned during the term of the permit. Any
security instrument shall be in a form satisfactory to the Board and shall
be issued by a person satisfactory to the Board, but the Board's approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any cash deposited with the Village
shall be deposited in a segregated interest-bearing account and shall be
used only for the required restoration. Any security shall be promptly
released or returned to the operator, with any accrued interest, at the
completion of the approved reclamation to the satisfaction of the Village
Board. The termination, expiration, or modification of a security instrument,
in the absence of a renewal or replacement thereof or the making of
other arrangements satisfactory to the Village Board, shall be grounds for
suspension of the operator's permit.
§ 270-20. Transfer.
Permits issued under this chapter may be transferred only with the prior
written approval of the Village Board. Such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, but the Board shall not approve any transfer in the
absence of satisfactory arrangements regarding security and the prompt
correction of any prior failure to comply with permit requirements.
§ 270-17 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 270-21
270:402
§ 270-21. Suspension, denial of renewal, or revocation of permit.
The Village Board, after a public hearing assuring the operator of due
process, may suspend a permit if it finds that the operator is guilty of a
pattern of repeated violations after similar violations have been brought
to the attention of the operator, or of violations involving a serious risk
of personal injury, substantial property damage or substantial harm to the
public health, safety or welfare, or for the reasons set out in § 270-19 of this
chapter, and may deny renewal of a permit or revoke a permit if it finds that
the operator is guilty of a pattern of repeated violations involving a serious
risk of personal injury, substantial property damage or substantial harm to
the public health, safety or welfare.
§ 270-22. Variances.
The Village Board may grant variances from the literal requirements of
this chapter, when it is not otherwise expressly authorized to modify
requirements, after a public hearing, if it finds that:
A. Because of special conditions, a literal enforcement of the requirements
of this chapter will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardship;
B. Granting a variance will not result in any significant loss, harm or
damage to neighboring property owners or to the Village;
C. Granting the variance will not result in a site that is unsafe, unusable or
aesthetically displeasing; and
D. That the spirit of the chapter will be observed by the variance, the
public health, safety and welfare will be secured and substantial justice
will be done.

to public sewers. [Amended 8-6-2012 by Ord. No. 12-23; 9-16-2013
by Ord. No. 13-43]
G. Mandatory connection. Connection to the public sewer is mandatory
when a public sewer has been extended to a property. A request for
public sewer can be made in writing to the approving authority.
A. Submission of basic data.
(1) The approving authority may require each person who discharges
or seeks to discharge industrial wastes to the public sewer to
prepare and file with the approving authority, at such times as it
determines, a report that shall include pertinent data relating to
the quantity and characteristics of the wastes discharged to the
wastewater collection and treatment facilities. In the case of a new
connection, the approving authority may require that this report be
prepared prior to making the connection to the public sewers.
(2) Industrial dischargers are further subject to the applicable rules
and regulations set forth in Section 32.08 of the Kenosha Code of
Ordinances regarding submittal of applications, operational data
and reports, baseline monitoring reports, compliance reports,
chemical analysis, etc.
B. Industrial discharges. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are
proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters or wastes
contain substances or possess the characteristics which, in the
judgment of the approving authority or the City of Kenosha wastewater
treatment facility, have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater
collection and treatment facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life, health, or constitute
a public nuisance, the approving authority may:
(1) Reject the wastes;
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
(4) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of this article.
C. Control manholes. Each industrial or nonresidential discharger shall, at
the discretion of the approving authority, construct and maintain one or
more control manholes or access points together with measuring and
sampling devices to facilitate observation, measurement, and sampling
of wastes, including sanitary sewage.
§ 285-17 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 285-18
277:420
(1) Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in a
manner acceptable to the approving authority. All measuring and/
or sampling devices shall be of a type acceptable to the approving
authority.
(2) Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall be
installed by the industrial or nonresidential discharger, at the
discharger's expense, and shall be maintained by the discharger so
as to be in safe condition, accessible, and in proper operating
condition at all times. Plans for installation of the control manholes
or access facilities and related equipment shall be approved by the
approving authority prior to the beginning of construction.
D. Measurement of flow. The volume of flow when used for computing
sewer service charges shall be the metered water consumption of the
person as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the
municipality except as noted in Subsection E.
E. Metering of waste. Devices for measuring the volume of waste
discharge may be required by the approving authority if this volume
cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption
records. Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed and owned by the industrial or nonresidential discharger,
subject to the approval of the approving authority. The approving
authority may require or undertake at the discharger's expense
necessary metering calibration and maintenance of metering devices.
Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed
without the consent of the approving authority. The approving authority
may require reporting in accordance with Subsection K.
F. Waste sampling. Industrial and nonresidential wastes discharged into
the public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and a
determination of character and concentration of said wastes. The
determination shall be made for the industry and nonresidential user as
often as may be deemed necessary by the approving authority.
(1) Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative
of the composition of the wastes. The sampling may be
accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical
equipment acceptable to the approving authority. Every care shall
be exercised in the collection of samples to ensure their
preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample
was taken.
(2) Installation, operation, and maintenance of the sampling facilities
shall be the responsibility of the industrial or nonresidential
discharger and shall be subject to the approval of the approving
authority. The approving authority may require the discharger to
use a contractor from a list of prequalified contractors.
(3) Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the approving
authority or its duly authorized representative at all times.
§ 285-18 RUMMAGE/GARAGE SALES § 285-18
277:421
(4) The approving authority shall collect and analyze the samples. If
the sample is significantly different from prior samples or out of
sample range, the approving authority may choose to resample for
that month.
(5) An industry or nonresidential discharger may split samples with the
approving authority upon request. Samples must be tested at a lab
certified by the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources using the same testing methods as the lab contracted by
the Village of Pleasant Prairie. If there is a significant difference
between the split samples, the discharger can request a resample
at its cost. [Amended 1-16-2017 by Ord. No. 17-05]
(6) In the event of a resample, the approving authority may choose the
most appropriate sample or average the two samples.
(7) Industrial or nonresidential discharger shall pay for all costs
incurred by the approving authority or its contracted
representative for the metering, monitoring and sampling required
under this section, whether taken by the discharger or the
approving authority. These charges are separate from and in
addition to the sewer service charges in § 285-19.
(8) Any waste sampling results over the listed thresholds for a
Category B user under § 285-15 will subject the discharger to a
sanitary sewer surcharge under § 281-19, until the sampling result
concentrations are below the Category B thresholds for 24
consecutive months.
(9) In addition to the foregoing, for satellite systems the following
requirements shall be required unless waived by the approving
authority upon application of the satellite system:
(a) Sampling of the volume of the discharge from the satellite
system shall be monitored by a continuous flow monitor (not
less than five-minute increments) maintained by the approving
authority. The approving authority shall download the data
monthly and provide the data to the satellite system within 18
days.
(b) Sampling of the waste characteristics of the discharge shall be
performed by the approving authority on no less than a
monthly basis.
(c) Samples may be tested for fats, oils and grease (FOG),
biological oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS),
phosphorus (P) and any other test deemed necessary based on
the nature of the discharge. Certified lab results from any
sample shall be sent to the satellite system 18 working days
after the sample is taken in the field.
§ 285-18 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 285-18
277:422
(d) If the satellite system wants to request a resample of any test
result, it must do so within three days of receiving the sample
result.
G. Pretreatment. Persons discharging industrial wastes into any public
sewer may be required to pretreat such wastes:
(1) If the approving authority determines pretreatment is necessary to
protect the wastewater collection and treatment facilities or
prevent the discharge of incompatible pollutants.
(2) In the event such person shall provide at his expense such
pretreatment or processing facilities as may be determined
necessary to render wastes acceptable for admission to the
sanitary sewers.
H. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards (NCPS), as promulgated by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, shall be met by all dischargers of the
regulated industrial categories.
I. State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
to the publicly owned treatment works shall be met by all dischargers
which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are
more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in
this article or any other applicable ordinance.
J. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the approving authority, they
are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing
floatable grease in amounts in excess of those specified in this article,
or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients, except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters
or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the approving authority and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In maintaining
these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for proper removal
and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject
to review by the approving authority. Disposal of the collected materials
performed by owner's personnel or currently licensed waste disposal
firms must be in accordance with currently acceptable Department of
Natural Resources rules and regulations.
K. Analyses.
(1) All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall
be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard
Methods and with the Federal Regulations, 40 CFR 136, Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants, as amended
from time to time.
§ 285-18 RUMMAGE/GARAGE SALES § 285-18
277:423
(2) Unless otherwise set forth in this section, sampling methods,
location, times, durations, and frequencies are to be determined on
an individual basis subject to approval by the approving authority.
(3) The industrial or nonresidential discharger shall report any and all
sampling data which it undertakes to the approving authority in a
time and format specified by the approving authority.
L. Accidental discharges. Each industrial discharger shall provide
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated
materials or substances established by this article. Where necessary,
facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall
be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
this protection shall be submitted to the approving authority for review
and shall be approved by the approving authority before construction of
the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures by the approving authority shall not relieve the discharger
from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this article.
(1) Dischargers shall notify the approving authority immediately upon
the occurrence of a slug load, or accidental discharge of substances
prohibited by this article. The notification shall include location of
discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and
volume, and corrective actions. Any discharger who discharges a
slug load of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense,
loss or damage to the wastewater facilities or wastewater
treatment works, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on
the Authority on account thereof under state or federal law.
(2) Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
discharger's premises, advising employees whom to call in the
event of a slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all
employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with
respect to the emergency notification procedure.
M. Submission of facility information. Plans, specifications, and any other
pertinent information relating to proposed flow equalization,
pretreatment, or grease and/or sand interceptor facilities shall be
submitted for review and approval of the approving authority prior to
the start of their construction if the effluent from such facilities is to be
discharged into the public sewers. No construction of such facilities
shall commence until said approval has been granted.
N. Discharges from satellite systems. Each satellite system discharger
shall adopt and implement a capacity, management, operation and
maintenance (CMOM) program, in substantial conformance with the
provisions of § NR 210.23(4), Wis. Admin. Code, subject to the review
and approval of the approving authority.
§ 285-18 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 285-18
277:424
§ 285-19. Basis for sewer service charge.
O. Reports. Industrial and nonresidential dischargers shall keep records of
the sampling results and maintenance performed for seven years and
submit an annual report to the approving authority containing a
summary of this information by February 10 each year unless the
approving authority agrees to an alternative schedule for reporting.
A. Basis. It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary and
conducive to the protection of the public health, safety, welfare and
convenience of the Village of Pleasant Prairie to levy and collect
charges, rentals, or rates of service upon all the lands, lots, and
premises served by and having connections with the sewerage system
of Pleasant Prairie Sewer Utility and Lake Michigan Sewer Utility
District. [Amended 5-2-2011 by Ord. No. 11-11]
B. Classification of sewer users. Sewer users shall be classified as
residential, commercial, industrial, or public authority as defined in
§ 285-15. A totally unit-based charge shall be used for customers
without municipal water; a flow-based charge shall be used for all
customers that are connected to municipal water. [Amended
9-16-2013 by Ord. No. 13-43]
C. Category B users. Category B users shall be charged a surcharge, in
addition to monthly customer charge plus volume charge, based on the
prevailing Category B service charges for BOD, suspended solids and
phosphorus. Any wastewater test results found over the Category B
thresholds will place the customer as a Category B user for 24 months.
[Amended 9-16-2013 by Ord. No. 13-43]
D. Residential user equivalents (RUEs). Each nonresidential customer
shall be assigned an RUE value to be used as the basis of computing the
user and connection charges. The RUE totals will be assigned by the
approving authority and shall be based on estimated water use,
considering a use of 210 gallons per day as equal to one RUE. RUE
assignments will be reviewed annually.
E. Sewer users served by private wells. If any industrial customer
discharging wastewater into the sanitary sewers procures any part or
all of his water from sources other than the Water Utility, all or part of
which is discharged into the sanitary sewers, the customer shall have
water meters installed by the Water Utility at the customer's expense
for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these
sources. Where sewer meters are installed, water meters will not be
required. The water meters shall be furnished by the Water Utility and
installed under its supervision, all costs (including meter cost) being at
the expense of the person requiring the meter.
F. Deduct meters. [Amended 5-16-2005 by Ord. No. 05-16; 4-16-2007
by Ord. No. 07-15; 12-4-2008 by Ord. No. 08-56]
§ 285-18 RUMMAGE/GARAGE SALES § 285-19
277:425
(1) If an industrial or nonresidential user feels that a significant
amount of metered water does not reach the sanitary sewer, he
can, at his own expense, with approval of the approving authority,
install such additional meters or metered services as are necessary
to calculate the volume of water not discharged to the sanitary
sewer. Metered water not discharged to the sanitary sewer shall
not be subject to sewer service charges. [Amended 8-6-2012 by
Ord. No. 12-23]
(2) Requests to install additional meters must be made in writing to the
approving authority.
(3) The monthly charge for deduct meters are as follows: [Amended
5-2-2011 by Ord. No. 11-11]
Meter Size
(inches) Monthly Charge
5/8 to 1 $15.98
1 1/2 $18.20
2 $25.05
3 $25.05
4 $31.91
6 $44.41
G. Winter base volume. [Amended 11-2-2015 by Ord. No. 15-40;
6-20-2016 by Ord. No. 16-25]
(1) The winter base volume shall be that volume of water that can be
verified through the use of municipal water meter readings for a
four-month period closest to December 1 through March 31. This
volume shall serve as the basis for determining the sewer volume
charge for residential customers for five billing periods closest to
May 1 through September 30. To establish a winter-based average
volume, two months of readings in the four-month evaluation
period (December 1 through March 31) is necessary. Zero usage is
considered a nonreading. Volume is based on a customer, not a
location. Any customer that does not have two readings in the fourmonth
evaluation period will be charged actual volume during the
summer months.
(2) Those sewer customers that are not connected to the Village's or
Kenosha Water Utility's (KWU) municipal water system shall have
the same monthly volume year around that was established during
the last sewer rate study.
(3) Kenosha Water Utility (KWU) should provide annually water usage
for the previous year to the Village of Pleasant Prairie for those
Pleasant Prairie sanitary sewer customers that are served by
§ 285-19 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 285-19
277:426
municipal water from the KWU. The information provided by KWU
will be used to determine a new monthly volume starting May 1.
(4) If the KWU does not provide winter water usage, the KWU
municipal water customer with Pleasant Prairie sanitary sewer will
be responsible for providing the appropriate information. They may
bring in two KWU utility bill stubs by May 1 each year from the
KWU representing usage closest to December 1 through March 31,
and that average consumption shall be used to calculate a winter
base volume. If KWU municipal water customers do not provide two
utility billing stubs each year, those customers will be billed based
on the volume established in Subsection G(2) of this section.
H. Groundwater surcharge.
(1) The groundwater surcharge is the volumetric charge that shall be
determined by the approving authority for application to those
customers that either have their perimeter, down spout, or footing
drainage tiles connected into the public sewer or have connected or
discharge their sump pumps into the public sewer.
(2) Customers that have had the Village inspect and approve their
sanitary sewage drainage system will be exempt from the charge.
(3) Customers that are subject to this charge are those that are in
metered service areas of the Pleasant Prairie Sewer Utility that are
served by the Kenosha Water Utility. [Amended 5-2-2011 by Ord.
No. 11-11]
(4) The charge shall be computed by establishing an actual gross
volume flow from a sanitary sewage metering station. From that
volume, the actual volume of water meter readings, RUE's from
nonwater customers, and the allowable infiltration rate established
in the Wisconsin State Standard Specifications for Sanitary Sewer
and Water Construction, Section 3.7.2, shall be subtracted. The net
result of that calculation will be divided equally among all
customers that have not complied with Subsection H(2) of this
section and are located in the metered areas as shown on Map
20-2.
I. When charges begin. Charges for sanitary sewer service begin at the
time the rough plumbing permit is issued. Charges shall be based upon
average winter base rate for residential customers for residential
construction. Multifamily dwelling units charges shall be based upon
the number of dwelling units multiplied by the average residential
winter base rate. All other classifications of customers shall be charged
based upon waste stream analysis to be supplied at the time of their site
and operation plan review.
J. Control of industrial wastes directed to public sewers; waste sampling.
Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be subject to
periodic inspection and a determination of character and concentration
§ 285-19 RUMMAGE/GARAGE SALES § 285-19
277:427
§ 285-20. Amount of sewer service charges.
of said wastes. The determination shall be made for the industry as
often as may be deemed necessary by the approving authority. [Added
6-4-2012 by Ord. No. 12-20]
(1) Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative
of the composition of the wastes. The sampling may be
accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical
equipment acceptable to the approving authority.
(2) Installation, operation, and maintenance of the sampling facilities
shall be the responsibility of the person discharging the waste and
shall be subject to the approval of the approving authority. Access
to sampling locations shall be granted to the approving authority or
its duly authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be
exercised in the collection of samples to ensure their preservation
in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was taken.
(3) The approving authority shall determine whether sampling by
district employees and/or contractor's findings shall be used when
presented with contrary sampling information. An industry may
split samples with the districts upon request by the industry.
(4) Sanitary sewer surcharge testing shall measure the biological
oxygen demand (BOD), which is the strength of effluent, the total
suspended solids (TSS), and phosphorous (P). The Village
discharges all sewer flow to the City of Kenosha, Kenosha Water
Utility, which in turn places a sanitary sewer surcharge for all flow
received. Pleasant Prairie monitors the discharge flow from
manufacturing, commercial, private sewer systems, restaurants,
and other users with a history of discharging sewer flows above the
allowable limits. The following limits have been established: BOD,
180 mg/L; TSS, 200 mg/L; and P, 6 mg/L. Each of the test limits has
an established fee as established by ordinance.
(5) Fats, oil and grease (FOG) testing shall be used as an indicator to
assist sanitary sewer surcharge test users that discharge effluent
with high BODs. Users that operate kitchens, restaurants,
industrial companies who handle meat, and private sewer system
owners are examples of sewer users who would receive this test.

277:438
(4) Requirements for the installation and maintenance of inspection
and sampling facilities.
(5) Special conditions imposed by the Administrator of the Wastewater
Utility required under particular circumstances of a given
discharger, including sampling locations, frequency of sampling,
number, types and standards for tests and reporting schedules, and
special technical reports or discharge reports in addition to those
specifically prescribed by this article. The special conditions
imposed by this section shall be reasonable and shall be necessary
to carry out the objectives of this article. In each case, if the
discharger so desires, the Administrator shall provide to the
discharger a full and complete explanation of the reason for the
special conditions.
(6) Dischargers which have a potential for an accidental discharge of
prohibited wastewater shall be required to develop a written plan
designed to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited
wastewater, and in the event of such accidental discharge, to
mitigate potential damages which could be caused thereby. Such
plan shall include a provision that dischargers place signs in
conspicuous places on their premises advising officers, employees
and agents thereof of the procedure to be utilized to report a
discharge of prohibited wastewater to the Wastewater Utility.
(7) Where pretreatment is required, the discharger shall be required
to submit a plan therefor to the Administrator of the Wastewater
Utility by a certain date. Such plan may not be implemented until
approved by the Administrator. Such plan shall include a schedule,
known as "milestone dates," for hiring an engineer, preliminary
plans, final plans, letting contract, commencement of and
completion of construction, hiring of appropriate personnel and
date of initial operation. Such schedule must be strictly complied
with unless such schedule is modified by the Administrator.
Dischargers shall have the obligation of filing for extensions of time
to meet such milestone date with the Wastewater Utility prior to
the expiration of any milestone date. A hearing will be held by the
Administrator on timely extension requests. No discharger shall fail
to timely obey an order for pretreatment, fail to submit a schedule
of milestone dates to implement pretreatment or fail to meet
scheduled milestone dates or authorized extensions thereof, for any
phase of the implementation of pretreatment. Pretreatment shall
be at the sole cost and expense of the discharger. No later than 14
days following each milestone date, the discharger shall submit a
progress report to the Administrator. If a specific milestone date is
not met, the report shall state the reason for the delay, the expected
time for complying with said milestone date and the steps being
taken to achieve said milestone by the date proposed. In the event
more than nine months elapse between milestone dates, a progress
report shall be submitted not less than every nine months. Should a
§ 285-27 RUMMAGE/GARAGE SALES § 285-27
277:439
milestone date not be met and should a timely extension request
not have been made and granted, an after-the-fact extension
request shall be applied for following the same procedure as should
have been utilized by the discharger for a timely request for
additional time to meet a milestone date. However, the approval
of an after-the-fact time extension shall not relieve the discharger
of liability for a forfeiture or other sanction for having missed a
milestone date without first having requested and been granted an
appropriate extension of time.
(8) A provision which states that samples shall be collected in such a
manner as to be representative of the composition of the
wastewater and as provided for in the permit. The sampling may be
accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical
equipment acceptable to the Administrator. Installation, operation
and maintenance of the sampling facilities shall be at the cost and
expense of the discharger and shall be subject to the approval of
the Administrator. Access to sampling locations, industrial
processes that pertain to wastewater discharge and pretreatment
facilities, and records of wastewater self-monitoring shall be
granted to the Administrator or duly authorized representative
thereof, at all reasonable hours. Care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to ensure their preservation in a state
comparable to that which existed at the time the sample was taken.
(9) A statement that dischargers discharging on the effective date of
this article shall comply with this article where it is stricter than
federal or state laws, rules or regulations, within 18 months after
the effective date of this article. The Administrator may provide
additional time for compliance with this article where such
additional time is mandated by technical considerations.
H. Permit duration. All wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for
four years, subject to amendment, suspension or revocation as provided
for in this article.
I. Limitations on permit assignment and transfer. A wastewater discharge
permit is issued to a specific industrial discharger or municipality for a
specific operation and is not valid for operations not described in the
application, is not assignable to another discharger or transferable to
any other location without the prior written approval of the
Administrator.
J. Permit amendments by issuer. The Wastewater Utility may amend any
wastewater discharge permit issued, subject to notice of its intent to do
so, and subject to the discharger being given an opportunity to be heard
for the purpose of correcting any errors or omissions made by the

ARTICLE I
Residency and Activity Restrictions
§ 287-1. Purpose.
§ 287-2. Definitions.
In this chapter, the following words shall have the following meanings:
CHILD  A person under the age of 16 years, for purposes of this chapter.
DESIGNATED OFFENDER  Any person who is required to register under
§ 301.45, Wis. Stats., for any sexual offense against a child, or any person
who is required to register under § 301.45, Wis. Stats., and who has been
designated a special bulletin (SBX) sex offender pursuant to § 301.46(2) and
(2m), Wis. Stats.
MINOR  A person under the age of 18 years.
PERMANENT RESIDENCE  A place where the designated offender lodges
or resides for 14 or more consecutive days.
PROHIBITED ACTIVITY  Participation in a holiday event involving minors.
Holiday events in which the designated offender is the parent or guardian
of the minors involved, and no nonfamilial minors are present, are exempt
from the definition of "prohibited activity." A designated offender
participates in a prohibited activity by taking part in the event which shall
include, without limitation, distributing candy or other items to children on
Halloween, wearing a Santa Clause costume on or preceding Christmas, or
wearing an Easter Bunny costume on or preceding Easter.
PROHIBITED LOCATION  Any school, licensed day-care center, park,
trail, playground, or place of worship. The Village Administrator shall
maintain an official map showing the prohibited locations and safety zones
within the Village. The Village Administrator shall update the map at least
annually to reflect any changes in the prohibited locations and safety zones.
A. It is the purpose of this chapter not to impose a criminal penalty but
rather to service the Village of Pleasant Prairie's compelling interest to
promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the Village of Pleasant Prairie by creating areas around
locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated number
wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited
from establishing temporary or permanent residency.
B. Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence
and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who
present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are
extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses,
and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more
victims that are never reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction
of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to
society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
§ 287-1 RUMMAGE/GARAGE SALES § 287-2
277:443
The map shall be available in the office of the Village Clerk and posted on
the Village website.
SAFETY ZONE  A safety zone is any real property that supports or
upon which there exists any facility used for or that supports a school for
minors, a public park, a park facility, a trail or any other prohibited location,
including any sidewalks or lawn adjacent to such prohibited location.
TEMPORARY RESIDENCE  Either:

more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not
the person's permanent address; or

A. Prohibited location of residence. It shall be unlawful for any designated
offender to establish a permanent residence or temporary residence
within 1,500 feet of a prohibited location.
B. (Reserved)81
C. Determination of minimum distance separation. For purposes of
determining the minimum distance separation under this chapter, the
requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the
closest point of the outer property line of the permanent residence or
temporary residence of a designated offender to the nearest outer
property line of a prohibited location. If any portion of a tax parcel
contains a prohibited location, the entire tax parcel shall be considered
a prohibited location. If any portion of a tax parcel would constitute a
prohibited location of residence under § 287-3A, the entire tax parcel
shall be considered a prohibited location of residence.
D. Exceptions. A designated offender residing within a prohibited location
of a Residence as described in § 287-3A and B shall not be in violation of
this chapter if any of the following apply:
(1) Subject to § 287-5A below, the designated offender established the
permanent residence or temporary residence and reported and
registered the residence pursuant to § 301.45, Wis. Stats., before
the initial effective date of the relevant provision of this chapter,
and the designated offender has resided in such permanent
residence or temporary residence continuously since the effective

following: The designated offender is prohibited from residing in

unless the designated offender is on probation or parole and
residing with the victim is approved in writing by the probation or
parole officer; and if not on probation or parole, such location is
prohibited unless approved in writing by the Pleasant Prairie Chief
of Police, based upon a finding that the circumstances of the
offense, the designated offender, the victim, and all relevant
information in the matter substantially eliminates the risk of reoffense
against the victim.
(5) The Sex Offender Residence Board has granted an exemption for
the designated offender. [Added 9-18-2017 by Ord. No. 17-40]

(1) By design, the peak flow discharge rates of stormwater runoff
under the post-development conditions shall be controlled and
reduced as follows:
(a) One-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour, post-development peak
runoff discharge shall not exceed the lesser of:
[1] Three tenths cubic feet per second (cfs) per acre; or

conveyance facilities as determined by the Village or peak
discharge requirements of Village-adopted stormwater
management plans for specific areas or watersheds where
applicable.
(b) Two-year, twenty-four-hour, post-development peak runoff
discharges shall not exceed the lesser of:
[1] Four hundredths cubic feet per second (cfs) per acre; or

A B C D
Woodland 30 55 70 77
Grassland 39 61 71 78
Cropland 55 69 77 80
(e) Peak discharge shall be calculated using Atlas 14 precipitation
depths and NRCS MSE3 precipitation distribution.
(2) Peak runoff discharge standards do not apply to any of the
following:
(a) Development activities located in sites riparian to Lake
Michigan where site runoff is directly discharged into Lake
Michigan and where the Village Engineer, or designee, has
§ 298-7 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 298-7
277:480
determined that bluff erosion protection has been
appropriately provided.
(b) Construction of recreational trails, if the trail width is 10 feet
or less, and the trail has continuous buffer at least five feet
wide on each side, disregarding interruption by streets,
driveways, or other impervious surfaces crossing the trail.
(c) Residential infill where the lot or development area is less than
five acres, the development is exclusively residential, the net
increase in the area of impervious surface is less than 20% of
the area of the site, each boundary of the site is contiguous to
sites that contain earlier development at the time the Village
receives the plans for the new development and it is
determined by the Village Engineer, or designee, that meeting
the peak discharge performance standard would be
impracticable or a hardship and said development would not
adversely affect downstream drainage conditions.
(d) A redeveloped post-construction site except as provided in
§ 298-7F, if the impervious area of the redevelopment is not
increased from existing conditions and it is determined by the
Village Engineer that meeting the peak discharge performance
standards would be impracticable or a hardship. Otherwise, it
is the intent that redevelopment sites incorporate peak runoff
discharge performance standards whenever possible.
B. Runoff quality performance standards.
(1) BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to control total
suspended solids carried in runoff from the post-construction site
in accordance with Table 2 or to the maximum extent practicable.
The design shall be based on an average annual rainfall, as
compared to no runoff management controls.
Table 2. TSS Reduction Standards
Development Type TSS Reduction
New development 80%
Infill development 80%
Redevelopment 40% of load from parking areas
and roads
(2) Exemption for TSS reduction: A post-development site with less
than ten-percent connected imperviousness based on complete
development of the post-construction site, provided that the
cumulative area of all impervious surfaces is less than one acre.
This does not include an exemption from protective area standards.
(3) Maximum extent practicable. If the design cannot meet a total
suspended solids reduction performance standard of Table 2, the
§ 298-7 RUMMAGE/GARAGE SALES § 298-7
277:481
stormwater management plan shall include a written, site-specific
explanation of why the total suspended solids reduction
performance standard cannot be met and why the total suspended
solids load will only be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.
(4) Off-site drainage. When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the
BMP from off site shall be taken into account in determining the
treatment efficiency of the practice. Any impact on the efficiency
shall be compensated for by increasing the size of the BMP
accordingly.
(5) Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle
maintenance areas (of any size) shall, to the maximum extent
practicable, have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to
reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters
waters of the state or other waterways in the Village contains no
visible petroleum sheen.
(6) Sites shall meet protective areas pursuant to § 298-8 of this
chapter.
C. Infiltration standards.
(1) Best management practices. BMPs shall be designed, installed, and
maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with the following or
to the maximum extent practicable:
(a) Low imperviousness. For development up to forty-percent
connected imperviousness, such as, but not limited to, parks,
cemeteries, and low-density residential development, infiltrate
sufficient runoff volume so that the post-development
infiltration volume shall be at least 90% of the predevelopment
infiltration volume, based on an average annual
rainfall. However, when designing infiltration systems to meet
this requirement, no more than 1% of the post-construction
site is required as an effective infiltration area.
(b) Moderate imperviousness. For development with more than
forty-percent and up to eighty-percent connected
imperviousness, such as, but not limited to, medium- and highdensity
residential, multifamily development, industrial and
institutional development, and office parks, infiltrate sufficient
runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration volume
shall be at least 75% of the pre-development infiltration
volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However, when
designing infiltration systems to meet this requirement, no
more than 2% of the post-construction site is required as an
effective infiltration area.
(c) High imperviousness. For development with more than eightypercent
connected imperviousness, such as, but not limited to,
commercial strip malls, shopping centers, and commercial
§ 298-7 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 298-7
277:482
downtowns, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that the postdevelopment
infiltration volume shall be at least 60% of the
pre-development infiltration volume, based on an average
annual rainfall. However, when designing infiltration systems
to meet this requirement, no more than 2% of the postconstruction
site is required as an effective infiltration area.
(2) Pre-development conditions. Runoff curve numbers specified in
Table 1 of the peak discharge section90 shall be used for the predevelopment
condition.
(3) Source areas.
(a) Prohibitions. Runoff from the following areas may not be
infiltrated and may not qualify as contributing to meeting the
requirements of this section unless demonstrated to meet
groundwater standards:
[1] Areas associated with Tier 1 industrial facility identified in
§ NR 216.21(2)(a), including storage, loading and parking.
Rooftops may be infiltrated with the concurrence of the
Village and WDNR.
[2] Storage and loading areas of a Tier 2 industrial facility
identified in § NR 216.21(2)(b).
[3] Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Runoff from
rooftops of fueling and vehicle maintenance areas may be
infiltrated with the concurrence of the Village and DNR.
(b) Exemptions. Runoff from the following areas may be credited
toward meeting the requirement when infiltrated, but the
decision to infiltrate these source areas is optional:
[1] Parking areas and access roads less than 5,000 square feet
for commercial development.
[2] Parking areas and access roads less than 5,000 square feet
for industrial development not subject to the prohibitions
under Subsection C(3)(a) above.
[3] Except as provided under § 298-7F, redevelopment postconstruction
sites.

protective area and where no impervious surface is present,
adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70% or greater
shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or selfsustaining
vegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank
stability, maintenance of fish habitat and the filtering of pollutants
from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow conditions.
Nonvegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on
the bank as necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes
or where high-velocity flows occur.
(3) BMPs, such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins, which
are designed to control pollutants from nonpoint sources, may be
located in the protective area.
D. Exemptions. This section does not apply to any of the following:
(1) Except as provided under § 298-7F, redevelopment postconstruction
sites.

least three feet wide and securely railed on each side so that foot
passengers can pass over safely at all times.
E. Protective measures. The applicant shall erect such fence, railing or
barriers around the site of the excavation work in order to prevent
danger to persons using the Village street or sidewalks, and such
protective barriers shall be maintained until the work shall be

piles adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be piled and
maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the
trench, pedestrians or users of the streets and so that as little
inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining
property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, the
Village Public Works Director, or designee, shall have the authority to
require that the applicant haul the excavated material to a storage site
and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be
the applicant's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and

300:511
H. Damage to existing improvements. Any damage done to existing public
or private improvements during the permitted work shall be repaired

furnished by the Village, and the cost shall be charged against the
applicant.

properties shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock
and other debris resulting from such work. All cleanup operations at the
location of such excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the

own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of
any kind resulting from such work, and upon failure to do so within 24
hours after having been notified to do so by the Village Public Works
Director, or designee, such work may be done by the Village Public
Works Director, or designee, and the cost thereof charged to the
applicant.
J. Breaking through pavement. Whenever it is necessary to break through
existing pavement for excavation purposes, or where trenches are to be
four feet or over in depth, the pavement in the base shall be removed to
at least six inches beyond the outer limits of the subgrade that is to be
disturbed in order to prevent settlement, and a six-inch shoulder of
undisturbed material shall be provided in each side of the excavated
trench. A face of the remaining pavement shall be approximately
vertical. A power-driven concrete saw shall be used so as to permit
complete breakage of concrete pavement or base without ragged
edges. Asphalt paving shall be scored or otherwise cut in a straight line.
No pile driver may be used in breaking up the pavement.
K. Tunnels. Tunnels under pavement shall not be permitted except by
permission of the Village Public Works Director, or designee, and, if
permitted, shall be adequately supported by timbering and backfilling
under the direction of the Village Public Works Director, or designee.
L. Backfilling. Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to
work in the right-of-way permit shall be compacted to a degree
equivalent to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was
dug. Compacting shall be done by mechanical tappers or vibrators, by
rolling in layers, or by water settling, as required by the soil in question
and sound engineering practices generally recognized in the
construction industry. The decision as to whether a trench shall be
backfilled by water settling shall be based upon such engineering
practices and shall be made by the Village Engineer. The use of public
§ 305-25 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 305-25
300:512
water shall be paid for by the applicant on the terms agreed upon with
the Public Works Department.
(1) Backfilling by water settling. When backfilling is done by water
settling, excavated materials above utility installations shall be
deposited uniformly in layers of not more than five feet in thickness
and shall be allowed to flow slowly to the trench from high spots
and shall be worked down to the full depth of the layer of backfill
with bars. All bars used shall be long enough to extend entirely
through the layer being filled and shall be forced down through the
loose backfill material. As the bars are withdrawn, the water shall
be allowed to flow downward around the bar. The channel or hole
formed by the bar shall be kept open and the water kept running
into it until the fill has settled. All work shall be done in such
manner as to obtain a relative compaction through the entire depth
of the backfill of not less than that existing adjacent to the
excavation.
(2) Dry backfilling. Backfilling up to the first 18 inches above the top of
the utility pipes or similar installations shall be done with thin
layers. Each layer is to be tamped by manual or mechanical means.
Layers that are hand tamped shall not exceed four inches in
thickness. Layers that are power tamped shall not exceed six
inches in thickness. The same requirements shall apply to the
remainder of the backfilling if tamping is the method used for
backfilling. Backfilling of all pipes of over 24 inches in diameter
shall be carried up to the spring line of the pipe in three-inch
layers, with each layer moistened and thoroughly tamped with

Village Clerk may require any person liable for the tax imposed to
file with him before or after a permit is issued such security not in
excess of $5,000 as the Village Clerk determines. If any taxpayer
fails or refuses to place such security, the Village Clerk may refuse
or revoke such permit. If any taxpayer is delinquent in the payment
of taxes imposed by this section, the Village Treasurer may, upon
§ 320-3 STORMWATER STORAGE FACILITIES § 320-3
300:541
10 days' notice and after giving the taxpayer an opportunity to
confer, recover the taxes, interest and penalties from the security
placed with the Village Treasurer by such taxpayer. No interest
shall be paid or allowed by the Village to any person for the deposit
of such security.
(3) Issuance of permit. After compliance with Subsection C(1) and (2),
the Village Clerk shall grant and issue to each applicant a separate
permit for each place of business with the Village. Such permit is
not assignable and is valid only for the person in whose name it is
issued and for the transaction of business at the place designated
therein. It shall at all times be conspicuously displayed at the place
for which it is issued.
(4) Revocation of permit. Whenever any person fails to comply with
this section, the Village Administrator may, upon 10 days'
notification and after affording such person the opportunity to
show cause why the permit should not be revoked, revoke or
suspend any or all of the permits held by such person. The Village
Administrator shall give notice of this suspension or revocation to
the party affected and shall not issue a permit after the revocation
of a permit unless he is satisfied that the former holder of the
permit will comply with the provisions of this section. A fee of $10
shall be imposed for the renewal or issuance of a permit which has
been previously suspended or revoked. The decision of the Village
Administrator to revoke or suspend a permit may be appealed to
the Village Board.
D. Records to be kept. Every person liable for the tax imposed by this
section shall keep or cause to be kept such records, receipts, invoices
and other pertinent papers in such form as the Village Treasurer

payable before the last day of the following month.

those furnishing at retail such rooms and lodging on or before the same
date on which such tax is due and payable. Such return shall show the
gross room receipts of the preceding calendar month from such retail
furnishing of rooms or lodging, the amount of the tax imposed for such
period and such other information as the Village Administrator deems
necessary to administer this section. The Village Administrator may, for
good cause, extend the time of filing any return, but not longer than one
month from the filing date.
G. Records to be confidential. All tax returns, schedules, exhibits, writings
or audit reports relating to such returns on file with the Village

audit determine the tax required to be paid to the Village or the refund
due to any person under the basis of the facts contained in the return
being audited or on the basis of any other information within the Village
Administrator's possession. One or more such office audit
determinations may be made of the amount due for any one or for more
than one period. The Village Administrator or his agent may examine
and inspect the books, records, memoranda and property of any person
in order to verify the tax liability of that person or another person. The
Village Administrator may make a determination of the tax at any time.
I. Failure to file return. If any person fails to file a return as required by
this section, the Village Administrator shall make an estimate of the
amount of the gross receipts. Such estimate shall be made for the
period for which such person failed to make a return and shall be based
upon any information which is in the Village Administrator's possession
or may come into his possession. On the basis of this estimate, the
Village Administrator shall compute and determine the amount
required to be paid to the Village, adding to the sum thus arrived at a
penalty equal to 10% thereof. One or more such determinations may be
made for one or more than one period.
J. Interest on unpaid taxes and refunds.
(1) All unpaid taxes shall bear interest at the rate of 18% per annum
from the due date of the return until the first day of the month
following the month in which the tax is paid or deposited with the
Village Treasurer.
(2) All refunded taxes shall bear interest at 18% per annum from the
date of the return until the first day of the month following the
month in which such taxes are refunded. An extension of time
within which to file the return shall not operate to extend the due
date of the return for purposes of interest computation. If the
Village Treasurer determines that any overpayment of tax has been
made intentionally or by reason of carelessness or neglect or if the
tax which was overpaid was not accompanied by a complete return,
he shall not allow any interest thereon.
K. Late filing fee. Delinquent tax returns shall be subject to a late filing fee
of $10.
L. Delinquent taxes. The tax imposed by this section shall become
delinquent if not paid on or before the due date of the return or before

the intent in either case to defeat or evade the tax imposed by this
section, a penalty of 50% of the tax due shall be paid in addition to the

proceedings thereof shall be kept by the Village Clerk; the Village
Treasurer shall keep all financial records of such utility.
B. Powers. The Water Utility of the Village shall have the power to
construct waterlines for public use and shall have the power to lay
water pipes in and through the alleys, streets, and public grounds of the
Village, and generally, to do all such work as may be found necessary or
convenient in the management of the water system. The Water Utility
shall have power by itself, its officers, agents, and servants, to enter
upon any land for the purpose of making examination or supervise in
the performance of its duties under this chapter, without liability
therefor, and the Village shall have power to purchase and acquire for
the Water Utility all real and personal property which may be necessary
for construction of the water system or for any repair, remodeling, or
additions thereto.
C. Condemnation of real estate. Whenever any real estate or any easement
therein or use thereof shall, in the judgment of the Village, be necessary
to the water system, and whenever, for any cause, an agreement for the
purchase thereof cannot be made with the owner, the Village Board
shall proceed with all necessary steps to take such real estate easement
or use by condemnation in accordance with the Wisconsin Statutes.
D. Title to real estate and personalty. All property, real, personal and
mixed, acquired for the construction of the water system, and all plans,
specifications, diagrams, papers, books, and records connected
therewith, and all buildings, machinery, and fixtures pertaining thereto,
shall be the property of the Water Utility.
A. Application. Every person connecting with the water system shall file an
application in writing to the Village Clerk in such form as prescribed for
that purpose.
(1) Blanks for such application must state fully and truly all uses
intended. Additional uses or changes in stated uses will not be
allowed except upon further application and permission regularly
obtained from the Village Board.
(2) If the applicant is not the owner of the premises, the written
consent of the owner must accompany the application.

§ 355-5. Excavations.
B. Deposit. Each user shall, prior to hookup and to guarantee payment of
all charges herein, pay a deposit in cash in the amount equal to the
minimum quarterly water charge, such charge to be determined by the
type of service by which the property is connected to the mains. Such
deposits shall be refunded after two years of timely payment of
quarterly charges or when the user moves from the premises,
whichever is first, providing all charges are current.
C. User to repair. All users shall keep their own service pipes in good
repair and protected from frost, at their own risk and expense, and shall
prevent any unnecessary waste of water. All expenses relating to the
connection with the water system shall be paid by the applicant. No
charge, however, shall be made for the services of the Superintendent
in directing where and in what manner the mains shall be tapped and
excavations made in the street for laying pipe.
D. Use restricted. No user shall allow others to connect to the water
system through his lateral.
E. User to permit inspection. Every user shall permit the Water Utility or
its duly authorized agent, at all reasonable hours of the day, to enter his

in which the water is used, and must at all times, frankly and without
concealment, answer all questions put to him relative to its use.
F. Utility responsibility. It is expressly stipulated that no claim shall be
made against the Village Water Utility by reason of the breaking,
clogging, stoppage, or freezing of any service pipe; nor from any
damage arising from repairing mains, making connections or
extensions or any other work that may be deemed necessary. The right
is hereby reserved to cut off the service at any time for the purpose of
repairs or any other necessary purpose, any permit granted or
regulation to the contrary notwithstanding. Whenever it shall become
necessary to shut off the water service within any district of the Water
Utility, the Village Clerk or agent shall, if practicable, give notice to
each and every user within such district of the time when the service
will be shut off.
G. Meters. The owner of any premises shall provide a location for a water
meter and maintain such location and passageway thereto clean and
sanitary and free from any obstruction or any condition hazardous in
nature. No connection for water meters shall be installed in any
location not easily accessible or which is, or may be, unclean,
unsanitary, or in any manner unsafe to Utility employees in the
discharge of their duties.
A. In making excavations in streets or highways for laying service pipe or
making repairs, the paving and earth removed must be deposited in a

All water service within the limits of the Village from the street main
to the property line and including all controls between the same will be
maintained by the Water Utility without expense to the property owner
unless such damage is a result of negligence or carelessness on the part of
the property owner, a tenant, or an agent of the owner, in which case they
will be repaired at the expense of the property owner. All water services
from the point of maintenance by the Utility to and throughout the premises
must be maintained free of defective conditions by and at the expense of the
owner or occupant of the property.

incurred by the Utility for the repair or replacement of any water pipe,
curb-cock, gate valve, hydrant, or valve box damaged in any manner by
any person by the performance of any work under his control or by any
negligent act. Owners or operators of motor vehicles shall be liable for the
utilized in their designed and approved locations. If the water service
curb stop falls within the driveway approach or driveway surface, the
property owner shall sign a letter of indemnification with the Village,
holding the Village harmless for any and all future liability, loss, or
damage associated with any work as may be required by the Village
within the property owner's paved portion of the driveway which is
located in the Village road right-of-way. This letter of indemnification
shall be recorded with the Register of Deeds, with the recording fee
paid by the property owner. The water service curb stop located within

A. A unit of service shall consist of any residential, commercial, industrial
or charitable aggregation of space or area occupied for a distinct
purpose such as a residence, apartment, flat, store, office, industrial
plant, church or school. Each unit of service shall be regarded as one
user.
B. Suites in houses or apartments with complete housekeeping functions
(such as cooking), shall be classed as apartment houses; thus houses
and apartments having suites of one, two or more rooms with toilet
facilities, but without kitchen for cooking, are classed as rooming

C. When a user's premises has several buildings, for which services are
eligible and such buildings are used in the same business and
connected by the user, the Water Utility shall set a separate rate for
such complex.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect consumers and the
public water supply system of the Village from the possibility of
contamination or pollution due to a backflow of contaminants into
building plumbing and/or into the public water supply system.
B. A "cross-connection" shall be defined as any physical connection or
arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which
contains potable water from the Village water system, and the other,
§ 355-10 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 355-14
344:574
water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety,
or steam, gases or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one
system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure
differential between the two systems.
C. No person shall establish or permit to be established, or maintain or
permit to be maintained, any cross-connection. No interconnection
shall be established whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary or
emergency water supply, other than the regular water supply of the
Village, may enter the supply or distribution system of such
municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply
and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been
approved by the Water Utility and the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources in accordance with § NR 811, Wis. Adm. Code.
D. It shall be the duty of the Water Utility to cause inspections to be made
of all properties served by the public water system where crossconnection
with the public water system is deemed possible. The
frequency of inspection and reinspections based on potential health
hazards involved shall be as established by the Water Utility and as
approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in
accordance with § NR 811, Wis. Adm. Code.
E. Upon presentation of credentials, the Water Utility, Village and/or its
representative shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable
time to examine any property served by a connection to the public
water system of the Village for cross-connections. If entry is refused,
such representative shall obtain a special inspection warrant under
§ 66.0119, Wis. Stats. On request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any
property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent
information regarding the piping system or systems on such property.
F. The Water Utility is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue
water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of
this section exists and to take such other precautionary measures
deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the
public water system. Water service shall be discontinued only after
reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats.,
except as provided in Subsection G. Water service to such property
shall not be restored until the cross-connection(s) has been eliminated
in compliance with the provisions of this section.
G. If it is determined by the Water Utility that a cross-connection or an
emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires
immediate action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the
Village Clerk and delivered to the customer's premises, service may be
immediately discontinued. The customer shall have an opportunity for
hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., within 10 days of such emergency
discontinuance.

H. The Village of Pleasant Prairie adopts by reference the State Plumbing
Code of Wisconsin being Ch. Comm 82, Wis. Adm. Code. This section
does not supersede the State Plumbing Codes but is supplementary to
them.
A. Notice to connect. Whenever the public sewer or water system becomes
available to any public, commercial, mercantile or business building, or
any building used for human habitation, the Village Administrator shall
notify in writing the owner, agent or occupant thereof to connect
thereto all facilities required by the Village Administrator. If the person
to whom notice has been given fails to comply within 10 days after
notice, the Village Administrator shall cause the necessary connections
to be made, and the expense thereof shall be assessed as a special tax
against the property pursuant to § 281.45, Wis. Stats. [Amended
3-2-2009 by Ord. No. 09-04]
B. Deferred payment. The owner or his agent or the occupant may, within

Village Treasurer electing to pay the amount of the assessment in 10
equal annual installments with interest on the unpaid balance at 12%
per year.
C. Privies and waterless toilets prohibited. After connection of any
building to a sewer main hereunder, no privy or waterless toilet shall be
used in connection with such building.

A. Purpose.
(1) To prevent unused and/or improperly constructed wells from
serving as a passage for contaminated surface or near surface
waters or other materials to reach the usable groundwater. These
wells shall be properly filled and sealed.
§ 355-14 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 355-16
344:576
(2) To prevent unused, unsafe and noncomplying wells from acting as
vertical conduits for aquifer contamination or as sources of unsafe
water that could enter the public water system through crossconnections.
B. Required well abandonment. Wells that do not have a valid operational
permit issued pursuant to Subsection D below, wells which are not
routinely used, wells which are in noncompliance with Ch. NR 812 or
wells which test bacteriologically unsafe shall be property sealed and
abandoned in accordance with Ch. NR 812 by an established date not to
exceed one year from date of connection to the public system or date of
discovery or construction.
C. Coverage. All private wells located on any premises which are served by
the public water system of the Village shall be properly filled by June 1,
1985. Only those wells for which a well operation permit has been
granted by the Village of Pleasant Prairie may be exempted from this
requirement, subject to conditions of maintenance and operation.
D. Well operation permits. A permit may be granted to a well owner to
operate a well for a period not to exceed five years if the following
requirements are met:
(1) The well and pump installation meet the requirements of Ch. NR
812, Wis. Adm. Code, and the well constructor's report is on file
with the Department of Natural Resources, or certification of the
acceptability of the well has been granted by the Private Water
Supply Section of the Department of Natural Resources.
(2) The well has a history of producing safe water and in accordance
with § NR 810.16, Wis. Adm. Code, presently produces
bacteriologically safe water as evidenced by one sample. A
minimum of one safe sample be taken prior to issuing or reissuing
the permit to establish that the water is bacteriologically safe.
(3) The proposed use of the well can be justified as being necessary in
addition to water provided by the public water system.
(4) No physical connection shall exist between the piping of the public
water system and the private well in accordance with § NR 812.26,
Wis. Adm. Code.
E. Cost of well operation inspections and permits. The cost of a well
inspection and to obtain a well operation permit is $50, which permit is
valid for five years. This cost will be added onto your utility bill. In the
case of a shared well, only the parcel containing the physical well will
be required to obtain a permit. Any residence connected to a shared
well must pass all required inspections and produce one safe water
sample as is required by the permit holder. Failed well inspections will
result in the need for a reinspection which is an additional $25 per
inspection. [Amended 8-20-2018 by Ord. No. 18-34]

material and prior to the required inspection. In addition,
the area shall be left open and secured by the contractor
for the inspector to verify proper abandonment.
[3] If applicable, the private well shall be properly abandoned
per the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) requirements. The contractor shall provide the
Village with a copy of the Wisconsin DNR well
abandonment report.

soon as possible after the electrical service to the structure is
completed. In no case shall municipal sewer and water service be
installed prior to permanent installation of a sump pump. All such sump
pumps shall discharge at least eight feet from the foundation wall until
the sump pump discharge can be permanently connected to the
municipal storm sewer system, if available.
Q. Top of foundation and grade levels. The height of all proposed top of
foundations and grades for single-family, two-family, and multifamily
structures shall conform to the following:

(4) Top of foundation elevation shall conform to the following:
(a) The top of foundation shall comply with the approved
engineering plans for a subdivision located within the Village,
except as provided in Subsection Q(4)(b) below. Any changes to
the top of foundation shall be approved in writing by the
developer of the subdivision and the developer's engineer, as
§ 370-19 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 370-19
344:604
authorized by the Village. An amended development
agreement shall be provided by the developer and approved
by the Village for all new subdivisions which modify the top of
foundation or drainage plans. Such agreement shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Village for any and all liabilities
associated with the modifications or changes to the Villageapproved
engineering plans.
(b) If there are no approved engineering plans on file with the
Village, the top-of-foundation elevation shall be approved by
the inspector based on the following criteria:
[1] An average of the top of foundation of the adjacent
structures. Example: Existing Dwelling No. 1: 650 feet;
Existing Dwelling No. 2: 656 feet; top of foundation for
new dwelling: 653 feet.
[2] The top of foundation shall not be less than one foot or
more than two feet above the center line of the average
height of the adjacent roadway, except that if the existing
lot grade is more than two feet above existing road grade,
the inspector may approve a top of foundation that
exceeds two feet above the center of the average height of
the adjacent roadway.
[3] In the event that extraordinary or unusual circumstances
exist on the property, the Village may consider altering the
top of foundation; however, the Village may impose other
requirements to ensure that the structure will not cause a
drainage problem.
[4] In all cases, the top-of-foundation elevation shall be
approved by the Village.
R. Unsafe electrical equipment. No person shall keep, offer for sale or sell
within the Village any appliance, equipment or fixtures designed for or
intended to be used for the production, transmission or utilization of
electric current or power unless said appliances, equipment or fixtures
are approved by the electrical inspector in accordance with the
requirements set forth in the Wisconsin State Electrical Code.
S. Well abandonment. All persons abandoning a well within the Village
shall complete the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) Form 3300-5B. The property owner/contractor shall submit one
copy to the DNR and one copy to the Village, and one copy shall be
retained by the person/contractor performing the abandonment
procedures. If the abandonment is not performed by a licensed well
contractor, an inspection shall be required prior to filling the well
casing.

A. The inspector may issue a stop-work order for construction to be
stopped for any of the following reasons:
(1) If written violations are not corrected within 30 days.
(2) Construction significantly deviates from approved and permitted
plans, as determined by the inspector.
(3) When construction is dangerously unsafe, as determined by the
inspector.
(4) The inspector is denied access to property.
B. The stop-work order shall be posted at the construction site, and the
property owner and contractor shall be notified in writing of the
reasons for issuance of the stop-work order and corrections required

other Village ordinance are paid to the Village Treasurer.
(2) Whenever any construction, use, occupancy or other work
requiring a permit, certificate, or approval within the Village's
ordinances is commenced, resumed or continued before such a
permit, certificate or approval is issued, the fees for reviewing and
processing the application for such permit shall be tripled to take

owner to complete the required work within a reasonable time
period. Upon failure to complete the work, the Village is authorized
to complete the work and charge the work against the deposited
cash and accrued interest. If the work completed by the Village is
less than the deposited cash and accrued interest, the remainder
will be returned to the landowner. Additional costs to complete the
work will be assessed to the property at the end of the year and
placed on the tax assessment roll.
E. Street-sweeping cash deposit. Prior to an erosion control permit being
issued for land disturbance associated with preliminary grading, mass
grading or any project, other than individual permits for single-family
and two-family dwellings or minor land activities, the landowner shall
submit a street-sweeping cash deposit to guarantee to the Village that
the conditions of the erosion control permit and this chapter are being
followed as they relate to maintaining the public right-of-way and
stormwater drainage system. The cash deposit shall be used if the
Village determines that the landowner or his contractors have not kept
the right(s)-of-way clean from mud tracking, if erosion control measures
are damaged or if there is damage to stormwater drainage
improvements. The Village shall notify the owner if any mud tracking or
damaged erosion control measures or stormwater drainage
improvements exist, providing them with a time frame to clean the
streets or fix the damaged erosion control measures or stormwater
drainage improvement. If the road is not clean and the damaged
erosion control measures or stormwater drainage improvements are
not completed in the time frame specified, the Village may complete the
work and draw upon the street-sweeping cash deposit for the actual
costs. If the cash is depleted prior to the project being completed, the
owner shall post another cash deposit in the same amount. The cash

meaning is clearly suggested by the context in which they appear. As used in
this chapter, "shall" is mandatory and "may" is permissive. Singular words
generally include the plural and vice versa. Words of a particular gender
generally include all genders.
§ 395-5. Severability.
In the event that any section, subsection or provision of this chapter is
adjudged to be unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall be deemed to be severable,
shall not be affected by such judgment and shall remain in full force and
effect.
§ 395-6. Disclaimer of liability.
The Village does not guarantee, warrant or represent that only those areas
delineated as floodplains on plats, certified survey maps, and development
plans will be subject to periodic inundation, nor does the Village guarantee,
warrant or represent that only those soils shown to be unsuited for
particular purposes on plats, certified survey maps, or development plans
will be unsuited for such purposes, and, therefore, the Village asserts that
there is no liability on the part of the Village, its agencies or employees
with respect to flooding, sanitation or structural problems that may occur
as a result of reliance upon or conformance with this chapter or any plats,
certified survey maps, or development plans approved pursuant to this
chapter.

§ 395-13. Condominiums.
B. Certain condominiums. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to
conversion condominiums or to condominiums involving only a single
principal building per lot or parcel.
C. Miscellaneous discretionary exemptions. In unusual circumstances,
where a particular proposed land division, condominium plat,
development or replat is technically subject to this chapter but poses
none of the potential problems addressed by this chapter, the Village
Board may, after the required preapplication staff conference, and after
review and recommendation by the Plan Commission, exempt a
particular land division from the requirements of this chapter. The
Board shall make an express finding that compliance is unnecessary to
accomplish the purposes of this chapter. This subsection shall not be
utilized, under any circumstances, to exempt any proposed land
division that would result in the creation of a new buildable lot.
A. Applicability. This chapter is applicable to all condominiums except
conversion condominiums and condominiums involving only a single
principal building per lot or parcel. In applying this chapter to
condominiums, the principles set out below shall govern.
B. Treatment.
(1) Five or more units. Any condominium having a maximum number of
five or more principal buildings per lot or parcel, including
buildings containing any condominium units or portions thereof
which may be added in a future expansion pursuant to § 703.26,
Wis. Stats., shall be treated and processed in the same manner as a
large lot subdivision.
(2) Four or fewer units. Any condominium having a maximum number
of four principal buildings per lot or parcel, including buildings
containing any condominium units or portions thereof which may
be added in a future expansion pursuant to § 703.26, Wis. Stats.,
shall be treated and processed in the same manner as a minor land
division.
(3) Expansion. Any expansion of a condominium permitted under
§ 703.26, Wis. Stats., shall be treated as a separate phase in
accordance with §§ 395-30K and 395-19E of this chapter.
(4) Reference to plats and maps. As applied to condominiums, all
references in this chapter to a preliminary or final plat or to a
certified survey map shall be deemed to be referenced to the
condominium instruments, including the condominium plat,
declarations, plans and related exhibits or schedules.
(5) References to divider. As applied to condominiums, all references
in this chapter to a divider shall be deemed to be references to the
condominium declarant.
§ 395-12 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-13
344:657
(6) Conflicts. In the event of any conflict between the mandatory
requirements of Ch. 703, Wis. Stats., and the provisions of this
chapter, the mandatory requirements of Ch. 703 shall control.
(7) Artificial lot lines. Unless a condominium development has been
approved as a planned unit development under Chapter 420,
Zoning Ordinance, of the Village Code or involves only one
principal building per lot or parcel, closing and nonoverlapping
artificial lot lines shall be placed around the site of each proposed
principal building on the condominium plat, or on a separate scaled
exhibit, to demonstrate that the spirit of the dimensional
requirements of § 395-63 of this chapter is satisfied.
(8) Fees. Each principal building involved in a condominium, exclusive
of principal buildings involved in a potential condominium
expansion under § 703.26, Wis. Stats., shall be deemed to be a lot
for purposes of the fees provided for in Article X of this chapter.
Each declared residential condominium unit, exclusive of potential
expansion units, shall be deemed to be a buildable residential lot
for purposes of the fees provided for in Article X of this chapter.
Fees relating to expansion units and principal buildings associated
with such expansion units shall be payable in connection with the
approval of the expansion as a separate phase under Subsection
B(3) above.
(9) Interpretation. Other than as specifically provided in this section,
this chapter shall be interpreted with respect to condominiums in a
common sense manner to achieve the purposes of this chapter. The
Village Board may waive technical compliance of a condominium
with the requirements of this chapter after making an express
finding, recorded in the minutes, that such compliance is
unnecessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.
C. Unlawful activity.
(1) It shall be unlawful to, and no person shall:
(a) Record, with respect to any condominium to which this chapter
is applicable, any condominium instrument after the effective
date of this chapter unless and until such time as there has
been full compliance with all applicable requirements of this
chapter and each of the statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances
and documents enumerated in § 395-11A of this chapter;
(b) Convey any condominium unit created in violation of this
chapter;
(c) Construct, install, assemble or place any building, structure or
improvement upon any land subject to condominium

and no Village zoning, building or occupancy permit or
approval shall be granted or issued with respect to any
condominium or condominium unit created in violation of this
chapter.
(2) This subsection shall be deemed to be a condominium supplement
to § 395-14 of this chapter. In the event of any inconsistency
between this Subsection C and § 395-14 of this chapter, this
subsection shall control.
A. Violations. Except as is specifically provided in this chapter, it shall be
unlawful to, and no person shall, after the effective date of this chapter:
(1) Divide any land located within the jurisdictional limits of this
chapter, or convey any interest in any such land, or create a
condominium to which this chapter is applicable with respect to
any such land, or take any other action regarding any such land so
as to create a land division (as defined in this chapter), unless and
until such time as there has been full compliance with all applicable
requirements of this chapter;
(2) Record any preliminary or final plat, replat, certified survey map,
condominium plat or declaration plat or declaration (other than
with respect to a condominium to which this chapter is not
applicable), conveyance or any other evidence of a land division
made in violation of this chapter;
(3) Construct, install, assemble or place any building, structure, or
improvement upon any lot, parcel of land or condominium which
was created by a land division made in violation of this chapter; or
(4) Fail to comply with any applicable provision of this chapter.
B. Permits; approvals. No Village zoning, building or occupancy permit or
approval shall be granted or issued with respect to any land division, lot
or parcel of land created in violation of this chapter or with respect to a
development that is not in compliance with the applicable requirements
of this chapter. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
A. The divider or developer may request the Village to design, construct,
install, provide and complete all required public improvements at the
divider's/developer's cost. If the divider/developer makes such a
request and if the Village agrees to design, construct, install, provide
and complete all required public improvements, § 395-19I of this
chapter regarding the divider's warranty, indemnification and hold
harmless agreement shall be inapplicable. Alternatively, the divider/
developer may assume the responsibility for designing, constructing,

344:659
§ 395-16. Development agreement. [Amended 12-19-2005 by Ord.
No. 05-59]
installing, providing and completing all required public improvements,
subject to the requirements of this chapter, at the divider's/developer's
cost.
B. Solely at its option, the Village Board may, under the limited
circumstances set out below, specially assess public improvement costs
required by this chapter and finance such improvements with special
assessment B bonds pursuant to § 66.0713, Wis. Stats., as amended
from time to time. The Village Board shall not approve the use of special
assessment B bonds in connection with public improvements required
by this chapter unless it first makes each of the following findings:
(1) That issuance of such bonds will not increase the Village's costs
with respect to other financing activity, e.g., by making any other
contemplated financing non-bank-qualified;
(2) That the Village will receive a substantial benefit, in terms of
facilitating desirable projects outside of the proposed land division
or curing or mitigating problems outside of the proposed land
division, as a result of completion of public improvements required
for the proposed land division; and
(3) That the divider's/developer's credentials, record of successful
developments, financial soundness, project plans, proffered
security and marketing strategy and plans convince the Board that
the Village will not incur any significant risk of having to raise
additional funds to retire such bonds. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this chapter to the contrary, if the Village Board
decides to utilize special assessment B bonds to finance required
public improvements, it may modify in the development agreement
the payment requirements and the letter of credit requirements set
out elsewhere in this chapter.
A. General requirement. Before or as a condition of receiving final
approval from the Village Board (or from the Village Plan Commission
or the Village Zoning Administrator with respect to a site and
operational plan to be approved under § 420-56 of the Village Code) of
any final plat or certified survey map relating to a land division or land
development plan within the Village, with respect to which public and/
or private improvements are required under this chapter, or with
respect to which public and/or private improvements, dedications or
fees are being deferred under this chapter, or with respect to which
phasing approval is being granted under this chapter, the divider/
developer shall sign and file with the Village Board a development
agreement. The Village Board may require a development agreement in
other situations where such an agreement is desirable to accomplish
the purposes of this chapter. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
§ 395-15 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-16
344:660
B. Provision for public improvements. In the development agreement, the
divider/developer shall either engage the Village to design, construct,
install, provide and complete all required public improvements, and
agree to pay for all such improvements, or the divider/developer shall
agree to assume full responsibility for designing, constructing,
installing, providing and completing all such improvements, in a timely
and workmanlike manner, to the satisfaction of the Village, and in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the final plat, certified
survey map, or development plan approved by the Village Board (or the
site and operational plan approved by the Village Plan Commission or
the Village Zoning Administrator under § 420-56 of the Village Code),
the development agreement and plans and specifications approved by
the Village Board in conjunction with its final approval of the plat,
certified survey map or development plan or in conjunction with the
final approval of the Village Plan Commission or the Village Zoning
Administrator of any site and operational plan. The development
agreement shall provide that the divider's/developer's obligations
regarding required public improvements and the payment for such
improvements shall not be contingent upon the divider/developer
commencing construction of any buildings or selling any lots. The
development agreement shall also provide that no breach of the
development agreement by the Village shall be deemed to excuse or
justify a failure by the divider/developer to complete the required public
improvements in accordance with the requirements of the development
agreement unless the Village's breach renders such completion
impossible. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
C. Provision for private improvements. The Village Board may approve and
require private improvements in lieu of certain public improvements. In
such event, the required private improvements shall be provided for in
the development agreement. Except as otherwise specifically provided
in the development agreement or in a planned development zoning
ordinance, such required private improvements shall be subject to the
same requirements and procedures as required public improvements
under this Chapter 395 and other related chapters of the Village Code
(e.g., Chapters 180, 285, 300, 305, 355, 370, 381 and 405), except that
required private improvements shall not be dedicated to the Village. If
and to the extent that the Village Board allows and requires private
improvements, the provisions of this chapter and of other related
chapters of the Village Code (e.g., Chapters 180, 285, 300, 305, 355,
370, 381 and 405) shall be deemed to apply to such required private
improvements, and words, phrases or references typically associated
with public improvements shall be construed to include the equivalent
words, phrases or references typically associated with private
improvements (e.g., public street shall be construed to include
private road, and public street rights-of-way shall be construed to
include private road easements). In any event, the divider/developer
shall assume the responsibility for designing, constructing, installing,
providing and completing, at the cost of the divider/developer, all
required private improvements in a timely and workmanlike manner, to
§ 395-16 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-16
344:661
the satisfaction of the Village, and in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter, the final plat, certified survey map, or development
plan approved by the Village Board (or the site and operational plan
approved by the Village Plan Commission or Village Zoning
Administrator under § 420-56 of the Village Code) and plans and
specifications approved by the Village Board in conjunction with its
final approval of the plat, certified survey map or development plan (or
in conjunction with the final approval of the Village Plan Commission
or Village Zoning Administrator of any site and operational plan.) The
development agreement shall provide that the divider's/developer's
obligations regarding required private improvements and the payment
for such improvements shall not be contingent upon the divider/
developer commencing construction of any buildings or selling any
lots. The development agreement shall also provide that no breach of
the development agreement by the Village shall be deemed to excuse
or justify a failure by the divider/developer to complete the required
private improvements in accordance with the requirements of the
development agreement unless the Village's breach renders such
completion impossible. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
D. Other provisions. Additionally, the development agreement shall
provide, as appropriate and without limitation, for the payment of fees,
the deadline for completion of the various required public and/or
private improvements, possible deferment of second or third phase of
street improvements, contractors' contracts, performance and payment
bonds and certificates of insurance, payment for the required public
and/or private improvements, an irrevocable letter of credit or other
approved security to secure the divider's/developer's obligations,
possible supplemental letters of credit, reduction of the remaining
balance of any letter of credit upon acceptance by the Village of
dedications of public improvements and in other specified
circumstances, dedication and acceptance of interests in land and
public improvements, covenants, restrictions, and easements on the
use of land, acceptance of private improvements, streetlighting, street
signage and street landscaping, title commitment insurance and lien
waivers, representations and warranties, investigations and remedial
action regarding environmental pollution or contamination, procedures
in the event of a breach, the indemnification of the Village, its
employees and consulting engineers for and the holding of the Village,
its employees and consulting engineers harmless against any costs or
damages or liability resulting from defects in required public and/or
private improvements provided by the divider/developer, and any other
requirements to protect the public health, safety and welfare or to
accomplish the purposes of this chapter which the Village Board
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
E. Approval. The development agreement shall be drafted or approved as
to form by the Village Attorney and shall be approved by the Village
Board prior to final approval of the plat, certified survey map or land
development plan.
§ 395-16 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-16
344:662
§ 395-17. Letter of credit. [Amended 12-19-2005 by Ord. No. 05-59]
F. Memorandum of agreement. The Village Board shall require the
divider/developer to sign a recordable memorandum of the
development agreement as a condition of the Village Board's final
approval of the plat, certified survey map and/or development plan.
G. Memorandum of understanding agreement. The Village Board may
require the divider/developer to sign a recordable memorandum of
understanding agreement regarding the financial commitments for offsite
required public and/or private improvements as a condition of the
Village Board's final approval of the proposed plat, certified survey map
and/or development plan.
A. General requirement. As a condition to receiving final approval from
the Village Board (or from the Village Plan Commission or Village
Zoning Administrator with respect to a site and operational plan to be
approved under § 420-56 of the Village Code) of any final plat, certified
survey map, or land development plan approval relating to land located
within the Village, the divider/developer shall file with the Village Board
an irrevocable letter of credit or an irrevocable standby letter of credit
to secure the divider's/developer's obligation to pay for the design,
construction, installation, provision and completion of all required
public and/or private improvements, including but not limited to
cleaning and televising of the public and/or private improvements, field
staking, inspection and construction, administration of the public and/
or private improvements, landscaping, lighting and signage public and/
or private improvements and construction contingencies, and
engineering, legal and administrative costs. When the divider/
developer has assumed the responsibility for designing, constructing,
installing, providing and completing required public and/or private
improvements, the letter of credit shall also secure the divider's/
developer's agreement to indemnify the Village, its employees and
consulting engineers for, and hold the Village, its employees and
consulting engineers harmless against, all costs, damages and liability
resulting from defects in such public and/or private improvements. The
letter of credit shall be drafted and approved as to form by the Village
Attorney and shall be approved by the Village Board. As an alternative,
the Village Board may accept cash payments as another acceptable
means of security as determined by the Village Board and as a condition
of final plat, certified survey map or development plan approval for the
cost of public and/or private improvements. [Amended 5-7-2007 by
Ord. No. 07-20]
B. Particular requirement.
(1) Amount. The amount of the irrevocable letter of credit shall be
125% of the total estimated costs of the required public and/or
private improvements and related costs and contingencies noted
above in Subsection A.
§ 395-16 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-17
344:663
(2) Issuer. The irrevocable letter of credit shall be issued by a financial
institution satisfactory to the Village Board.
(3) Payment. The irrevocable letter of credit on the financial
institution's letterhead shall be payable to the Village at a
convenient location, at sight, upon presentment of the Village's
draft, the original letter of credit and any amendments thereto, and
the affidavit of the Village President or Village Administrator, duly
signed and sworn to before a notary public and attested by the
Village Clerk, stating that the Village Board, at a meeting duly held
on a specified date, duly approved a draft upon the letter of credit
in the specified amount. Partial drawings upon the letter of credit
shall be allowed.
(4) Expiration. The irrevocable letter of credit shall expire, by its
terms, one year after the latest date on which the last to be
completed of the required public and/or private improvements
must be completed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and
the provisions of the development agreement entered into by and
between the divider/developer and the Village, unless other
arrangements have been agreed upon and approved by the Village
Board.
(5) Reduction. The irrevocable letter of credit supplied by a divider/
developer who has assumed responsibility for providing the
required public and/or private improvements shall state that the
remaining balance of the letter of credit will be reduced, and the
amount of the reduction will be made available to the divider/
developer, upon presentment of the Village's written request for
such a reduction, the original letter of credit and any amendments
thereto, and the affidavit of the Village President or Village
Administrator, duly signed and sworn to before a notary public and
attested by the Village Clerk, stating that the Village Board at a
meeting duly held on a specified date duly approved a reduction in
the remaining balance of the letter of credit by a specified amount
and the release of such amount to the divider/developer.
(6) Administrative processing fee. An administrative processing fee
shall be provided by the divider/developer to the Village Treasurer
as a condition of final approval of the final plat, certified survey
map or development plan for the administration and financial
processing of the irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposits made
with the Village. The total amount of the administrative processing
fee shall be equal to 0.0075% of the total cost of the irrevocable
letter of credit, cash payment or other acceptable means of security
(a total of 0.0050% x the letter of credit for Finance administrative
processing fee and 0.0025% x the letter of credit for Community
Development administrative processing fee).
C. Supplemental letter of credit. The Village Board may require the
divider/developer to deliver to it a supplemental irrevocable letter of
§ 395-17 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-17
344:664
credit if it determines that the actual cost of completing any class
of required public and/or private improvements will exceed 125% of
the total amount of the estimated cost of that class of improvements
utilized in determining the amount of the existing letter of credit. If the
divider/developer has assumed responsibility for providing the required
public improvements, and/or is providing private improvements, then
the divider/developer shall promptly notify the Village Administrator
of any change order causing an increase in the estimated cost of
completing any required public and/or private improvements of which
the divider/developer has knowledge or notice.
D. Reduction.
(1) If the divider/developer has assumed responsibility for providing
required public improvements, and/or is providing required private
improvements, then upon the Village Board's acceptance by
resolution of the dedication and/or acceptance of any class of
public improvements, the Board shall promptly authorize the issuer
of the irrevocable letter of credit to reduce the remaining balance
of such letter of credit by the amount that was attributed to the cost
of the accepted class of improvements, including the associated
amounts for construction contingencies and engineering, legal and
administrative costs, in determining the amount of the existing
letter(s) of credit. For good cause shown, the Village Board may
make arrangements for periodically reducing the remaining
balance of any letter of credit in the development agreement. If the
Village has provided the public improvements, then upon the
Village's acceptance of the divider's/developer's dedication of the
last to be completed and dedicated class of public improvements,
the Village Board shall promptly authorize the issuer to cancel the
letter of credit. If the divider/developer has provided the public
and/or private improvements, however, the Board shall withhold
and not authorize the release of 15% of the original amount of the
letter(s) of credit for the period of one year after the acceptance of
the last to be completed and/or dedicated class of improvements
for the purpose of securing the divider's/developer's warranty, hold
harmless and indemnification agreement. After such one-year
period, if no defects have appeared in the public and/or private
improvements, the Village Board shall promptly authorize the
issuer to cancel the letter of credit. However, if it can be proven
that a defect had occurred in the public and/or private
improvements under the one-year warranty period, then the
developer shall be responsible for correcting the deficiency at the
divider's/developer's cost.
(2) Reduction in the letter of credit or any supplemental letter of credit
other than as a result of a draw by the Village shall be permitted
only in accordance with the following procedures:
(a) The developer may submit written requests to the Village for a
reduction in the letter of credit not more often than one per
§ 395-17 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-17
344:665
calendar month. Any such request shall be accompanied by
copies of original lien waivers from contractors,
subcontractors and suppliers. The Village Board shall review
the lien waivers and other documentation received from the
developer and reports from the Village's engineering
consultants regarding the status of the work in progress for
which such reduction in the letter of credit is claimed and the
recommendations of such consultants regarding the amount of
the letter of credit to be released based on the percentage of
work completed. The Village Board shall authorize a reduction
of the letter of credit in an amount proportionate to the
percentage of the work completed to the extent the Village
Board is satisfied that appropriate payment has been made for
such work.
(b) After the completion of a classification of the required public
and/or private improvements and the Village's inspection and
testing of such classification of improvements and conditional
approval thereof pursuant to a letter of substantial completion,
the delivery to the Village of satisfactory evidence that there is
no unpaid work with respect to the classification in question
for which a mechanic's or supplier's lien may be imposed, the
dedication by the developer of any such completed public
improvements to the Village and the formal acceptance thereof
by the Village pursuant to a resolution by the Village Board, the
Village Board shall promptly authorize a reduction in the
letter(s) of credit. The amount of any such reduction shall be
the remaining amount (including the twenty-five-percent
contingency calculated on such amount) that was attributed to
the identified itemized listing of such completed improvements
in determining the amount of the letter(s) of credit and in any
determination of the Village Board to require a supplemental
letter of credit. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
E. Treatment in development agreement. The development agreement
entered into by and between the divider/developer and the Village shall
specify the circumstances under which the Village is entitled to draw
upon the letter of credit or is required to approve the reduction or
cancellation of the letter of credit. If the Village will be responsible for
providing the required public improvements, the Village shall be
entitled to draw upon the letter of credit as needed to pay for the
design, construction, installation and provision of the improvements. If
and to the extent the divider/developer will be responsible for providing
the required public and/or private improvements, the Village shall
generally be entitled to draw upon the letter of credit only if the divider/
developer fails to discharge its obligations under this chapter and
development agreement. The Village Board shall approve each draw
upon a letter of credit, each reduction in the remaining balance of the
letter of credit and each cancellation of the letter of credit.
§ 395-17 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-18
344:666
§ 395-18. Dedications and reservations.
A. Sites for public purposes; open spaces. In the design and approval of
any plat, certified survey map, or development plan, due consideration
shall be given to the establishment or preservation of appropriate sites

improvements, facilities or uses, and the preservation of scenic and
historic sites, stands of fine trees, wetlands, floodplains, lakes, ponds,
watercourses or other desirable, unusual or environmentally sensitive
natural features or archaeologically significant areas.
B. Mandatory dedications.
(1) Dedication of streets. The divider/developer of any proposed land
division or development within the Village shall dedicate to the
Village, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances (except as may
be approved in the development agreement entered into by and
between the divider/developer and the Village), and without
compensation, appropriate dedications for public streets or alleys
required or proposed to serve such land division or development
and for all sanitary sewerage system facilities, water system
facilities, storm sewer and drainage system facilities, sidewalks or
pedestrian walkways, street trees or other public improvements or
facilities to be constructed or located in such streets or alleys.
(2) Dedication for other public improvements. The divider/developer of
any proposed land division or development within the Village shall
dedicate to the Village, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances
(except as may be approved in the development agreement entered
into by and between the divider/developer and the Village) and
without compensation, appropriate dedications for all sanitary
sewerage system facilities, water system facilities, storm sewer or
drainage system facilities, sidewalks, pedestrian walkways, bridges
or other public improvements or facilities required or proposed to
serve such land division or development and not located within
public streets or alleys, together with any construction or access
easements required in connection with such public improvements
or facilities.
(3) Dedication of easements for public or private utilities. The divider/
developer of any proposed land division or development within the

developer of any proposed land division or development with the
Village shall dedicate to the Village, free and clear of all liens and
§ 395-18 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-18
344:667
encumbrances (except as may be approved in the development
agreement entered into by and between the divider/developer and
the Village) and without compensation, appropriate easements for
all private sanitary sewerage system facilities, water system
facilities, storm sewer or drainage system facilities, sidewalks,
pedestrian walkways or bridges, park areas, or other private
improvements or facilities required or purposed to serve such land
division or development and not located within dedicated public
streets or alleys, together with any construction or access
easements required in connection with such private improvements
or facilities.
C. Dedication or reservations for other public purposes. [Amended
5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
(1) Public facilities shown on a Comprehensive Plan component.
Whenever a proposed land division or development within the
Village of Pleasant Prairie encompasses all or any part of the site of
a proposed arterial or collector street, public way, park,
playground, school, sanitary sewerage system facility, water
system facility, storm sewer or drainage system facility or
drainageway or any other public improvement, facility or use, the
location of which has been designated on a Comprehensive Plan
component, a suitably located site of adequate size and shape for
the intended purpose, or an appropriate interest therein, shall be
dedicated or temporarily reserved for possible public acquisition as
a condition to final approval of any plat, certified survey map, or
development plan by the Village Board (or by the Village Plan
Commission or Village Zoning Administrator with respect to a site
and operational plan to be approved under § 420-56 of the Village
Code, subject to ratification by the Village Board) unless the Village
Board expressly waives or modifies this requirement. Whether
requiring the dedication of such a site necessitates the payment of
just compensation shall be determined by the Village Board prior to
final approval of the plat, certified survey map, or development
plan.
(2) Other public facilities. The Village Board (or the Village Plan
Commission or Village Administrator with respect to approval of a
site and operational plan under § 420-56 of the Village Code,
subject to Village Board ratification) may require, as a condition to
final approval of any proposed plat, certified survey map, or
development plan within the Village, the dedication or temporary
reservation for possible public acquisition of a suitably located site
of adequate size and shape for any public improvement, facility or
use, or an appropriate interest therein. Whether requiring the
dedication of such site requires the payment of just compensation
shall be determined by the Village Board prior to final approval of
the plat, certified survey map, or development plan.
§ 395-18 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-18
344:668
(3) Preservation easements; restrictive covenants. The Village Board
(or the Village Plan Commission or Village Zoning Administrator
with respect to a site and operational plan to be approved under
§ 420-56 of the Village Code, subject to Village Board ratification)
may require, as a condition to final approval of any proposed plat,
certified survey map, or development plan within the Village, the
dedication or temporary reservation for possible public acquisition
of preservation or scenic easements, or the imposition of restrictive
covenants running with the land, to preserve and protect scenic
and historic sites, stands of fine trees, wetlands, floodplains, lakes,
ponds, watercourses or other desirable, unusual or
environmentally sensitive natural features or archaeologically
significant areas or otherwise to accomplish the purposes and
intent of this chapter. Whether the requirement of such dedications
or covenants necessitates the payment of just compensation shall
be determined by the Village Board prior to final approval of the
plat, certified survey map, or development plan.
D. Temporary reservations for possible public acquisition.
(1) Significance. The significance of land or an interest in land being
temporarily reserved for possible acquisition for a public purpose
or use on a plat, certified survey map, or development plan is that
the divider's/developer's proposed use or development of the area
in question is inconsistent with a possible public use of such area,
which is under active consideration, and approval of the divider's/
developer's proposed use or development is temporarily rejected
pending the outcome of the planning process relating to the
possible public use of the area.
(2) Statement of reservation. Whenever any land or an interest in land
is temporarily reserved on a plat, certified survey map, or
development plan for possible acquisition for a public purpose or
use, the plat, certified survey map, or other recorded document
shall show the boundaries of the land affected by such temporary
reservation and shall contain a statement of the purpose of the
reservation, the interest reserved and the conditions upon which
the reservation will terminate and upon which the land will be
released from such reservation.
(3) Duration of reservation. Any temporary reservation for possible
acquisition for a public purpose or use on an approved plat,
certified survey map, or other recordable document shall
automatically terminate one year after the last required approval of
the plat or certified survey map or development plan, unless the
reserved land or the reserved interest therein shall have been
acquired and an appropriate conveyance shall have been recorded
in the office of the Register of Deeds for Kenosha County, prior to
the end of such period, or unless a jurisdictional offer to acquire
such land or interest shall have been made and a lis pendens shall
have been recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds for
§ 395-18 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-18
344:669
Kenosha County pursuant to § 32.05, Wis. Stats., prior to the end
of such period, or unless a petition for condemnation proceedings
shall have been filed in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County and
a lis pendens shall have been recorded pursuant to § 32.06, Wis.
Stats., prior to the end of such period, or unless the reservation
period shall have been extended by written agreement signed by
the divider/developer and owner, if the owner and divider/
developer are not the same, and recorded prior to the end of such
period. A statement to this effect shall be made on the final plat,
certified survey map or other recordable document. If the Village
Board determines not to acquire the reserved land or interest in
land, or receives an official communication from the public body
having authority to acquire the reserved land or interest therein
for the contemplated purpose stating that it has determined not to
acquire such land or interest, prior to the automatic termination
of the temporary reservation, the Village Board shall promptly
cause an appropriate document to be recorded evidencing the
termination or removal of the temporary reservation.
(4) Conditional approval. To reduce any potential hardship imposed on
a divider/developer by a temporary reservation of land or an
interest in land for possible public acquisition, the Village Board (or
the Village Plan Commission or Village Zoning Administrator with
respect to a site and operational plan under § 420-56 of the Village
Code) shall permit the plat, certified survey map, or development
plan to show the ultimate treatment of the land affected by such
reservation in the event that the reserved land or interest therein is
not acquired for a public purpose. Such approved ultimate
treatment shall be expressly conditioned, on the face of the plat,
certified survey map, or development plan, upon the termination or
removal of the reservation. Such conditional approval shall not be
effective until the termination or removal of the reservation.
[Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
E. Compensation.
(1) Amount of compensation. Whenever an interest in land is to be
dedicated or acquired after a temporary reservation for possible
public acquisition, under circumstances requiring the payment of
just compensation, the amount of compensation shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of Ch. 32, Wis. Stats.,
as amended from time to time.
(2) Disagreement on amount of compensation. Whenever the Village
Board shall have determined that the payment of just compensation
is required in connection with the acquisition of land or an interest
in land, but the amount of compensation to be paid cannot be
agreed upon by the Village Board and the divider/developer (and
the owner, if the divider/developer is not the owner) prior to the
Village Board's final approval of the plat, certified survey map, or
development plan, the interest in the land in question shall be
§ 395-18 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-18
344:670
temporarily reserved for possible public acquisition, and any
acquisition shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Ch.
32, Wis. Stats., as amended from time to time.
F. Statement of dedications and restrictions.
(1) Dedications. Whenever an interest in land is dedicated on a plat or
certified survey map, the plat or certified survey map shall show
and describe the boundaries of the land affected by the dedication
and shall contain a statement of the purpose of the dedication and
the interest dedicated.
(2) Restrictions. Whenever land included in a plat, certified survey
map, or development plan is subject to restrictions running with
the land, the plat, certified survey map, or other recordable
document shall contain a statement of such restrictions and a
description of the area to which they apply. Alternatively, such
restrictions may be included in a separate, recordable document,
but such restrictions shall be referred to on the face of the plat,
certified survey map or development plan and shall be recorded by
the divider/developer with the plat or map. Any restrictions
required by the Village Board shall expressly state that they are
intended to benefit the Village, that they are enforceable by the
Village and that they shall not be modified without the express
written consent of the Village Board.
G. Acceptance of dedications. Dedications of interest in land shown on any
final plat or certified survey map shall be deemed to be accepted by the
Village Board upon granting final approval of such plat or map.
H. Environmental investigations. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No.
07-20]
(1) Investigations; tests. The Village Board (or the Village Plan
Commission or Village Zoning Administrator with respect to
approval of a site and operational plan under § 420-56 of the Village
Code) may, as a condition to approval of any proposed plat,
developer's certified survey map, or development plan, make or
cause to be made, at the divider's/developer's cost, such
investigations or tests regarding possible environmental
contamination or pollution of land that is affected by dedications
for public improvements, facilities or uses to serve the proposed
land division or development as the Board deems to be reasonable
and prudent under the circumstances.
(2) Remedial action. If such investigations or tests demonstrate that
the land is contaminated or polluted, the Board (or the Village Plan
Commission or Village Zoning Administrator with respect to
approval of a site and operational plan under § 420-56 of the Village
Code) may require the divider/developer, as a condition to final
approval of the plat, certified survey map, or development plan, to
§ 395-18 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-18
344:671
§ 395-19. Public improvements.
take reasonable and appropriate remedial action to protect the
public health, safety and welfare and to protect the Village from
potential liability.
(3) Representations; warranties. The Village Board (or the Village Plan
Commission or Village Zoning Administrator with respect to
approval of a site and operational plan under § 420-56 of the Village
Code) may also, as a condition to approval of any proposed plat,
certified survey map, or development plan, require the divider/
developer to make such representations and warranties regarding
possible contamination or pollution of land affected by proposed
dedications for public improvements, facilities or use as the Board
(or the Plan Commission or Zoning Administrator) deems to be
reasonable and prudent under the circumstances.
(4) Indemnity; hold harmless. In circumstances where the Board
concludes that there is risk of liability to the Village, the Board (or
the Village Plan Commission or Village Zoning Administrator,
having made such a conclusion with respect to approval of a site
and operational plan under § 420-56 of the Village Code) may
require the divider/developer to agree to indemnify the Village for,
and hold the Village harmless against, all costs, damages and
liability potentially resulting from contamination or pollution of
land affected by dedications for public improvements, facilities or
use.
A. Approval of contracts, contractors, performance and payment bonds
and certificates of insurance. All proposed contracts for the
construction, installation or provision of required public improvements,
and all contractors proposed to do such work, shall be subject to the
approval of the Village Board. The divider/developer shall provide to the
Village copies of adequate and appropriate contractor payment and
performance bonds for such work, and certificates of insurance with the
Village listed as an insured party to protect the Village, prior to the
Village's final review and approval of such contracts and approval of the
contractors. Only prequalified and preapproved contractors shall be
allowed to perform public improvement work in the Village.
B. Design. All public improvements shall be designed by a licensed
professional engineer, registered in the State of Wisconsin, in

chapter, the Village Code and ordinances, the development agreement
entered into by and between the divider/developer and the Village, or
the plans, specifications and profiles approved by the Village Board.
H. Dedication and acceptance.
(1) Dedication requirement. Subject to the provisions of this chapter,
the divider/developer shall, upon completion of each phase of the
public improvements (e.g., all first phase of public improvements),
unconditionally give, grant, convey and dedicate all required public
improvements to the Village, its successors and assigns forever,
free of charge to the Village, and free and clear of any
encumbrances whatsoever. Such dedication shall include, without
limitation, all buildings, structures, mains, pipes, conduits, lines,
machinery, equipment and appurtenances which in any way form a
part of or pertain to such improvements, together with any
easements necessary for access or maintenance.
(2) Form of dedication documents. The form of the dedication
documents shall be subject to approval by the Village Attorney.
(3) Acceptance of dedications. The dedication of each phase of public
improvements shall be specifically accepted by the Village Board,
and such acceptance shall be recorded in the minutes at such time
as such phase of public improvements is completed to the
satisfaction of the Village and in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter, the approved plans and specifications and the
development agreement entered into by and between the divider/
developer and the Village and the improvements are determined to
be free and clear of liens or encumbrances. A letter of substantial
completion shall be forwarded by the Village to the divider/
developer which identifies the phase of improvements that has
been completed and that the warranty period has commenced.
(4) Title evidence. When the Village is not awarding and administering
the construction contracts, the divider/developer shall provide to
the Village, at the divider's/developer's cost, satisfactory evidence
that each phase of public improvements dedicated to the Village is
owned by the divider/developer free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, including, without limitation, appropriate lien
waivers with respect to all work or materials supplied in connection
with each class of public improvements.
§ 395-19 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-19
344:674
§ 395-20. Land suitability.
(5) After acceptance. After the Village Board's acceptance of the
dedication of a phase of public improvements, the Village shall
have the duty to maintain such improvements, except as is
specifically provided by warranty in this chapter, and shall have the
right to connect to or to integrate with such improvements other
facilities or improvements with no payment or award to the divider/
developer and without the divider's/developer's consent.
I. Warranty, indemnification and hold harmless. If the divider/developer
assumes the responsibility of designing, constructing, installing and
providing the public improvements, the divider/developer shall warrant
all such improvements against defects due to faulty design, materials or
workmanship, or due to any failure to comply with the requirements of
this chapter or with the requirements of the development agreement
entered into by and between the divider/developer and the Village,
which appear and of which the divider/developer is notified in writing at
the divider's/developer's last known address within one year from the
date of the Village's acceptance of the dedication of such
improvements, or within one year after, or if it is proven by the Village
that the defect occurred during the warranty period, if the work or
materials in question are not incorporated into an improvement
dedicated to the Village. The divider/developer shall, at its cost,
promptly make any repairs or replacements necessary to correct any
such defects in a workmanlike manner and to the satisfaction of the
Village. The divider/developer shall agree to indemnify the Village for
and hold the Village harmless against the costs of any repairs or
replacements required by such defects, any resulting damage to Village
property, the costs and expenses of any resulting litigation (including
the Village's reasonable attorney fees) and any resulting liability
incurred by the Village. Additionally, the divider/developer shall, at its
cost, promptly replace any vegetative landscaping elements, not
planted by the Village, which die or are removed for any reason within
one year after the date of planting and of which the divider/developer is
notified by the Village in writing within such one-year period. Also,
street trees and grassy terraced areas in the right-of-way shall be
forever maintained and/or replanted by the abutting landowner.
A. Determination of unsuitability. No land shall be divided or developed for
residential, commercial, industrial, governmental, institutional or any
other urban land use if the land is determined to be unsuitable for such
use by the Village Board, after receiving the recommendation of the
Village Plan Commission and any other Village officials or consultants
as may be deemed appropriate by the Board, for reason of flooding,
inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock conditions, unfavorable
topography, contamination or any other feature, characteristic or
condition likely to be harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, or
to the health, safety or welfare of the future residents or users of the
land in question.
§ 395-19 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-20
344:675
B. Filled lands/on-site sewage disposal.
(1) Filled lands shall not be divided/developed into building sites which
are proposed to be served by on-site soil absorption sewage
disposal systems, except where soil borings, soil percolation tests,
and any other appropriate tests or investigations conducted by a
certified soil tester demonstrate that such soils are suited to the
use of such systems. Such testing shall be conducted at a minimum
of one appropriate location per building site. The Village Board or
Village Plan Commission may require additional testing or
information.
(2) Lands covered by soils having a percolation rate slower than 60
minutes per inch or faster than 10 minutes per inch shall not be
divided into building sites to be served by on-site soil absorption
sewerage disposal systems.
C. Filled lands/structural characteristics. Lands filled within 20 years shall
not be divided/developed into building sites except where soil borings,
other appropriate tests or investigations and the opinion of a
recognized expert demonstrate that the compaction, bearing capacity
and other relevant characteristics of the fill material makes it
structurally suitable for the proposed use. Such testing and expert
investigation shall be conducted at a minimum of one appropriate
location per building site. The Village Engineer may require additional
testing or information.
D. Slope. Lands having a slope of 12% or more shall be maintained in
permanent open space use. No lot shall have more than 50% of its
minimum required area in slopes of 10% or greater.
E. Bedrock. Lands having bedrock within six feet of the natural
undisturbed surface shall not be divided into building sites to be served
by on-site soil absorption sewage disposal systems.
F. Groundwater. Lands having groundwater (constant water table) within
five feet of the natural undisturbed surface shall not be divided into
building sites to be served by on-site soil absorption sewage disposal
systems. Lands having the seasonal high water table within two feet of
the natural undisturbed surface shall not be divided into building sites
to be served by a mound system.
G. Drainage tiles; ditches. Lands drained by farm drainage tile or farm
ditch systems shall not be divided into building sites to be served by onsite
soil absorption sewage disposal systems.
H. Findings, conditions and rebuttal. The Village Board shall make express
findings with respect to the particular facts upon which it bases its
conclusion that the land is unsuitable for a particular use or uses, which
findings shall be recorded in the minutes. The Village Board may
prescribe conditions or remedial actions, if appropriate. The Village
Board shall afford the divider/developer a reasonable opportunity to
§ 395-20 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-20
344:676
§ 395-21. Variances.
present evidence to rebut the Board's findings of unsuitability if the
divider/developer so desires. Thereafter, the Village Board may affirm,
modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.
A. Grounds. The Village Board shall have authority in specific cases, upon
application by a divider/developer/property owner and after a public
hearing noticed by a Class 1 notice under Ch. 985, Wis. Stats., and
notice of such public hearing being mailed by first class mail, not less
than 10 days prior to the public hearing, to the last known address of
the applicant, the owners of the subject lot or site, the owners of all real
property located within 300 feet of the subject lot or site and to all other
parties of interest as defined in this chapter, to grant such variances
from the requirements of this chapter as will not be contrary to the
public interest, where, owing to special conditions which are not
generally applicable to other properties or the use thereof and which
are not of such a recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should
be amended, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will
result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit
of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and
substantial justice done. For purposes of this section, the requirement
of "special conditions" and "practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship" shall be interpreted so as to take into account all of the
relevant facts relating to the variance request. Such facts shall include,
among others, the nature and scope of the variance being sought, the
reasons for requesting the variance, and the reasonableness of
requiring strict compliance in light of the resulting difficulty or
hardship and the purposes of this chapter and of the particular
provisions of this chapter from which the variance is sought. The
Wisconsin case law relating to statutorily controlled variances from
zoning ordinance requirements, which are often quite different in
nature and purpose from the requirements of this chapter, shall not be
construed to be binding with respect to the interpretation of this
section, and, specifically, lack of any reasonable use of the subject real
property in the absence of the requested variance or any need for the
"special conditions" or the "practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship" to relate uniquely to some physical condition or
characteristic of the subject real property, shall not be required.
B. Findings; vote. The Village Board shall grant such variance only after
making express findings, which shall be recorded in the minutes, that
each requirement of Subsection A of this section is satisfied, and only
upon the affirmative vote of four members of the Village Board.
C. When variance unnecessary. The granting of a variance under this
section shall be unnecessary if specific authority is granted elsewhere
in this chapter to waive or modify a requirement of this chapter.
§ 395-20 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-22
344:677
§ 395-22. Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by an objecting authority's objection to a subdivision
plat, or by a failure to approve a plat or certified survey map, or by a
discretionary condition imposed upon the approval of a plat or certified
survey map, may appeal such objection, failure to approve, or condition as
provided in § 236.13(5), Wis. Stats., as amended from time to time, within
30 days of notification of such objection, failure to approve or condition.
When the appeal is from an objecting authority's objection to a subdivision
plat, or from a failure to approve a subdivision plat based on an unsatisfied
objection of an objecting authority to a subdivision plat, the agency making
the objection shall be made a party to the appeal.
§ 395-23. Remedies; violations and penalties.
A. Legal actions. The Village may institute any appropriate legal actions or
proceedings to enforce the provisions of this chapter by means of
injunction, forfeitures or penalties or otherwise as provided by law.
B. Forfeitures; penalties. Any person who violates the provisions of this
chapter shall, upon conviction, forfeit not less than $25 nor more than
$645 for each violation, plus the cost of prosecution. The penalty for
default of payment of any such forfeiture and costs shall be
imprisonment in the Kenosha County Jail until payment thereof, but not
exceeding six months. Each day a violation exists or continues shall
constitute a separate violation. In addition, forfeitures, fines or
penalties provided for in Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., including the following,
without limitation, shall be applicable:
(1) Recordation of a subdivision plat without submitting such plat for
approval, or failure to present such plat for recording within the
time prescribed after approval: a forfeiture of not less than $100
nor more than $1,000, pursuant to § 236.30, Wis. Stats.
(2) Violations of § 236.31(1), Wis. Stats., relating to conveyances, or
offers or contracts to convey subdivisions or lots in subdivisions,

not more than $500 or imprisonment in the Kenosha County Jail for
not more than six months, or both.
(3) Violations of § 236.32, Wis. Stats., relating to disturbing or failure
to place monuments as required, or the knowing removal or
disturbance of monuments, or the failure to replace monuments
properly when ordered to do so: a fine of not more than $250 or
imprisonment in the Kenosha County Jail for not more than one
year.
C. Assessor's plat. An assessor's plat, made under § 70.27, Wis. Stats., may
be ordered as a remedy by the Village Board, at the expense of the
divider, when a subdivision is created by successive land divisions.

ARTICLE III
Land Division Procedures
§ 395-25. Preapplication staff conference.
Prior to the filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat,
certified survey map, or a development plan, the divider/developer shall
meet and confer with the Village staff. The purposes of this preapplication
staff conference are to inform the divider/developer of the purposes,
objectives, and requirements of this chapter and of the various components
of the Village Comprehensive Plan; to identify, at the earliest possible time,
any significant policy issues that may suggest the need for neighborhood
sketch planning, conceptual plan review; budgetary review, or site and
operational plan review; to identify any problems or potential adverse
impacts that will need to be addressed in the planning and approval
process; and otherwise to assist the divider/developer and the Village in
making sound land division or development decisions.
§ 395-26. Neighborhood sketch plan.
A. When required. If the Village staff determines at the preapplication
staff conference that no detailed neighborhood development planning
exists for the area in which the proposed land division or development
will be located, then, prior to filing any conceptual plan, preliminary
plat, certified survey map, or development plan, the divider/developer
shall pay to the Treasurer the required neighborhood sketch plan fee
for the Village to prepare an appropriate neighborhood sketch plan, or
shall participate with the Village in the preparation of an appropriate
neighborhood sketch plan, or shall have a neighborhood sketch plan
prepared by a qualified land use planner in cooperation with the Village
staff for the area which shows how the proposed land division/
development will relate to the surrounding area, particularly in terms of
required municipal facilities and services and compatibility of land
uses.
B. Purpose. The neighborhood sketch plan is intended to provide the
Village staff, the Village Plan Commission and the Village Board with
the means of reviewing the pattern of existing and probable future
development in and around the area proposed for land division, access
to such land division and the practicability of providing municipal
facilities and services to serve such area.
C. Information required. The neighborhood sketch plan, which shall be
drawn to a recognized engineering scale of one inch equals 200 feet,
shall include the following information:
(1) Topographic contours at a minimum of two-foot intervals;
(2) Public street layout, existing and proposed;
(3) Proposed lot or parcel layout;

schools and other public purposes, existing or proposed;
(8) Existing cadastral information and property boundaries; and
(9) Any other information that the divider, the Village staff, the Village
Plan Commission or the Village Board believes will be helpful in
reviewing, approving or using the neighborhood sketch plan.
D. Approval. Approval of a neighborhood plan, which is a component of the
Village Comprehensive Plan, is subject to the requirements of Chapter
390. In addition, notice of such public hearing shall be mailed by firstclass
mail, not less than 10 days prior to the public hearing, to the last
known address of the applicant, the owners of the subject lot or site, the
owners of all real property located within 300 feet of the subject lot or
site and to all other parties of interest as defined in this chapter. For any
amendment to a portion of an adopted neighborhood plan, a notice of
said public hearing shall be mailed by first-class mail, not less than 10
days prior to the public hearing, to the last known address of the
applicant and the owners of the properties located within the
neighborhood plan amended area and property owners within 300 feet
of said amended area. Failure of any person to receive actual notice of
the request shall not invalidate any action taken by the Village Plan
Commission or the Village Board. [Amended 12-21-2009 by Ord. No.
09-62]
A. When required. If the Village staff determines in the preapplication staff
conference, or as a result of reviewing the neighborhood sketch plan,
that any proposed land division or development raises significant policy
issues, then, prior to filing a preliminary plat or certified survey map or
development plan with the Village, the divider/developer shall pay to
the Village Treasurer the required conceptual plan review fee and shall
file a conceptual plan of the proposed land division or development for
review and comment by the staff, the Village Plan Commission and the
Village Board. Without limitation, conceptual plan review shall be
required if the proposed land division or development will create five or
more buildable lots, or will require a rezoning or conditional use permit
to implement, or will require a significant extension of public or private
improvements, or will require other significant budgetary decisions, or
if there is a lack of agreement between the divider/developer and the
staff regarding appropriate dedications or reservations for public
§ 395-26 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-27
344:684
acquisition, or regarding appropriate waivers of or variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. Purpose. The conceptual plan is intended to provide the Village staff,
the Village Plan Commission and the Village Board with an early
opportunity to review policy issues relating to the proposed land
division and its development or any development plan and its possible
adverse effects on adjacent properties of the Village.
C. Information required. The conceptual plan, which shall be drawn to a
recognized engineering scale, shall include the following information:

concerning matters within their jurisdiction.
G. Objections of objecting authorities. The objecting authorities shall,
within 20 days of the date of receiving their copies of the preliminary
plat, notify the Village and all other approving and objecting authorities
of any objections or informal comments. If there are no objections to the
preliminary plat of a proposed subdivision, the objecting authority shall
so certify on the face of a copy of the plat and shall return that copy to
the Village. If an objecting authority fails to act within such 20 days, it
shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat. If it is unclear from the
face of any objection received by the Village when the objecting
authority received a copy of the preliminary plat and when it acted, any
objection received by the Village within 30 days of the date of original
transmission of copies of the preliminary plat to or for such authority

Community Development Department's permanent file.
E. Failure to act timely. Failure of the Village Board to approve, approve
conditionally or reject the preliminary plat within 90 days from the date

constitute an approval of the plat as filed, unless the review period is
extended by agreement with the divider, or unless timely objections of
objecting authorities to a subdivision plat have not been satisfied.
F. Effect on approval. Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary
plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the final plat, but if the
final plat is submitted within 36 months of the last required preliminary
plat approval under § 236.25(2)(b), Wis. Stats., and conforms
substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, including any
conditions of preliminary plat approval, and to local plans and
ordinances adopted at the time the preliminary plat was approved as
authorized by law, the final plat shall be entitled to approval. In
addition, the Village Board may extend the time frame of such approval,
prior to the expiration. [Amended 8-16-2010 by Ord. No. 10-47]

agreements and Comprehensive Plan components and shall comment
and recommend action on the proposed final plat. The Plan Commission
shall promptly transmit the plat and its comments and

K. Staged final platting. If permitted by the Village Board, the approved
preliminary plat may be final platted in stages, with each stage
encompassing only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which
the divider proposes to record at one time and with respect to which the
divider proposes to install all required public improvements in one
stage. Each such stage shall be designated as a stage of the approved
preliminary plat. Timely compliance by a divider with an approved
staging plan (see § 395-19E of this chapter) shall extend the six-month

the conditions of approval or reasons for rejection shall be stated in the
§ 395-30 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-31
344:692
minutes of the meeting and a written statement shall be promptly
mailed to the divider.

conditionally or reject a final plat within 60 days of the filing of a
complete application of a final plat, the time having not been extended
by agreement with the divider and no unsatisfied objections from
objecting authorities having been filed, the final plat shall be deemed
approved, and, upon demand, a certificate to that effect shall be made
on the face of the plat by the Village Clerk.
E. Satisfaction of conditions. The divider shall submit to the Village Board
proof of satisfaction of all conditions imposed by the Board within six
months, or such other time period as the Board may prescribe, after the

are satisfied and the Board has granted final approval, the final plat
shall not be certified as approved and shall not be recorded.
F. Final approval. Upon granting final approval and satisfaction of all of
the conditions of this chapter, the Village Board shall cause the Village
President and Clerk to certify the final approval on the face of the
original plat and promptly return the plat to the divider for recording.
G. Final approval upon conditions. To facilitate the signing of the
development agreement entered into by and between the divider/
developer and the Village, the Village Board may grant final approval
conditioned upon satisfaction of specified ministerial conditions and the
filing of proof of such satisfaction within a short period of time, not to
exceed seven business days following the Village Board conditional
approval. The Board shall specify the date and time by which such
conditions shall be satisfied and shall designate the Village official(s) to
whom proof of satisfaction shall be delivered. The Village Board or the
Village Treasurer may require that any payments made to satisfy a
condition imposed under this subsection be made in cash or by certified
or cashier's check. Upon the timely satisfaction of all such conditions,
and the timely filing of proof of such satisfaction, the Board's final
approval shall be effective, and the Village President and Clerk shall
promptly certify the Board's final approval upon the face of the original
plat. The plat shall then be promptly returned to the divider/developer
for recording. If the specified conditions are not timely satisfied, or if
proof of satisfaction of the specified conditions is not timely filed, the
Board's approval shall be automatically suspended. In such event, the
Village President and Clerk shall not certify the Board's final approval
upon the final plat, and the final plat shall be returned to the Board for
further action.

certified survey map to further divide a specified lot) any
requirement in this chapter to provide and pay for required public
§ 395-32 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-32
344:695
improvements, or any requirements to make dedications of land
or interests in land, or any requirement to pay fees regarding
items such as school sites, park sites or stormwater management
projects, with respect to any lot of a minor land division that is not
intended to be developed, improved or further divided.
(2) Required findings. Such a deferral shall only be allowed, however,
if the Board expressly finds that there are special circumstances
justifying the extraordinary act of deferral, the deferral will not
adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare, substantial
unnecessary hardship will be avoided, and, with respect to any
deferral of required public improvements or of required
dedications, that a conveyance of any lot(s) in the minor land
division prior to the occurrence of the specified event will not make
satisfaction of existing or anticipated public improvement or
dedication requirements impossible or difficult to achieve.
(3) Required condition/recorded restriction. Whenever the Board
permits the deferral of any requirement under this subsection, it
shall require that a statement of restrictions similar to the
following statement, but appropriately modified to fit the particular
circumstances and approved as to form by the Village Attorney,
appear on the face of the recorded certified survey map as a
condition to final approval of the certified survey map:
Lot(s) _____ shall not be developed or improved in any way, and
no zoning, building or occupancy permit shall be issued by the

public improvements] are constructed and installed in accordance
with the then-current provisions of the Village of Pleasant Prairie's
Land Division and Development Control Ordinance, free of charge
to the Village and free of any liens or encumbrances, and/or until
such time as dedications of [specified interests in land for
specified purposes] are made to the Village in accordance with
the then-current provisions of such ordinance, free of charge to
the Village and free of any liens or encumbrances, and/or until
such time as [specified fees] are paid to the Village Treasurer in
accordance with then-current provisions of such ordinance. This
restriction shall run with the land, shall benefit and be enforceable
by the Village of Pleasant Prairie, and shall be removed or
modified only upon the express approval of the Village Board and
the recording of an affidavit evidencing such approval, signed by
the Village President and attested by the Village Clerk.
K. Removal of restrictions. At such time as all conditions to the removal of
any restrictions imposed pursuant to Subsection J have been satisfied,
the Village Board shall promptly approve the removal of such
restrictions and cause an affidavit evidencing such approval to be

Design Standards
§ 395-58. Street arrangement.
A. General. The type, location and arrangement of public streets in any
proposed land division or development shall generally conform to the
type, location and arrangement of public streets shown on the Kenosha
County Jurisdictional Highway System Plan, the neighborhood sketch
plan, or any other Comprehensive Plan component of the Village of
Pleasant Prairie. When such plans have not been completed or are
insufficiently detailed or are outdated, decisions regarding the type,
location and arrangement of public streets shall take into account the
following factors, among others: the type, location, arrangement and
connectivity of existing and proposed streets; the topography; natural
features, such as streams, wetlands, floodplains and woodlands; the
proposed use of the land to be served by such streets; the needs of
adjoining areas; municipal services' efficiency for snow plowing and
garbage; accessibility for police, fire and rescue vehicles/personnel;
and traffic safety. Public streets shall be located and arranged so as to
provide each proposed buildable lot with the required frontage on a
public street. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
B. Arterial streets. Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide ready
access to centers of employment, governmental activity, shopping and
recreation and to arterial streets with which they connect, both within
and outside the Village. Arterial streets shall be appropriately related to
existing and proposed collector streets. Insofar as practicable, they
shall be continuous and in alignment with existing or planned streets
with which they are to connect in linear fashion.
C. Collector streets. Collector streets shall be arranged to collect traffic
from residential areas and to convey such traffic smoothly and
efficiently to existing and proposed arterial streets. Collector streets
shall be appropriately related to the existing or future mass
transportation system, to special traffic generators, such as schools,
churches and shopping centers, to concentrations of population and to
the arterial and collector streets with which they connect.
D. Minor streets. Minor streets shall be arranged to serve residential
areas and other areas of dispersed development. The arrangement of
minor streets shall conform to the topography, discourage use by
through traffic, permit the design of efficient sanitary sewerage system
facilities, water system facilities and storm sewer and drainage system

§ 395-63. Lots.
driveway intersections of minor or collector streets for commercial or
industrial access shall be at a radius of 40 feet being the minimum.
E. Continuation of minor streets. If the center lines of minor streets
approaching an arterial or collector street from opposite sides would be
within 250 feet on one another, measured along the center line of the
arterial or collector street, then the location of one or both of such
streets shall be adjusted so that a single intersection is formed.
A. General requirements. The widths, lengths and shapes of blocks shall
be suited to the planned use of the land, zoning requirements, need for
convenient access, control and safety of street traffic and the
limitations and opportunities of topography.
B. Length. The length of blocks in residential areas shall not generally be
less than 600 feet nor more than 1,500 feet unless otherwise dictated
by exceptional topography or other limiting factors of good engineering
design.
C. Width. Blocks shall generally be wide enough to provide for two tiers of
lots of appropriate depth except where an alternative configuration is

street lines or radial to curved street lines on which the lots face. Lot
lines shall follow municipal boundary lines rather than cross them.
C. Double and reverse frontage lots. Double frontage and reverse frontage
lots shall generally be prohibited except where necessary to provide
separation of residential or commercial development from through
traffic or railroads or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography
and orientation.
D. Public street frontage. Every buildable lot shall front on or abut a public
street for a distance of at least 60 feet or such lesser distance as
specifically allowed by Chapter 420, Zoning Ordinance, of the Village
Code; provided, however, that not withstanding the foregoing language,
nothing in this subsection shall require that a buildable lot have any
public street frontage if and to the extent that the regulations of a
planned development zoning district under Chapter 420 of the Village
Code provide for development supported by an approved system of
private roads. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
E. Area and dimensions. The area and dimensions of all lots shall satisfy all
applicable requirements of Chapter 420, Zoning Ordinance, of the
Village Code. Buildable lots that will not be served by public sanitary

depth in relation to width shall be avoided, and a proportion of two to
one shall be considered a desirable ratio of depth to width under normal
conditions. The depth of lots proposed to be developed for park and
recreational, institutional, commercial or industrial uses shall be
adequate to provide for the off-street parking, loading and service areas
required by the use contemplated.
G. Width. The width of lots shall satisfy the requirements of Chapter 420,
Zoning Ordinance, of the Village Code. (See also Subsection E above.)
H. Corner lots. Corner lots shall have a width at least 20 feet greater than
the minimum required width of interior lots to permit adequate building
setbacks from side streets.
I. Shape. The shape of lots shall generally be rectangular, but lots located
on curves or culs-de-sac shall be an exception. The creation of flag lots
shall not be permitted.
J. Cul-de-sac lots. The street frontage of cul-de-sac lots shall satisfy the
applicable regulations of Chapter 420, Zoning Ordinance, of the Village

344:718
§ 395-64. Building setback lines.
Building setback lines appropriate to the location and type of development
contemplated, which are more restrictive than the regulations of the zoning
district in which the land division is located, may be required by the Village
Board to provide aesthetically consistent site lines for structures and shall
be shown on the final plat or certified survey map. Examples of the
application of this provision might include requiring greater setbacks on
cul-de-sac lots to achieve the necessary lot width at the setback line,
requiring greater setbacks to conform to setbacks of existing adjacent
development, or setting special yard requirements to protect natural
resource elements.
§ 395-65. Easements. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
The Village Board shall require the dedication of easements to allow
construction, operation, maintenance, repair and reconstruction of and
access to sanitary sewerage system facilities and improvements, water
system facilities and improvements and storm sewer and drainage system
facilities and improvements which cannot conveniently be located in public
streets, and private roads, and all electric power, gas, telephone, cable
division and the water's edge, shall be included as part of lots, outlots
or public dedications in any plat or certified survey map abutting a
navigable lake or stream.
L. Principal buildings. No more than one principal building shall be
permitted on a lot, except in an approved planned development or as
specifically allowed by Chapter 420, Zoning Ordinance, of the Village
Code.
M. Restrictions prohibiting development. Whenever a lot appearing on a
final plat or certified survey map is not intended to be buildable, or is
intended to be buildable only upon certain conditions, an express
restriction to that effect, running with the land and enforceable by the
Village, shall appear on the face of the plat or certified survey map.
N. Shoreland areas. All lots created by a plat or certified survey map shall
be located a minimum of 75 feet from the ordinary high-water mark of a
navigable waterway. Outlots shall be designated on the plat or certified
survey map for open space, conservancy lands and shoreland
jurisdictional areas.
O. Number of lots per access connection. Each residential subdivision or
large lot subdivision should generally have roadway access or provide
access onto an arterial, collector or minor street as outlined below:
(1) One to 20 lots require a minimum of one access point;
(2) Twenty-one to 80 lots require a minimum of two access points; and
(3) Eighty-one or more lots require a minimum of three access points.
§ 395-63 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-65

television or other utility or communications lines or other related facilities.
Such easements shall be of adequate width and appropriate alignment to
serve the intended purpose. They shall be located along rear lot lines, and
along side lot lines or across lots where necessary or advisable. When a
land division is traversed by a watercourse or drainageway, a drainageway,
access and maintenance easement of adequate width and appropriate
alignment to accommodate the maximum potential volume of flow shall
generally be required, and parallel streets or parkways may be required in
connection therewith.

Board. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
B. Public streets.
(1) First phase. When the Village Board has deferred the requirement
to install survey monuments prior to final approval of the final plat,
certified survey map, or development plan, temporary street rightof-
way monuments shall be installed. After the installation of such
temporary monuments, and during the first phase following the last
required approval of the final plat or certified survey map, all public
streets shall be graded to subgrade. During this same period, the
shoulders and ditches of all rural streets without curbs and gutters
shall be finish graded and all necessary culverts shall be installed.
If required to prevent erosion, surface ditch inverts shall be
installed in conjunction with the grading of the ditches.
(2) Second phase. After the installation of curbs and gutters, and
during the second phase following the last required approval of the
final plat or certified survey map, the area between the curbs and
the street right-of-way lines shall be filled with topsoil and leveled.

expedited, pursuant to § 395-70F(4) of this chapter, then
notwithstanding the foregoing language of this subsection, such
work shall be completed during the first phase, but the sequence
shall not be altered.
C. Lots. Buildable lots shall be graded so that the elevation of each
building site shall be at least one to two feet above the elevation of the
paved roadway crown in the adjacent public street, unless otherwise
approved by the Village Engineer.
D. Cut or filled land. Cut or filled land shall be graded to a maximum slope
of four horizontal to one vertical, unless it is in a landscaped area, in
which case the maximum slope of three horizontal to one vertical is
acceptable.
§ 395-69 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-69
344:722
E. Completion.
(1) General. All grading, cutting, filling and related work shall be
completed during the first phase and within 12 months after the
last required approval of the final plat or certified survey map,
except as is provided in Subsection B(2) above, unless otherwise
approved by the Village.
(2) Alteration of timing. Notwithstanding any other language in this
section, the Village Board, upon a showing of good cause and upon
whatever conditions the Board deems appropriate in the interests
of public health, safety and welfare, may alter any of the timing or
sequencing requirements stated in this section.
F. Plans. Grading plans for the proposed land division or development
plan shall be prepared by a professional licensed engineer registered in
the State of Wisconsin. The scale of such plans shall be determined by
the Village staff, on a case-by-case basis, based on the size and
complexity of the proposed land division. Reproducible mylars and
electronic media of the plans compatible with the Village's Geographic
Information System (GIS) format pursuant to § 395-82A of this chapter
shall be submitted to the Village.
G. Inspection requirements. The Village shall be contacted to inspect and
approve the grading and related work.
H. Additional general grading requirements. The following subsections set
forth other grading-related requirements for the engineering design of
public improvements:
(1) Engineering plans for public improvements and private on-site
grading and drainage shall be based upon actual field surveying or
aerial mapping techniques or procedures. Mapping accuracy shall
be plus or minus 1/2 of a foot. The Kenosha County topographic
maps as base information for detailed engineering plan shall not be
permitted.
(2) Detailed engineering grading and drainage plans shall identify
existing and finished yard grades and top of foundation elevations
for proposed lots and all surrounding properties, developed and
undeveloped.
(3) Perimeter slopes of the new development shall have a maximum
slope of 1:3 and desirable slope of 1:4 to match the adjacent
existing development.
(4) Sump pump laterals shall be provided for all residential
developments. Storm laterals shall be four inches minimum and
extended to the property line as approved by the Village Engineer.

interconnected to the storm sewer system.
(5) Earthwork balancing computations shall be provided. Any
earthwork shortage or surplus must be addressed prior to
engineering plan approval.
(6) Every effort shall be made to minimize earth movement and work
with the existing topography in site design.
(7) In developments where final grading is based upon use of basement
spoils, all rear yard swales shall be provided as a part of the initial
grading operation. Side yard swales that serve more than the
adjacent two lots must also be constructed as a part of the initial
grading operations. Drainage and maintenance easements shall be
provided along such side and rear yard swales.
(8) The divider/developer shall submit both a mass grading/drainage
plan for the subdivision, large lot subdivision or planned
development zoning district and a lot grading or site-andoperational-
plan site and drainage plan which details grading,
drainage flows (swales) and high points of each individual lot. The
grading and drainage plans shall include topographic contours at
one-half-foot contour intervals. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No.
07-20]
(9) The divider/developer shall provide copies of a field-verified survey
and as-built grading plan of the rough-graded development to the
Village showing contours or spot elevations and datum of
elevations for the development for review and approval in order to
verify that the development site, including the retention or
detention basins, has been graded in accordance with the approved
grading and drainage plans as provided in the construction plans
for the development. Said grading survey shall identify the
proposed and existing graded elevations for all property corners,
building pads, finished yard grades and high point elevations,
elevations for all topographic contours within the lots, drainage
swale locations, stormwater drainage easements, basins and utility
easement areas. The elevations within the development shall be
graded to within four inches of the proposed elevations along all
property lines and within all drainage and utility easement areas
prior to the installation of utilities and prior to the Village's
acceptance of the grading and drainage plan. In completing the
grading for the single-family lots, the proposed building area
determined by the building setbacks may be kept between 18
inches and 30 inches low to minimize the amount of fill removal
from excavated basements. The grading survey shall be completed
by a Wisconsin-registered land surveyor and verified by the
developer's engineer and shall be submitted to the Village for

review, verification and approval prior to the commencement of
installation of any required private utilities and the acceptance of
any of the required public improvements. No building or zoning
permits shall be issued prior to the Village's approval of this
grading survey and the installation of the required private utilities
and the erosion control site stabilization. The required as-built
grading plans shall be provided to the Village pursuant to
§ 395-82C of this chapter. [Amended 5-18-2009 by Ord. No.
09-35]
A. General requirements. Subject to this chapter and Chapter 405, Public
Improvement Projects, public streets shall be required in all
subdivisions and large lot subdivisions, and in all minor land divisions
and developments proposed to be developed for residential,
manufactured housing community, commercial, industrial, or other
uses, unless the Village Board determines that, in the public's interest,
the streets should be privately owned and maintained. Public street
access to lands adjacent to a proposed land division or development
shall be required if development of such land division or development
without access would make development of the adjacent land difficult
or would result in an undesirable street pattern.
B. Design and construction. All public streets shall be designed, located,
constructed, installed, provided and completed in a workmanlike
manner, to the satisfaction of the Village, at the divider's cost, and in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter and Chapter 405,
Public Improvement Projects, all other applicable ordinances, the
development agreement entered into by and between the divider and
the Village, the final plat or certified survey map approved by the
Village Board and the plans and specification approved by the Village
Board.
C. Rural street cross sections. Permanent public streets constructed in
accordance with the Village's rural street cross sections (see Chapter
405) shall not be permitted in subdivisions or large lot subdivisions, or
in minor land divisions proposed to be developed for residential,
manufactured housing community, commercial, industrial or other
uses. The Village Board may approve the use of rural street cross
sections for minor land divisions proposed to be developed only for
rural uses.
D. Urban street cross sections. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
(1) All public streets in subdivisions and large lot subdivisions, and in
minor land divisions or developments proposed to be developed for
residential, manufactured housing communities, commercial,
industrial or other nonrural uses, shall be constructed in
accordance with the Village's urban street cross sections. (See
Chapter 405.)
§ 395-69 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-70
344:725
(2) Except as may be otherwise specifically required by the Village
Board in a development agreement relating to a planned
development zoning district, all private streets in subdivisions and
large lot subdivisions, and in minor land divisions proposed to be
developed for residential, manufactured housing communities,
commercial, industrial or other uses, which were permitted by the
Village Board to be constructed as privately owned and maintained
shall be constructed at the same urban cross section standards of a
minor Village road with curb and gutter and storm sewer and shall
provide sufficient access and cul-de-sac turnaround location per all
applicable Village and state ordinances and codes.
E. Surfacing and timing of improvements. After completion and the
Village's inspection and approval of all underground sanitary sewerage
system, water system, storm sewer and drainage system, and utility and
communication improvements and facilities that are to be located
within the public street, all public street roadways shall be paved in
accordance with the requirements of this section, § 395-60 of this
chapter, and Chapter 405 of the Village Code.
(1) The base and surface course standards provided are considered
minimum standards. Upon the evaluation of the soil borings and
projected traffic volumes, the minimum roadway profile standards
may be adjusted or increased by the Village Engineer.
(2) Binder course. The binder course of paving (hereinafter referred to
as the "Phase 2 public improvements") shall be commenced by the
divider/developer as soon as practicable but not until the
construction of the Phase 1 improvements has been completed by
the divider/developer, inspected and conditionally approved by the
Village pursuant to a letter of substantial completion, and such
improvements have been dedicated to and formally accepted by the
Village by resolution of the Village Board, and at least 50% of the
residential units in the development are constructed. Prior to
installation of the binder course of paving on public street
roadways, the base course shall be finish graded and compacted.
(3) Surface course.
(a) As soon as practicable but not until construction of the Phase 2
improvements has been completed by the divider/developer,
such improvements have been inspected and conditionally
approved by the Village pursuant to a letter of substantial
completion, and the developer had dedicated such
improvements and the Village has formally accepted them by
resolution of the Village Board, and at least 75% of the
residential units in the development are constructed, the
developer shall raise storm inlet frames and water main valve
boxes, remove and replace all areas of the damaged binder
course, sweep and tack coat the binder course on all streets in
the development, and, after completion by the developer and
§ 395-70 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-70
344:726
inspection and approval by the Village of the foregoing
improvements, install the binder course of bituminous
pavement (the "surface course") on all streets in the
development. The required public street improvements
described shall be collectively referred to as the "Phase 3
street improvements."
(b) Notwithstanding anything to contrary in Subsection E(3)(a)
above, if fewer than 75% of the residential units in the
development have been constructed within 36 months after the
effective date, then, at the developer's request, in order to
protect the surface course from excessive wear and tear
resulting from activities associated with building construction
within the development, the Village Administrator shall elect to
either:
[1] Waive the requirement that 75% of the units are to be
constructed and permit the divider/developer to construct
the Phase 3 street improvements; or
[2] Defer the installation of the Phase 3 street improvements
until the earlier of the construction of 75% of the
residential units or five years after the effective date. If the
Village Administrator elects to require the divider/
developer to defer the installation of the Phase 3 street
improvements, then, at the divider's/developer's request,
the Village shall draw upon the letter of credit in an
amount equal to the maximum estimated amount of the
cost of providing, installing and constructing the Phase 3
street improvements (or such greater sum as the parties
may agree upon, based on the condition of the Phase 2
required public improvements).
(c) Repair, sweeping and coat. Prior to installation of the surface
course of paving on public street roadways, all damaged
portions of the binder course shall be swept clean, and a tack
coat shall be applied to all roadway surfaces.
(d) Residential streets. A one-inch surface course of compacted
and rolled bituminous concrete pavement shall be installed on
the binder course of all residential and commercial collector
and minor street roadways.
(e) Commercial and industrial streets. A surface course of 1 1/2
inches of compacted and rolled bituminous concrete paving
shall be installed on the binder course of all public street
roadways.
(f) Arterial streets. A surface course consisting of a minimum of
1 1/2 inches of compacted and rolled bituminous concrete
paving shall be installed on the binder course of all public
street roadways. The actual thickness of the surface course
§ 395-70 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-70
344:727
shall be determined in connection with the review and
approval of the engineering design documents.
(4) Specifications. The specifications of all base course, concrete,
bituminous concrete, tack coat and other material used for public
street paving shall be subject to Village Board approval and shall be
prepared by a professional engineer registered in the State of
Wisconsin and shall be subject to Chapter 405 of the Village Code.
F. Paving sequence and timing. The paving of public street roadways shall
proceed in phases as follows:
(1) Phase 1. The base course shall be installed on the graded and
prepared beds of all public street roadways during Phase 1, within
12 months following the last required approval of the final plat or
certified survey map. Installation of the base course shall occur
only after completion and the Village's inspection and approval of
all roadway grading and all underground public improvements and
facilities that are to be located in the public streets. It shall be the
divider's/developer's expense to maintain, repair, reshape, and
regravel the base course whenever it has been determined by the
Village that said base course has become a health or safety
concern.
(2) Phase 2. During Phase 2, approximately 24 months following the
last required approval of the final plat or certified survey map or
development plan, the base course on all public streets shall be
finish graded and compacted and the binder course of pavement
shall be installed on the base course. The binder course shall not be
installed until after completion, inspection and approval by the
Village of Phase 1 improvements and at least 50% of the residential
units in the development have been constructed. The Phase 2
improvements shall not be commenced until after June 1 of any
given year, unless approved by the Village Administrator.
(3) Phase 3. During Phase 3, approximately 36 months following the
last required approval of the final plat, certified survey map, or
development plan, the inlet frames and water main valve boxes
shall be adjusted as necessary, damaged areas of the binder course
of pavement and curbs and gutters shall be repaired, all roadway
surfaces shall be swept clean, a tack coat shall be applied to all
roadway surfaces, and the surface course of pavement shall be
installed on all public street roadways. The surface course shall not
be installed until after the completion, inspection and approval by
the Village of the Phase 2 improvements and at least 75% of the
residential units in the development have been constructed.
(4) Expedited schedule. Notwithstanding Subsection F(2) and (3)
above, if compacted granular material has been approved by the
Village Administrator to be used for backfilling the trenches in
which sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water mains, utilities and
§ 395-70 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-70
344:728
other underground public improvements and facilities are
constructed in the public streets, the Village Administrator may
allow the improvements usually during Phase 2 to be made during
Phase 1, and the improvements usually made during Phase 3 to be
made during Phase 2, but without any alteration of the required
sequence. This will permit the completion of public street
improvements within two phases, subject to Subsection F(5) below.
(5) Deferral of surface course. Upon written notice to the divider/
developer during Phase 2 following the last required approval of
the final plat or certified survey map, installation of the surface
course of pavement on all public street roadways, and other street
improvements usually made during the Phase 3 period, may be
deferred to protect the surface course of pavement from excessive
wear and tear in connection with the construction of residences or
other buildings in the land division. The development agreement
entered into by and between the divider/developer and the Village
shall provide that, in the event of such a deferral, the Village shall
be entitled to draw upon the irrevocable letter of credit provided by
the divider/developer to the extent of the estimated cost of
installing the surface course and any other street improvements
usually installed during the third phase. Upon receipt of such funds
by the Village, the divider/developer shall dedicate to the Village
the remainder of the street improvements, and the Village shall
assume all responsibility for maintenance of the streets. Such funds
shall be kept in a special fund separate from the Village general
fund and shall be used exclusively for construction and installation
of the surface course of paving and other third phase street
improvements in the particular land division or development with
respect to which the funds were received.
(6) Alteration of timing. Notwithstanding any other language in this
section, the Village Board, upon a showing of good cause and upon
whatever conditions the Board deems appropriate in the interests
of public health, safety, and welfare, may alter any of the timing or
sequencing requirements stated in this section.
G. Plans. Plans for public streets shall be prepared by a professional
engineer, registered in the State of Wisconsin, at a scale of no greater
than one inch equals 40 feet horizontal and one inch equals four feet
vertical. Reproducible mylars and electronic media of all such plans
compatible with the Village's Geographic Information System format
pursuant to § 395-92A of this chapter shall be submitted to the Village
as a condition of final plat, certified survey map, or development plan
approval.
H. Inspection requirements. The Village shall be contacted to inspect and
approve work on the paving of public street roadways during
construction, and no further work shall be done on the roadways until
the prior work is approved.
§ 395-70 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 395-70
344:729
I. Cost of extension.
(1) Divider's/developer's fair share. The divider/developer shall be
required to pay, as a condition to final approval of a proposed final
plat or certified survey map or development plan, the divider's/
developer's fair share of the costs of extending any required public
street to the site of the proposed land division or development,
unless the divider/developer will be required to pay its fair share of
such costs through some other mechanism, or unless the Village
Board specifically waives this requirement for good cause shown.
(2) Basis for rejection. The Village Board may reject a plat, certified
survey map or development plan requiring the extension to the site
of a public street if the costs to the Village of such extensions will
be too great. In making such determination, the Village Board shall
consider, among other factors, the advantages and disadvantages
to the Village and the affected areas of installing the required
street improvements, the Village's ability to recover such costs by
special assessment or otherwise, the financial status of the Village,
the borrowing capacity of the Village, and applicable development,
special assessment and resource allocation policies of the Board.
(3) Alternative conditional approval. When the Village Board would
otherwise reject a proposed preliminary plat, final plat, certified
survey map or development plan because of the cost of extending a
required public street to the site of the proposed land division or
development plan, the Village Board may approve the plat, map or
plan upon the condition that the divider/developer will pay, in the
first instance, and as a condition to final approval of the proposed
final plat, certified survey map or development plan, all or some
portion in excess of the divider's fair share of the costs of designing
and extending such public streets to the site of the proposed land
division or development. In such situations, the development
agreement entered into by and between the divider/developer and
the Village shall include an agreement by the Village to pay to the
divider/developer certain specified moneys which may be
subsequently recovered by the Village with respect to such
extended street improvements. Such right of recovery may be
made contingent upon the Village first recovering specified costs
incurred by it in connection with such improvements and upon such
other reasonable conditions as the Board may impose, but in any
event such right of recovery shall only address payments made by
the divider/developer in excess of the divider's/developer's fair
share of the total costs of designing and installing the public street
improvements.
(4) Other contributions. The Village Board may require the divider/
developer of a subsequently approved land division or development
which benefits from such extended public street improvements to
pay the divider's/developer's fair share of the total coats of such
improvements as a condition to final approval of the final plat or
§ 395-70 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-70
344:730
§ 395-71. Curbs and gutters.
certified survey map or development plan, but due credit shall
be given for any payments made toward the cost of such
improvements by the divider/developer or the divider's/developer's
predecessors in title, with respect to the land involved in the
divider's/developer's proposed land division or development.
J. Cost of upgrading. The divider/developer shall be required to pay, as a
condition to the Village Board's final approval of a proposed final plat,
certified survey map, or development plan, a fair share of the cost of
upgrading any existing public streets in or adjacent to the proposed
land division, in accordance with applicable Village Comprehensive
Plan components, unless the need for such upgrading is unrelated to
the proposed land division or its contemplated development.
A. General requirement. Subject to this chapter and Chapter 405, Public
Improvement Projects, concrete curbs and gutters shall be required in
all subdivisions and large lot subdivisions, and in all minor land
divisions or developments proposed to be developed for residential,
manufactured housing community, commercial, industrial or other
uses, and in all minor land divisions and developments which are
adjacent to land divisions or developments which contain curbs and
gutters which can be continued into the new land division or
development. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
B. Design and construction. All concrete curbs and gutters shall be
designed, constructed, installed, provided and completed in a
workmanlike manner, to the satisfaction of the Village, at the divider's/
developer's cost, and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter,
all other applicable ordinances, the development agreement entered
into by and between the divider/developer and the Village, the final
plat, certified survey map, or development plan approved by the Village
Board (or by the Village Plan Commission or Village Zoning
Administrator with respect to a site and operational plan to be approved
under § 420-56 of the Village Code) and plans and specifications
approved by the Village Board. [Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No.
07-20]
C. Type. In new residential streets where the location of curb openings for
driveways cannot be determined, concrete thirty-inch-wide mountabletype
curbs and gutters shall be installed in accordance with the typical
minor or collector street cross sections, unless another curb detail is
otherwise approved by the Village Engineer. (See Chapter 405, Public
Improvement Projects.) In existing residential areas, or where the
location of curb openings can be determined prior to construction,
thirty-inch-wide Wisconsin Department of Transportation Type D
concrete curbs and gutters shall be installed in nonresidential streets.
D. Handicap ramps. Curb openings at all intersections shall be provided
for handicap accessibility ramps where sidewalks are required.

E. Completion.
(1) General. Curbs and gutters shall be installed and completed during
the Phase 2 period following the last required approval of the final
plat, certified survey map, or development plan. Curbs and gutters
shall only be installed after the base course on all public street
roadways has been completed and inspected and approved by the
Village and at least 50% of the residential units in the development
have been constructed.
(2) Expedited schedule. If granular material is approved by the Village
Administrator and used to backfill the trenches in which sanitary
sewers, water mains, storm sewers and other underground
improvements and facilities are located in the public streets and
the Village Administrator permits expedited installation under
§ 395-70F(4) of this chapter, then the curbs and gutters may be
installed and completed during Phase 1 after the last required
approval of the final plat, certified survey map, or development
plan but without any alteration in sequence.
(3) Alteration of timing. Notwithstanding any other language in this
section, the Village Board, upon a showing of good cause, and upon
whatever conditions the Board deems appropriate in the interests
of public health, safety and welfare, may alter any of the timing or
sequencing requirements stated in this section.
F. Plans. Curb and gutter plans shall be prepared as a detail of the public
street plans prepared in accordance with § 395-70G of this chapter.

expense of the divider/developer.
(3) As-built sanitary sewer plans. Upon installation, inspection and
televising of the sanitary sewer main, the Village's consulting
engineer shall prepare the required as-built plans, at the divider's/
developer's cost, pursuant to § 395-82C of this chapter. [Added
5-18-2009 by Ord. No. 09-35]
K. Cost of extension.
(1) Divider's/developer's fair share. The divider/developer shall be
required to pay, as a condition to final approval of a proposed final
plat, certified survey map, or development plan, the divider's/
developer's fair share of the costs of extending any required public
sanitary sewerage system improvements to the site of the proposed
land division or development, unless the divider/developer will be
required to pay its fair share of such costs through some other
mechanism, or unless the Village Board specifically waives this
requirement for good cause shown.
(2) Basis for rejection. The Village Board (or the Village Plan
Commission or Village Zoning Administrator with respect to a site
and operational plan to be approved under § 420-56 of the Village
Code, subject to ratification by the Village Board) may reject a plat,
certified survey map or development plan requiring the extension
of public sanitary sewerage system improvements to the site if the
costs to the Village's sewer utility districts of such extension will be
§ 395-72 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 395-72
344:734
too great. In making such determination, the Village Board (or
the Village Plan Commission or Village Zoning Administrator) shall
consider, among other factors, the advantages and disadvantages
to the Village and the affected areas of installing the required
improvements, the Village's ability to recover such costs by special
assessment or otherwise, the financial status of the Village, the
borrowing capacity of the Village, and applicable development,
special assessment and resource allocation policies of the Board.
[Amended 5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-20]
(3) Alternative conditional approval. When the Village Board would
otherwise reject a proposed preliminary or final plat, certified
survey map, or development plan because of the cost of extending
required public sanitary sewerage system improvements to the site
of the proposed land division or development, the Village Board
may approve the plat, certified survey map or development plan
upon the condition that the divider/developer will pay, in the first
instance, and as a condition to final approval of the proposed final
plat, certified survey map, or development plan, all or some portion
in excess of the divider's/developer's fair share of the cost of
extending such improvements to the site of the proposed land
division or development . In such situations, the development
agreement entered into by and between the divider/developer and
the Village shall include an agreement by the Village to pay to the
divider/developer certain specified moneys which may be
subsequently recovered by the Village with respect to designing
and extending public sanitary sewerage system improvements.
Such right of recovery may be made contingent upon the Village
first recovering specified costs incurred by it in connection with
such improvements and upon such other reasonable conditions as
the Board may impose, but in any event such right of recovery shall
only address payments made by the divider in excess of the
divider's fair share of the total cost of designing and installing such
improvements and facilities.
(4) Other contributions. The Village Board may require the divider of a
subsequently approved land division which benefits from such
extended public sanitary sewerage system improvements to pay
the divider's fair share of the total cost of such improvements as a
condition to final approval of the final plat, certified survey map or
development plan, but due credit shall be given for any payments
made toward the cost of such improvements by the divider/
developer, or the divider's/developer's predecessors in title, with
respect to the land involved in the divider's/developer's proposed
land division or development.
L. Cost of upgrading. The divider/developer shall be required to pay, as a
condition to final approval of any proposed final plat, certified survey
map or development plan, a fair share of the cost of upgrading any
existing public sanitary sewerage system facilities and improvements in

survey map, or development plan (or the Village Plan Commission
or Village Zoning Administrator may reject a site and operational
plan to be approved under § 420-56 of the Village Code, subject to
Village Board ratification) requiring the extension to the site of
public water system improvements if the costs to the Village of
such extension will be too great. In making such determination, the
Village Board (or the Village Plan Commission or Village Zoning
Administrator with respect to a site and operational plan) shall
consider, among other factors, the advantages and disadvantages
to the Village and the affected areas of installing the required
improvements, the Village's ability to recover such costs by special

approve the plat or map upon the condition that the divider/
developer will pay, in the first instance, and as a condition to final
approval of the proposed final plat, certified survey map, or
development agreement, all or some portion in excess of the
divider's/developer's fair share of the costs of extending such
improvements and facilities to the site of the proposed land division
or development. In such situations, the development agreement
entered into by and between the divider/developer and the Village
shall include an agreement by the Village to pay to the divider/
developer certain specified moneys which may be subsequently
recovered by the Village with respect to designing and extending
public water system improvements. Such right of recovery may be
made contingent upon the Village first recovering specified costs
incurred by it in connection with such improvements and upon such
other reasonable conditions as the Board may impose, but in any
event such right of recovery shall only address payments made by
the divider/developer in excess of the divider's/developer's fair
share of the total cost of designing and installing such
improvements.

(4) Other contributions. The Village Board may require the divider/
developer of a subsequently approved land division or development
plan which benefits from such extended public water system
improvements to pay the divider's/developer's fair share of the total
cost of such improvements as a condition to final approval of the
final plat, certified survey map, or development plan, but due credit
shall be given for any such improvements by the divider, or the
divider's/developer's predecessors in title, with respect to the land
involved in the divider's/developer's proposed land division or
development plan.
K. Cost of upgrading. The divider shall be required to pay, as a condition to
the Village Board's final approval of a proposed land division or
development plan, a fair share of the cost of upgrading any existing
public water system facilities and improvements in or adjacent to the

and having a financial standing acceptable to the Village, which secures a
divider's obligation to pay the cost of designing, constructing and installing
required public improvements and certain other obligations in connection
with an approved land division. The standby letter of credit functions as
a backup or in addition to the line of credit that a divider/developer is
using to pay for the public improvements. The standby letter of credit
shall be reduced or released upon verification of quantities and Village
inspections and the Village Board's full acceptance of a classification of

SECURITY ORDINANCE
GENERAL REFERENCES
Land division and development control  See
Ch. 395.
Zoning Ordinance  See Ch. 420.
§ 410-1. Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to provide for the implementation
and use of digital security imaging systems (hereinafter referred to as
DSIS) that monitor the exterior spaces and areas of certain commercial
retail establishments and retail developments in the Village of Pleasant
Prairie. The DSIS will afford the opportunity for public safety departments
(e.g., Village Police Department and Village Fire & Rescue Department) to
visually examine certain retail establishments and retail development sites
and will provide emergency response personnel with a visual assessment
of an emergency situation in advance of arrival without placing an undue
burden for services on the taxpayers. The advanced visual assessment
may pertain to a person or persons (personal identification), a location
(scene identification), and/or a situation (action identification) in emergency
situations. The implementation and usage of DSIS will facilitate law
enforcement agencies in crime investigation. While it is anticipated that
the implementation and usage of DSIS will greatly aid law enforcement
agencies in subsequent criminal investigations and prosecutions, it is
recognized that DSIS alone cannot provide for or be solely relied upon to
produce positive personal, action, or scene identification. Furthermore, it
is recognized that since there is no Village requirement that these systems
be actively monitored, it cannot be reasonably expected that these systems
will, on their own, necessarily provide a safer or more secure environment,
nor are they a substitute for other security measures. It is also the intent
of this chapter to attain commercial retail environments of sustained
desirability and economic stability and to avoid unreasonable adverse
effects to the property values of the surrounding properties and
surrounding neighborhoods and to maintain and promote the public health,
safety and welfare of the Village.

§ 420-11. Disclaimer of liability.
The Village makes no guaranties, warranties or representations of any
kind by or as a result of adopting this chapter. Particularly, and without
limitation, the Village does not guarantee, warrant or represent that any

only those areas designated as floodplain areas are subject to periodic
inundation. Consequently, the Village hereby asserts that there is no liability
on the part of the Village, its agencies, employees or agents for any flood
damage, sanitation problems, or structural or other damages that may
occur despite or as a result of reliance upon or conformance with this
chapter.
§ 420-12. Zoning Maps. [Amended 9-5-2006 by Ord. No. 06-42]
A. General Zoning and Shoreland Maps. A series of 41 cadastral base
maps at a scale of one inch equals 200 feet, dated March 2006, as
prepared by the Kenosha County Department of Planning and
Development, on which the current Village zoning districts and
§ 420-8 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-12
344:782
§ 420-13. Amendments to the Official Zoning Maps and zoning text.
shoreland boundaries have been digitized, are hereby adopted as part
of this chapter as the Official General Zoning and Shoreland Zoning
Maps of the Village of Pleasant Prairie and incorporated herein by
reference (such maps, as amended from time to time, are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the " Zoning Maps" of the Village). For
purposes of identification, the date of adoption of each of these Zoning
Maps shall be certified upon its face by the Village President and
attested by the Village Clerk. Each ordinance amending the Zoning
Maps shall be promptly noted on one or more of such maps, as
appropriate, by the Village Zoning Administrator with the change in
zoning district classification and/or the change in zoning district
boundaries, the number of the ordinance and the date of its adoption by
the Village Board. See Appendix B for map amendments after January
17, 2000. For purposes of information, convenience and cross-reference
only, the Village Zoning Administrator may develop a system of
notations or symbols to designate on the Zoning Maps the existence of
variances, conditional use permits, nonconforming uses, conditions of
a particular zoning ordinance's effectiveness, and/or other matters of
zoning interest, but such notations or symbols on the Zoning Maps shall
not be deemed to be adopted as part of the official maps and shall not
themselves have any legal or evidentiary significance. The Zoning Maps
shall be available for inspection in the Village Community Development
Department.
B. Floodplain Zoning Maps. The Village Floodplain Zoning Maps are
adopted and described in § 420-131 of this chapter.
A. Intent. While stability of zoning within the Village is generally
desirable, zoning is by no means static. It is the intent of this section to
recognize that changed or changing conditions may require a change in
the zoning maps or the text of this chapter and that no person has a
right to an unchanged zoning classification or to unchanged provisions
of this chapter. It is the policy of the Village Board generally not to zone
land for development in the absence of an approved plan of
development, and the Village Board reserves its right, without
limitation, to condition an amendment of this chapter upon the owner
timely proceeding to implement an approved development plan or to
downzone land when it becomes apparent that an approved plan of
development will not be acted upon in a timely fashion.
B. Authority and limitations. Whenever the public necessity, convenience
or general welfare requires, the Village Board may, in its discretion,
amend any part of this chapter by ordinance. Such amendments may
include changes in the zoning district classification, changes in zoning
district boundaries, and/or changes in the text of this chapter. Such
amendments shall be enacted in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes and this chapter. Amendments may
§ 420-12 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-13
344:783
also be made upon a showing of a mistake or error on the part of the
Village.
C. Initiation. A petition for amendment of this chapter may be made by any
owner of real property in the Village affected by the proposed
amendment or by such owner's agent. Without filing a petition for an
amendment, any member of the Village Plan Commission or Village
Board may initiate consideration of an amendment of this chapter by
making a resolution which is adopted by such body.
D. Petition for amendment. A petition for any amendment of this chapter
shall be filed with the Village Zoning Administrator on forms furnished
by the Community Development Department.

F. Review and approval.

applicant shall schedule and participate in a conference with the
Zoning Administrator or the Zoning Administrator's designee
regarding the proposed amendment and the requirements for such

the Plan Commission or Village Board, the Zoning Administrator
shall promptly submit the petition and/or drafted amendment and
related materials to the Village Plan Commission by written
communication, with a copy of such written communication to the
Village Board, and shall place the matter on the agenda of the Plan
Commission for a public hearing and recommendation and report
to the Village Board. The sixty-day period referred to in
§ 62.23(7)(d), Wis. Stats., after which the Village Board may
proceed without a recommendation of the Plan Commission, shall
begin on the day following such submission of the petition or
drafted amendment to the Plan Commission.
(3) Notice of the public hearing on any petition for amendment or on
any amendment proposed by resolution of the Plan Commission or

shall be mailed to the last known address of the owners of all real
property within 300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the real
property affected by any proposed amendment of the zoning
district classification of real property or any proposed amendment
of the boundaries of any zoning district (even if the area to be
rezoned is smaller) and to parties in interest as defined in this
chapter. Failure to give or nonreceipt of such actual notice by any
property owner or other party in interest shall not invalidate any
action taken by the Plan Commission or the Village Board. For good
cause shown, the petitioner may request the Plan Commission to
postpone or adjourn the public hearing. The Plan Commission may,
for good cause shown, postpone or adjourn a public hearing on its
own motion. No further publication or mailing of notice shall be
required if notice of the date, time and location of the postponed or
adjourned hearing is publicly announced at the place and
approximate time of the scheduled public hearing.
§ 420-13 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-13
344:786
(4) Additional notice requirements. The Zoning Administrator shall
give at least 10 days' prior written notice of the public hearing on a
proposed amendment to the clerk of any municipality whose
boundaries are contiguous with the Village's and within 1,000 feet
of the boundaries of the area to be rezoned, as required in
§ 62.23(7)(d)1a, Wis. Stats. Failure to give or nonreceipt of such
actual notice by any property owner or other party in interest shall
not invalidate any action taken by the Plan Commission or the
Village Board. For good cause shown, the petitioner may request
the Plan Commission to postpone or adjourn the public hearing.
The Zoning Administrator shall give any other actual notice of a
public hearing required by any other provision of this chapter or by
state or federal statute or regulation.
(5) Upon completion of the public hearing and consideration of any
proposed amendment of this chapter, the Plan Commission shall
make a recommendation and report to the Village Board relating to
the proposed amendment. Any substantial changes in the proposed
amendment not covered by the published notice of the public
hearing or not a subject of discussion at the public hearing shall
require a new public hearing and recommendation and report by
the Plan Commission.
(6) Upon receipt of the Plan Commission recommendation and report,
the Village Board may: adopt the amendment as proposed, deny the
proposed amendment, or refer the proposed amendment to staff
and/or the Plan Commission for further review, study and/or
drafting in light of expressed concerns and/or requested changes.
The Village Board may also adopt a proposed amendment with
minor changes, or with substantial changes provided that any such
substantial changes were covered by the published notice of the
public hearing and were a subject of discussions at the public
hearing.
(7) Approval of a down zoning ordinance. Pursuant to 66.10015 (3),
Wis. Stats., the Village may enact a down zoning ordinance only if
the ordinance is approved by at least two-thirds of the Village
Board members, except that if the down zoning ordinance is
requested, or agreed to, by the person who owns the land affected
by the proposed ordinance, then the ordinance may be enacted by a
simple majority of the Village Board. A down zoning ordinance
means a zoning ordinance that affects an area of land in one of the
following ways:
(a) By decreasing the development density of the land to be less
dense than was allowed under its previous usage; or
(b) By reducing the permitted uses of the land, that are specified
in zoning ordinance or other land use regulations, to fewer
uses than were allowed under its previous usage. [Added

the protestor shall attach to the protest a copy of the deed or other
instrument on the basis of which the protester claims to be an
owner.

deferred until the Village Clerk is able to determine the validity and
sufficiency of the protest(s), or the Village Board may proceed to
vote, with the outcome to abide the Clerk's determination as to the
effect of the protest(s). Any and all protests determined to be
invalid or insufficient may be disregarded.

§ 420-15. Annexed lands.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, whenever any area
which has been subject to the Kenosha County General Zoning/Floodplain
and Shoreland Zoning Ordinance becomes part of the Village, the
regulations imposed by the County Zoning Ordinance shall continue to be
in effect, without change, and shall be enforced by the Village until such
regulations have been changed by official action of the Village Board, except
that in the event an annexation ordinance is contested in the courts, the
County Zoning Ordinance shall continue to control and the County shall
continue to have jurisdiction over the area affected until such time as the
annexation ordinance is finally determined not to be invalid as a result
of such challenge, and except that the general zoning classification of
all land coming within the jurisdiction of this chapter shall automatically
be A-2 General Agricultural District (except areas zoned FPO Floodplain
Overlay District, C-1 Lowland Resource Conservancy District, or C-2 Upland
Resource Conservancy District), unless and until the Village Board
affirmatively acts to change the zoning classification of such land.

by this chapter.
E. Incomplete application. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to hold
for completion or deny, in his or her discretion, any incomplete permit
application. With respect to any such application held for completion,
§ 420-22 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-22
344:799
the Zoning Administrator shall promptly notify the applicant in writing
by first class mail or by fax what information is needed to complete the
application and what if any preconditions must be satisfied pursuant to
§ 420-22C of this chapter. Any application not completed within 30 days
after the filing of the application shall be denied.
F. Application approval/denial. Applications and all supporting documents
and materials shall be submitted in specific quantities required per
each application. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue
zoning permits alone in situations where a building permit or any other
permit pursuant to this chapter is not required or is premature.
(1) As soon as practicable after a permit application is complete, the
Zoning Administrator shall approve or deny it. The Zoning
Administrator shall have authority to impose any conditions
reasonably based upon the requirements of this chapter. The
Zoning Administrator shall promptly notify the applicant of the
approval of said permit application. The Zoning Administrator shall
promptly notify the applicant of the denial in writing by first class
mail or by fax and state in such notice the reasons for any denial.
(2) A permit may not be issued unless the proposed work as described
in the application fully complies with all applicable requirements of
this chapter and all applicable orders, decisions, permits or other
approvals made or issued pursuant to this chapter and with all
other applicable Village, county, state or federal statutes,
ordinances, codes, regulations, permits or orders relating to land
use, land division, environmental protection or development
control.
(3) Among the conditions that shall be imposed on any permit, to the
extent applicable, are the following:
(a) That the applicant has duly authorized the filing of the
application and all related information and that all information
contained in or submitted in connection with the application is
true and accurate;
(b) That the permit and all terms and conditions thereof must be
reviewed and accepted by the applicant prior to
commencement of the work and that such commencement
constitutes acceptance;
(c) That commencement of work upon issuance of the required
permit(s) constitutes a waiver of any right to appeal the
decision or permit of the Zoning Administrator or to otherwise
challenge such decision or permit;
(d) That the applicant shall request the required inspections
during the project at least 48 hours in advance to avoid a
violation; and
§ 420-22 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-22
344:800
(e) That the work shall be in full compliance with this chapter and
the terms and conditions of the permit and must be in
accordance with the approved plans, specifications and other
information submitted with the application.
(4) If a permit is not issued within 30 days after the date on which
notice of approval of the application is given, the application
approval shall automatically be void. No permit shall be issued on
the basis of a void application approval. The applicant may reapply
without prejudice.
G. Permit issuance. A permit shall be issued only upon payment of any
required permit fees provided for in or by this chapter. All permits
issued pursuant to this chapter shall be posted in a conspicuous place
on the premises from the date of issuance to the date of expiration or
revocation, or the date of issuance of the related certificate of
occupancy, whichever is later.
H. Binding nature of application. It shall be the duty of the applicant to
review and duly authorize the filing of any permit application and
information submitted with or in connection with any such application.
Every permit shall be conditioned upon the accuracy of all such
information. Any permit approved or issued on the basis of materially
inaccurate information may be suspended by the Zoning Administrator
or revoked or voided by the Zoning Administrator.
I. Acceptance of permit before commencement of work. It shall be the
duty of the applicant to review and accept the terms and conditions of
any permit before commencement of work pursuant to such permit.
Commencement of work pursuant to a permit automatically constitutes
acceptance of the permit and waives any right to appeal or challenge
the permit decision, the permit or any condition thereof. Any permit not
accepted prior to work commencing may be suspended by the Zoning
Administrator or revoked or voided by the Zoning Administrator.
J. Time limits.
(1) The time limits for development applications shall be as follows:
(a) All written site and operational plan approvals issued by the
Village shall be effective for a period of 180 days from and after
the date of written notification to the applicant of the decision
to approve the application for purposes of the granting of any
erosion control permit, zoning permit and/or building permit.
In the event that conditions precedent to such written approval
are not satisfied within such one-hundred-eight-day period, or
the final site and operational plans are not signed in
accordance with § 420-56H of this chapter within such onehundred-
eight-day period, or in the event that necessary
erosion control, zoning or building permits are not granted
within such one-hundred-eight-day period, a new application
for site and operational plan approval shall be filed in
§ 420-22 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-22
344:801
accordance with § 420-55 of this chapter. [Note the waiver
provisions of § 420-55D with respect to applications to renew
site and operational plan approvals that have lapsed pursuant
to this Subsection J(1) or § 420-56I of this chapter.]
(b) All conditional use permits and stipulated shoreland permits
shall be granted or denied within six months after the
application is submitted, unless the time is extended by mutual
agreement between the Village and the petitioner/owner. If the
above application is granted, the required conditional use or
stipulated shoreland grant document shall be signed and the
building and zoning permits or erosion control permit shall be
issued within six months from the Village approval date of said
application. If said grant document is not signed and the
permits are not issued, said approval and grant shall be invalid
and the applicant shall reapply. A new application, fee and
revised plans, which reflect new or amended Village or state
requirements, shall be submitted for Village Plan Commission
and/or Village Board approval.
(2) The time limits for zoning permits shall be as follows:
(a) All zoning permits that have been applied for and approved by
the Village, except as noted in above, shall be issued to the
petitioner/owner within 30 days from the date the plans were
approved. If the permit is not issued the approval shall be
voided. The Village will return the plans to the owner/
applicant, and the Village shall invoice the property owner for
the plan review fee for the project. If this invoice is not paid per
Village requirements, the cost shall be assessed to the property
for which the permit application was made. If the permit
approval has been voided, the owner/petitioner shall resubmit
all of the required applications and application materials for
review and approval.
(b) All zoning permits for residential accessory structures shall
expire within 12 months of the issuance of said permit. The
applicant may request that the permit be renewed, prior to the
expiration, for an additional six months only after paying the
required renewal fee. If said permit expires, the applicant shall
reapply for a building and zoning permit before recommencing
work on the structure. Any permit issued in conflict with the
provisions of this chapter shall be null and void. [Amended
7-6-2015 by Ord. No. 15-21]
(c) All zoning permits related to the construction of a new singlefamily
or two-family house shall expire within two years, unless
the project is substantially completed, as defined below. The
applicant may request that the permit be renewed, prior to the
expiration, for an additional year only after paying the required
renewal fee. If said permit expires, the applicant shall reapply
§ 420-22 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-22
344:802
for a building and zoning permit before recommencing work on
the structure. Any permit issued in conflict with the provisions
of this chapter shall be null and void.
(d) All zoning permits related to the construction of any
commercial, industrial, institutional, government, park and
recreation, or multifamily structure shall be completed per
§ COMM 50.17, Wis. Adm. Code,111 which may be amended
from time to time. If said permit expires, the applicant shall
reapply for a building and zoning permit before recommencing
work on the structure. Any permit issued in conflict with the
provisions of this chapter shall be null and void.
(e) All zoning permits for a sign shall automatically expire 12
months after the date of issuance of the permit, or if a building
permit is associated with the permit, said permit shall be
automatically extended to match the expiration date of said
building permit. After such right expires, or after the permit is
revoked or voided, or while it is suspended, no work requiring
such a permit shall be commenced, continued or resumed until
after a new permit is issued or until after the original permit
has been reinstated. A suspension of the permit tolls the
remainder of such twelve-month period. [Amended 7-6-2015
by Ord. No. 15-21]
(f) A zoning permit may be extended in writing by the Zoning
Administrator for up to 60 additional days upon a showing of
good cause by the applicant and the payment of any permit
extension fee imposed by or pursuant to this chapter, provided
that the applicant's rights under the permit have not expired or
been revoked or voided. New or amended regulations that
have become effective after the approval of the initial permit
shall be applied to any application for an extension, and an
extension shall not be granted unless the original application is
amended to conform to such new or amended regulations.
(3) For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the
meaning indicated:
SUBSTANTIAL CONSTRUCTION  The construction is equivalent
to 25% of the projected cost of the project as noted on the
application for the permit.
SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED  Construction equivalent to 75%
of the projected cost of the project as noted on the application for
the permit has in fact been completed.
K. Assignment. A permit may be assigned to a new owner or user of the
property, or to a successor of the applicant, upon written consent of the
Zoning Administrator, provided that the rights pursuant to the permit
111. Editor's Note: For the Commercial Building Code, see Chs. SPS 361 to 366.
§ 420-22 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-22
344:803
have not expired or been revoked or voided, that there are no uncured
violations of the permit or of this chapter associated with such permit
and that the assignee or successor accepts the permit and timely
satisfies all conditions of the permit to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Zoning Administrator.
L. Inspections required. The Zoning Administrator designee may inspect
the premises for which any permit is issued, during all reasonable
hours, to ensure compliance with this chapter and all orders, decisions,
permits or other approvals made or issued pursuant thereto.
M. Suspension, revocation or voiding of permit.
(1) In the event the Zoning Administrator determines, prior to the
completion of permitted work pursuant to a permit, that the work is
not in accordance with the terms and conditions of such permit or
the requirements of this chapter, or that the information on the
basis of which the permit was approved or issued was untrue or
inaccurate in material respects, the Zoning Administrator may
suspend such permit, notify the applicant or the applicant's
designated agent in writing by first class mail or by fax of the
reasons for the suspension, and issue a written stop-work order
until the problem or defect is cured to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Zoning Administrator. In the event the applicant refuses or
fails to cure the problem or defect within 30 days following such
notice of suspension, and after conferring with the applicant or the
applicant's agent regarding such refusal or failure, the Zoning
Administrator may revoke said permit and notify the applicant in
writing by first class mail or by fax of the reasons for the revocation
and any related violations.
(2) In the event the Zoning Administrator determines, after the
completion of work done pursuant to any such permit, that the
work was not in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
permit or the requirements of this chapter, or that the information
on the basis of which the permit was approved or issued was
inaccurate in material respects, the Zoning Administrator shall
issue and cause to be served a notice of violation. If such violations
are not cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator within 30 days following service of such notice of
violation, the Zoning Administrator may, in addition to all other
remedies, void the permit and promptly notify the owner in writing
by first class mail or by fax of the reasons for voiding the permit.
(3) Work completed pursuant to a permit which has been revoked or
voided is illegal and a violation of this chapter.
N. Circularity. In the event of any circularity between the precondition
requirements for issuing any permit, certificate or approval under this
chapter and any applicable requirements of any other ordinance or law,
e.g. where this chapter requires that an approval under ordinance x be
§ 420-22 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-22
344:804
obtained before a permit can be issued under this chapter but
ordinance x requires that the permit under this chapter be obtained
before an approval under that ordinance can be issued, the Zoning
Administrator and all other Village officials and bodies charged with
the administration and enforcement of such ordinances, in order to
harmonize such requirements, are authorized to issue necessary
permits, certificates and approvals, the effective date of which is
conditioned upon full compliance with specified requirements of other
ordinances or laws. Whenever such a circulatory is discovered, it shall
promptly be brought to the attention of the Village Board so that
appropriate legislative action can be considered. In the event that any
permit, certificate or approval is issued, the effective date of which is so
conditioned, the expiration date of such permit, certificate or approval
shall be determined by its date of issuance rather than its effective date.
O. Plan changes. No plans, specifications or data approved by the Zoning
Administrator in connection with the issuance of a permit, issued
pursuant to this chapter, shall be changed or modified in any manner,
nor shall the amount or character of any work authorized by such
approval be changed or modified, unless the written approval of the
Zoning Administrator is first obtained. No such change or modification
shall be approved unless the changes or modifications are in
compliance with all applicable provisions of this chapter and all orders,
decisions, permits or other approvals required, made or issued
pursuant to this chapter. All documents evidencing such approved
changes or modifications shall be endorsed, filed, distributed and
maintained in the same manner as the original documents.
P. Plans on file. Two sets of plans, specifications and data shall be
submitted with each application, unless otherwise required. Upon
approval, one set of approved plans, specifications and data shall be
returned to the owner at the time the permit is issued and the second
approved copy shall be retained by the Community Development
Department and filed as a public record. The owner is responsible to
have an approved set of plans, specifications and data readily
accessible on any construction site, and said plan set shall be open at all
reasonable times to inspection by the Zoning Administrator.
Q. Invalid permits. Any permit intended to authorize a violation of this
chapter is, to that extent, invalid and of no legal force or effect. Each
applicant for a permit required by this chapter is charged with
knowledge of this chapter, which is available for inspection and
purchase, and no reliance on any erroneous statement made, assurance
given or permit issued contrary to the provisions of this chapter is
reasonable.
R. Disclaimer. All permits issued by the Community Development
Department shall note the following disclaimer: "Each applicant for a
permit is charged with the knowledge of the Village Zoning Ordinance.
Copies of said ordinance or portions thereof and copies of the Official
Zoning Maps are available for sale, copying or inspection upon request.
§ 420-22 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-22
344:805
§ 420-23. Other permits.
It is the responsibility of a permit applicant to secure all other necessary
permits required by any federal, state or local agency.
§ 420-24. Surveys/certifications required.
Any statement made, assurance given or permit erroneously issued
contrary to this chapter is null and void."
A. Foundation surveys.
(1) Requirement. No work on a new principal building for which a
zoning permit is required by this chapter shall proceed beyond
completion of the footings, concrete slab or other foundation, or
basement walls up to the first floor level, until the Zoning
Administrator has approved the foundation survey that indicates
that such footings, foundation or walls, as built, are located in
accordance with the requirements of the zoning permit and the
applicable provisions of this chapter.
(2) Procedure. The owner shall submit to the Zoning Administrator,
upon completion of the footings, foundation, or basement walls of
any principal building for which a zoning permit is required by this
chapter, a survey prepared by a Wisconsin registered land surveyor
showing the exact distance of the new footings, foundation or
basement walls, as built, at their closest point, to existing buildings
and structures, property lines, the ordinary high-water mark of any
navigable waterway, or any floodplain and/or wetlands located on
the lot or parcel. No additional work shall commence until the
Zoning Administrator has approved said location for compliance
with this chapter.
B. Release of waiver of foundation survey. The Zoning Administrator is
authorized to prepare a release of waiver of foundation survey if the
permit applicant waived the foundation survey requirements of
§ 12.05-4(a) of the Kenosha County General Zoning and Shoreland/
Floodplain Zoning Ordinance at the time the Village of Pleasant Prairie
was the Town of Pleasant Prairie, where the permit applicant(s) caused
a waiver of liability of foundation survey to be filed with the Kenosha
County Register of Deeds in compliance with § 12.05-4(a) of the
Kenosha County General Zoning and Shoreland/Floodplain Zoning
Ordinance. Upon receipt of the applicable fee and a foundation survey
prepared for said property by a Wisconsin registered land surveyor, the
Village shall verify that the structure was build in conformity with the
requirements of § 12.05-4(a) of the Kenosha County General Zoning and
Shoreland/Floodplain Zoning Ordinance at the time the zoning permit
was issued by Kenosha County. If the structure is in conformance with
said ordinance, the Village shall prepare a waiver of foundation survey
document to be executed by the current owner(s) of said property and
§ 420-22 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-24
344:806
recorded at the Kenosha County Register of Deeds office at the owner's
expense.
C. Certificate of occupancy/certificate of compliance. [Amended
7-6-2015 by Ord. No. 15-21]
(1) Requirement. No person shall use or occupy any newly completed
building or structure, and no person shall use or occupy any newly
completed portion of any existing building or structure, unless a
valid certificate of occupancy or certificate of compliance has first
been issued for such use or occupancy and such permit has neither
expired nor been suspended or revoked. No person shall commence
any new occupancy of any existing building or structure for any use
other than a permitted residential use in a residential zoning
district or a permitted agricultural use in any agriculture zoning
district unless a valid certificate of occupancy has first been issued
for such use or occupancy and such permit has neither expired nor
has been suspended or revoked.
(2) Preconditions. No certificate of occupancy or certificate of
compliance shall be issued unless:
(a) Valid zoning, building and erosion control permits or other
required permits were issued for the project; and
(b) The project, as built, was completed in accordance with all
applicable provisions of this chapter and of any orders,
decisions, permits or other approvals made or issued pursuant
to Village ordinances.
D. Verbal or temporary occupancy. To facilitate occupancy and prevent
unnecessary hardship, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue a
verbal or temporary occupancy with respect to any building or
structure, or any part of a building or structure, for which valid permits
have been issued, prior to completion of the building or structure,
provided that such temporary occupancy will not jeopardize the safety,
health, or public welfare of the occupants or the general public. The
Zoning Administrator is authorized to impose as conditions upon the
issuance of such verbal occupancy whatever temporary precautionary
measures may be required to safeguard the public. No such verbal
occupancy shall be construed as vesting in the applicant any right to
receive a certificate of occupancy for a building or structure, or a part
of a building or structure, unless it satisfies all requirements of this
chapter, Chapter 370, Building and Mechanical Code, of the Village
Code, or other ordinances that would be applicable to such building or
structure in the absence of the verbal occupancy certificate or any
activity conducted pursuant thereto. [Amended 7-6-2015 by Ord. No.

§ 420-24 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-25
344:807
§ 420-25. Vested rights.
The following provisions shall govern administrative determinations
regarding vested rights to nonconforming use status which are made under
or pursuant to this chapter:
A. Permit necessary but not sufficient. No claim to a vested right to valid
nonconforming use status shall be administratively recognized unless
such claim is based in part upon the issuance of valid permits required
under this chapter, and no such claim shall be administratively
recognized unless there was a substantial change of position in reliance
upon such permit(s) during the period that such permit(s) was (were) in
full force and effect.
B. Presumptions. There shall be a rebuttal presumption against the
existence of a vested right that depends upon conduct which occurred
in reliance upon the issuance of a valid permit required under this
chapter that had not expired or been suspended or revoked at the time
of the conduct in question but which occurred prior to the issuance of
said permit that was required to institute the nonconforming use or any
expansion thereof. There shall be a rebuttal presumption in favor of the
existence of a vested right that depends upon conduct which occurred
under or pursuant to a validly issued building permit that had not
expired or been suspended or revoked at the time of the conduct in
question.
C. Loss. A vested right to nonconforming use status can be lost for the
same reasons and to the same extent that valid nonconforming use
status can be lost. If substantial construction or site development work
has not commenced or has been discontinued for a twelve-month
period, vested rights may be lost.

ARTICLE VII
Business License
[Amended 4-10-2006 by Ord. No. 06-19; 5-20-2013 by Ord. No.
13-17; 11-21-2016 by Ord. No. 16-37]
§ 420-40. Purpose.
§ 420-41. Home-based business.
A. A business license is required to operate in the Village. There are
various types of Pleasant Prairie licenses and permits that are required
by various government entities at the federal, state and local levels.
This zoning license is the basic type of license that is required for all
home-based and non-home-based businesses in Pleasant Prairie.
B. This article is not a regulation of occupation but rather to verify
locations of active business operations, to obtain emergency contact
information in order to notify and provide efficient public safety
services to the business, to support economic development activities
and to verify compliance with the site and operational zoning
regulations of the Village. The information gathered from the business
license application and the annual renewal is essential to performing
the community's public-safety- and public-work-related services. The
information obtained from the business license application and annual
renewals is also important to the community for the purposes of its
overall economic development business attraction and retention
strategy insofar as the Village will be able to track and maintain an
accurate listing of all active businesses, relevant contact information,
employment counts and anticipated employment growth projections on
an annual basis.
C. All businesses in the Village shall obtain and maintain an annual
business license for any home-based or non-home-based businesses
operating in the Village pursuant to the requirements of this article. If
more than one business is located within a building, each business is
required to obtain a separate business license. Properties with more
than one principal building or more than one principal building address
are required to obtain a separate business license for each principal
building on the property.
A. Intent. It is the intent of this section to permit home-based businesses in
any home within a residential, agricultural, or conservancy zoning
district, provided that such use conforms to the standards and
conditions set forth in this section, conforms to all Village Municipal
Code requirements and maintains an active and continuous Village
business license. In general, a home-based business is an accessory use
located on the property and conducted so that a typical neighbor would
not be aware of said use other than for a sign as herein permitted. The
standards and conditions for home-based businesses in this section are
intended to ensure compatibility with other permitted adjacent uses
§ 420-40 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-41
344:827
and to maintain the residential character of the neighborhood or
underlying zoning district. A home-based business and/or regularly
occurring activity is a business activity which results in a product being
produced or service being performed and is conducted in whole or
in part in the principal or accessory building on the property and is
clearly subordinate to the residential use of the dwelling and property.
A community living arrangement, within a single-family or two-family
dwelling as defined in this chapter, with 15 or fewer persons, is not
classified as a home-based business and is exempt from this section;
however, it is required to obtain a business license pursuant to
§ 420-42.
B. Requirements.
(1) The home-based business shall be carried out by the property
owner or occupant at his or her place of primary residence, and
said home-based business use shall be clearly incidental to the
residential or agricultural use of the principal or accessory building
and parcel and shall not change the essential residential character
of the dwelling and parcel. "Primary residence" shall be defined as
follows:
(a) The place where the owner's or occupant's habitation is fixed,
without any present intent to move, and to which, when absent,
the person intends to return.
(b) The primary residence of a person performing the home-based
business is the main home that the person lives in for a
majority of the year as defined by the Internal Revenue
Service. A person shall not have more than one primary
residence for the purposes of operating a home occupation.
(c) When a person's spouse and/or family resides at one place and
the other spouse's business is conducted at another place, the
former place establishes the place of primary residence for the
purpose of determining whether a home-based business may
be conducted at the requested premises.
(d) No person gains the right to conduct a home-based business at
a residence while living there for temporary purposes only.
(2) The home-based business shall not be detrimental to the public
health, safety and welfare.
(3) No more than 25% of the principal building or the accessory
building area shall be used to conduct the home-based business.
Further, there shall be no more than two home-based businesses
conducted from the same premises, provided that the combined
home-based business usage does not exceed 25% of either the
principal or accessory buildings on the premises and all other
home-based business requirements as set forth in this section are
met.
§ 420-41 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-41
344:828
(4) No outside storage or displays shall be used in connection with the
home-based business.
(5) No chemical, mechanical or electrical equipment that is not
normally a part of domestic or household equipment shall be used
in connection with the home-based business which may cause an
interference, disruption or nuisance to an adjacent property owner
on a regular basis.
(6) No machinery or equipment shall be used in connection with the
home-based business that causes noises or other interference in
radio or television reception.
(7) No commercial machine repair or sharpening of equipment or
machines shall be done which may cause an interference,
disruption or nuisance to an adjacent property owner on a regular
basis.
(8) No internal or external building alterations inconsistent with the
residential use of the building shall be permitted.
(9) No construction equipment or construction-related vehicles or
trailers shall be parked or stored on the property.
(10)No commercial construction or delivery vans, trucks, semi-trucks/
semitrailers, truck cabs, box trucks, buses, trailers or any vehicle
licensed or rated to be in excess of 7,000 pounds shall be parked or
stored on the property.
(11)No more than four passenger vehicles shall be permitted at the
referenced property at any one time in connection with the conduct
of the home-based business or regularly occurring activity.
(12) The home-based business shall not cause parking or traffic
congestion problems on the adjacent roadways or neighboring
properties.
(13) The home-based business shall be carried out by the occupant of
the home; however, no more than two nonresidents may be
employed and work on the property.
(14)No display of products shall be visible from the street or the
adjacent property.
(15) Instruction in music, dancing and similar subjects shall be limited
to two students at a time.
(16) Only off-street parking facilities normal for residential use on the
property shall be used.
(17) Deliveries accepted shall be by United States Mail, UPS, Federal
Express or other mail carrier. Semi-truck deliveries shall not be
accepted more than once a month.
§ 420-41 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-41
344:829
(18) Signs shall be subject to regulations in Article X.
(19) If a state or federal license is required for the home-based
business, then a current and valid copy of said license shall be
provided to the Village.
C. Permitted home-based businesses. The following are hereby declared to
be home-based businesses as intended by this section. It is recognized
that it is neither possible nor practicable to list all of the home-based
businesses that are compatible with those listed below, and therefore it
is intended that the aforementioned list of home-based businesses be
illustrative only. Any individual aggrieved by a failure to list a particular
home-based business in this section shall have the right to file a petition
with the Zoning Administrator for a determination as to the similarity of
the intended home-based business with the home-based businesses
listed below.
(1) Artists, sculptors or photographers.

(5) An annual business license (valid during the calendar year) will be
electronically provided to the applicant to print and shall be kept
on file at the business to provide as proof of the required license if
requested by the Village.
(6) A business license issued pursuant to this section is
nontransferable.
§ 420-42 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-43
344:832
B. Renewal of license.
(1) On or about November 15 of each year, the Village will send a
business license renewal notice via regular mail or electronically to
each active home-based and non-home-based business within the
Village. Failure to receive notice does not preclude the business
from the requirement to renew the license.
(2) The renewal application and renewal fee pursuant to § 420-29 of
this chapter shall be submitted to the Village on or before January
15 of every year. If the business fails to renew the license by
January 15 of each year, then a late fee will be assessed and the
business may be subject to further zoning violations, forfeitures or
fines.
(3) When a business is no longer operating at the location as identified
on the previous year's license, written notification shall be provided
to the Village Community Development Department. If the business
relocates to a new location in the Village, a new business license
will be required since a business license is nontransferable.
C. Notice of change. Any expanded home-based or non-home-based
business shall submit the applicable business license application and
fee pursuant to § 420-29 of this chapter at the time the required
building permit application is submitted for the expanded use. An
expanded home-based or non-home-based business is one that modifies
its business operations in such a manner which increases its building
square footage or involves remodeling or renovations so as to require
the issuance of a building permit; or where there is a change in
ownership and other contact information for the business; or which
commences a new business activity that would substantially modify or
change the total full-time, part-time or seasonal employment of the
business, which in turn may impact the business site by blocking
building exiting areas, causing restrictions to the emergency access or
fire lane access, or by causing vehicles to park in nondesignated
parking areas or on the adjacent roadways.
D. Open records requests for personally identifiable information. As part
of the business license application, the Village may collect the names,
addresses, phone numbers, e-mails, and other personally identifiable
information for owners and emergency contacts of businesses in the
Village. That information will enable the Village to quickly communicate
with businesses in the event of an emergency or other circumstances
requiring an immediate response. The Village recognizes that any
personally identifiable information gathered may be a record subject to
requests and disclosure under § 19.35, Wis. Stats. The Village has
determined, in addition to the general presumption of disclosure, that
the following public interests will affect all requests for personally
identifiable information gathered in business license applications: 1) no
public interests generally favor disclosure; 2) the public interest in
preserving the privacy of private employees and business owners
§ 420-43 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-43
344:833
weighs against disclosure; and 3) the Village favors nondisclosure of
the information to encourage more business license applicants to
provide the Village with the requested contact information. The Village
directs the custodian in charge of its records to balance these interests,
as well as any other public interests that may apply to a particular
request, when determining whether to release or withhold personally
identifiable information from business license applications.
E. Other Village ordinances. Any references in the Village Ordinances to a
"home occupation" shall also be referred to as a "home-based business"
as defined in § 420-41 above.
F. Enforcement and penalties: pursuant to Article XIX of this chapter.

§ 420-46. Driveways in agricultural, single-family, two-family and
conservancy districts.
All driveways installed, altered, changed, replaced, or extended in an
agricultural, single-family or two-family or conservancy district shall meet
the following requirements:
B. Roadway offsets (jogged intersections). Roadway offsets shall not be
allowed in any district unless they meet the criteria as set forth in
Subsection A above.
C. Boulevard islands and medians within roadways. Boulevard islands and
medians within roadways shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width
(measured from back of curb to back of curb), except for entrances to a
subdivision where an entrance boulevard island shall be a minimum of
seven feet in width (measured from the front of curb to front of curb).
Location of openings within boulevard islands or medians is subject to
Village approval. Driveway openings shall be aligned with boulevard
island or median openings.
D. Access barriers. Permanent or temporary access barriers, such as
bollards, barricades, curbing, fencing, ditching, landscaping, or other
topographic barriers, shall be erected where required by the Plan
Commission or Zoning Administrator to prevent unauthorized vehicle
ingress or egress to the above-specified streets or highways.
E. Other urban design standards not listed. The spacing, location, turning
radii and median width and other highway geometrics not listed for
roadways shall be in accordance with the standards set forth in the
book titled "Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets"
prepared for American Standards for Highways and Traffic Operations
(ASHTO), prepared by the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials, 1984, as amended from time to time, and
supplemental highway engineering and construction standards and
specifications approved by the Wisconsin Department of
Transportation.
A. Width. The minimum width of a driveway shall be 12 feet, and the
driveway shall not exceed 24 feet in width at the property line. In no
case shall a driveway extend into the right-of-way so as to cross the
extension of the side property line as extended into the right-of-way.
B. Setback. Driveways shall be a minimum of five feet from the side or rear
property line, and a minimum of 10 feet from wetlands on said property,
except as provided in Subsection C below.
C. Exceptions to the driveway setback.
(1) The Village Zoning Administrator may allow for encroachment into
the required setback in the following instances:
(a) Extension of a nonconforming driveway.
§ 420-45 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-46
344:837
(b) Installation of a driveway that cannot meet said requirements
if there is no garage on said lot and if an attached garage
cannot be constructed and a detached garage must be
constructed in the rear of the property.
(c) Environmental or drainage problems prevent the meeting of
this requirement.
(2) Encroachment into the setback may be allowed only if the following
conditions are satisfied:
(a) Proper drainage is provided so as not to cause a drainage
problem on said property or adjacent properties;
(b) An area for snow removal and snow storage is provided; and
(c) Any other requirements deemed necessary by the Village to
ensure that public health, safety and welfare are not
compromised.
D. Location of driveway in relation to intersections.
(1) Spacing between driveways and intersections of county, state or
Village arterial roadways. No direct driveway access shall be
permitted within 150 feet, as measured from the center line of the
roadway to the center line of the driveway, of any county, state or
Village arterial roadway intersection, except where existing platted
residential lots have insufficient frontage to meet this requirement,
then the driveway shall be placed as far from the intersection as
practically possible. In the event that a particular parcel lacks
adequate road frontage for access to maintain adequate spacing
between driveways, the property owner may obtain approval from
the Zoning Administrator or shared common driveway access from
the roadway per Subsection F may be approved.
(2) Spacing between driveways and intersections of all other Village
public or private roadways. No direct driveway access shall be
permitted within 100 feet, as measured from the center line of the
roadway to the center line of the driveway, of all other Village
public or private road intersections, except where existing platted
residential lots have insufficient frontage to meet this requirement,
then the driveway shall be placed as far from the intersection as
practically possible. In the event that a particular parcel lacks
adequate road frontage for access to maintain adequate spacing
between driveways, the property owner may obtain approval from
the Zoning Administrator or shared common driveway access from
the roadway per Subsection F may be approved.
E. Number of driveways. Only one driveway shall be allowed onto a state,
county or Village arterial roadway, except farm access points may be
approved by the county, state or Village Zoning Administrator for their
respective roadway jurisdiction, provided that all other Village
§ 420-46 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-46
344:838
§ 420-47. Driveways in business, manufacturing, multifamily,
institutional and park and recreational districts.
All driveways installed, altered, changed, replaced, or extended in any
business, manufacturing, multifamily, institutional or park and recreational
district shall meet the following requirements:
driveway requirements are satisfied. More than one driveway onto all
Village public or private roadways may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator, provided that the distance as measured from the center
line to the center line of each driveway is a minimum of 55 feet and all
other driveway requirements are satisfied.
F. Shared driveway access. Shared driveway access may be allowed by the
Plan Commission as long as the underlying district minimum lots widths
are maintained. The shared driveway entrance shall not cross property
lines at the right-of-way. If a shared driveway access is approved, an
easement and maintenance agreement shall be prepared by the
property owner, approved by the Village and recorded at the owner'
expense at the Kenosha County Register of Deeds office.
A. Driveway spacing.
(1) Driveway spacing shall be determined as a function of the adjacent
and/or intersecting roadway operating speeds. Spacing between
driveways and the spacing between driveways and an intersection
for all uses except single-family and two-family residential land
uses shall be determined according to the following table as
outlined below:
Minimum Space Between Driveway
Entrances and/or Adjacent
Intersections as Measured from Center
Line to Center Line
(feet)

40 185 370
45 230 460
50 275 550
Source: Wisconsin Department of Transportation and Village of
Pleasant Prairie.
(2) The spacing is based on average vehicle acceleration and
deceleration rates and is considered necessary to maintain safe
§ 420-46 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-47
344:839
traffic operation. Spacing shall be measured from the midpoint of
each driveway or intersection. In the event that a particular parcel
lacks frontage to maintain adequate spacing, the property owner
has one of two options: the property owner can seek approval from
the Zoning Administrator for minimum spacing, but in no case
should the distance be greater than the next lowest classification
on the above table; or the adjacent property owners may agree to
establish a common driveway. This provision does not lessen the
minimum lot width requirement on a public roadway.
(3) To further clarify the above chart the following examples are being
provided:
(a) Example 1: If a driveway is proposed to be located on a
nonarterial road which has a speed limit of 30 miles per hour
and said nonarterial road intersects an arterial road which has
a speed limit of 50 miles per hour, then the driveway shall be
located either on the arterial (unless restricted access
prohibits said driveway) or nonarterial road a minimum of 550
feet as measured from the center line of the driveway and the
center line of the intersecting arterial street.
(b) Example 2: If a second driveway is proposed to be located on
the nonarterial road as described above in Example 1, then the
second driveway shall be a minimum of 125 feet from the first
driveway and shall be a minimum of 550 feet from the center
line of the intersecting arterial street.
(c) Example 3: If a second driveway is proposed to be located on
the arterial road as described above in Example 1, then the
second driveway shall be a minimum of 550 feet from the
driveway that is a minimum of 550 feet from the center line of
the intersecting arterial street.
(d) Example 4: If a driveway is proposed to be located on an
arterial road which has a speed limit of 45 miles per hour and
said arterial road intersects another arterial road which has a
speed limit of 50 miles per hour, then the driveway shall be
located a minimum of 550 feet as measured from the center
line of the driveway and the center line of either intersecting
arterial street.
B. Offset driveways. Offset driveways shall not be allowed in any district
unless they meet the criteria as set forth in Subsection A above.
C. Sight distance.
(1) All driveways shall be located so that an exiting vehicle has an
unobstructed sight distance according to the following minimum
sight distance table as outlined below:
§ 420-47 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-47

(2) Sight distance is defined as the minimum distance required by a
driver of a vehicle traveling at a given speed to bring the vehicle to
a stop after sighting an object in the path. Stopping sight distance
is measured from the driver's eyes, which are assumed to be 3.5
feet above the pavement surface, to an object 1/2 foot high on the
pavement. (Source: American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials, 1984, and the Wisconsin Department of
Transportation's Facility Development Manual.)
D. Width. The maximum width of a driveway shall not exceed 35 feet at the
property line. The Zoning Administrator, however, may allow an
increase in width to provide for safer and adequate traffic movements.
In no case shall a driveway extend into the right-of-way so as to cross
the extension of the side property lines as extended into the right-ofway.
[Amended 5-17-2010 by Ord. No. 10-29]
E. Setback. Driveways shall be a minimum of 20 feet from the side or rear
property line and a minimum of 25 feet from any wetlands on said
property.
F. Driveway design. Any driveway design shall allow an entering vehicle
maximum turning speed of 15 miles per hour to help reduce
interference with through street traffic.
G. Off-street storage on driveway. Driveways shall be sufficient to provide
off-street storage to accommodate at least three vehicles waiting to
park or exit without using any portion of the street right-of-way or in
any other way interfering with traffic.
H. Number of driveways. A maximum of one driveway opening shall be
permitted to a particular site from each of any one or two abutting
Village public or private streets. In an attempt to promote good traffic
circulation, the Plan Commission may permit an additional driveway
entrance along a continuous site with frontage in excess of 300 feet,
provided that the separation distance does not conflict with the spacing
criteria as listed in Subsection A above or more restrictive
requirements as set forth by the state or county. All driveway access to

At the time any use or building, except a single-family home, is constructed,
or at the time an existing use or building, except a single-family home,
is enlarged, extended, relocated or remodeled by 50% or more of the
gross floor area, then the following off-street parking requirements shall be
complied with:
a county or state right-of-way requires approval from the county or
state.
I. One-way driveways. Only one right in, right out only driveway may be
used per 250 feet of frontage.
J. Dual-service driveway. A dual-service driveway (one lane in, one or two
lanes out, separated by a boulevard) shall be considered to be only one
direct-access driveway.
K. Temporary driveway access. Temporary driveway access may be
granted by the Village Plan Commission after review and
recommendations by the highway agencies having jurisdiction. Such
Village access permit shall be temporary, revocable, and subject to any
conditions required and shall be issued for a period not to exceed 12
months.
L. Shared driveway access. Shared driveway access may be allowed by the
Plan Commission as long as the underlying district minimum lots widths
are maintained. The shared driveway entrance may cross property lines
at the right-of-way, except for driveway access onto a county or state
highway right-of-way, then the driveway shall not cross property lines.
If a shared driveway access is approved, an easement and maintenance
agreement shall be prepared by the property owner, approved by the
Village and recorded at the owner's expense at the Kenosha County
Register of Deeds office.
A. Internal site circulation, access roads and private roads. Internal site
circulation, access roads and private roads serving property located
within the R-7, R-8, R-9, R-10, R-11 and R-12 Districts and business,
manufacturing, institutional or recreational districts shall be
constructed of an all-weather paved surface roadway with a minimum
width of 30 feet as measured from face of curb to face of curb.
B. Parking space size. The size of each parking space shall meet the
following criteria as listed below. All parking spaces shall provide
adequate access and maneuvering and proper ingress and egress which
shall not be part of the required space, and vehicles shall not extend
beyond the required space size.
(1) Ninety-degree, sixty-degree and forty-five-degree parking spaces
shall measure nine feet by 18 feet.
(2) Parallel parking spaces shall measure nine feet by 23 feet.
§ 420-47 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-48
344:842
(3) Handicapped parking spaces shall be provided as required by the
Ch. COMM 69, Barrier-Free Design, Wis. Adm. Code, which may be
amended from time to time.
C. Minimum number of off-street parking spaces. Minimum number of offstreet
parking spaces shall be provided as required in § 420-50.
D. Handicapped parking requirements. In addition to any other
requirements relating to parking spaces contained in this chapter, the
provisions contained in §§ 101.13, 346.503 and 346.56, Wis. Stats., and
any Wisconsin Administrative Code sections adopted pursuant thereto,
are hereby adopted by reference and are made applicable to all parking
facilities whenever constructed.
E. Combinations. Combinations of any of the above uses shall provide the
total of the number of spaces required for each individual use.
F. Uses not listed. In the case of structures or uses not mentioned in
§ 420-50, the parking space provisions for a use which is similar, as
determined by the Village Zoning Administrator, shall apply.
G. Shared off-street parking. Off-street parking spaces for separate uses
may be provided collectively or shared if the total number of spaces
provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirement of the
uses being served.
H. Adjustment of spaces required. The Village Plan Commission, after
careful review and consideration, may adjust the minimum number of
required parking spaces due to additional factors which may be
present, such as the availability of on-street parking adjacent to the
development or use; peak or off-peak parking requirements; additional
parking needs; additional parking needs; or dependency of automobile
traffic to access the site.
I. Off-street parking lot aisle widths. The aisle widths for two-way traffic
within parking lots shall be a minimum of 24 feet between the ends of
the parking spaces, except as may be required in Subsection J below.
The aisle widths for one-way traffic within parking lots shall be a
minimum of 20 feet, except as may be required in Subsection J below.

roadways with a minimum width of 30 feet and set back at least the
maximum height of the building adjacent to the fire lane, but not to
exceed 50 feet from the building, unless otherwise approved by the Fire
& Rescue Chief. [Amended 3-17-2014 by Ord. No. 14-03]
K. Location. The location of each parking space shall be on the same lot as
the principal use or structure. However, upon approval of the Plan
Commission, the closest off-street parking lot, on adjacent properties,
may be located up to 400 feet from the principal use or structure.

L. Setback for parking areas (which includes parking spaces,
maneuvering lanes and fire lanes). [Amended 10-19-2009 by Ord.
No. 09-51; 11-19-2012 by Ord. No. 12-39]
(1) Parking areas shall meet the following minimum setbacks:
(a) Twenty feet from all adjoining street rights-of-way, private
roadways and lot lines, except as provided in Subsection
L(1)(b), (c) and (d) below;
(b) Fifty feet from any railroad right-of-way, excluding railroad
spurs and parking areas in the manufacturing districts,
whereby the parking setback may be reduced to zero; and
(c) Twenty-five feet from any wetlands on the property.
(d) Other exceptions:
[1] For parking areas on abutting properties, the parking area
setback to internal, nonstreet lot lines may be reduced to a
minimum of 10 feet in order to achieve a minimum twentyfoot-
wide separation between parking areas upon the
development of both properties. In no case shall the
distance between abutting parking areas be less than 20
feet. Parking areas shall not encroach into easement areas
without written approval.
[2] If a commercial parking area abuts any residential district,
no vehicle shall be allowed to travel on a driveway or park
closer than 25 feet to the abutting residential property
line.
(2) These required setback areas shall be used for an open green space
with plantings, sidewalks, if required, or signage, provided that it
meets the minimum setback requirements for said sign.
M. Cross access easements. Cross access easements for vehicles or
pedestrian travel between properties may be required by the Plan
Commission to promote safe and controlled access points. Such
agreement, if required, shall be prepared by the developer, reviewed
and approved by the Village and recorded at the Register of Deeds
office. At a minimum such easement shall include a legal description, its
specific use and maintenance responsibilities.
N. Surfacing. All off-street parking areas shall be graded and surfaced with
asphalt or concrete so as to be dust- and mud-free and properly

from the Village's Community Development Department. Any
application relating to real property for which site and operational plan
approval has not previously been granted since April 5, 1989, shall be a
full site and operational plan approval application; provided, however,
that an application filed only pursuant to § 420-52A(7) above shall be
required to address the proposed exterior alterations or repairs and
compliance of such alterations or repairs with applicable construction
design standards (and, in the case of proposed exterior alterations or
repairs to a sign, their compliance with applicable sign standards). An
application involving no change in an approved site and operational
plan other than a change of occupancy, or involving only minor or
discrete amendments to an approved site and operational plan, shall
generally be subject to the provisions of Subsection D below, relating to
waiver of application requirements. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in this section, each applicant for any site and operational plan
approval shall fully, accurately and legibly complete the application
form and shall file with it eight sets of the plans and other materials and
information identified in Subsection B below and described in much
greater detail in § 420-57 below, including seven sets in which all
architectural or engineering plan sheets are full sized and one set in
which all such plan sheets have been reduced to 8 1/2 inches by 11
inches for easy handling, together with the required filing fee, which
shall be payable at the time of application. (Required filing fees are set
out in Article V of this chapter; fees of expert consultants used by the
Village in the review and evaluation of an application for site and
operational plan review shall be invoiced separately by the Village and
shall be paid by the applicant within 30 days of the date of the invoice.)
B. Site and operational plan components.
(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this article, the
following information, plans and other attachments, which are
more fully described in § 420-57 below, shall be included as part of
any application for site and operational plan approval:
(a) Applicant, site, use, project and plan information;
(b) Operational plan;
(c) Title sheet;
(d) Survey;
(e) Site plan;
(f) Grading and drainage plan;
(g) Building plan;
§ 420-55 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-55
344:860
(h) Lighting plan;
(i) Landscape and open space plan;
(j) Signage plan;
(k) Industrial/commercial waste survey;
(l) Performance standards compliance plan; and
(m) Additional requirements, as determined by the Village Zoning
Administrator, other appropriate Village staff members, or the
Village Plan Commission, as appropriate.
(2) Two or more plans may be combined, provided that all of the
information submitted on the combined plan is clearly legible, but
in no case shall the combined plans fail to show any of the
information required for each individual plan by § 420-57 below,
unless such information is waived pursuant to Subsection D below.
The applicant shall attach to the application form any waiver of
application requirements granted as a result of a preapplication
staff conference pursuant to Subsection D below.
C. Filing. Applications for site and operational plan approval shall be filed
with the Village's Community Development Department. Obviously
incomplete applications shall not be accepted for filing.
D. Waiver. The Village Zoning Administrator may waive in writing any
application requirement which is not necessary for the effective review
and determination of the application. In the event of an application to
renew a site and operational plan approval that has lapsed for purposes
of the issuance of permits pursuant to § 420-56I below, the requirement
of initially filing a new set of plans shall be waived if the previously
approved plans are on file and readily accessible, unless the Zoning
Administrator knows that substantial changes in the previously
approved plans will need to be made. Such waivers may be issued at a
preapplication conference or at any time during the application or
review process. A preapplication conference with the Zoning
Administrator or other Village zoning staff members is encouraged for
the purpose of discussing the application requirements, as they apply to
a particular proposed project or activity, and potential waivers of such
requirements.
E. Streamlining. The Village Zoning Administrator shall develop
checklists, affidavits of no change, and/or other methodologies to help
streamline the processing of site and operational plan approval
applications whenever possible.
F. Preliminary site and operational plan approval. An applicant may apply
for preliminary site and operational plan approval in connection with an
erosion control permit application for early mass grading, or in
connection with an early foundation permit, or for other good cause
§ 420-55 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-55
344:861
shown. Applications for preliminary site and operational plan approval
shall be filed and processed in accordance with this article, but the
application requirements for such a preliminary approval shall be
limited to a completed application form, survey, a site plan, a grading
and drainage plan, an operational plan (and if an early foundation
permit is sought, a preliminary building plan, plus any additional
requirements imposed by the Village Zoning Administrator in light of
the particular facts and circumstances of the situation), and payment
of a filing fee. Without limitation, the waiver and deferral provisions of
Subsections D and G, respectively, shall be applicable. A preliminary
site and operational plan approval shall vest no rights in the applicant
against changes in any ordinance requirements that occur prior to final
site and operational plan approval, and a condition of any preliminary
site and operational plan approval shall be that the applicant accepts all
risks of relying on the preliminary approval. Any approved preliminary
site and operational plan shall automatically be superseded by any
subsequently approved site and operational plan.
G. Deferral of signage plan and/or landscaping plan review and approval.
The applicant for an initial or amended site and operational plan
approval under circumstances where there will be a substantial interval
of time between site and operational plan approval and occupancy may
request deferred review and approval of that part of the required
signage plan relating to proposed new or modified signs and/or that
part of the landscaping plan relating to proposed new or modified
landscaping. Although the project may be allowed to proceed in
advance of approval of the signage plan and/or the landscaping plan,
the conditions of any site and operational plan approval with respect to
which any deferred review is approved shall include each of the
following conditions: that the applicant assumes all risks of relying on
the plan approval in advance of obtaining the deferred approvals, that
no work shall proceed with respect to any deferred matters until the
applicable plans have been reviewed and approved and any other
required permits or approvals with respect to such deferred matters
have been obtained, and that occupancy of the real property shall not
be permitted until such time as the deferred plans are approved and the
approved signage and/or landscaping is installed (subject only to an
approved delay in installing landscaping due to cold and/or inclement
weather, and then only upon entering into a satisfactory development
agreement and providing satisfactory security). The Village Zoning
Administrator shall have authority to decide all applications for any
such deferred plan review, and for approval of any deferred plans,
regardless of whether the Zoning Administrator or the Plan
Commission had authority to decide the application for site and
operational plan approval as originally filed.
H. Incorrect or inaccurate information. The provision of material
information on or in connection with any application for site and
operational plan approval that is incorrect or inaccurate and not timely
corrected shall be grounds for denial of the application, issuance of a
§ 420-55 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-55
344:862
§ 420-56. Administration.
stop-work order, suspension or revocation by the applicable
decisionmaker of any approved site and operational plan which is
significantly affected by such incorrect or inaccurate information if the
problem is not promptly and satisfactorily resolved after written notice
and an opportunity to be heard (e.g., the filing of correct information
showing that the approval was properly granted, or the filing of an
application for amended site and operational plan approval coupled
with a voluntary interim cessation of the activities in question) and/or
the commencement of a legal action seeking an injunction, forfeitures
and/or other appropriate relief. An applicant for any site and
operational plan approval shall have a duty to correct, update and/
or supplement an application containing information that was either
incorrect or inaccurate when filed or that has become incorrect or
inaccurate during the pendency of the application. Any such changes in
an application may delay the processing or decision of such application.
A. Preliminary determination of completeness. The Village Zoning
Administrator shall use reasonable efforts to make a preliminary
determination of completeness with respect to any application for site
and operational plan approval accepted for filing and shall notify the
applicant by first class mail or by fax of such determination, or of any
additional information or materials required to complete the
application, within 10 business days after the filing of the application.
The Zoning Administrator shall use reasonable efforts to make
additional preliminary determinations of completeness and to notify the
applicant by first class mail or by fax, as necessary, within 10 business
days after receiving supplemental information or materials from an
applicant. The Zoning Administrator may deny an application for
incompleteness if the application is not completed within 30 days after
the date of any notice of incomplete application.
B. Staff and/or consultant review. Upon making a preliminary
determination that an application for site and operational plan approval
is complete, the Zoning Administrator shall promptly transmit the
application and accompanying information and materials to appropriate
Village staff members and/or to expert consultants for review,
comment, and recommendation, as the Zoning Administrator
determines is required under the facts and circumstances of the
particular application.
C. Summary approval/disapproval. Notwithstanding Subsection B above,
the Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to approve summarily an
application for site and operational plan approval, without circulating
the application to other Village staff members and/or expert consultants
for review, comment and recommendation, when the application
involves no change or only minor amendments to an approved site and
operational plan and there are no apparent violations of such approved
plan, the conditions of plan approval, or the provisions of any applicable
§ 420-55 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-56
344:863
Village ordinance. Similarly, the Zoning Administrator shall be
authorized to disapprove summarily an application for site and
operational plan approval requiring an amendment of the map or text
of this chapter, if an application for such a zoning ordinance map or text
amendment is not pending and if satisfactory arrangements have not
been made with the Zoning Administrator to process the application for
site and operational plan approval in conjunction with the application
for a zoning ordinance map or text amendment.
D. Zoning Administrator action. Promptly after completion of the Village
staff and/or expert consultant review of an application for site and
operational plan approval, or promptly after the preliminary
determination of completeness if the Village Zoning Administrator
determines that staff and/or consultant review is unnecessary, the
Zoning Administrator shall either notify the applicant by first class mail
or by fax of any additional information or materials required as a result
of the staff and/or consultant review or decide the application, if the
Zoning Administrator has authority to decide it, and notify the applicant
by first class mail or by fax of the decision, including all conditions of
approval and all reasons for denial, or transmit the application and
related staff and/or consultant comments and recommendations to the
Village Plan Commission for decision. The Zoning Administrator shall
make reasonable efforts to take one of these three actions within 30
days after the date of written notification to the applicant of the
preliminary determination of completeness, and other Village staff
members and consultants shall make reasonable efforts to facilitate
timely action by the Village Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning
Administrator notifies the applicant that additional information or
materials are required after the preliminary determination of
completeness, the Zoning Administrator shall make reasonable efforts
to decide the application and notify the applicant of the decision by first
class mail or by fax, or transmit the application and related staff and/or
consultant comments and recommendations to the Plan Commission for
decision, within 10 business days after the filing of all such additional
information or materials, unless further staff and/or consultant review,
comments and recommendations are required with respect to such
additional information. In such event, the Zoning Administrator shall
make reasonable efforts either to decide the application and notify the
applicant of the decision or transmit the application to the Plan
Commission for decision within 15 business days after the filing of all
such additional information or materials.
E. Plan Commission action. The Plan Commission shall make reasonable
efforts to decide an application for site and operational plan approval
within 30 days from the date on which the application and staff and/or
consultant comments and recommendations are transmitted to it for
decision. The Village Zoning Administrator shall make reasonable
efforts to notify the applicant of the Plan Commission's decision by first
class mail or by fax within 10 days after the decision, including all
conditions of approval and all reasons for denial.
§ 420-56 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-56
344:864
F. Decisions. Site and operational plan approval shall be granted if the
application and documents and information submitted in connection
with the application demonstrate that the proposed project or activity
with respect to which the application is filed will comply with all
applicable Village ordinance requirements (including, without
limitation, satisfaction of all applicable conditions precedent
established by provisions of Chapter 395 of the Village Code) and will
comply with all other requirements of applicable federal, state or
county statutes, regulations, ordinances or other laws relating to land
use, buildings, development control, land division, environmental
protection, sewer service, water service, stormwater management,
streets and highways and fire protection. For the purpose of ensuring
compliance with such legal requirements, the Zoning Administrator or
the Plan Commission may reasonably condition approval of a site and
operational plan upon the submission of additional information or
modified plans, the completion of specified public improvements or the
satisfaction of other specified requirements. The Zoning Administrator
or the Plan Commission may impose reasonable time limits for the
completion of specified improvements or the satisfaction of conditions
of approval and may require the applicant to enter into a satisfactory
development agreement with the Village relating to any required public
improvements and to submit an irrevocable letter of credit or other
acceptable security in satisfactory form to insure that public
improvements are completed on schedule and in accordance with
approved plans and specifications. Requirements relating to required
public or private improvements, dedications of interests in land or
dedications of completed public improvements shall be in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter 395, Land Division and Development
Control, of the Village Code relating to such matters and in accordance
with any development agreement entered into by and between the
Village and either the applicant(s) or the owner(s) of the real property
involved in the application. Conditions precedent to any site and
operational plan approval shall include at least the following: that the
information contained in the application is correct and accurate; that
any known violation of this chapter, Chapter 395, Land Division and
Development Control, or other applicable Village ordinances is
corrected; and that all expert consultant fees incurred by the Village in
connection with site and operational plan review are paid in full by the
applicant. The Zoning Administrator and the Plan Commission shall be
authorized to process and to grant an application for site and
operational plan approval with respect to a use requiring a special
Village license and/or a conditional use permit which has not yet been
granted, provided that a complete application for such or conditional
use permit has been duly filed and not withdrawn or denied, and further
provided that a condition precedent to the granting of such site and
operational plan approval shall be the issuance of any required license
and/or the required conditional use permit. (With respect to an
application for site and operational plan approval requiring an
amendment of the text or map of this chapter, see Subsection above.) In
§ 420-56 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-56
344:865
the event of any inconsistency between the requirements of site and
operational plan approval and the requirements of the special license
or conditional use permit when issued, the most stringent or restrictive
requirement shall control. Without limitation, ongoing conditions of any
site and operational plan approval shall include continuing compliance
with the approved plan and satisfaction of any conditions of plan
approval and maintaining the real property in a safe, structurally
sound, neat, well cared for and attractive condition. [Amended
5-7-2007 by Ord. No. 07-21; 5-21-2007 by Ord. No. 07-24]
G. Findings. Neither the Zoning Administrator nor the Plan Commission
shall approve any site and operational plan application without finding
in the decision that the application, coupled with satisfaction of any
conditions of approval, will comply with all applicable Village ordinance
requirements and will comply with all other requirements of applicable
federal, state or local statutes, regulations, ordinances or other laws
relating to land use, buildings, development control, land division,
environmental protection, sewer service, water service, stormwater
management, streets and highways and fire protection.
H. Required signatures on final approval forms. Following approval of the
site and operational plan application, the applicant shall file with the
Community Development Department three complete sets of the final
approved site and operational plan components which have been
modified to comply with all conditions precedent set forth in the
approval and which demonstrate satisfaction of any other conditions
precedent to plan approval. Such plans shall be signed by the owner
and by the developer, user and/or occupant of the real property, as
appropriate, and by the Village Zoning Administrator prior to the filing
of any building permit application or erosion control permit application
for the site or the granting of any building permit or erosion control
permit for the site. The Village Zoning Administrator shall make
reasonable efforts to review any signed site and operational plan filed
by the applicant pursuant to this subsection for satisfaction of all
conditions precedent to approval, and to sign such plan, or notify the
applicant by first class mail or fax of any deficiencies, within 10 days
after filing. Approved preliminary site and operational plans and
approved deferred plans shall be processed in the same manner as set
out above.
I. Effective period. For purposes of the granting of any erosion control
permit, zoning permit and/or building permit, a site and operational
plan approval shall be effective for a period of 180 days from the date of
written notification to the applicant of the decision to approve the
application.
J. Permits. Except as provided in § 420-55F or G above (relating,
respectively, to preliminary site and operational plan approval and to
deferral of signage and/or landscaping plan review and approval), no
erosion control permit, zoning permit or building permit shall be issued
by the Community Development Department until site and operational
§ 420-56 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-56
344:866
plan approval has been granted, and until all conditions precedent
set forth in the approval have been satisfied, and until the final plans
have been fully signed as required by Subsection H above. (Note that
the Chief of the Village Fire & Rescue Department has review and
approval authority with respect to matters relating to fire protection,
independent of the Community Development Department, pursuant to
Chapter 180, Fire and Rescue Protection, of the Village Code.) In
a situation where review of a signage plan and/or landscaping plan
has been deferred pursuant to § 420-55G above, no permit relating to
signage and/or landscaping, respectively, shall be issued until approval
of the deferred plan has been granted, and until all conditions
precedent set forth in such approval have been satisfied, and until the
final plan has been fully signed as required by Subsection H above.
Site and operational plan approval for a use requiring a conditional
use permit shall be processed in conjunction with the conditional use
permit application.
K. Amendments. Any proposed changes to the uses, buildings, structures,
site, operations, occupancy or other matters appearing in an approved
site and operational plan, or to any of the conditions of plan approval,
shall require the approval of an amended site and operational plan.
Applications for amended site and operational plan approval shall be
filed and processed in the same manner as applications for initial site
and operational plan approval. Without limitation, the provisions of
§§ 420-55D and 420-56C above, relating to waiver of application
requirements and to summary approval, respectively, may be applicable
to such applications.
L. Time periods. Any time period provided for in this article, except the
periods specified in Subsections I and M of this section, can be
extended by agreement of the applicant and the Zoning Administrator
or Plan Commission, as appropriate, and memorialized in writing.
Failure of the Village Zoning Administrator, the Village Plan
Commission or any other Village employee or consultant to act within
the time provided by this article shall not result in approval of the
application and shall not constitute a violation of this chapter or give
rise to any cause of action, but the Zoning Administrator and the Plan
Commission shall promptly report to the Village Board any failure to
comply with such time requirements, together with a brief explanation
of the circumstances of such failure, so that the Village Board can take
such actions as may be necessary to ensure timely Village action on
applications for site and operational plan review. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, if the Village Zoning Administrator or the Village
Plan Commission fails to take any action provided for in this section
with respect to an application for site and operational plan approval
relating to an adult-oriented use within the time provided by this
§ 420-56 (or within such time as is extended pursuant to this Subsection
L), the action in question shall be deemed to have been taken in favor of
the applicant, and the basis for such action shall be deemed to be the
application as amended or supplemented at such time.
§ 420-56 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-56
344:867
§ 420-57. Contents of plan components and related standards.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this article, a full and complete
application shall include each of the components described below in this
section. The required minimum contents of each such component, and
certain standards applicable to such components, are set out below.
M. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Village Zoning
Administrator or of the Village Plan Commission relating to site and
operational plan review may appeal the decision to the Village Zoning
Board of Appeals in the manner and within the time provided for such
appeals. Any applicant for site and operational plan approval with
respect to an adult-oriented use who wishes to challenge any decision
of the Village Zoning Administrator or of the Village Plan Commission
on its application pursuant to this article shall not be required to appeal
to the Village Zoning Board of Appeals before commencing an action in
court.
N. Exemptions. This article shall not be applicable to Village public works
projects involving streets, sanitary sewers, water mains, storm sewers,
fiber optic communication facilities, sanitation facilities or related
facilities. However, reasonable efforts as determined by the Zoning
Administrator shall be made by the Village to comply with the site and
pperational plan provisions set forth in this article as it pertains to
Village buildings, or other Village structures or site improvements. This
article shall not be applicable to City of Kenosha public works projects
involving streets, sanitary sewers, water mains, storm sewers or related
facilities, provided that the Village has been notified of the project in
advance and in writing, and further provided that a permit has been
obtained for work in a Village street right-of-way, if applicable, but this
exemption shall not be applicable to city buildings or other city
structures or site improvements. This article shall not be applicable to
county or state projects involving highways, provided that the Village
has been notified in advance of the project in writing. This article shall
not be applicable to utility company projects involving electric power
lines or communications lines designed to serve consumers directly
(e.g., this exception shall not apply to towers, transmission lines,
substations or power plants, etc.), provided that the Village has been
notified of the project in advance and in writing, and further provided
that a permit has been obtained for work in a street right-of-way, if
applicable.

ARTICLE X
Signs, Flags, Festoons and Lights
§ 420-58. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate the use of outdoor signs, flags,
festoons and lights; to provide for signs and related devices which are
functional, attractive and safe and which satisfy the reasonable needs of
owners and users of real property and of the public; to maintain and
enhance the aesthetic environment of the Village; to protect property
values; to promote vehicular and pedestrian safety; and to clarify the rights
and duties of owners and users of nonconforming signs.
§ 420-59. Definitions.
The definitions set out below shall apply to this article and shall control with
respect to signs, flags, festoons and lights, in the event of any inconsistency
between such definitions and the definitions set out in Article XXI of this
chapter. The following definitions are not necessarily intended to be
mutually exclusive, e.g., because signs in this chapter are classified both by
function and by physical characteristics.
ACCESSORY SIGN  A sign that is accessory to a particular principal
use of the property on which the sign is located, as distinguished from
a principal use sign, a principal structure sign or an off-site sign. (Note
that pursuant to § 420-78T of this chapter, nonconforming accessory signs
are not nonconforming uses; that the right to continue an accessory sign
after it becomes nonconforming does not necessarily run with the land;
and that the nonconformity must be cured when such a sign becomes
obsolete, or when such a sign is destroyed or damaged to the extent of more
than 50% of the cost of its replacement, or when the cumulative cost of
structural alterations, modifications or repairs exceeds 50% of the cost of
its replacement.)

single-faced or two-faced back-to-back or angled sign located in an
agricultural zoning district that identifies an agriculture-related business,
other than farming, which is operated on the property where the sign is

symbol or other graphic or pictorial representation on the face of a sign and
any background panel, surface or color which forms the backdrop of the
message or other graphic or pictorial representation or which differentiates
the message or other graphic or pictorial representation from the structure
on or against which the sign mounted, placed or depicted, together with
any related framing, but excluding any differentiated sign base or other
differentiated supporting structure or apparatus of the sign other than such
background panel, surface or color and related framing.
The area of a single face of a three-dimensional sign is the area of
the smallest horizontally and vertically oriented rectangle that fully
encloses the one-dimensional outline of such sign, produced at the
same scale as the sign itself and from the perspective from which the
outer dimensions of such sign are most extensive, exclusive of any
differentiated sign base or other differentiated supporting structure or
apparatus. (Note that pursuant to the definition of "three-dimensional
sign" in this section, any three-dimensional primary monument sign is
deemed to have two sides.)
A.
The area of a wall sign, canopy sign or roof sign consisting only of
words, letters, numerals, characters and/or symbols, with no
differentiated background panel, material or color other than the
surface of the wall, canopy or roof itself, is the area of the smallest
horizontally and vertically oriented rectangle that fully encloses such

reviewed and accepted by the applicant prior to commencement of
the installation, construction or modification of the sign and that
such commencement constitutes acceptance;
(3) That commencement of installation, construction or modification of
the sign constitutes a waiver of any right to appeal the decision or
permit of the Zoning Administrator or any part thereof to the
Village Zoning Board of Appeals or to otherwise challenge such
decision or permit; [Amended 2-2-2009 by Ord. No. 09-01]

location of the sign prior to commencement of the installation or

§ 420-66. Changes in display provided for in sign permit.
A sign permit or sign special exception permit may specify that the message
or other display of the sign may be changed in specified ways, and with
specified frequency, without having to seek a new permit, but specific
limitations shall be imposed on such changes. Such provisions may be
allowed only in situations where this article specifically allows changeable
copy signs, electronic changing message signs or electronic scrolling signs.
With respect to electronic changing message signs, the permit shall state
that a new message shall not appear more frequently than once every three
seconds, and the sign shall not have the appearance of flashing or pulsing.

conditions of any sign permit or sign special exception permit before
commencement of the installation, construction or modification of any sign
pursuant to such permit. Commencement of installation, construction or
modification of any sign pursuant to a permit automatically constitutes
acceptance of the permit and waives any right to appeal or challenge
the permit decision, the permit or any condition thereof. Any permit not
accepted prior to commencement of installation, construction or
modification may be suspended, revoked or voided by the Zoning
Administrator.
§ 420-69. Duration of rights pursuant to permit.

after the permit is revoked or voided, or while it is suspended, no work
requiring such a permit shall be commenced, continued or resumed
until after a new permit is issued or until after the original permit has
been reinstated. A suspension of the permit tolls the remainder of such
twelve-month period. [Amended 7-6-2015 by Ord. No. 15-21]
B. The right to install, construct or modify a sign pursuant to a sign permit
or a sign special exception permit may be extended in writing by the

owner or user of the property, or to a successor of the applicant, upon
written consent of the Zoning Administrator, provided that the rights
pursuant to the permit have not expired or been revoked or voided, that
there are no uncured violations of the permit or of this article associated
with such sign, that no modification of the permitted sign or the permit is
required to prevent the sign from becoming obsolete, and that the assignee
or successor accepts the permit and timely satisfies all conditions of the
permit to the reasonable satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.

rights under the permit have not expired or been revoked or voided.
New or amended sign regulations that have become effective after the
approval of the initial sign permit shall be applied to any application
for an extension, and an extension shall not be granted unless the
original application is amended to conform to such new or amended
sign regulations.
A. Prior to installation or construction of any new freestanding sign that
requires a sign permit or a sign special exception permit, the applicant
shall stake the proposed sign or any modification that changes the
location or dimensions of the sign and any boundaries, buildings or
objects for which sign setbacks have been established which are within
the thirty-five-foot area of concern (or the fifty-foot area of concern with
respect to a freeway sign or the ninety-foot area of concern with respect
to the ordinary high-water mark of any navigable water) pursuant to
§ 420-62C(3) of this chapter and shall request that a staking inspection
be performed by the Village. The applicant shall modify the staking to
comply with the results of such staking inspection prior to commencing
installation, construction or modification of the sign, and the sign shall
be installed or constructed in accordance with the approved staking.
B. Within seven days of the completion of any sign that requires a sign
permit or a sign special exception permit, the applicant shall request
that the Village perform a final inspection to ensure that the sign is in
compliance with the permit and the applicable provisions of this
chapter. If necessary, the applicant shall promptly modify the sign to
comply with the permit and this article. A sign for which such an
inspection request has not been timely made or which has not promptly
been modified to comply fully with the permit and this article is a
violation of this chapter.

special exception permit, that the sign or related work is not in

material respects, the Zoning Administrator may suspend such permit,
notify the applicant or the applicant's designated agent in writing by
first class mail or by fax of the reasons for the suspension and issue a
written stop-work order until the problem or defect is cured to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator. In the event the
applicant refuses or fails to cure the problem or defect within 30 days
following such notice of suspension, and after conferring with the
applicant or the applicant's agent regarding such refusal or failure, the
Zoning Administrator may revoke a sign permit and notify the applicant
in writing by first class mail or by fax of the reasons for the revocation
and any related violations.
B. In the event the Zoning Administrator determines, after the completion
of work done pursuant to any such permit, that the sign or related work

the requirements of this article, or that the information on the basis of
which the permit was approved or issued was inaccurate in material
respects, the Zoning Administrator shall issue and cause to be served a
notice of violation. If such violations are not cured to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator within 30 days following
service of such notice of violation, the Zoning Administrator may, in
addition to all other remedies, void the permit and promptly notify the
owner and user of the property where the sign is located in writing by

on-site information signs located on each property shall be coordinated
for purposes of functionality and aesthetic appeal, and the design and
materials of such signs shall be complementary to the use of the
property, to the design and materials of the buildings and other
structures on the property, and to the other commercial advertising
signs and on-site information signs on the property. This subsection is
not intended to limit the use of any logo or trademark on signs or to
require that the colors appearing in a particular logo or trademark must

E. Waiving cured violations. The curing of an illegal sign or a violation of
the provisions of this article shall not bar the Village from pursuing all
legal remedies with respect to any prior violations, but the Village
Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to waive, in writing, prior
violations provided that a complete cure of such violations has been
effected and that all costs incurred by the Village in connection with
such violations and such cure, including, without limitation, any actual
attorney fees, have been paid in full.
F. Intentional violation. The failure to cure a violation of this article within
30 days of service of a notice of violation shall be deemed to constitute
an intentional violation. The filing during such thirty-day period of a
complete application for a sign permit or a special exception sign
permit required to cure the violation shall extend such period to 60
§ 420-76 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-78
344:938
days after the permit application is approved, provided that the
application is approved and that the permit is issued and that the cure
is completed within such sixty-day period.

cured so as to eliminate any violation of this article. Any illegal sign
shall be subject to removal by the Village, at the cost of the owner, if
such sign is not removed or otherwise cured within 30 days after
service of a notice of violation. The filing during such thirty-day period
of a complete application for a sign permit or a special exception sign
permit required to cure the violation shall extend such period 60 days
after the permit application is approved, provided that the application
is approved and that the permit is issued and that the cure is completed
within such sixty-day period.
I. Effect of sign variance. A previously issued sign variance shall not be
interpreted as immunizing a sign from subsequent amendments of this
article or of any other applicable provisions of this chapter, to the extent
that the effect of such amendments is to make the sign nonconforming.
J. Primary monument sign. Every property improved with a principal
building that is used for any business, manufacturing, institutional or
recreational purpose shall have a primary monument sign. Every
primary monument sign shall include the street address of the property

three inches in height and at least 18 inches above the surface of the
ground. If required, a primary monument sign shall be a condition
precedent to occupancy.
K. Aggregate permitted background commercial advertising sign area.
(1) Except as is otherwise specifically provided in this article, the
aggregate permitted background commercial advertising sign area
allowed on a property used for any business, manufacturing,
institutional, park or recreational or agricultural purpose shall be

(square feet)
Sign Area
(square feet)
0 to 999.9 20
1,000 to 4,999.9 75
5,000 to 9,999.9 150
10,000 to 19,999.9 200
20,000 to 99,999.9 250
§ 420-78 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-78

Building Floor Area
(square feet)
Sign Area
(square feet)
100,000 to 199,999.9 300
200,000 or more 600
(2) Note that not all commercial advertising signs are counted in
determining the aggregate permitted background commercial
advertising sign area, pursuant to the definition of "aggregate
permitted background commercial advertising sign area" in
§ 420-59 of this chapter. In a situation where more than one
principal building is located on the property and the buildings are
not or will not be occupied by the same business or other entity, the
aggregate permitted background commercial advertising sign area
may, at the option of the owner, be applied on a per-building basis.
In a situation where a single building is or will be occupied by more
than one store, business or other entity, each having its own
dedicated entrance, the aggregate permitted background
commercial advertising sign area allowance may, at the option of
the owner, be applied on a per-store or other unit basis, in which
event the allowance shall be based on the interior qualifying floor
area exclusively occupied by each such store or other entity. Once
such option is exercised, it can be reversed only if all of the
background commercial advertising signage on the property is
brought into conformance. No new commercial advertising sign
may be permitted if the property on which the sign is proposed to
be located has more than the aggregate permitted background
commercial advertising sign area.
L. Signs for buildings straddling tax key parcel boundaries without side
setbacks. A special exception sign permit shall be required for the
installation, construction or modification of any commercial advertising
sign (including, without limitation, a modification of the message or
other display) on a property on which is located a shopping center or
shopping mall building, or any other building occupied by multiple
businesses or other entities, which straddles a tax key parcel boundary
without side yard setbacks, unless such tax key parcels are combined
into a single tax key parcel; or the property is zoned for planned
development, and a requirement of the planned development zoning is
coordinated and complementary signs in accordance with Subsection A
of this section; or the property is subject to a covenant running with the
land requiring coordinated and complementary signs in accordance
with Subsection A of this section, which has been approved by and is
enforceable by the Village. A condition of any such special exception
permit shall be that the subject sign shall be and shall continue to be
coordinated and complementary.
M. Materials. All nontemporary signs, and all temporary signs having a
height greater than four feet that are intended to be in place for 120
days or more, shall be constructed of sound, high-strength,
§ 420-78 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-78
344:940
appropriately sized, attractive materials that are resistant to rust,
corrosion, rot or unattractive weathering to ensure safe construction.
N. Wind pressure requirements. All nontemporary signs, and all temporary
freestanding signs having a height greater than four feet, shall be
designed and constructed to withstand wind pressure of not less than
40 pounds per square foot of surface area.
O. Temporary occupancy or obstruction of public space. The temporary
occupancy or obstruction of a sidewalk, public street or highway rightof-
way, or other public property during construction, removal, repair,
alteration, or maintenance of a sign is permitted with written approval
of the Village or other body having jurisdiction, provided that the space
occupied or obstructed is fenced off or otherwise appropriately
isolated, that any required temporary warning signs or devices are
installed and that all other applicable conditions or requirements are
satisfied.
P. Obsolete signs.
(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this article, any
obsolete sign that has been obsolete for more than 30 days is illegal
and a violation of this article.
(2) If an otherwise conforming sign becomes obsolete, it shall be
promptly removed, or the sign display shall be promptly modified to
make it nonobsolete, or the display area of the sign shall be
appropriately blanked in a safe, stable and attractive fashion. Such
a sign that is blanked for more than six months shall be promptly
removed. The Zoning Administrator may extend this six-month
period for up to an additional six months on good cause shown and
upon receipt of a cash deposit or satisfactory letter of credit in an
amount sufficient to pay for the removal of the sign and a written
agreement of the owner authorizing the Village to remove the sign
if it is not modified pursuant to a valid permit during such
additional period to make it nonobsolete and conforming.
(3) If a nonconforming accessory sign becomes obsolete, it shall be
promptly removed or otherwise cured. In curing such a sign, all
nonconformities with or violations of this article shall be
eliminated.
(4) If a nonconforming principal use, principal structure of off-site sign
becomes obsolete, it shall be promptly removed, or the sign display
shall be promptly modified to make it nonobsolete, or the display
area of the sign shall be appropriately blanked in a safe, stable and
attractive fashion. Such a sign that is blanked for more than 12
months shall be promptly removed.
Q. Dilapidated signs.
§ 420-78 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-78
344:941
(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this article, any
dilapidated sign that has been dilapidated for more than 30 days is
illegal and a violation of this article.
(2) Subject to Subsection T of this section relating to nonconformities,
any dilapidated sign shall promptly be restored to nondilapidated
condition.
R. Zoning Administrator. The Village Zoning Administrator shall have the
authority and duty to interpret and apply the provisions of this article in
the first instance.
S. Application to planned development districts. The provisions of this
article shall automatically be incorporated by reference into any zoning
ordinance establishing or amending the regulations applicable to a
planned development zoning district except to the extent that the
Village Board specifically approves in such ordinance other or different
regulations relating to signs.
T. Nonconformities. The following regulations shall apply to and govern
signs which are themselves a valid nonconforming use, or a valid
nonconforming accessory sign, or a sign which relates to a valid
nonconforming use:
(1) A principal use sign, principal structure sign or off-site sign which
is itself a valid nonconforming use shall be allowed to continue
subject to the regulations of § 420-140 of this chapter, relating to
nonconforming uses, and all applicable requirements of this article.
(2) A valid nonconforming accessory sign shall be allowed to continue,
subject to the applicable requirements of this article, until such
sign becomes obsolete or becomes an illegal sign or a violation of
this article for any other reason. At that point, the sign must be
cured and any violation or nonconformity must be eliminated. Such
signs shall not have valid nonconforming use status, and the right
to continue such signs shall not necessarily run with the land.
(3) At such time as the cumulative cost of modifications to a
nonconforming accessory sign exceeds 50% of the cost of replacing
the sign, such sign shall become illegal and shall be removed or
otherwise cured. Any such cure shall eliminate all nonconformities
with or violations of this article.
(4) Any nonconforming accessory sign that is destroyed or damaged to
the extent of 50% of the cost of replacing the sign shall be illegal
and shall be removed or otherwise cured. Any such cure shall
eliminate all nonconformities with or violations of this article.
(5) Any permit issued with respect to a nonconforming accessory sign
shall expressly state that the permit is issued for a nonconforming
accessory sign and that neither the permit nor the work done nor
§ 420-78 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-78
344:942
the expense incurred pursuant to such permit will change the
status of such sign.
(6) Any application for a sign permit for an accessory sign relating to
an allegedly valid nonconforming use shall be treated and
processed as an application for a special exception sign permit.
[Amended 2-2-2009 by Ord. No. 09-01]
(a) The regulations of this article relating to accessory signs that
would be appropriate for the nonconforming use if it were
located in an appropriate zoning district shall be utilized as a
guide in acting upon any such application for an accessory
sign, and the Zoning Administrator shall have authority to
impose conditions which are more stringent than such
regulations if it specifically finds that:
[1] Such conditions are required to avoid a nuisance, to
protect the value of neighboring properties from
significant diminution or otherwise to avoid serious
interference with the rights and reasonable expectations
of owners and users of property within the zoning district
where the nonconforming use exists which would
otherwise result from the proposed sign; and
[2] The imposition of such conditions will not substantially
interfere with the right of the nonconforming use to
continue.
(b) No special exception permit for an accessory sign relating to a
nonconforming use shall be granted unless the Zoning
Administrator specifically finds that:
[1] The use is a valid nonconforming use, regarding which the
owner or applicant has the burden of proof with respect to
all elements of nonconforming use status, by a
preponderance of the evidence (such a finding does not
estop or otherwise bar the Village from making a
subsequent determination that the use is not a valid
nonconforming use, either because of subsequent events
or circumstances or because of new evidence regarding
prior events or circumstances); and
[2] The permit will not allow and is not associated with an
expansion, extension or change in the nature of the
nonconforming use.
(c) Any such special exception sign permit shall be expressly
conditioned upon continuation of the status of the principal use
to which the sign relates as a valid nonconforming use and
shall expressly provide that any rights acquired by virtue of the
permit shall terminate automatically upon the termination of
valid nonconforming use status of such principal use.
§ 420-78 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-78
344:943
U. Indemnification for sign installed, constructed or modified in Village
street right-of-way. Any person who applies for a permit to install,
construct, or modify a sign in the right-of-way of any Village street shall
offer to enter into a written agreement with the Village, satisfactory in
form to the Village Attorney, agreeing to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Village, its officers, agents and employees for, from and
against any and all causes of action, claims or demands of any person
arising out of or relating to such sign or its location in the Village rightof-
way or any work done on or in connection with such sign, and all
related liability or costs (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred
by the Village.
V. Freestanding signs. No freestanding sign may be used for any of the
aggregate permitted background commercial advertising sign area
allowed pursuant to the definition of "aggregate permitted background
commercial advertising sign area" in § 420-59 of this chapter.
W. Standard minimum setback distances. The following standard minimum
setback distances shall apply to all signs:
(1) Five feet from any wetland or floodplain, unless specifically
permitted by the wetland or floodplain provisions of this chapter.
(2) Seventy-five feet from the ordinary high-water mark of any body of
navigable water.
(3) The distance from any side or rear property line equal to the height
of the sign.
X. Reasonable need. Whenever this article provides that signs may be
permitted based upon reasonable need, the following considerations
shall apply, without limitation:
(1) Whether the signs are excessive in terms of number, size or
repetition.
(2) Whether the signs will add substantially to a cluttered sense about
the site.
(3) Whether the signs are addressed to the appropriate audience
under the circumstances.
(4) Whether the signs present information that will be useful and
helpful to the public.
(5) Whether the signs are appropriately located in light of their type,
message and the physical layout of the site.
Y. Wall sign or canopy sign for a particular business or other entity in a
multi-occupant building. A wall sign or canopy sign for a particular
business or other entity that has an obvious storefront area and its own
dedicated entrance in a multi-occupant building shall not extend past
the storefront area of the business or other entity so advertised.
§ 420-78 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-78
344:944
Z. Corner sign. In any situation where the maximum allowable dimensions
of a sign are affected by whether or not it is located adjacent to an
arterial street or highway, and a sign is located at the corner of an
intersection and is essentially equidistant from the two intersecting
streets or highways, and one of the intersecting streets or highways is
arterial and the other is not, the sign shall be deemed to be located
adjacent to an arterial street or highway.
AA. Signs for nonconforming use. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
article relating to the zoning districts in which certain types of signs
may be permitted, it is the intent of this article that a nonconforming
use may generally be permitted to have the same types of signs that it
could have if it were a conforming use, but such signs require a special
exception sign permit and are subject to more stringent regulation
pursuant to Subsection T of this section..
BB. Sign required for unit in unified development. A wall sign or a
temporary banner sign is a condition precedent to occupancy of a store
or other unit in a unified development that is or will be occupied by
more than one business or other entity, if such store or other unit has its
own dedicated entrance, and if the owner has exercised the option to
apply the aggregate permitted background commercial advertising sign
area on a per-store or other unit basis.
CC. Service of notice of violation. Any notice of violation of this article shall
be served on the person or entity occupying the property where the
sign is located in the manner of serving a summons pursuant to
§ 801.11, Wis. Stats., and a copy of such notice shall promptly be mailed
by first class United States mail to the last known address of the owner
of such property and, if the owner or user of the sign is not the owner of
the property, to the last known address of the owner or user of the sign.
If there is no person occupying the property where the sign is located,
or if service cannot be made pursuant to § 801.11, Wis. Stats., with
reasonable effort, the mailed notice(s) shall suffice.

§ 420-119 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-119
344:1060
(including nonconforming uses) may only be conducted pursuant to and
in accordance with such a license.
(1) Without limitation, such uses include the following:
(a) Any restaurant in which alcoholic beverages are served or sold
(some are prohibited in the B-2 District).
(b) Any cabaret.
(c) Any tavern.
(d) Any liquor store.
(e) Any adult-oriented use, including, without limitation, an adult
bookstore, adult cabaret, adult club, adult dry cabaret, adult
movie theater, adult video rental store, adult video store or
adult viewing facility. In this chapter, an adult-oriented use
(e.g., an adult cabaret) is classified and treated as a separate
and distinct use from the closest type of non-adult-oriented use
(e.g., a cabaret).
[1] Adult-oriented uses are allowed in the B-2 District, subject
to the requirements of Article IX and all other applicable
provisions of this chapter and of other Village ordinances
and codes, provided that at the time the application for
site and operational plan approval for the commencement
or expansion of such proposed adult-oriented use is
decided by the Village Plan Commission or Zoning
Administrator: [Amended 3-3-2008 by Ord. No. 08-17]
[a] The physically separate defined area of the building in
which an adult-oriented use is proposed to be
commenced or expanded shall be not less than 300
feet in a direct line from the nearest lot line of any lot
on which any school, church or day-care center for
children is located or has a vested right to locate;
[b] The physically separate defined area of the building in
which an adult-oriented use is proposed to be
commenced or expanded shall be not less than 300
feet in a direct line from any land area zoned
residential (including street and railroad rights-ofway);
and
[c] The physically separate defined area of the building in
which an adult-oriented use is proposed to be
commenced or expanded shall be not less than 300
feet in a direct line from the physically separate
defined area of the building in which any separately
located adult-oriented use is located or has a vested
right to locate.
§ 420-119 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-119
344:1061
[2] In the event that a proposed adult-oriented use involves a
use which would otherwise require a conditional use
permit (e.g., a proposed adult cabaret, involving a cabaret
that would otherwise require a conditional use permit), the
requirement of an adult-oriented use license shall be
substituted for the requirement of a conditional use
permit. In the event that an existing use operating under a
conditional use permit proposes to become an adultoriented
use (e.g., a cabaret for which a conditional use
permit has been granted proposes to become an adult
cabaret), the conditional use permit for the existing use
shall automatically be terminated upon the granting of an
adult-oriented use license by the Village Board, so that the
adult-oriented use will not be subject to conditional use
permit requirements.
(2) The granting of a Village license by the Village Board is not assured
either by permitted use status or by the granting of a conditional
use permit or of any other permit or approval under this chapter.
F. Combination of uses. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in
this section, two or more principal uses and their related accessory uses

(2) Conditional uses allowed in the B-2 District and their related
accessory uses may be located separately or together, and may be
conducted separately or together, with other such conditional uses
and their related accessory uses in the same principal building in
the B-2 District; provided, however, that the area of a building
occupied by a conditional use and any related accessory uses shall
be a physically separate defined area in which any proposed new
use of any kind (or any use of any kind existing as of the time when
the conditional use permit for such conditional use or any
amendment of such permit is approved) shall be allowed only
pursuant to and in accordance with the conditional use permit
issued for such conditional use under Article XVIII of this chapter.
(3) Permitted uses allowed in the B-2 District and their related
accessory uses and conditional uses allowed in the B-2 District and
their related accessory uses may be located separately or together,

344:1062
building in the B-2 District; provided, however, that the area of a
building occupied by a conditional use and any related accessory
uses shall be a physically separate defined area in which any
proposed new use of any kind (or any use of any kind existing as
of the time when the conditional use permit for such conditional
use or any amendment of such permit is approved) shall be allowed
only pursuant to and in accordance with the conditional use permit
issued for such conditional use under Article XVIII of this chapter.
(4) Nonconforming uses existing in the B-2 District as of the effective
date of Ordinance No. 03-24 (June 4, 2003) and any related
accessory uses existing as of such date may be continued in the
same principal building with other uses; provided, however, that no
nonconforming use and no accessory use to a nonconforming use
may be extended or expanded into new areas, and no new
accessory use related to such nonconforming use (and no prior
accessory use to such nonconforming use that has been
discontinued as an actively conducted use for a period of 12 or
more consecutive months) may be commenced or recommenced,
and further provided that the area of a building occupied by a
nonconforming use and any related accessory uses shall be a
physically separate defined area in which any proposed new use of
any kind shall be prohibited.
G. Accessory uses.

uses to principal uses allowed in the B-2 District are allowed,
subject to Article IX and all other applicable provisions of this
chapter and of other Village ordinances and codes, as follows:

are allowed.

months) are prohibited.
(3) In the event of any issue about whether a particular use is properly
an accessory use, the Zoning Administrator shall have authority to
decide. The Zoning Administrator shall make written findings to
support any such decision.

L. Municipal services required. Except as otherwise specifically provided
in this chapter, and without limitation, no proposed new, reconstructed
or relocated principal building shall be permitted in the B-6 District
unless it is connected to the Village's public sewer and water systems,
and any existing principal building not already connected to the
Village's public sewer and water systems shall be so connected before
any proposed addition is made to such building, or before any proposed
change in the use of such building is made from one use category to
another (e.g., residential to business), and before any proposed use is
commenced or recommenced in such a building that has been vacant or
unused for 12 consecutive months or longer.
A. Purpose and characteristics.
(1) The M-1 Limited Manufacturing District is intended to provide for
limited manufacturing, wholesaling, warehousing and related uses
within an enclosed structure wherein no high-hazard uses are
allowed and the method of manufacturing is not injurious to the
point of constituting a nuisance to the occupants of adjacent
properties by reason of the emission or creation of noise, vibration,
smoke, dust or particle matters, toxic or noxious materials, odors,
fire or explosive hazards, glare or heat and located in those areas
where the relationship to surrounding land uses would create few
problems of compatibility. This district also allows for office parks
or individual office buildings and ancillary uses, which may or may
not include space for manufacturing, assemblies, or warehousing,
but provide direct services to the employees or customers or other
uses in the area. It is anticipated that these areas would be
developed in an attractive parklike setting with landscaping,
consistent signage, and similar or compatible building materials
and designed to present an integrated image to customers. No such
district shall be established unless it is in compliance with Village
adopted or amended comprehensive, neighborhood and conceptual
plans.
(2) The uses allowed in the M-1 District are based on the Use and
Occupancy Classification specified in Chapter 3 of the 2006
International Building Code (2006 IBC), as may be amended from
time to time. Where a use is proposed for a purpose that is not
specifically provided in Chapter 3 of the 2006 IBC and is not
specifically listed as a prohibited use in the M-1 District, such use
shall be classified in the group that the occupancy most clearly
resembles, according to the firesafety and relative hazard involved.
The Zoning Administrator shall make the final determination if the
use is allowed within the M-1 District.

A. Purpose and characteristics.
(1) The M-2 General Manufacturing District is intended to provide for
manufacturing, wholesaling, warehousing and related uses within
an enclosed structure in which high-hazard uses are located within
limited areas and the method of manufacturing is not injurious to
the point of constituting a nuisance to the occupants of adjacent
properties by reason of the emission or creation of noise, vibration,
smoke, dust or particle matters, toxic or noxious materials, odors,
fire or explosive hazards, glare or heat and located in those areas
where the relationship to surrounding land uses would create few
problems of compatibility. This district also allows for office parks
or individual office buildings and ancillary uses, which may or may
not include space for manufacturing, assemblies, or warehousing,
but provide direct services to the employees or customers or other
uses in the area. It is anticipated that these areas would be
developed in an attractive parklike setting with landscaping,
consistent signage, and similar or compatible building materials
and designed to present an integrated image to customers. No such
district shall be established unless it is in compliance with Village
adopted or amended comprehensive, neighborhood and conceptual
plans.
(2) The uses allowed in the M-2 District are based on the Use and
Occupancy Classification specified in Chapter 3 of the 2006
International Building Code (2006 IBC), as may be amended from
§ 420-123 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-124

specifically provided in Chapter 3 of the 2006 IBC and is not
specifically listed as a prohibited use in the M-2 District, such use
shall be classified in the group that the occupancy most clearly
resembles, according to the firesafety and relative hazard involved.
The Zoning Administrator shall make the final determination if the
use is allowed within the M-2 District.
B. Permitted uses. The following listed principal uses and certain
unspecified principal uses approved pursuant to Subsection C below

M-2 District and is free of potential problems requiring special
regulation. The Zoning Administrator shall make written findings
supporting any such decision. Any use so approved shall be subject to
all requirements of Subsection B above. Notwithstanding the foregoing
authorization, the following uses shall not be construed to be permitted
uses in the M-2 District:

4-7-2014 by Ord. No. 14-08; 4-17-2017 by Ord. No. 17-12; 7-17-2017
by Ord. No. 17-32; 2-19-2018 by Ord. No. 18-07;5-14-2018 by Ord.
No. 18-19]
A. Purpose and characteristics.
(1) The M-5 Production Manufacturing District is intended to provide
for manufacturing, assembly, office, and research and development
uses with limited warehouse and distribution uses within an
enclosed structure wherein no high hazard uses are allowed and
the method of manufacturing is not injurious to the point of
constituting a nuisance to the occupants of adjacent properties by
reason of the emission or creation of noise, vibration, smoke, dust
or particle matters, toxic or noxious materials, odors, fire or
explosive hazards, glare or heat and located in those areas where
the relationship to surrounding land uses would create few
problems of compatibility. This district also allows for office parks
or individual office buildings and ancillary uses, which may or may
not include space for manufacturing, assemblies, or research and
development but provides direct services to the employees or
customers or other uses in the area. It is anticipated that these
areas would be developed in an attractive corporate parklike
setting with landscaping, consistent signage, and similar or
compatible building materials and designed to present an
integrated image to customers. No such district shall be
established unless it is in compliance with Village adopted or
amended comprehensive, neighborhood and conceptual plans.
(2) Some of the uses allowed in the M-5 District are based on the Use
and Occupancy Classification specified in Chapter 3 of the 2006

time to time. Where a use is proposed for a purpose that is not
specifically provided in Chapter 3 of the 2006 IBC and is not
specifically listed as a prohibited use in the M-5 District, such use
shall be classified in the group that the occupancy most clearly
resembles, according to the firesafety and relative hazard involved.
The Zoning Administrator shall make the final determination if the
use is allowed within the M-5 District.
B. Permitted uses. The following listed principal uses and certain
unspecified principal uses approved pursuant to Subsection C below

A. Primary purpose and characteristics. The C-1 Lowland Resource
Conservancy District is intended to be used to prevent destruction of
valuable natural or man-made resources and to protect watercourses
and wetlands, including the shorelands of navigable waters, and areas
that are not naturally drained, or which are subject to periodic flooding,
where development would result in hazards to health or safety and or
would deplete or destroy natural resources or be otherwise
incompatible with public welfare. Wetlands are unique and valuable
natural resources that are becoming rare in Wisconsin and have many
benefits. Wetlands filter nutrients and sediments out of water, keeping
§ 420-127.2 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-128
344:1166
our lakes and streams clean; wetlands reduce flood damage by storing
runoff from heavy rains or snow melt; wetlands are spawning and
nursery areas for fish such as northern pike; wetlands are home to
waterfowl, songbirds, pheasants, fur-bearers, and a number of rare or
endangered animal and plant species; wetlands buffer adjacent uplands
against wave and current erosion; and wetlands are scenic.
B. Designation of lowland conservancy areas. Lands mapped as wetlands
have soils formed under wet conditions and have water at or near the
surface often enough to be able to support plants adapted to wet
conditions. For the purpose of determining which areas are to be
located in the C-1 Lowland Resource Conservancy District, the Village
Community Development Department has established wetland map
resources which reflect the best data available to the Village. The
district delineation process shall make use of the 2005 Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources Final Wetland Inventory Maps, as
may be amended from time to time, in delineating wetlands. [Amended
10-6-2008 by Ord. No. 08-51]
C. Mapping disputes. Whenever there is a discrepancy between the
Official Zoning Map and actual field conditions, the discrepancy shall be
resolved by the property owner or his/her agent by completing a
wetland staking by a qualified biologist by any manner specified below:
[Amended 3-7-2016 by Ord. No. 16-03]
(1) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WI DNR) assured
biologist. The WI DNR offers a program for wetland consultants to
have WI DNR assess their accuracy in determining wetland
boundaries. Individuals are assured for purposes of State of
Wisconsin permits and state-mandated local programs. By using an
assured biologist, concurrence from WI DNR is not needed and
wetland delineation issues are unlikely to cause delays in state
permit decisions for sites at which these individuals are the lead
field delineator and report author. Using this method allows for
early planning and the permit application process to proceed more
quickly. This approval, however, may not satisfy wetland
requirements for the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (ACOE) for any
required permits necessary from the ACOE. A list of WI DNR
assured biologists can be found on the WI DNR website.
(a) The property owner or his/her agent contracts with a WI DNR
assured biologist to complete a site investigation and wetland
report and stake the location of the wetlands on the property,
referred to as a "wetland staking."
(b) Upon completion of the wetland staking, the following shall be
submitted to the Village:
[1] A letter from WI DNR verifying the biologist is a WI DNR
assured biologist.
§ 420-128 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-128
344:1167
[2] A wetland report prepared by the biologist.
[3] A plat of survey prepared by a Wisconsin registered
surveyor that includes, at a minimum, the property
boundaries and location of any structures on the property;
location and legal description of the field-delineated
wetlands; a note indicating the name of the biologist that
completed the wetland staking and the date(s) the
wetlands were staked; clear notations as to which areas
are wetlands and which areas are uplands; and the square
footage or acreage of each.
[4] A complete application and application fee to amend the
Village Comprehensive Land Use Map and the Village
Zoning Map pursuant to Village requirements for said
amendments.
(2) Non-WI DNR assured biologist. The property owner or his/her
agent contracts with a qualified biologist to complete a site
investigation and wetland report and stake the location of the
wetlands on the property, referred to as a "wetland staking." Upon
completion of the wetland staking and written approval from the
WI DNR, the following shall be submitted to the Village:
(a) A letter from WI DNR approving the wetland staking.
(b) A wetland report prepared by the biologist.
(c) A plat of survey prepared by a Wisconsin registered surveyor
that includes, at a minimum, the property boundaries and
location of any structures on the property; location and legal
description of the field-delineated wetlands; a note indicating
the name of the biologist that completed the wetland staking
and the date(s) the wetlands were staked; clear notations as to
which areas are wetlands and which areas are uplands; and the
square footage or acreage of each.
(d) A complete application and application fee to amend the
Village Comprehensive Land Use Map and the Village Zoning
Map pursuant to Village requirements for said amendments.
(3) Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Plan Commission (SEWRPC) staff
biologist. The Village will, upon receipt of a complete application,
coordinate with the staff biologist from the SEWRPC, based on
their availability, a site investigation and wetland report and stake
the location of the wetlands on the property, referred to as a
"wetland staking." The following procedure will be used:
(a) The property owner or his/her agent shall submit a completed
wetland staking application form to the Community
Development Department. In addition, the property owner/
§ 420-128 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-128
344:1168
agent shall submit an application fee pursuant to Article V of
this chapter.
(b) The property owner or his/her agent shall have the property
boundaries clearly delineated and staked on the site by a
Wisconsin registered land surveyor so that the field biologist
can clearly identify the site boundaries.
(c) Upon receipt of the completed application, the Community
Development Department staff shall forward a written request
letter to SEWRPC to schedule the services of its field biologist.
(d) A representative from SEWRPC will contact the Village staff
with the date and time of the field staking appointment. The
staking appointment may be scheduled more than 90 days
after the receipt of a completed application by the Village. The
Community Development Department or SEWRPC will notify
the owner or his/her agent of the appointment date and
approximate time so that the owner/agent can notify the
Wisconsin registered land surveyor.
(e) The SEWRPC field biologist will field-stake the wetlands by
flagging the limits of the wetlands on the subject property.
(f) The property owner/agent shall contact his/her Wisconsin
registered land surveyor to prepare a plat of survey of the
wetlands within five days from the date of the biologist's field
staking. The owner/agent shall submit the plat of survey to the
Community Development Department within 30 days from the
date of the biologist's staking.
(g) The plat of survey, as certified by a Wisconsin registered land
surveyor, shall include, at a minimum, the following
information: the property boundaries and all structures on the
property; the location of the wetlands as staked in the field by
the biologist, including a legal description of the wetland
area(s); a notation of the date when the wetlands were fieldstaked
and which agency, that is, "Wetland boundary as
marked by (agency) SEWRPC on (date) August 5, 1996"; clear
notations as to which areas are wetlands and which areas are
uplands; and the square footage or acreage of each.
(h) If the plat of survey is not completed and received by the
Community Development Department within the required 30
days from the date of the field staking, the Village will, after
providing notice, have the plat of survey completed, and all
associated costs will be invoiced to the property owner
pursuant to application requirements (pre-development
agreement) specified in Article V of this chapter.
§ 420-128 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-128
344:1169
(i) Upon receipt of the plat of survey, the Village will forward a
copy of the plat of survey to the SEWRPC for final review and
approval.
(j) Within 30 days of receipt of the final written approval from
SEWRPC, the Village will initiate an application to amend the
Village Comprehensive Land Use Map and the Village Zoning
Map pursuant to Village requirements for said amendments.
All associated costs will be invoiced to the property owner
pursuant to application requirements (pre-development
agreement) specified in Article V of this chapter.

§ 420-130. C-3 Natural and Scientific Area Resource Conservancy
District.
A. Primary purpose and characteristics. The C-3 Natural and Scientific
Area Resource Conservancy District is intended to preserve and
enhance existing natural features, including scenic, historic, and
scientific areas and associated plant and animal communities, and to
prevent the destruction of valuable natural, scenic and scientific
resources, including wetlands, shorelands or navigable waters,
prairies, meadows, sand dunes, woodlands, wildlife habitat and areas
with high erosion hazard. Incompatible development in these areas may
result in hazards to the public health and safety, may deplete or destroy
invaluable and irreplaceable natural resources, or may be otherwise
detrimental to public welfare.
B. Designation of the natural and scientific area resource conservancy
areas.
(1) Lands mapped as natural and scientific areas include those lands
identified in a continuous open space preservation consisting of
continuous environmental corridor, including valuable natural,
scenic and scientific resources of special scientific interest, wildlife
habitat areas, and critical plant habitat areas where several
Wisconsin rare, threatened or endangered plant species are
identified, wetlands, prairies, meadows, sand dunes, woodlands
and areas subject to flooding and high erosion hazards.
(2) For the purpose of determining which areas are to be located in the
C-3 Natural and Scientific Area Resource Conservancy District, the
Village Community Development Department has conservancy
areas mapped as natural and scientific resources as a result of the
planning and study efforts encompassed in the Southeastern
Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission's Community Assistance
Planning Report, titled "A Land Use Management Plan for the
Chiwaukee Prairie - Carol Beach Area of the Town of Pleasant
Prairie." The resulting Land Use Management Plan provides a
technically sound, long-term guide to natural resource base
protection and preservation. The Land Use Management Plan
seeks to preserve a substantial portion of the existing natural
features of the area through the maintenance of a continuous
environmental corridor connecting the Kenosha Sand Dunes on the
north end and the area with the Chiwaukee Prairie Preserve on the
south end. The Land Use Management Plan identifies the lands
within the corridor to be acquired and maintained as a natural
area/wildlife area by a combination of state and private
conservancy interests. The Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources and the Nature Conservancy of Wisconsin have
identified land acquisition areas for permanent resource
protection.
§ 420-130 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-130

Assistance Planning Report No. 88 prepared by SEWRPC entitled "A
Land Use Management Plan for the Chiwaukee Prairie - Carol Beach
Area of the Town of Pleasant Prairie," the Village shall initiate the
process to rezone the property into the C-3 Natural and Scientific
Resource Conservancy District. [Amended 3-7-2016 by Ord. No.
16-04]

173. Editor's Note: This ordinance was included with the codification 4-18-2005 by Ord. No.
05-13.
§ 420-130 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1180
regulations set out in this section are hereby adopted, pursuant to the
authorization and mandate of §§ 61.35, 62.23 and 87.30, Wis. Stats.
B. Finding of fact. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains,
rivers and streams of the Village of Pleasant Prairie would adversely
affect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and
impair the tax base of the Village.
C. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate land use,
development and development-related activities in flood hazard areas
in order to:
(1) Protect life, health and property;
(2) Minimize expenditures of public moneys for costly flood-control
projects;
(3) Minimize rescue and relief efforts which are generally undertaken
at the expense of the taxpaying public;
(4) Minimize business interruptions which usually result in the loss of
local incomes;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities, such as water mains, sewer
lines, streets and bridges, which are located within floodplain
areas;
(6) Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas;
(7) Discourage the victimization of unwary land and home buyers;
(8) Prevent increases in regional flood heights that could increase
flood damage and result in conflicts or litigation between property
owners; and
(9) Prohibit development in the floodplain that is not expressly allowed
as a conditional use pursuant to this section.
D. Title. This section shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance
of the Village of Pleasant Prairie."
E. Areas regulated. Areas regulated by this section include all areas within
the limits of the Village of Pleasant Prairie (Village) that would be
covered by water in the event of a regional flood or base flood as shown
the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
or other maps approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources (DNR), FEMA, and described in Subsection I below or that
would become a floodplain island surrounded by water in the event of a
regional flood. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from
other studies as referenced in this section. If more than one map or
revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
F. Establishment of FPO District. The FPO Floodplain Overlay District
established by this section consists of the floodplain or A Zone (as
§ 420-131 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-131
344:1181
defined in Subsection CC below) and includes both the floodway and
the flood-fringe (as defined in Subsection CC below). The floodplain or
A Zone may contain lands within the A, AE, AH and AO Zones on the
Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
G. Annexed areas. This section shall automatically apply to any floodplain
area within land annexed by the Village from and after the time the
annexation takes effect. The Kenosha County floodplain zoning
provisions and mapping in effect with respect to any annexed land at
the time the annexation takes effect shall remain in effect and be
enforced by the Village to the extent provided by law, and in any event
the county floodplain mapping shall remain effective until such time as
a Village floodplain map amendment takes effect. The ordinance
amendment shall meet the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm.
Code, and 44CRF59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
H. Relationship of FPO regulations to regulations imposed by underlying
basic zoning ordinance and other Village ordinances. Any land use,
development or development-related activity within the Floodplain
Overlay District shall satisfy all requirements imposed by this chapter
(including, without limitation, general requirements, requirements
relating to specific conditional uses, and requirements relating to basic
underlying zoning districts) and all requirements imposed by all other
applicable Village ordinances, as well as all requirements imposed by
this section with respect to floodplain areas. In the event of any conflict
between any such requirements, the most restrictive shall be
controlling.
I. Official floodplain maps and studies.
(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsections O, R and S below, the
boundaries of the floodplain areas, including both the floodway and
the flood-fringe areas, and the boundaries of the floodway areas (all
as defined in Subsection CC below), and the water surface
elevations of the regional flood profile, are as designated on the
official floodplain maps or as stated in or determinable from other
official DNR- and FEMA-approved technical studies, listed below,
which are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference. These
official floodplain maps and studies are on file in the office of the
Village of Pleasant Prairie Zoning Administrator. In the event of a
conflict between any of the maps or studies referred to in this
Subsection I, the most restrictive information shall apply.

must be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR.
(c) In A Zones, increases equal to or greater than 1.0 foot may only
be permitted if the applicant receives a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision from FEMA and amendments are made to this
section, the official floodplain maps, floodway lines, and water
surface profiles, in accordance with Subsection T.
J. General standards applicable to all floodplain districts.
(1) Village review.
(a) The Village shall review all permit applications to determine
whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all
new construction and substantial improvements shall be
designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
§ 420-131 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1184
hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant
materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and to
ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/
or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the equipment during conditions of
flooding.
(b) Land divisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above
standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured
home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and
floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision
definition of this section and all other requirements in
Subsection M(2)(c). Adequate drainage shall be provided to
reduce exposure to flood hazards, and all public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, are
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damages.
(2) Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses.
(a) No land use, development or development-related activity,
except as provided below, shall be permitted in floodplain
areas which will:
[1] Cause any obstruction to flow, defined as development
which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or
with other development causing any increase in the
regional flood height; or
[2] Cause an increase in regional flood height due to
floodplain storage area lost.
(b) Any proposed land use, development or development-related
activity which will obstruct flow or result in an increase in the
regional flood height may be permitted only if appropriate
amendments are made to the applicable official floodplain
map(s), including floodplain and/or floodway boundary lines
and water surface profiles of the regional flood, as applicable,
in accordance with Subsection T below.
(c) The Village Zoning Administrator and other appropriate
Village officials and bodies shall deny any application for an
administrative permit or approval when it is determined that
the proposed land use, development or development-related
activity will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the
upstream or downstream regional flood height, based on the
available data, or when the applicant fails to satisfy the
applicant's burden of proof relating to such issues.
K. Floodplain issues and discrepancies.
§ 420-131 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-131
344:1185
(1) Whenever an issue relating to floodplain-related matters arises, it
shall be administratively determined in the first instance by the
Village Zoning Administrator.
(2) Where an apparent discrepancy exists between the location of the
floodplain boundary [as shown on the applicable official floodplain
map(s)] and actual field conditions, the location of such boundary
shall be initially determined by the Village Zoning Administrator or
other appropriate Village officials or bodies, depending upon the
nature of the permit, approval or issue involved, using the following
criteria:
(a) Where flood profiles of the regional flood exist, the location of
the floodplain boundary line shall be determined using both the
scale and contours appearing on the official floodplain map (or
on a more accurate topographic map if available) and the
water surface elevations shown on the flood profile of the
regional flood. Where a discrepancy exists between the official
floodplain map and actual field conditions, the regional flood
elevations shall govern.
(b) Where the base flood elevation has been determined pursuant
to the official floodplain map (Zone A of the FIRM) or any
designated navigable waterway where a floodplain study has
not been completed, a detailed study to determine the base
flood elevation shall be completed and approved by the DNR
and FEMA and this section shall be amended.
(c) Where flood profiles of the regional flood do not exist, the
location of the floodplain boundary line shall be determined
using the scale and contours appearing on the official
floodplain map (or on a more accurate topographic map if
available) and any other credible information which is
available.
(3) A floodplain map amendment is required whenever an
administrative determination is made that a significant discrepancy
exists between the official floodplain map and actual field
conditions. The Village Zoning Administrator shall be responsible
for initiating any such map amendments within a reasonable period
of time.
(4) Notwithstanding any language in any Village ordinance apparently
to the contrary, the Village Zoning Administrator and other Village
officials and bodies, as appropriate to the type of permit or
approval in question, shall have the authority to deny or condition a
building, zoning or land disturbance permit, or a land division
approval, or any other land use or development-related permit or
approval, to ensure compliance with this section. Such permits or
approvals may be denied or conditioned upon the basis of an
administrative determination, such as the location of a floodplain
§ 420-131 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1186
boundary or the location of a floodway boundary, whether or not an
amendment of the official floodplain map is required.
(5) Disputes regarding the administrative determination of the
location of a floodplain boundary line or other administrative
floodplain-related determinations, decisions or orders made under
this section shall be resolved in the first instance by an appeal to
the Village Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with Subsection
R below.
L. Burden of proof. In the event of any issue regarding the location of the
boundary of any floodplain or floodway, or whether any proposed or
existing land use or development or development-related activity is
subject to this section, or whether or the extent to which a proposed
land use or development will obstruct flow or raise the height of the
regional flood elevation, or the flow rate to which a proposed land use
or development will be subjected, or whether the flood-carrying
capacity of a watercourse will be maintained, or any other issue arising
under or in connection with this section, the applicant, or the owner,
developer or user who is the proponent of the land use or development
or development-related activity in question, shall have the burden of
proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, demonstrating that the land
use or development or development-related activity in question is in
compliance with and satisfies all applicable provisions of this section.

Q. Nonconforming uses.
(1) General.
(a) Applicability. These regulations apply to the modification of, or
addition to, any structure, and to the use of any structure or
premises, which was lawful before the passage of this section
or any amendment thereto, including, without limitation, any
text amendment or any amendment to the official floodplain
map or to the regional flood profiles.
(2) The existing lawful use of a structure or building which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this section may continue subject
to the following conditions:
(a) No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or
nonconforming structure shall be permitted unless they are
made in conformity with the provisions of this section for the
area of the floodplain occupied and the other applicable
provisions of this chapter. The words "modification" and
"addition" include, but are not limited to, any alteration,
addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or
replacement of any such existing use or structure or accessory
structure or use. Maintenance is not considered a modification.
Maintenance activities include such items as internal and
external painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of
doors, windows and other nonstructural components and the
maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage
or water supply systems or connections to public utilities. Any
costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure are not
considered maintenance.
(b) If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure
is discontinued for 12 consecutive months it is no longer
permitted, and any future use of the property, and of any
structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable
requirements of this section.
(c) As requests are received by the Village for modifications or
additions to nonconforming uses or nonconforming structures,
§ 420-131 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1200
a record shall be kept which lists the nonconforming uses and
nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed
value, the cost of those additions or modifications which have
been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total
current value such additions or modifications represent.
(d) No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or
any structure with a nonconforming use which, over the life of
the structure, would equal or exceeds 50% of its present
equalized assessed value shall be allowed unless the entire
structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure
with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this section. Contiguous dry land access must
be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance
with Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code. The costs of elevating the
lowest floor of a nonconforming building or a building with a
nonconforming use to the flood-protection elevation are
excluded from the fifty-percent provisions of this subsection.
(e) If any nonconforming structure or any structure with a
nonconforming use is destroyed or is so badly damaged that it
cannot be practically restored, it cannot be replaced,
reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure
satisfy the requirements of this section. For the purpose of this
subsection, restoration is deemed impractical where the total
cost of such restoration would equal or exceeds 50% of the
present equalized assessed value of the structure. For
nonconforming buildings that are substantially damaged or
destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction
of any such nonconforming building shall be permitted in order
to restore it, to the size and use in effect prior to the damage
event, provided that the minimum federal code requirements
below are met and all required permits have been granted
prior to the start of construction.
[1] Residential structures.
[a] Shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the base flood elevation using fill,
pilings, columns, posts or perimeter walls. Perimeter
walls must meet the requirements of Subsection S(2).

[ii] Two feet above the highest adjacent grade around
the structure; or
[iii] The depth as shown on the FIRM.
[f] In AO Zones, shall have adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters
around and away from the structure.
[2] Nonresidential structures.
[a] Shall meet the requirements of Subsection Q(2)(e).
[b] Shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the regional flood elevation, or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
shall meet the standards in Subsection S(1) and (2).
[c] In AO Zones with no elevations specified, shall have
the lowest floor, including basement, meet one of the
following conditions below, whichever is higher:

[ii] Two feet above the highest adjacent grade around
the structure; or
[iii] The depth as shown on the FIRM.
(f) A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure, the alteration will comply
with § 420-131J, M, N and O; flood-resistant materials are
used; and construction practices and floodproofing methods
that comply with § 420-131S are used. Repair or rehabilitation
of historic structures shall be exempt from the development
standards of Subsection Q(2)(e)[1] if it is determined that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure and
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
§ 420-131 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1202
(g) No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or
any structure with a nonconforming use, the cost of which
would equal or exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed
value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is
permanently changed to a conforming structure with a
conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this section. Contiguous dry land access shall
be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance
with Subsection S(4).
(h) If, on a per-event basis, the total value of the work being done
under Subsection Q(2)(d) and (g) equals or exceeds 50% of the
present equalized assessed value, the work shall be permitted
unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a
conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance
with the applicable requirements of this section. Contiguous
dry land access shall be provided for residential and
commercial uses in compliance with Subsection S(4).
(3) Floodway areas.
(a) Modification or addition.
[1] No modification or addition shall be allowed to any
nonconforming structure or any structure with a
nonconforming use in a floodway area unless such
modification or addition:
[a] Has been granted a permit or variance which satisfies
the requirements of this section;
[b] Satisfies the requirements of Subsection Q(1) above;
and
[c] Shall not increase the obstruction to flood flows or
increase the regional flood height.
[2] An addition to the existing structure shall be floodproofed,
pursuant to Subsection S, by means other than the use of
fill, to the flood-protection elevation.
[3] If any part of the foundation below the flood-protection
elevation is enclosed, the following standards shall apply:
[a] The enclosed area shall be designed by a registered
and licensed architect or an engineer to allow for the
efficient entry and exit of floodwaters without human
intervention. A minimum of two openings must be
provided with a minimum net area of at least one
square inch for every one square foot of the enclosed
area. The lowest part of the opening can be no more
than 12 inches above the adjacent grade;
§ 420-131 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-131
344:1203
[b] The parts of the foundation located below the floodprotection
elevation must be constructed of floodresistant
materials;
[c] Mechanical and utility equipment must be elevated or
floodproofed to or above the flood-protection
elevation; and
[4] The use must be limited to parking, building access or
limited storage.
(b) No new private sewage disposal system, or addition to an
existing private sewage disposal system, except where an
addition has been ordered by a government agency to correct a
hazard to public health, shall be allowed in a floodway area.
Any replacement, repair or maintenance of an existing private
sewage disposal system in a floodway area shall satisfy the
applicable requirements of all applicable Village or other local
ordinances and Ch. SPS 383, Wis. Adm. Code.
(c) No new well or modification to an existing well used to obtain
water for ultimate human consumption shall be allowed in a
floodway area. Any replacement, repair or maintenance of an
existing well in a floodway area shall satisfy the applicable
requirements of all applicable Village or other local ordinances
and Chs. NR 811 and NR 812, Wis. Adm. Code.
(4) Flood-fringe areas.
(a) No modification or addition shall be allowed to any
nonconforming structure or any structure with a
nonconforming use unless such modification or addition has
been granted a permit or variance by the Village. In addition,
the modification or addition shall be placed on fill or
floodproofed to the flood-protection elevation in compliance
with the standards in Subsection S, except where Subsection
Q(4)(b) below is applicable.
(b) Where compliance with the provisions of Subsection Q(4)(a)
above would result in unnecessary hardship, and only where
the structure will not be used for human habitation or be
associated with a high flood damage potential, the Zoning
Board of Appeals, using the procedures established in
Subsection R, may grant a variance from those provisions for
modifications or additions, using the criteria listed below.
Modifications or additions which are protected to elevations
lower than the flood-protection elevation may be permitted,
provided that:
[1] No floor (excluding the basement or crawlway) is allowed
below the regional flood elevation for residential or
commercial structures;
§ 420-131 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1204
[2] Human lives are not endangered;
[3] Public facilities, such as water or sewer, shall not be
installed;
[4] Flood depths shall not exceed two feet;
[5] Flood velocities shall not exceed two feet per second; and
[6] The structure shall not be used for storage of materials
described in Subsection P(2) above.
(c) All new private sewage disposal systems, or addition to,
replacement, repair or maintenance of a private sewage
disposal system, shall meet all the applicable provisions of all
local ordinances and Ch. SPS 383, Wis. Adm. Code.
(d) All new wells, or addition to, replacement, repair or
maintenance of a well, shall meet the applicable provisions of
this section and Chs. NR 811 and NR 812, Wis. Adm. Code.
(5) It is the intent of this section that in the event a building permit is
validly granted or issued on the basis of the best currently available
information relating to the floodplain, floodway or regional flood
profiles but a subsequently conducted floodplain study
demonstrates that such information was not accurate and that the
permit would not be granted or issued in light of the newer
information, such permit shall not be deemed to have been granted
or issued in error so as to prevent the vesting of rights based upon
reasonable detrimental reliance on such permit or approval. In the
event of reasonable detrimental reliance upon a Village building
permit under these circumstances, the status of the land use,
development or development-related activity in question shall be
that of a valid nonconforming use or valid nonconforming
structure, provided that the requirements for such status, in
addition to being lawful in its inception, are satisfied.
R. Zoning Board of Appeals.
(1) The Village Zoning Board of Appeals, created under § 62.23(7)(e),
Wis. Stats., is hereby authorized to hear and decide, pursuant to
the specific requirements of this section and in accordance with the
procedures and requirements specified in Article V of Chapter 18 of
the Village Municipal Code:
(a) Appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by an
administrative official or body in the enforcement or
administration of this section;

boundaries; and
§ 420-131 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-131
344:1205
(c) Variances from the dimensional standards of this section.
(2) Boundary disputes. The following procedure shall be used by the
Zoning Board of Appeals in hearing disputes concerning the
location of floodplain or floodway boundaries:
(a) Whether a floodplain boundary is established by approximate
or detailed floodplain studies, the regional flood elevations or
profiles for the location in question shall be the governing
factor in locating the floodplain boundary. If no regional flood
elevations or profiles are available to the Board, other available
evidence may be examined.
(b) The person contesting the location of the floodplain or
floodway boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
present arguments and technical evidence to the Zoning Board
of Appeals.
(c) If the boundary is incorrectly mapped, the Zoning Board of
Appeals should inform the person contesting the boundary
location to petition the Village for a map amendment according
to Subsection T.
(3) Variance.
(a) The Zoning Board of Appeals may, upon appeal, grant a
variance from the dimensional standards of this section where
an applicant convincingly demonstrates that:
[1] Literal enforcement of the provisions of this section will
result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship to the
applicant;
[2] The hardship is due to adoption of this section and to
special conditions unique to the property and not common
to a group of adjacent lots or premises (in such case, the
section or map must be amended);
[3] Such variance is not contrary to the public interest; and
[4] Such variance is consistent with the purpose of this
section.
(b) In addition to the criteria specified above, to qualify for a
variance under FEMA regulations, the following criteria must
be met:
[1] The variance shall not cause any increase in the regional
flood elevation;
[2] Variances can only be granted for lots that are less than 1/
2 acre and are contiguous to existing structures
constructed below the regional flood elevation; and
§ 420-131 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1206
[3] Variances shall only be granted upon a showing of good
and sufficient cause, shall be the minimum relief
necessary, shall not cause increased risks to public safety
or nuisances, shall not increase costs for rescue and relief
efforts and shall not be contrary to the purpose of the
ordinance.
(c) A variance shall not:
[1] Grant, extend or increase any land use or development
prohibited in the floodplain (or in the floodway, if
applicable).
[2] Be granted for a hardship based solely on an economic
gain or loss.
[3] Be granted for a hardship which is self-created.
[4] Damage the rights or property values of other persons in
the area.
[5] Permit a lower degree of flood protection in the floodplain
than the flood-protection elevation.
[6] Allow any floor of a basement or crawl space below the
regional flood elevation for residential, commercial or
industrial structures.
[7] Allow any land use or development which requires an
amendment to this section, the official floodplain maps or
the regional flood profiles.
[8] Allow any alteration of an historic structure, including its
use, which would preclude its continued designation as an
historic structure.
(d) When a variance is granted in a floodplain area, the Board shall
notify the applicant in writing that increased flood insurance
premiums and risks to life and property may result. A copy of
this notification shall be maintained with the variance appeal
record.
(4) Appeals. Appeals to the Zoning Board of Appeals may be taken by
any person aggrieved, or by any officer or department of the Village
affected by any decision of the Zoning Administrator or other
administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days
unless otherwise provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with
the official whose decision is in question, and with the Board, a
notice of appeal specifying the reasons for the appeal. The official
whose decision is in question shall transmit to the Board all records
regarding the matter appealed.
§ 420-131 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-131
344:1207
(a) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review all data related to
the appeal. This may include:
[1] Permit application data listed in Subsection L;
[2] Floodway/flood-fringe discrepancy, Subsection K;
[3] Data listed in Subsection M where the applicant has not
submitted this information to the Zoning Administrator;
and
[4] Other data submitted with the application or submitted to
the Board with the appeal.
(b) For appeals of all denied permits, the Board shall:
[1] Follow the procedures of Subsection R;
[2] Consider the recommendations of the Zoning
Administrator, or his/her designee or other appropriate
Village officials or bodies, depending upon the nature of
the permit; and
[3] Either uphold the denial or grant the appeal.
(c) For appeals concerning increases in regional flood elevation,
the Board shall:
[1] Uphold the denial where the Board agrees with the data
showing an increase in flood elevation. Increases equal to
or greater than 0.01 foot may only be allowed after
amending the flood profile and map and all appropriate
legal arrangements are made with all adversely affected
property owners as per the requirements of Subsections I
and T; and
[2] Grant the appeal where the Board agrees that the data
properly demonstrates that the project does not cause an
increase, provided that no other reasons for denial exist.
S. Floodproofing for nonconforming structures.
(1) No conditional use permit or variance shall be granted or issued for
a nonresidential structure designed to be watertight below the
regional flood elevation until the applicant submits a plan or
document certified by a Wisconsin licensed and registered
professional engineer or architect that any required floodproofing
measures are adequately designed to protect the structure or
development to the flood-protection elevation and submits a FEMA
floodproofing certificate.
(2) For a structure designed to allow the entry of floodwaters, no
permit or variance shall be issued until the applicant submits a plan
that is certified by a Wisconsin licensed and registered professional
§ 420-131 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1208
engineer or architect that the design meets or exceeds the
following standards:
(a) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
(b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
(c) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(3) Floodproofing measures shall be designed, as appropriate, to:
(a) Withstand the flood pressures, depths, velocities, uplift and
impact forces, and other factors associated with the regional
flood.
(b) Assure protection to the flood-protection elevation.
(c) Provide anchorage of structures to foundations to resist
flotation and lateral movement.
(d) Ensure that the structural walls and floors are watertight to
the flood-protection elevation and the interior remains
completely dry during flooding, without human intervention.
(e) Minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters.
(4) Floodproofing measures may include, without limitation, the
following:
(a) Reinforcement of walls and floors to resist rupture or collapse
caused by water pressure or floating debris.
(b) Addition of mass or weight to structures to prevent flotation.
(c) Placement of essential utilities above the flood-protection
elevation.
(d) Surface or subsurface drainage systems, including pumping
facilities, to relieve external foundation wall and basement
floor pressures.
(e) Construction of water supply wells and waste treatment
systems to prevent the entrance of floodwaters into the
systems.
(f) Cutoff valves on sewer mains or elimination of gravity flow
basement drains.
§ 420-131 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-131
344:1209
(5) Dry land access. All residential or commercial uses or any habitable
structure shall provide dry land access from the public road to said
structure.
T. Removal of lands from floodplain; amendments. Compliance with the
provisions of this section shall not be grounds for removing lands from
the floodplain, unless they are removed by filling to a height of at least
two feet above the regional flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land
lying outside the floodplain, the official floodplain map is amended, and
FEMA revises the Flood Insurance Rate Map or issues a letter of map
amendment or revision.
(1) Official floodplain map amendments are required for any changes
in the official regional floodwater surface profiles or the delineation
of the floodplain or floodway. Examples of actions requiring
floodplain map amendments are listed below:
(a) Any change to the boundary of the floodplain and/or
watercourse alterations on the FIRM;
(b) Correction of discrepancies between the water surface profiles
of the regional flood and the official floodplain maps;
(c) Any fill in the floodplain which raises the elevation of the filled
area to a height at or above the flood-protection elevation and
is contiguous to land lying outside the floodplain;
(d) Any fill, deposition of materials, storage of materials or
encroachment into the floodplain that will obstruct flow or
causing any increase in the regional flood height;
(e) Any upgrading of this section; or
(f) Any correction to an existing mapped floodplain.
(g) All channel relocations and changes to the official floodplain
maps to alter floodway lines or to remove an area from the
floodplain that is based on a base flood elevation from a FIRM
requires prior approval by FEMA.
(2) Criteria for amending the floodplain boundary. The Village shall not
permit amendments to the floodplain boundary that are
inconsistent with the purposes of this section or in conflict with the
applicable rules of the DNR and FEMA. In addition:
(a) Amendments to the floodplain boundaries shall not be
permitted where the change will increase the regional flood
stage elevation unless the applicant has made appropriate
legal arrangements with the Village, any other affected
governmental units, and any other property owners affected by
the flood stage increase.
(b) The floodplain boundary shall not be amended without first:
§ 420-131 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-131
344:1210
[1] Providing the Village with updated engineering data and
computations necessary to correctly determine the
floodplain boundary and submitting detailed engineering
plans for redelineating the floodplain boundary;
[2] Amending this section;
[3] Obtaining approval from the DNR; and
[4] Obtaining approval from FEMA in the form of a letter of
map change approved by FEMA.
(c) Petitions for the floodplain amendments shall provide adjusted
water surface profiles and adjusted floodplain limits to reflect
the increased flood elevations.
(d) Any area removed from the floodplain shall be contiguous to
land lying outside the floodplain.
(e) Whenever any volume of flood storage capacity is removed
from the floodplain, as defined by the ground surface and the
regional flood elevation, an equal volume of flood storage
capacity shall be created within the existing or newly created
floodplain boundary, in the vicinity of the removal, to
compensate for the lost flood storage capacity. Excavation
below the ordinary high-water mark shall not be considered as
providing any equal volume of storage capacity for
compensation purposes. Any such area of compensating flood
storage capacity shall drain freely to the receiving stream.
[Amended 3-17-2014 by Ord. No. 14-04]
(f) Removal of land from the floodplain shall not be permitted
unless the land has been filled to an elevation at least two feet
above the elevation of the floodplain.
(g) Amendments to the boundaries of the floodplain or the
unnumbered A Zones shall not be permitted unless the
petitioner provides the Village with all necessary data and
computations to justify and determine the effects of the
proposed amendment. The Village may require the applicant to
submit any or all of the information that is required pursuant to
Subsection M above in connection with applications for a
conditional use permit. The effects of any change in the
floodplain boundary shall not increase the regional flood
elevation unless appropriate legal arrangements have been
made to protect the rights of the Village and all affected
governmental entities and landowners. If the affected area of
the floodplain or the unnumbered A Zone is less than five acres
in area and the cost of the proposed development is less than
$125,000, the DNR may assist the petitioner in determining
the required flood elevations.
§ 420-131 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-131
344:1211
(h) No river or stream or watercourse shall be altered or relocated
until a floodplain map amendment has been conditionally
approved, and in no case shall the flood-carrying capacity
within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse be
less.
(3) Procedures. Amendments to this section, including text
amendments, floodplain map amendments relating to the boundary
of the floodplain or floodway, or amendments to the regional flood
profiles, may be made upon petition of any interested party in
accordance with the provisions of § 420-13 of this chapter.
Additionally, the following requirements shall apply, and in the
event of any conflict between the provisions of this Subsection T
and § 420-13, the requirements of this subsection shall be
controlling:
(a) Any amendment proposed shall be submitted to the Village
with the completed application, all required information and
materials and the required fee.
(b) Upon receipt of a completed application, the Village will set a
date for the public hearing a minimum of 30 days from the date
such completed application was received. Copies of the
proposed amendment and notice of the public hearing shall be
submitted to the DNR for review prior to the hearing, and a
Class 2 notice shall be published.

(h) All persons petitioning for a map amendment that obstructs
flow, causing any increase in the regional flood height, shall
obtain flooding easements or other appropriate legal
arrangements from all adversely affected property owners and
provide copies of said legal arrangements before the
amendment can be approved by the Village.
U. Watercourse alterations. Prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and prior to the issuance of any zoning, building, land
disturbance or other Village permit or approval which may be required
for the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, the Village Zoning
Administrator shall notify, in writing, any adjacent municipality, the
appropriate district office of the DNR and the appropriate office of
FEMA within six months and shall require the applicant to obtain all
necessary state and federal permits and approvals. Without respect to
any other restrictions that may be imposed, the flood-carrying capacity
within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse shall be
maintained and standards specified in Subsection J above are required.
V. Development or development-related activity requiring a DNR permit.
Any development or development-related activity which requires a
permit from the DNR under Ch. 30 or 31, Wis. Stats., such as docks,
piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams, navigational aids or channel
improvements, may be allowed, provided that such DNR permits and all
necessary local permits or approvals are obtained and that all
necessary amendments to this section, including amendments of the
official floodplain map, the boundaries of the floodplain and floodway,
and the water surface elevations of the regional flood, as applicable, are
made in accordance with Subsection T above.
W. Compliance. Any land use development or development-related activity
within the areas regulated by this section shall be in full compliance
with the terms of this section and all other applicable local, state, and
federal statutes, ordinances, regulations and permits. Unless
specifically exempted by law, the Village is required to comply with this
section and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to
comply if § 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction,
reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges
by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when
§ 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
X. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
(1) This section supersedes all of the provisions of any municipal
zoning ordinance relating to the floodplain areas or enacted under
§ 61.35 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains, except
that where any other such municipal zoning provision is more
restrictive than the provisions contained in this section, such other
provision shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the
greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
§ 420-131 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-131
344:1213
(2) This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing deed restrictions, convents or easements. However, where
this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
section shall prevail.
Y. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this section shall be held to be minimum requirements liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin
Statutes. Where a provision of this section is required by a standard in
Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, and where the provision in this section is
unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Ch. NR 116
standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this section or in effect
on the date of the most recent text amendment to this section.
Z. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
provided by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering experience and methods of study.
Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade
or natural causes, such as ice jams or bridge openings restricted
by debris. Therefore, this section does not imply that areas outside of
the delineated floodplain or permitted land uses within the floodplain
will be totally free from flooding and associated flood damages, nor
does this section create liability on the part of, or a cause of action
against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that may result from reliance on this section.
AA. Enforcement and penalties. Any violation of the provisions of this
section by any person shall be unlawful and shall be referred to the
Village Attorney for expeditious prosecution of all such violations. A
violator shall, upon conviction, forfeit to the Village a penalty of not less
than $5 and not more than $50, together with the current cost and
processing fees of such action. Each day of continued violation shall
constitute a separate offense. Every violation of this section is a public
nuisance, and the creation of such nuisance may be enjoined and its
maintenance may be abated by action or suit of the Village, the state, or
any citizen thereof pursuant to § 87.30, Wis. Stats.
BB. Severability. Should any portion of this section be declared
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remained of this section shall not be affected.
CC. Definitions. For purposes of this section, words and phrases defined in
this Subsection CC shall have the meaning stated below. Words and
phrases not defined below in this subsection shall have the common,
ordinary meaning which results in the most reasonable interpretation
and application of this section in light of the stated purposes of this
section. Words used in the present tense include the future, and vice
versa. Words indicating the singular number include the plural, and
vice versa. The word "may" is permissive; the word "shall" is mandatory
and not discretionary.

§ 420-133 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-135
344:1227
§ 420-135. UHO Urban Land Holding Overlay District.
A. Primary purpose and characteristics.
(1) This district is intended to be used where land is expected to
experience further urban or suburban development in accordance
with underlying zoning but where such development cannot be
permitted at the present time due to the existence of one or more
deficiencies, including lack of essential services, such as municipal
sanitary sewers, water or stormwater management facilities and
proper drainage, or the need to provide for access to landlocked
lands, or the establishment of street grades that are coordinated,
or similar neighborhood development matters.
(2) Accordingly, existing uses are permitted to continue as they are,
but any expansions or additions thereof are only allowable with
approval of site plans as noted under Subsection I below.
(3) New uses requiring the issuance of building or zoning permits shall
not be permitted until this overlay district is first removed by the
Village of Pleasant Prairie by a Zoning Map amendment, and the
petition to remove such overlay shall address the neighborhood
development matters requiring consideration, unless neighborhood
plans or other actions, such as municipal utility extensions, have
already been made.
B. Principal uses. Any existing principal use as permitted in the underlying
basic use district, except that any expansions thereof shall be subject to
review of site plans under Subsection I below.
C. Accessory uses. Any existing accessory use as permitted in the
underlying basic use district, except that any expansions thereof shall
be subject to review of site plans under Subsection I below.
D. Conditional uses. Any existing conditional use, or existing uses entitled
to conditional use status which apply for such status, except that any
expansion thereof shall, in addition to meeting the requirements for
conditional uses of this chapter, in the process of having its conditions
set, be subjected to the criteria established under Subsection I below.
E. Lot area and width.
(1) Lots shall have a lot area as required in the underlying basic use
district.
(2) All lots shall have a lot width as required in the underlying basic
use district.
F. Building height and area.
(1) No building or part of a building shall exceed 35 feet in height.
§ 420-135 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-135
344:1228
§ 420-136. LUSA Limited Urban Service Area Overlay District.
(2) The total floor area of any use shall not be less than that which is
required in the underlying basic use district.
G. Setbacks.
(1) Street setback: as required in the underlying basic use district.
(2) Shore setback: as required in the underlying basic use district.
(3) Side setback: as required in the underlying basic use district.
(4) Rear setback: as required in the underlying basic use district.
H. Authorized sanitary sewer system and water supply system. As
permitted in the underlying basic use district.
I. Review of site plans.
(1) Where existing uses wish to expand prior to removal of this district,
before building and zoning permits are issued the applicant shall
first obtain site plan approval from the Village Plan Commission.
The purpose of such review is to establish that the expansion will
not worsen an existing deficiency of the property or neighborhood
nor prevent the eventual solution of such deficiencies. As
experience with this problem is gained, the Village may from time
to time issue checklists or guidelines for the applicant's use which
outline information or analyses required to answer the issues often
posed in such reviews. An applicant under this provision shall be
entitled to an acceptance, rejection, or suggested modification of
the submitted site plan or related information within 45 days from
the date of submittal to the Community Development Department.
The aforesaid review may be waived by the Zoning Administrator of
the Community Development Department if it is determined that
the proposed expansion or addition of the existing use does not
interfere with future expansion of streets or stormwater drainage
or adversely affect future development or platting of the remainder
of the site.
(2) New uses may only be permitted by the staff of the Zoning
Administrator of the Community Development Department when it
is determined that adequate neighborhood plans for future
development exist or where such actions as extension of utilities
have already been completed and a Zoning Map amendment has
been adopted.
A. Primary purpose and characteristics. This district is intended to be
placed on existing platted land where urban development could legally
occur but where typical urban municipal services, such as municipal
sanitary sewer, municipal water and effective stormwater management
§ 420-135 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-136
344:1229
improvements, are not available and will not be available in the
foreseeable future.
B. Limited urban services available.
(1) Properties within this district are not located within the Village of
Pleasant Prairie Master Sanitary Sewer System Master Plan, which
means that the Village has no plans in the foreseeable future to
extend municipal sanitary sewer to service these properties and
that these properties, if developed, will require a private on-site
sewage disposal system or holding tank. In addition, the State of
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has not included the
properties within this district in the Sanitary Sewer Service Area,
which means that the Village cannot extend sanitary sewers within
this area.
(2) Properties within this district are not located within the Village of
Pleasant Prairie Master Water Utility System Master Plan, which
means that the Village has no plans in the foreseeable future to
extend municipal water to service these properties and that if
developed these properties will required a private well to be
installed for potable water. In addition, since there is no municipal
water service, no municipal fire hydrants are located in the area,
and water for fire protection must be hauled by tanker.
(3) Properties within this district are known to have high groundwater
levels, which are influenced both by Lake Michigan water levels
and weather conditions.
(4) Properties in this district are frequently subject to standing surface
water, in part because this area is not served by urban stormwater
systems that can effectively and efficiently convey stormwater, and
this situation may be exacerbated by further development. Such
stormwater improvements would be very difficult or impossible to
provide due to the high groundwater table, the generally level
topography which precludes efficient drainage, the fact that any
improvements would require a permit under Ch. 30, Wis. Stats.,
from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the fact
that the DNR has expressed serious concern that any such
improvements would dewater the wetlands in the area.
(5) Properties within this district may be located adjacent to a
dedicated public road right-of-way that is not improved, and the
Village has no plans in the foreseeable future to make such
improvements on roads in the area which have not already been
improved.
C. Principal uses. Any principal use permitted in the underlying basic use
zoning district.
D. Accessory uses. Any accessory use permitted in the underlying basic
use zoning district.
§ 420-136 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-136
344:1230
§ 420-137. PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District.
E. Conditional uses. Any conditional use permitted in the underlying basic
use zoning district.
F. Lot area and width.
(1) All lots shall have the minimum lot area required in the underlying
basic use zoning district.
(2) All lots shall have the minimum lot width required in the underlying
basic use zoning district.
G. Building height and area.
(1) Building height shall not exceed the height limitation in the
underlying basic use zoning district.
(2) The total floor area of any use shall not be less than that which is
required in the underlying basic use zoning district.
H. Setbacks.
(1) Street setback: as required in the underlying basic use zoning
district.
(2) Shore setback: as required in the underlying basic use zoning
district.
(3) Side setback: as required in the underlying basic use zoning
district.
(4) Rear setback: as required in the underlying basic use zoning
district.
I. Authorized sanitary sewer system. As permitted in the underlying basic
use district.
J. A property owner who develops property located in the LUSA Overlay
District, notwithstanding the nonavailability of typical urban municipal
services within the foreseeable future, necessarily accept the risks of
doing so and needs to design any such development to take account of
the nonavailability of such services. The Village disclaims any
responsibility for any loss or damage arising out of or resulting from the
nonavailability or inadequacy of municipal services in the LUSA
District.
A. Primary purpose and characteristics. The Village Board of Trustees has
the authority to create planned development districts. The PUD
Planned Unit Development Overlay District, set forth herein, is
intended to permit developments that will, over a period of time, be
enhanced by coordinated area site planning and diversified location of
structures. Such developments are intended to provide a safe and
efficient system for pedestrian and vehicle traffic; to provide attractive
§ 420-136 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-137
344:1231
recreation and open spaces as integral parts of the developments;
to provide for development opportunities to be designed to protect,
enhance and benefit from unique environmental features on a site; to
enable economic design in the location of public and private utilities
and community facilities; and to ensure adequate standards of
construction and planning. The PUD Overlay District under this chapter
will allow for flexibility of overall development design, with benefits
from such design flexibility intended to be derived by both the
developer and the community, while at the same time maintaining,
insofar as possible, the land use density and other standards or use
requirements set forth in the underlying basic zoning district. The
unified and planned development of a site in a single or corporate
ownership or control or in common ownership under the Unit
Ownership Act176 set forth in Ch. 703, Wis. Stats. (condominiums), may
be permitted by the Village Board upon specific application under this
section and after public hearing, with such development encompassing
one or more principal uses or structures and related accessory uses
or structures, when all regulations and standards as set forth in this
section have been met. [Amended 3-20-2006 by Ord. No. 06-13]
B. District created. So as to ensure a maximum benefit to both the
community and to developers and so as to provide flexibility in planning
in all the districts created under this chapter, there is hereby created
the Planned Unit Development Overlay District. [Amended 3-20-2006
by Ord. No. 06-13; 1-16-2012 by Ord. No. 12-01]
C. Principal, accessory and conditional uses. Principal, accessory and
conditional uses permitted in a planned unit development overlay
district shall conform to uses permitted in the underlying basic use
district, except that the PUD Overlay District may prohibit certain
permitted principal, accessory and conditional uses specified in the
basic use district, as determined by the Village Board. [Amended
3-2-2015 by Ord. No. 15-09]
D. Ownership. Areas designated as PUD Overlay Districts shall be under
single or corporate ownership or control at the time of their creation.
E. Modifications allowed. The PUD Overlay District may also modify, with
approval of the Village Board, dimensional requirements including but
not limited to setbacks, structure height, lot width and area
requirements of the underlying basic zoning district. In addition the
PUD Overlay District may also modify, with approval of the Village
Board, other sections of the Zoning Ordinance including but not limited
to traffic, parking and access requirements and sign requirements.
[Amended 3-2-2015 by Ord. No. 15-09177]
176. Editor's Note: Now titled the "Condominium Ownership Act."
177. Editors Note: This ordinance also superseded former Subsection E, regarding minimum
area requirements, as amended.
§ 420-137 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-137

F. Minimum sanitary sewer and water requirements. All planned unit
developments shall be on public sanitary sewer. All planned unit
development shall be on public water system, except for the planned
unit developments in the A-2, A-3, A-4 that create four or fewer lots
wherein water is not readily available as determined by the Village
Administrator. [Amended 3-20-2006 by Ord. No. 06-13]
G. Preapplication conference and general layout conceptual plan. Prior to
the official submission of the application for the approval of a planned
unit development overlay district, the owner or his agent making such
application shall meet with the Community Development Department to
discuss the scope and proposed nature of the contemplated
development and data and other information as deemed appropriate
and pertinent for presentation to the Village. At the preapplication
conference, the owner or agent shall present a general layout
conceptual plan, including drawings and sketches of the proposed
development and figures or calculations that are pertinent to the
development, using as a general guideline the requirements set forth in
Subsection H(2) below.
H. Application. Following the preapplication conference, the owner or his
agent may file an application with the Zoning Administrator on forms

and notice thereof shall be given pursuant to the provisions of § 420-13
of this chapter, and said proposed alterations shall be submitted to the
Village Board for approval.
M. Subsequent land division. The division of any land or lands within a
planned unit development overlay district for the purpose of change or
conveyance of ownership shall be accomplished pursuant to Chapter
395, Land Division and Development Control, of the Village Code.
N. Failure to begin development. If no substantial construction has
commenced as defined in § 420-22J(3) of this chapter or no use is
established in the planned unit development district within the time
schedule submitted to the Village, the Plan Commission shall petition
the Village Board for the purpose of rescinding the planned unit
development overlay designation so as to allow the land in question to
revert to its underlying zone. The procedures set forth in § 420-13 of
this chapter relating to the amendment of this chapter shall be adhered
to. In its discretion and for good cause, the Village Board may extend
for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year, the period for
the beginning of construction or the establishment of a use. If the
planned unit development overlay district is rescinded, the Zoning
Administrator shall remove said district from the Official Zoning Map.
Those zoning regulations applicable before the creation of said district
shall then be in effect, and no vested rights in the planned unit
development overlay district shall be deemed to have accrued.

181. Editor's Note: See § 420-44, Vision triangle.
§ 420-139 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-139
344:1242
(a) The required street setback distance of principal structures
located within a single-family residential district may be
decreased to the average of the existing street setback
distance of the abutting principal structures on each side, but
in no case shall the setback distances be reduced to less than
15 feet from a Village right-of-way or private roadway or less
than 50 feet from a federal, state or county trunk highway
right-of-way. If one of the abutting lots to be used in averaging
the setback is vacant, then to calculate the average street
setback, the street setback on the vacant lot shall be the
minimum setback as required in the underlying zoning district.
Furthermore, the required street setback distance may be
reduced to 25 feet for principal structures in any subdivision
platted prior to April 5, 1989 (Village incorporation date),
wherein said plat had a previously recorded deed restriction
indicating a twenty-five-foot street setback, then said principal
structure or addition thereto may be set back a minimum of 25
feet from the property line adjacent to the street.
(b) The required street setback distance of principal structures for
all manufactured/mobile homes located within a licensed park
as of January 1, 1998, may be decreased to the average of the
existing street setback distance of the abutting structures on
each side, but in no case shall the setback distances be
reduced to less than 10 feet from a Village right-of-way or to
less than five feet from a private roadway (as measured from
the back of curb or edge of road pavement). The required
street setback distance for the deck or a porch (including steps
or stairs) used for the minimum required ingress or egress into
any manufactured/mobile home located within a licensed park
may encroach up to four feet into the required street setback
but in no case shall the setback distance be reduced to less
than 10 feet from a Village right-of-way or less than five feet
from a private roadway (as measured from the back of curb or
edge of road pavement). [Amended 11-17-2014 by Ord. No.
14-33]
(c) The required street setback distance of fences may be
decreased to the average of the existing street setback
distance of the abutting fences on each side, but in no case
shall the setback distance be reduced to less than two feet
from a street right-of-way. This provision would not apply
where the fence setback distance reduction would involve
vision triangles.
(d) (Reserved)182

to abutting principal structures, was repealed 7-17-2017 by Ord. No. 17-32.
§ 420-139 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-139
344:1243
(e) The required rear street yard setback distance of a principal
structure located in a single-family residential district and
located on a double or triple frontage lot which abuts a federal,
state or county trunk highway may be decreased to 50 feet
where there is no direct access permitted to a federal, state or
county trunk highway.
(f) (Reserved)183
(3) Noise. Sirens, whistles, and bells which are maintained and utilized
solely to serve a public purpose are exempt from the sound level
standards of this chapter.
(4) Corner lots (double frontage lots). All double frontage corner lots
shall have two street yards, one side yard, and one rear yard.
(5) Corner lots (triple frontage lots). All triple frontage corner lots shall
have three street yards and one side yard.
(6) Setback distances restrictions. Permitted principal structure
setback distances appropriate to the location and type of
development contemplated which are more restrictive than the
regulations of the applicable zoning district may be required by the
Village. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
(a) Greater street setback distances may be required on cul-de-sac
lots to achieve the necessary lot width at the building setback
line.
(b) Minimum or maximum street setback distances may be
required for new principal structures to provide aesthetically
consistent building site lines and conformance with existing
adjacent development.
(c) Special setback distances may be required to protect natural
resource elements such as trees.
(7) Manufactured home/mobile home park (R-12 District) side
setbacks. The required side setback distance of principal
structures for manufactured/mobile homes located in
manufactured/mobile home parks (R-12 District) created prior to
January 1, 1999, may be decreased to a zero lot line setback,
provided that in no instance shall adjacent manufactured/mobile
home principal structures and accessory structures be closer than
10 feet apart as measured from side to side or side to end.
However, in no case shall the side setback distance be reduced if
the side yard abuts the exterior property line of said manufactured/
mobile home park.

(8) Single-family dwellings not constructed in accordance with the
valid zoning permit. Any principal single-family structure and its
accessory garage located within an R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, A-2,
A-3, AGO or C-2 District containing a legally conforming use and
constructed with a valid zoning permit issued by Kenosha County
prior to April 1, 1983, but which was not constructed in accordance
with the zoning permit as it pertains to street, side and rear
setbacks for said principal structure or accessory garage shall be
considered a legal nonconforming structure and shall be subject to
§ 420-140 of this chapter insofar as the placement of the structure,
as determined by the Village, does not present a threat to the
public's health, safety or welfare. [Amended 4-7-2014 by Ord.
No. 14-06]
C. Zero side setback. In any B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, M-1 or M-2 District, for
an existing building or a building to be constructed on a lot which, as a
result of a subdivision of such lot into two contiguous lots, will share a
common division or party wall and parking areas and will be developed
under an approved common development plan, the required side
setback and related parking lot setback shall not apply to such common
division or party wall created thereby on the subdivided lot.
D. Accommodations and exceptions for tax increment districts.
(1) For any land division effective after January 1, 2000, that is located
between or adjacent to any tax increment district (TID) within the
Village that cannot be combined, according to the Wisconsin
Department of Revenue, into one tax parcel number because the
parcels are located within different tax increment districts, or
because one of the parcels is located within a TID and the other
parcel is not located within a TID, the parcels may be developed as
one single development. However, if one parcel does not meet the
basic underlying zoning district lot area and/or lot frontage
requirements, then the lots shall be developed as a single
development and at the time the parcel is created or modified shall
be exempt from meeting the lot area and lot frontage requirements
until the termination of the TID as stated in Subsection D(2)(b)
below.
(2) If the parcels cannot be combined for reasons described above and
the parcels are developed as a single development, then the
following shall be required:
(a) At the time an application is filed with the Village for a site and
operational plan approval and/or a conditional use permit, the
owner(s) shall indicate on the application that the parcels are
to be developed as one single development.
(b) The parcels shall remain under the same ownership, and upon
the termination of the tax increment district for all affected
§ 420-139 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-139
344:1245
§ 420-140. Nonconforming lots, structures and uses.
units of government, the owner(s), at the owner's expense,
shall combine the parcels into one tax parcel number.
(c) The inner property boundaries shall only exist for tax
distribution purposes, and for zoning purposes the parcels
shall be considered as one property defined by its outer
property boundaries as it relates to zoning regulations, such as
but not limited to the number of principal structures and/or
accessory structures allowed, setbacks, signs, and traffic and
parking requirements for the basic underlying zoning district.
(See Illustration 7 184).
A. Intent. Within the districts established by this chapter, or amendment
thereof, there may exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures
which were lawful before this chapter was enacted or amended but
which would be prohibited in the future under the terms of this chapter
or amendment.
(1) It is the intent of the Village Board to permit these nonconforming
lots, structures and uses existing as of the effective date of this
chapter or amendment thereof to remain and continue in
accordance with the provisions hereinafter set forth until they are
removed by economic forces or otherwise. It is not the intent of this
section to encourage the survival of nonconformities, since it has
been determined that they are incompatible with the character of
the districts involved, or to permit nonconformities to be enlarged
upon, expanded, or extended except as provided for herein.
Existing nonconformities shall not be used to justify adding
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(2) It is the further intention of the Village Board that the guidelines be
set for the purpose of determining:
(a) That the nonconforming lot, structure or use existed prior to
the effective date of this chapter or amendment thereto;
(b) The ways in which the right of the nonconforming lot or
structure to remain can be served and the ways in which the
right to continue nonconforming uses can be lost;
(c) The extent of permissible variation in the nonconforming lot,
structure and use; and
(d) The devices available for eliminating such nonconforming lots,
structures and uses.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meaning indicated:
184. Editor's Note: Illustration 7 is included in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.
§ 420-139 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-140
344:1246
ASSESSED VALUE  The full market value placed upon the structure
or lot by the Village Assessor as of the date that the nonconformity
came into being, that is, the effective date of this chapter or amendment
thereto. Such valuation by the Village Assessor shall be prima facie
evidence of the assessed value of the structure or lot.
LEGALLY EXISTING  A lot, structure or use existing on the effective
date of this chapter or amendment thereto which was created, built or
established in accordance with zoning and land use regulations in effect
in the Village immediately prior to the effective date of this chapter or
amendment thereto, or a lot, structure or use for which a zoning permit
was issued prior to the effective date of this chapter or amendment
thereto in accordance with the provision of § 420-6 of this chapter.
NONCONFORMING LOT  A parcel of land legally created prior to
the effective date of this chapter or subsequent amendments thereto
having frontage on a public street, occupied or intended to be occupied
by a principal building or structure, together with accessory buildings
and uses, and having insufficient size to meet the lot width, lot area,
setback, off-street parking area, or other open space provisions of this
chapter.
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE  One which was legally
constructed prior to the effective date of this chapter or subsequent
amendment thereto but which would not be permitted as a new
structure under the terms of this chapter or amendment thereto
because the structure is not in conformance with the setback, height,
coverage, or floor area ratio requirements of the district in which it
is located. A structure located on a nonconforming lot shall not be
classified as a nonconforming structure solely because of insufficient lot
area or width.
NONCONFORMING USE  An activity utilizing land or structures, or
both, legally established prior to the effective date of this chapter or
subsequent amendment thereto which would not be permitted as a new
use in the district in which it is located under the terms of this chapter.
C. Burden of proof. Any property owner asserting as a defense to a charge
of violating this chapter that his property was a valid nonconforming
use has the burden of demonstrating to a reasonable certainty by the
greater weight of credible evidence that:
(1) The nonconforming use was legally in existence at the time this
chapter was passed or amended.
(2) The use of the property prior to this chapter was so active and
actual that it can be said the property owner acquired a vested
interest in its continuance. For purposes of this chapter, a property
owner shall be deemed to have a vested right in the use of his
property where that use at the time of the effective date of this
chapter or amendment thereto is both active and actual (not
contemplated) and a substantial degree of activity or expense had
§ 420-140 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-140
344:1247
been undertaken prior to the effective date of this chapter or
amendment thereto. Permits issued prior to the existence of this
chapter shall be deemed to have created a vested right in the
property owner to the extent provided in § 420-6 of this chapter.
(3) The use is substantially the same use that existed prior to the
enactment of this chapter or amendment thereto.
D. Existing vacant nonconforming (substandard) lots. In any residential,
upland conservancy or agricultural district, a one-family detached
dwelling and its accessory structures may be erected on any vacant
legal lot or parcel of record in the County Register of Deeds office
recorded before the effective date or amendment of this chapter,
provided that such lot or parcel meets all the following minimum
requirements and further provided that all requirements of the County
Sanitary Ordinance are met.
(1) Lot.
(a) Width: minimum 50 feet (public sewerage); 65 feet (private
sewage system).
(b) Area: minimum 5,000 square feet (public sewerage); 10,000
square feet (private sewage system).
(2) Setbacks.
(a) Street: the minimum required in the district except as provided
in § 420-139 of this chapter.
(b) Rear: minimum 25 feet from lot line.
(c) Side: minimum 16% of the lot width on each side, but not less
than eight feet from lot line.
E. Use of existing nonconforming lots in the business districts. [Amended
12-3-2007 by Ord. No. 07-51]
(1) In any B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 or B-5 Business District, any
nonconforming lot having no principal structure located on it (or on
which the sole principal structure will be removed before or in
conjunction with the proposed development and use of the lot) may
be developed and used for an allowed use subject to compliance
with all applicable requirements of this chapter (other than the
minimum lot size or minimum public street frontage requirements
that cause the lot to be nonconforming) and of all other Village
ordinances and codes; provided, however, that in the event
applicable requirements of this chapter cannot be complied with as
a result of the lot's failure to satisfy the minimum lot size and/or
minimum public street frontage requirements, certain other
specified requirements of this chapter shall be modified in
accordance with this subsection to allow productive development
and use of the nonconforming lot if certain specified conditions are
§ 420-140 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-140
344:1248
met. The following items shall be evaluated sequentially and
cumulatively to determine the minimum amount of such
modification necessary to allow productive development and use
of the nonconforming lot, as well as the maximum amount of such
modification permitted by this section, and the extent and priority
of such modifications shall be as provided below:
(a) First, any existing or proposed accessory structure on the lot
shall be reduced in size or eliminated, as necessary to achieve
compliance.
(b) If any necessary reduction or elimination of any accessory
structure does not allow the lot to be developed in compliance
with the remaining applicable requirements, the proposed
principal building size shall be reduced, as necessary to
achieve compliance, to an absolute minimum of 1,500 square
feet of gross floor area in the B-1 District or to an absolute
minimum of 2,000 square feet of gross floor area in the B-2,
B-3, B-4 or B-5 District.
(c) If any necessary reduction of the principal building size does
not allow the lot to be developed in compliance with the
remaining applicable requirements, the required landscape
islands within the parking lot shall be reduced in size or
number or eliminated, as necessary to achieve compliance.
(d) If any necessary reduction or elimination of the landscape
islands does not allow the lot to be developed in compliance
with the remaining applicable requirements, the required side
setbacks for principal structures shall be reduced, as
necessary to achieve compliance, as follows:
[1] Side setbacks for principal structures in the B-1 and B-2
Districts shall be reduced, as necessary, to an absolute
minimum of 10 feet.
[2] Side setbacks for principal structures in the B-3, B-4 and
B-5 Districts shall be reduced, as necessary, to an absolute
minimum of 25 feet.
(e) If any necessary reduction of the side setbacks for principal
structures does not allow the lot to be developed in compliance
with the remaining applicable requirements, the street
setback(s) for principal structures shall be reduced, as
necessary to achieve compliance, to an absolute minimum of
50 feet from arterial streets or highways and to an absolute
minimum of 30 feet from nonarterial streets or private roads.
(f) If any necessary reduction of the street setback(s) for principal
structures does not allow the lot to be developed in compliance
with the remaining current requirements, the setback for
parking area(s) from the property line(s) of the lot shall be
§ 420-140 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-140
344:1249
reduced, as necessary to achieve compliance, to an absolute
minimum of 10 feet.
(g) If any necessary reduction of the setback for parking area(s)
from the property line(s) does not allow the lot to be developed
in compliance with the remaining applicable requirements, the
minimum width of internal site circulation ways, access roads
and private roads shall be reduced, as necessary to achieve
compliance, to an absolute minimum of 24 feet, provided that
fire-fighting equipment can be safely maneuvered through the
lot.
(h) If any necessary reduction of the minimum width or internal
site circulation ways does not allow the lot to be developed in
compliance with the remaining current requirements, the
required garbage/recycling enclosure may be detached from
the building, provided the required enclosure is located in the
side or rear yard and is a minimum of three feet from the side
and rear property lines; however, the Village Zoning
Administrator may allow for the three-foot setback to be
reduced if proper screening is provided to the adjacent
property.
(i) The open space requirements may be reduced to the extent
required by the other modifications provided for in this
Subsection E(1).
(j) If the modifications provided for in this Subsection E(1) are not
sufficient to allow the lot to be developed and used in
compliance with the remaining applicable requirements of this
chapter, such lot may only be developed and used for a less
intense use (e.g., a use requiring fewer parking spaces) or with
a variance.
(2) In any B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 or B-5 Business District, any
nonconforming lot on which one or more principal structures are
located [which will not be removed so as to make applicable
Subsection E(1) above] may continue to be used and further
developed for an allowed use subject to compliance with all
applicable requirements of this chapter (other than the minimum
lot size and/or minimum public street frontage requirements that
cause the lot to be nonconforming) and of all other Village
ordinances and codes; provided, however, that in the event
applicable requirements of this chapter cannot be complied with as
a result of the lot's failure to satisfy the minimum lot size and/or
minimum public street frontage requirements, then certain other
specified requirements of this chapter shall be modified in
accordance with this subsection to allow continued productive use
and/or development of the lot if certain specified conditions are
met. The following items shall be evaluated sequentially and
cumulatively to determine the minimum degree of such
§ 420-140 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-140
344:1250
modification necessary to allow productive continued use and/or
development of the nonconforming lot, as well as the maximum
amount of such modification permitted by this section, and the
extent and priority of such required modifications shall be as
provided below:
(a) First, any existing or proposed accessory structure or
proposed addition to an accessory structure on the lot shall be
reduced in size or eliminated, as necessary to achieve
compliance.
(b) If any necessary reduction or elimination of any proposed
accessory structure or any proposed addition to such a
structure does not allow compliance with the remaining
applicable requirements, any extra principal structure or any
proposed addition to any principal structure shall be reduced
in size or eliminated, as necessary to achieve compliance.
(c) If any necessary reduction or elimination of any extra principal
structure or of any proposed addition to any principal structure
does not allow compliance with the remaining applicable
requirements, the required landscape islands within the
parking area(s) shall be reduced in size or number or
eliminated, as necessary to achieve compliance.
(d) If any necessary reduction or elimination of the landscape
islands in the parking area(s) does not allow compliance with
the remaining applicable requirements, the setback for
parking area(s) from the property line(s) of the lot shall be
reduced, as necessary to achieve compliance, to an absolute
minimum of 10 feet.
(e) If any necessary reduction of the setback for parking areas(s)
from the property line(s) of the lot does not allow compliance
with the remaining applicable requirements, the minimum
width of internal site circulation ways, access roads and
private roads shall be reduced, as necessary to achieve
compliance, to an absolute minimum of 24 feet, provided that
fire-fighting equipment can be safely maneuvered through the
lot.
(f) If any necessary reduction of the minimum width or internal
site circulation ways does not allow the lot to be developed in
compliance with the remaining current requirements, the
required garbage/recycling enclosure may be detached from
the building, provided the required enclosure is located in the
side or rear yard and is a minimum of three feet from the side
and rear property lines; however, the Village Zoning
Administrator may allow for the three-foot setback to be
reduced if proper screening is provided to the adjacent
property.
§ 420-140 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-140
344:1251
(g) The open space requirements may be reduced to the extent
required by the other modifications provided for in this
Subsection E(2).
(h) If the modifications provided for in this Subsection E(2) are not
sufficient to allow the proposed use and/or development
activities on the lot in compliance with the remaining
applicable requirements of this chapter, such lot may only
continue to be used and/or further developed for a less intense
use (e.g., a use requiring fewer parking spaces) or with a
variance.
F. Common ownership of abutting nonconforming lots. Nonconforming
lots of record owned by the same individual or individuals shall be
combined prior to the issuance of a zoning permit.
G. Existing nonconforming structures. The use of a structure existing at
the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter may be
continued although the structure's size or location does not conform to
the established lot area and width, setback, height, parking, loading, or
access provisions of this chapter. A nonconforming structure can be
moved, altered or reconstructed as follows:
(1) A nonconforming structure may be structurally altered within the
limits of the existing building envelope.
(2) An addition to a nonconforming structure is allowed provided that
the addition complies with the current requirements of this
chapter.
(3) A nonconforming structure can be moved provided that the
structure complies with the current requirements of this chapter.
(4) The only portion of a nonconforming structure that can be
reconstructed, whether or not it is damaged or destroyed by
natural calamity, is that portion used for the required ingress or
egress into said building and further provided that there is no
greater degree of encroachment into the setback or a greater
degree of enclosure.
H. Existing nonconforming uses. The lawful use of a building or premises
existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of a zoning ordinance
may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions
of the ordinance. Such nonconforming use may not be extended. The
total structural repairs or alterations in such a nonconforming building
shall not during its life exceed 50% of the assessed value of the building
unless permanently changed to a conforming use. If such
nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 12 months, any
future use of the building and premises shall conform to the ordinance.
I. Changes and substitutions. Once a nonconforming use or structure has
been changed or altered so as to comply with the provisions of this
§ 420-140 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-140
344:1252
§ 420-140.1. Temporary uses. [Added 9-2-2008 by Ord. No. 08-47;
amended 11-21-2016 by Ord. No. 16-39]
chapter, it shall not revert back to a nonconforming use or structure.
Once the Zoning Board of Appeals has permitted the substitution of
a more or equally restrictive nonconforming use for an existing
nonconforming use pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 18, Article
V of the Village Code, the existing use shall lose its status as a legal
nonconforming use and become subject to all the conditions required
by the Board.
J. Floodplain nonconforming uses. Pursuant to § 420-131.
K. Nonconforming signs. Pursuant to § 420-78T.
L. Nonconforming performance standards. The use of any lot or parcel
failing to comply with the performance standards set forth in this
chapter at the time of the adoption of this chapter shall not be expanded
unless such expansion conforms to the performance standards set forth
in § 420-38 of this chapter.
A. Purpose and intent. A temporary use, as defined by this chapter, is
designed to provide the Zoning Administrator with flexibility to allow
uses that are short-term in nature. A temporary use shall not be
inherently inconsistent with the uses allowed in a particular zoning
district. The nature, character or circumstances of temporary uses are
unique and dependent upon specific conditions. Therefore, specifying
all temporary uses and associated standards, regulations or conditions
necessary or appropriate for a temporary use permit to be granted is
not practical. Applicants that obtain approval of a temporary use permit
pursuant to this section are not required to obtain a business license
pursuant to Article VII of this chapter.
B. The Village Board has authorized the Zoning Administrator, at his/her
discretion, the authority to approve, impose reasonable conditions and
issue a temporary use permit, provided that such temporary use
complies with the provisions of this chapter, its purpose and intent and
all other applicable federal, state, county and local requirements.
C. Permits and procedures for the issuance of a temporary use permit
shall be pursuant to Article IV of this chapter.
D. The issuance of a temporary use permit does not waive any other
requirements which are imposed by the Village's Zoning or Land
Division Ordinances or Building or Municipal Code.
E. Any violations of the terms and conditions of a temporary use permit is
a violation of the Village Zoning Ordinance and is subject to Article XIX
of this chapter.
§ 420-140 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-140.1
344:1253
F. Specified temporary uses. It is recognized that it is neither possible nor
practicable to list all of the temporary uses that are acceptable;

compliance with the following requirements:
(a) A new single-family dwelling is allowed to be constructed on an

existing old dwelling is razed upon completion of the new
single-family dwelling.
(b) The occupant(s) of the existing dwelling is allowed to live in the
existing dwelling while the new single-family dwelling is being

property owner shall submit and obtain the required
razing permits from the Village.
[2] The property owner shall completely remove or relocate
any other accessory structures on the property that are or
would be classified as nonconforming structures after the
old dwelling is removed. Prior to razing or relocating any
existing accessory structure, the property owner shall
submit and obtain the required permits from the Village.
[3] The property owner is responsible to remove all debris,
restore and stabilize the area occupied by the old dwelling
and comply with any other requirements or conditions of
the razing or relocation permits.

344:1254
(f) In no case shall any structures located on the property be
classified as a nonconforming structure once the new singlefamily

ARTICLE XVIII
Conditional Uses
§ 420-141. Purpose and findings.
A conditional use, as defined by this chapter, is designed to be a flexibility
device designed to cope with situations where a particular use, although not
permitted as a matter of right, is not inherently inconsistent with the use
classification of a particular district but could create special problems and
hazards if allowed to develop and locate as a matter of right in a particular
district and therefore is in need of special consideration. Often the effects
of these uses on the surrounding environment cannot be foreseen until a
specific site has been proposed. The nature, character or circumstances
of these uses are so unique or so dependent upon specific contemporary
conditions that predetermination of permissibility by right or the detailing
in this chapter of all of the specific standards, regulations or conditions
necessary or appropriate to such permissibility is not practical, it being
recognized that the Village is faced with practical difficulties in defining
with precision in advance the conditions under which a conditional use
permit may be granted. Those conditional uses hereinafter designated in
this chapter as such are deemed to have one or more of the following
characteristics when located within certain districts:
§ 420-142. Intent.
It is the intent of the Village Board that the hereinafter designated
conditional uses may be allowed at the Plan Commission's discretion within
the areas designated by this chapter in accordance with § 420-145G of
this chapter and only when the conditions imposed thereon are met. Any
conditions so imposed as a basis for granting the conditional use permit
shall be binding on all grantees, assignees, heirs, legatees, donees,
transferees and trustees of the petition.
§ 420-143. Conditional use permits.
The Plan Commission may authorize the Zoning Administrator to issue
a conditional use permit for conditional uses as specified in each of the
aforementioned districts set forth in Article XVI after review and a public
hearing, as provided herein, provided that such conditional uses and
structures are in accord with the provisions of this chapter, its purpose and
intent and all other applicable federal, state, county and local requirements.
A. Hazardous, dangerous or harmful to adjoining or nearby parcels,
waters, air or the environment;
B. Noxious, offensive, a nuisance or otherwise adverse to the adjoining or

published as a Class 2 notice in a newspaper of general circulation in
accordance with Ch. 985, Wis. Stats. Notice of such public hearing shall
also be given in accordance with the Wisconsin Open Meeting Law,
§§ 19.81 to 19.98, Wis. Stats. Further, notice of such public hearing
shall be mailed by first class mail, not less than 10 days prior to the
public hearing, to the last known address of the applicant, the owners
of the subject lot or site, the owners of all real property located within
300 feet of the subject lot or site and to all other parties of interest as

District, a copy of the notice of public hearing and a copy of the
application shall be mailed to the Southeast District Office of the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in accordance with Ch. NR
116 or NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, respectively, not less than 10 days
prior to the hearing. Failure of any person to receive actual notice of the
public hearing shall not invalidate any action taken by the Plan
Commission. In the event that the Plan Commission postpones or
adjourns a public hearing for a period of time not to exceed one month
after the publication and mailing of the public hearing notice in
accordance with this subsection, no additional Class 2 notice or mailed
notice to property owners shall be required, provided that notice of the
date, time and place of the postponed or adjourned hearing is publicly
announced by the Plan Commission at the time and place of the hearing
for which notice was published and mailed and appears in the record of
the proceeding.
C. In hearing a petition for a conditional use permit, the Plan Commission
shall call the petition at the public hearing. Upon the call of the petition,
the petition shall be read by the Chairman of the Plan Commission, and
at the conclusion thereof the Chairman shall hear and receive any
evidence or sworn testimony presented by the petitioner or his
authorized agent. At the conclusion of the petitioner's presentation, the
Chairman shall ask for any public comments related to the petition. Any
§ 420-144 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-145
344:1267
relevant and material evidence or sworn testimony presented by
individuals shall be received by the Chairman; provided, however, that
said evidence or sworn testimony is properly identifiable for the record.
Lastly, the Chairman shall ask for a recommendation from the Zoning
Administrator.
D. Upon receiving the recommendation of the Zoning Administrator, the
Plan Commission may table the petition for a period of up to three
months from the date of public hearing, or longer if agreed by the
petitioner, so as to allow the petitioner an opportunity to provide any
further information deemed pertinent by the Commission or so as to
allow the Commissioners an opportunity to view the site in accordance
with the guidelines set forth in Chapter 18, § 18-41, of the Village Code
or consider the conditions for issuing a conditional use permit or to
view similar uses already in existence in accordance with the guidelines
set forth in § 18-41 if a comparison is warranted. All deliberations and
decisions of the Commission relating to the conditional use permit shall
be made at a meeting held in conformance with the Wisconsin Open
Meeting Law.
E. Upon having received all evidence and hearing all sworn testimony
relating to the petition, the Plan Commission shall review the site plan,
existing and proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring land
and water uses, parking areas, driveway locations, highway access,
traffic generation and circulation, drainage, sewage and water systems,
the proposed operation, the effects of the proposed use, structure,
operation and improvement upon flood damage protection, water
quality, air quality, shoreland cover, natural beauty and wildlife habitat,
and any other pertinent requirements deemed necessary by the
Commission so as to eliminate, alleviate, or control any hazard, danger,
harm, nuisance, adversity or inconsistency that exists or could develop.
Upon completion of said review, the Chairman shall entertain a motion
that the Plan Commission either grant or deny the conditional use
permit petition based upon specific findings and conclusions.
F. The Plan Commission shall not approve a conditional use permit unless
they find after viewing the application that the structure, site or use, as
planned, will not violate the intent and purpose of all Village
ordinances. The Plan Commission shall review and consider the
approval of said conditional use permit only after determining that:
(1) The proposed structure(s), site or use will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent properties or increase danger of
fire, cause traffic congestion or traffic circulation problems, create
stormwater flooding or drainage, create obnoxious odors or
problems or otherwise endanger the public health, safety or
welfare.
(2) The effect of the proposed conditional use will not hinder, harm or
distract the provision of public services.
§ 420-145 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-145
344:1268
§ 420-146. Existing uses.
(3) The existing and proposed methods of eliminating, alleviating or
controlling the identified hazard, danger, harm, noxiousness,
offensiveness, nuisance or other adversity or inconsistency do not
endanger the public's health, safety or welfare.
(4) Regardless of any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary
allowing for a conditional use permit for a particular structure, site
or use on a particular parcel, the proposed and applied for use on a
particular parcel is not inherently inconsistent with either the
district in which it is located or adjoining districts or
neighborhoods.
G. Unless specifically altered by § 420-148, Standards for conditional uses,
compliance with all of the minimum provisions of this chapter dealing
with such matters as, without limitation due to enumeration, lot area
and width, building height and area, yards, setbacks, sanitary systems,
signs, parking, loading, traffic and highway access and performance
standards shall be required of all conditional uses. Variances shall only
be granted as provided in Chapter 18, Article V of the Village Code.
H. Notice of conditional uses granted in the FPO Floodplain Overlay
District or in any other area where the shoreland jurisdictional
boundary is applicable shall be given to the Southeast District Office of
the State Department of Natural Resources within 10 days following
the decision. [Amended 4-7-2014 by Ord. No. 14-06]

a conditional use permit may be appealed as provided for in Chapter 18,
Article V of the Village Code. Such appeal shall be filed with the Village
Zoning Administrator within 30 days after final action taken by the Plan
Commission.
J. Any conditional use permit granted by the Plan Commission shall not be
valid unless recorded at the Kenosha County Register of Deeds office
within six months after approval of said permit or prior to issuance of
any building or zoning permits, which ever comes first. Any recording
fees shall be paid by the applicant. In addition, the Zoning
Administrator shall keep a record of all such conditional use permits,
with such records available to the public.
A. All uses existing at the effective date of this chapter which would be
classified as conditional uses in the particular zoning district concerned
if they were to be established after the effective date of this chapter are
hereby declared to be conforming conditional uses to the extent of the
existing operation only. Any addition, alteration, extension, expansion,
repair or other proposed change in the existing operation shall be
subject to the conditional use procedures as if such use were being
established anew.

§ 420-147. Suspension or revocation of permit.
Upon a complaint filed with the Zoning Administrator alleging
noncompliance with the terms of the conditional use permit by any
interested party, or upon the motion of the Zoning Administrator, the Plan
Commission shall schedule an open hearing within 45 days of the filing
of the complaint and shall conduct a hearing pursuant to the general
outline set forth in § 420-145. Upon a finding that the standards, regulations
and conditions set forth in granting the conditional use permit have been
violated, the Plan Commission may suspend the conditional use permit
until such time as there is compliance with the standards, regulations and
conditions imposed with said permit, or the Plan Commission may revoke
the conditional use permit. Any continued operation after a suspension
or revocation of such permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter
and subject to the fines set forth in § 420-150 of this chapter. This action
of the Commission may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 18, Article V
of the Village Code. Such appeal shall be filed with the Village Zoning
Administrator within 30 days after final action taken by the Plan
Commission. Any failure to revoke a conditional use permit for past
violations shall not operate as a waiver of the right to suppress future
violations.
§ 420-148. Standards for conditional uses.
B. Any other use not mentioned above which was a conforming conditional
use before adoption or amendment of this chapter but is not a
conditional use in the district in which it is now located shall be
considered a legal nonconforming use and shall be subject to the
requirements of § 420-140 of this chapter.
A. In addition to the specific conditions required herein, additional
reasonable conditions or requirements which bear a direct relationship
to the hazard, danger, harm, noxiousness, offensiveness, nuisance or
other adversity or inconsistency sought to be eliminated, alleviated or
controlled, such as, without limitation due to enumeration,
environmental, economic or social impact statements, storm drainage
plans, landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, ground

344:1270
the period of time for which the conditional use will be permitted, may
be required by the Plan Commission upon its finding that these are
necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this chapter and so as to
eliminate, alleviate or control the hazard, danger, harm, noxiousness,
offensiveness, nuisance, adversity or inconsistency sought to be
averted. Where studies, environmental assessments or environmental
impact statements are required, the Commission can address problems
called to its attention by the imposition of certain conditions aimed at
eliminating, alleviating or controlling the problems.
B. The following uses are deemed by the Village Board to be hazardous,
dangerous, harmful, noxious, offensive, a nuisance or otherwise
adverse to adjoining or nearby parcels, water, air or the environment or

In cases where any building or structure is or is intended to be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, altered, moved or converted or any building,

Appeals
§ 420-151. Administrative appeals.
Chapter 68, Wis. Stats., Municipal Administrative Procedure, is hereinafter
modified pursuant to the authority granted in § 68.16, Wis. Stats.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to afford a constitutionally
sufficient, fair and orderly administrative procedure and review in
connection with determinations by Village authorities which involve
constitutionally protected rights of specific persons which are entitled
to due process protection under the 14th Amendment to the United
States Constitution.
B. Review of administrative determinations. Any person having a
substantial interest which is adversely affected by an administrative
determination of a governing body, board, commission, committee,
agency, officer or employee of a Village or agent acting on behalf of the
Village as set forth in Subsection C below may have such determination
reviewed as provided in this section. The remedies under this section
shall not be exclusive. A department, board, commission, agency, officer
or employee of the Village who or which is aggrieved may not initiate
review under this section of a determination of any other department,
board, commission, agency, officer or employee of the Village but may
respond or intervene in a review proceeding under this section initiated
by another.
C. Determinations reviewable. The following determinations are
reviewable under this section:
(1) The grant or denial in whole or in part after application of an initial
permit, right, privilege, or authority, with the exception, however,
of the granting or denial of a variance or any other decision of the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
(2) The suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of an existing permit,
right, privilege, or authority
D. Determinations not subject to review. Except as provided in Subsection
C above, the following determinations are not reviewable under this
section:
(1) A legislative enactment. A legislative enactment is an ordinance,
resolution or adopted motion of the Village Board.
(2) Any action subject to administrative or judicial review procedures
under other statutes.
(3) The denial of a tort or contract claim for money, required to be filed
with the Village pursuant to statutory procedures for the filing of
such claims.
§ 420-151 VEHICLES, ALL-TERRAIN § 420-151
344:1307
(4) Judgments and orders of a court.
(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any action or
determination of the Village which does not involve the
constitutionally protected right of a specific person or persons to
due process in connection with the action or determination.
E. Persons aggrieved. A person aggrieved includes any individual,
partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, public
or private organization, officer, department, board, commission or
agency of the Village whose rights, duties or privileges are adversely
affected by a determination made pursuant to this section. No
department, board, commission, agency, officer, or employee of the
Village who or which is aggrieved by an administrative decision may
initiate a review under this section of a determination of any other
department, board, commission, agency, officer or employee of the
Village. However, said department, board, commission, agency, officer
or employee may respond to or intervene in a review proceeding under
this section initiated by another.
F. Written determinations. If a determination subject to this section is
made orally or, if in writing, does not state the reasons therefor, the
Village making such determination shall, upon written request of any
person aggrieved by such determination made within 10 days of notice
of such determination, reduce the determination and the reasons
therefor to writing and mail or deliver such determination and reasons
to the person making the request. The determination shall be dated and
shall advise such person of the right to have such determination
reviewed, the time within which such review may be obtained, and the
office or person to whom a request for review shall be addressed. For
purposes of this section, a Village authority making a determination is
defined to include the Village Board, Village Plan Commission, the
Village Community Development Director and his/her employees or
deputies.
G. Request for review of determination. Any person aggrieved may have a
written or oral determination reviewed by written request mailed or
delivered to the Village authority which made such determination
within 30 days of notice to such person of such determination. The
request for review shall state the basis or grounds upon which the
person aggrieved contends that the decision should be modified or
reversed. A request for review shall be made to the officer, employee,
agent, agency, committee, board, commission or body who or which
made the determination, but failure to make such request to the proper
party shall not preclude the person aggrieved from review unless such
failure has caused prejudice to the Village authority.

device, the expense thereof to be paid by the Village.
J. Final determination.
(1) Within 20 days of completion of the hearing conducted under
Subsection I above and the filing of briefs, if any, the decision
maker shall mail or deliver to the appellant its written
determination stating the reasons therefor. Such determination
shall be a final determination.
(2) A determination following a hearing substantially meeting the
requirements or a decision on review under this section following

(2) If review is sought of a final determination, the record of the
proceedings shall be transcribed at the expense of the person
seeking review. A transcript shall be supplied to anyone requesting
the same at the requester's expense. If the person seeking review
establishes impecuniousness to the satisfaction of the reviewing
court, the court may order the proceedings transcribed at the
expense of the Village, and the person seeking review shall be
furnished a free copy of the transcript. By stipulation, the court
may order a synopsis of the proceedings in lieu of a transcript. The
court may otherwise limit the requirement for a transcript.
L. Legislative review.
(1) The seeking of a review pursuant to the section does not preclude a
person aggrieved from seeking relief from the governing Village
authority.
§ 420-151 PLEASANT PRAIRIE CODE § 420-151
344:1310

under this subsection need not conduct the type of hearing

not supersede contractual provisions for that purpose.

ARTICLE XXII
Planned Development Zoning District
[Added 4-2-2007 by Ord. No. 07-08]
§ 420-153. Planned Development Zoning Districts.
The Village Board reserves the right, from time to time and on a completely
discretionary, case-by-case basis, to create a planned development zoning
district (PDD) which is unique and site-specific for the purpose of
accommodating, facilitating and regulating a particular proposed
development and use project. No specific criteria are set out here to limit
the Village Board's discretion in creating such districts since the nature of
the project characteristics which might give rise to the desirability for a
PDD cannot reasonably be foreseen. Generally, however, the Village Board
will consider a PDD only if a proposed development and use project is
not practicable under the Village's traditional zoning districts; involves
multiple uses; is unusual, large and complex; and is so substantially in the
public interest as to justify extraordinary efforts to accommodate, facilitate
and regulate it. Because the creation of a PDD requires an enormous
commitment of resources by the Village, no person shall have any right to a
PDD classification under any circumstances, and no person shall have any
right to a public hearing on a proposed ordinance to create a PDD, unless
such hearing is specifically approved by the Village Board after a detailed
report on the proposed PDD from the Village staff. Since a PDD cannot be
created by the Village Board unilaterally and must be consented to by the
affected landowner(s), and since the drafting of a proposed PDD ordinance
is necessarily a difficult, time-consuming and cooperative effort, and since
the creation of a PDD will usually require the negotiation and drafting of
a companion development agreement relating to the public and private
infrastructure that is required to serve the proposed development and
use(s), the preparation of a proposed PDD ordinance will generally involve
extensive closed-door discussions and negotiations between members of the
Village staff and the Village attorneys and representatives of the owner(s)
and developer(s) of the land covered by the proposed PDD. The purpose of
such discussions and negotiations shall not be to commit the Village Board
in any way to the proposed ordinance but rather to mutually explore the
needs and desires of the owner(s) and developer(s) and the requirements,
policies and practices of the Village, to attempt to structure a proposed
ordinance that both the Village staff and the owner(s) and developer(s)
can support, to identify potential problems and issues which should be
addressed at a public hearing, and to attempt to work out potential
solutions to any such problems or issues, so that the proposed PDD
regulations and all relevant facts, issues and problems can be presented
meaningfully and efficiently to the Village Plan Commission, the Village
Board and all interested persons at a public hearing.265
