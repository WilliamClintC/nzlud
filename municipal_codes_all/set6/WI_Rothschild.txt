Stats., and information that is not subject to suchdisclosure, the Village shall provide the information that is subject to disclosure and delete theinformation that is not subject to disclosure from the record before release.
The Village shall provide a requestor with facilities comparable to those used by itsemployees to inspect, copy and abstract the record during established office hours. However,the Village is not required to purchase or lease photocopying, duplicating, photographic orother equipment or to provide a separate room for the inspection, copying or abstracting ofrecords.
The Village will impose a fee upon the requester of a copy of a record which may not exceedthe actual, necessary and direct cost of reproduction and transcription of the record, unless afee is otherwise specifically established or authorized to be established by law.

custodian from contacting the record requestor in an attempt to better identify what the personis seeking.
Upon request for any record, a legal custodian shall as soon as practicable and withoutunnecessary delay either fulfill the request or notify the requester of the Village'sdetermination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor.
A requester may be required to show acceptable identification only when the requestedrecord is being kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law orregulations require it. Otherwise, no request may be refused because the person making therequest is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request.
A request may be made orally or in writing and need not be made in person. If a request ismade orally, the Village may deny the request orally unless a demand for a written statementof the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of theoral denial. If the Village denies a written request in whole or in part, the requester shallreceive from the Village a written statement of the reasons for denying the written request.Every written denial of a request by the Village shall inform the requester that if the requestfor the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review by mandamusunder § 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.
No record may be destroyed after the receipt of a request for inspection or copying of therecord until after the request is granted or until at least 60 days after the date that the requestis denied or, if the requester is a committed or incarcerated person, until at least 90 days afterthe date that the request is denied. Upon written notice that an action relating to a record hasbeen commenced under § 19.37, Wis. Stats., the record may not be destroyed until after theorder of the court in relation to such record is issued and the deadline for appealing that orderhas passed, or, if appealed, until after the order of the court hearing the appeal is issued. Ifthe court orders the production of any record and the order is not appealed, the record maynot be destroyed until after the request for inspection or copying is granted.
In limited circumstances a request can experience minor delay in order to properly notify arecord subject pursuant to § 19.356, Wis. Stats.
Limitations on right of access.
Although there is a presumption of access to a record, the legal custodian must also considerwhether there are any explicit rights or prohibitions to access in statute or case law, and finallyby a balancing test weighing possible harm against benefit to the public.
If a record contains both information that may be made public and information that may not bemade public, the custodian shall provide the information that may be made public and redactthe information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodianshall confer with the Village attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow theguidance of the Village attorney when separating out the exempt material. If in the judgmentof the custodian and the Village attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exemptmaterial from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of theexempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.
A requester has a greater right of access than the general public to any personally identifiableinformation pertaining to the individual in a record containing personally identifiableinformation that is maintained by the Village.

§ 357-8. Intent and findings.
The Village Board intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even ifdone within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons civilly responsible whohost events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol,regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The VillageBoard finds that:
Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumedby persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat topublic health requiring prevention or abatement.
Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public,from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related trafficcollisions.
Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those whouse it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.
Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside thepresence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and condone(s)the activity and, in some circumstances, provide(s) the alcohol.
A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person responsible for hosting an event or gatheringwhere underage possession or consumption occurs.

Such premises, asfurther described in §
407-10B
, are deemed chronic nuisance premises and are herebyrecognized as a public nuisance due to the resource drain it causes the community as a whole.This section is enacted to encourage property owners and/or managers to engage in theirresponsibility to ensure that activities occurring on their property conform to the law and do notunduly burden the Village's resources and to provide a mechanism for the Village to take actionagainst property owners who fail to ensure premises they own do not require a disproportionatedevotion of resources to the premises.

§ 535-11. Sewer user charge system.
The Village of Rothschild is a part of and is served by the sewage treatment plant of the RibMountain Metro Sewerage District, which levies charges against the Village of Rothschild forsewage treatment and capital costs. The Rib Mountain Metro will assess the Village of Rothschildfor wastewater treatment based upon the monitoring of wastewater volume, BOD and suspendedsolids at the metering stations serving the Village of Rothschild. The Rib Mountain Metro levies auser charge against the Village of Rothschild to be calculated based on the quantity and quality ofthe wastewater contributed by the Village of Rothschild as determined by the Rib Mountain Metroand on the number of actual users and equivalent meters in service within the boundaries of theVillage of Rothschild as determined by the Rib Mountain Metro.
It shall be the policy of the Village to obtain sufficient revenues to pay the cost of the annual debtretirement payment on any bonded indebtedness, any required cash reserve account payment,and operation and maintenance of the sewage works, including a replacement fund (i.e., a cashaccount to be used for future expenditures for obtaining or installing equipment, accessories orappurtenances which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance of the sewageworks during the service life for which such works were designed and constructed), through asystem of user charges as defined in this section. The system shall assure that each user of thesewage works pays a proportionate share of the cost of such works.
Classification of users. All sewer users shall be classified by the Utility as residential/commercial(domestic strength) or industrial customers.
Monitored users. A monitored user that meters the sewage discharge as required by Article
IV
ofthis chapter shall be subject to the following measurement requirements:
Flow monitoring. Flow shall be recorded for each day a flow occurs.
Concentration monitoring. Three consecutive production day twenty-four-hour compositesamples shall be taken and analyzed each calendar month.
Data collections. All monitored users shall conduct or cause to be conducted all requiredsamplings necessary to provide the Village with the required date for BOD
, suspended solidsand flow. Billing for BOD
and suspended solids may be based on samples or on the latestconcentrations reported to the Department of Natural Resources on NR 101 reporting forms,where no samples are available. The Village may verify the required data.
User reporting. Daily volume recordings and concentration data shall be submitted to theVillage by the 10th of the month following the data collections.
Waste analysis. Monitored waste samples shall be analyzed for BOD
and suspended solidsin accordance with the current edition of Standard Methods.
Strength determination for billing. BOD
and suspended solids shall be determined by takingthe arithmetic average of the BOD and suspended solids concentration proportionate to thetotal quarterly volume to arrive at total pounds. (Average concentration as milligrams per litermultiplied by flow in millions of gallons multiplied by the factor for weight, 8.345 per gallon,equals pounds.)
User charge basis. User charges shall consist of a minimum quarterly billing, on the basis of usercharge factors, and a unit price per volume of water utilized. The minimum quarterly billing shall besufficient to pay any annual debt retirement. A portion of the debt service and reserve account

may be budgeted by levying an ad valorem tax in accordance with state statutes. The unit priceper volume shall be sufficient to pay the annual cost of operation and maintenance, including anyreplacement fund, of the sewage works. Water meter readings shall be used to determine theactual water volume used. Users will be notified annually of the portion of user charges or advalorem taxes attributable to wastewater treatment services. If a portion of the water furnished toany customer is not discharged into the sewer system, the quantity of such water will be deductedin computing the charge for sewer service, provided that a meter has been installed to measuresuch water. The customer must at his own expense make necessary changes in the water pipingand install couplings so that a meter can be set. A charge for the actual costs of providing a metershall be paid by the customer.
Review of rates. The user charges, and this section, shall be reviewed not less than biannually.Such review shall be performed by the Village Board and the Village Treasurer. User charges shallbe adjusted, as required, to reflect actual volumes of water used and actual costs.
Use of average water volume. Where it is not possible to obtain a water meter reading, or in caseswhere no water meter exists, the customer shall be assigned an average water volume by theVillage, based on previous meter readings, and this shall be so stated on the bill. The differenceshall be adjusted when the meter is again read.
Sewer rates. There shall be charged to each user of the sewer system a sewer charge accordingto the methodology and amount as set forth in

Sewer billing procedure.
Quarterly billing. Bills for sewer service are rendered quarterly for service to the end of March,June, September and December. The billing procedure, late payment penalty charges andenforcement of collection of sewer bills shall be the same as for water bills as set forth in§
535-3F
which is adopted by reference and is hereby made a part of this section.
Residential quarterly billing. Residential billings for each of the quarters of April through Juneand July through September shall be based on 125% of the winter quarter of January throughMarch. If the volume of the April through June quarter or the July through September quarteris less than 125% of the winter quarter, the billing shall be based on actual volume. All otherquarters shall be based on actual volume. Where a water meter is disconnected during thewinter quarter, or the winter quarter consumption is not representative usage for a full winterquarter (this may be the result of inaccurate readings, vacancy, extended winter vacations,etc.), the winter quarter consumption shall be adjusted. This adjustment will be based on thepreceding quarter's usage, general overall usage, and/or based on a per capita consumptionof 5,900 gallons per person, per quarter. If a new account is established and a full winterquarter has not been recorded, the actual volume shall be used until a winter quarter occurs.

Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate theactivity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
Title. This Chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the Village ofRothschild, Marathon County, Wisconsin.
General provisions.
Areas to be regulated. This Chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regionalflood or base flood as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other mapsapproved by WDNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the FloodInsurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Otherregulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may bederived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictiveinformation shall apply.
Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all Floodplain Districts are designated as A,AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below.Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of thefloodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must bereviewed and approved by the WDNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process(see §
572-8
, Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA mapsshall be effective until approved by the WDNR. These maps and revisions are on file in theoffice of the Department of Public Works, Village of Rothschild. If more than one map orrevision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
Official maps based on the FIS:
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 55073C0411F dated July 22,2010, with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)dated September 28, 2018, volume 55073CV000B.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55073C0392G, 55073C0394G,55073C0411G, 55073C0413G dated September 28, 2018, with correspondingprofiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 28,2018, volume 55073CV000B.
Official maps based on other studies:

Rothschild DAMBRK Study dated December 26, 1990.
U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.
Approved by WDNR on August 13, 1991.
Profile is "DAMBRK without failure water surface elevation."
Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided intothree districts as follows:
The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of thefloodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and arecontained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM.
The Flood-Fringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and thefloodway and displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwaterduring the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined,

including A, AH and AO Zones on the FIRM.
Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplainzoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection
E(4)(a)
or
(b)
below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to§
572-8
, Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from aprofile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment isrequired. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actualpredevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary wasdetermined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputesbetween the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall besettled according to §
572-7C(3)
and the criteria in Subsection
E(4)(a)
and
(b)
below. Wherethe flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA mustapprove any map amendment or revision pursuant to §
572-8
, Amendments.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the districtboundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are anydiscrepancies.
Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall bedetermined by the map scale.
Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter shall not begrounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above theregional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and themap is amended pursuant to §
572-8
, Amendments.
Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this Chapter shall be incompliance with the terms of this Chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federalregulations.
Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities,villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this Chapter and obtain allnecessary permits.

Stats., applies.The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges bythe Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies.
Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This Chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enactedpursuant to §§ 62.23, 61.35 and/or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. A morerestrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greaterrestrictions, but not otherwise.
This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions,covenants or easements. If this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions ofthis Chapter shall prevail.
Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter are theminimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the Village and are not a limitation on orrepeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.

Hydraulic modeling. The regional flood elevation shall be based on thestandards in Ch. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Adm. Code, Hydraulic Analysis:Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the following:
Determination of the required limits of the hydraulic model shall be basedon detailed study information for downstream structures (dam, bridge,culvert) to determine adequate starting WSEL for the study.
Channel sections must be surveyed.
Minimum four-foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used for thedevelopment of cross-section overbank and floodplain mapping.
A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is allowed indeveloped areas with additional intermediate cross sections required attransitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel ateach location.
The most current version of HEC-RAS shall be used.
A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required ateach structure.
Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstreamlimits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediatelocations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet.
Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigningparameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values,expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The basemodel shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high-water marks todetermine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data isavailable, adequate justification shall be provided for any parametersoutside standard accepted engineering practices.
The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in theexisting and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existingstudies. The height difference between the proposed flood profile and theexisting study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 foot.
Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided, showing all crosssection locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best available topographicdata, geographic limits of the proposed development and whether the proposeddevelopment is located in the floodway.
If the proposed development is located outside of the floodway, then it isdetermined to have no impact on the regional flood elevation.
If any part of the proposed development is in the floodway, it must be addedto the base model to show the difference between existing and proposedconditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients remain the same asin the existing model, unless adequate justification based on standardaccepted engineering practices is provided.
Zone AE Floodplains.
Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the existing study, theappropriate method to be used shall be based on Ch. NR 116.07(3), Wis. Adm.Code, Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Discharge.

Hydraulic model. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards inCh. NR 116.07(4), Wis. Adm. Code, Hydraulic Analysis: Determination ofRegional Flood Elevation and the following:
Duplicate effective model. The effective model shall be reproduced toensure correct transference of the model data and to allow integration ofthe revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream anddownstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model isavailable, models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and theelevations shown in the floodway data table in the FIS report to within 0.1foot.
Corrected effective model. The corrected effective model shall not includeany man-made physical changes since the effective model date but shallimport the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for Departmentreview.
Existing (pre-project conditions) model. The existing model shall berequired to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the projectassociated with the revised (post-project) model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model.
Revised (post-project conditions) model. The revised (post-projectconditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any proposedchanges to the topography caused by the proposed development. Thismodel shall reflect proposed conditions.
All changes to the duplicate effective model and subsequent models mustbe supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans,construction plans and survey notes.
Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach forwhich the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream anddownstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the effectivemodel and result in water surface elevations and topwidths computed bythe revised models matching those in the effective models upstream anddownstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall notbe truncated.
Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to theDepartment for review which meet the following conditions:
Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the revised floodplainand floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles, topographic workmap, annotated FIRMs and/or flood boundary floodway maps (FBFMs),construction plans, bridge plans.

§ 584-1. Statutory authorization.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 61.35 and 61.351, Wis. Stats., for villagesor §§ 62.23 and 62.231, Wis. Stats., for cities and §§ 87.30 and 281.31, Wis. Stats.
§ 584-2. Findings of fact and purpose.
Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipalitywould adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the taxbase. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to:
Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare;
Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands;
Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments,nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters;
Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands andother aquatic habitat;
Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and
Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover andcontrolling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earthmoving activities.
§ 584-3. Compliance required.
The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the municipality shallbe in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state or federalregulations. (However, see §
584-12

Wisconsin's Supreme Court has declared navigable bodies of water that have a beddifferentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow sufficient to support navigation bya recreational craft of the shallowest draft on an annually recurring basis [Muench v.Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952) and DeGaynor and Co., Inc., v.Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975)]. For example, a stream whichis navigable by skiff or canoe during normal spring high water is navigable, in fact, underthe laws of this state though it may be dry during other seasons.
ORDINARY HIGH-WATER MARK
The point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water are socontinuous as to leave a distinctive mark, such as by erosion, destruction or prevention ofterrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognizedcharacteristic.
PLANNING AGENCY
The Municipal Plan Commission created under § 62.23(1), Wis. Stats., a board of public landcommissioners or a committee of the municipality's governing body which acts on matterspertaining to planning and zoning.
SHORELANDS
Lands within the following distances from the ordinary high-water mark of navigable waters:1,000 feet from a lake, pond or flowage and 300 feet from a river or stream or to the landwardside of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater.

§ 590-33. Nonmetallic Mine Reclamation Overlay District.
Intent. The Village has historically not permitted nonmetallic mining areas in the Village. Growth ofthe Village has brought in properties that are or had been used for nonmetallic mining. So thatsuch uses would not be uncontrolled the Village created Chapter
388
, Mining, Nonmetallic, of theVillage Code licensing nonmetallic mining and site reclamation for regulating and, moreimportantly, encouraging and mandating reclamation of these sites. However, nonmetallic minesite reclamation was heretofore not an explicitly permitted use in the Village or the towns fromwhich annexations occurred. This section is intended to create a district in which miningreclamation can be permitted in accordance with Chapter
388
of this Code.
Permitted uses subject to licensing pursuant to Chapter
388
of this Code.
Restoration, reclamation or filling of existing or unreclaimed nonmetallic mining sites.
Accessory uses, such as office, machine storage, stockpiling of fill and soil covering material.
Definitions. The terms "nonmetallic mining," "nonmetallic mining operation," "nonmetallic miningsite," "site" and "reclamation" shall have the meaning assigned them in § 66.038(1), Wis. Stats.

Article IV. Stormwater Management and Erosion Control
[Amended
7-12-2010
]
§ 590-42. Declaration of findings.
The Village Board of the Village of Rothschild finds that uncontrolled post-construction runoff has asignificant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the communityand diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled erosionand post-construction runoff can:
Degrade physical stream, lake, and river habitat by increasing bank erosion, increasingstreambed, lake bed, and riverbed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing streambase flows and increasing water temperatures.
Diminish the capacity of lakes, streams, and rivers to support fish, aquatic life, and recreationaland water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients,heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants.
Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads.
Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers,drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities.
Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks andvolumes.
Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding.
§ 590-43. Intent.
The intent of this article is to reduce the amount of erosion and post-construction stormwater andassociated pollutants reaching waters of the state. Use of this article by municipalities will foster theconsistent statewide application of post-construction performance standards for new development andredevelopment contained in Subchapters III and IV of Ch. NR 151, Wis. Adm. Code.
§ 590-44. General provisions.
Authority.
This article is adopted by the Village Board under the authority granted by § 61.354, Wis.Stats. This article supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under§ 61.35, Wis. Stats., that relate to stormwater management regulations. Except as otherwisespecified in § 61.354, Wis. Stats., § 61.35, Wis. Stats., applies to this article and to anyamendments to this article.

The provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of theVillage.
The Village of Rothschild Board hereby designates the Administrator of Public Works, or hisdesignee, to administer and enforce the provisions of this article.
The requirements of this article do not preempt more stringent stormwater managementrequirements that may be imposed by any of the following:
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules, permits or approvals,including those authorized under §§ 281.16 and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
Targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resources under § NR 151.004, Wis. Adm. Code.
Purpose and intent.
Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish site construction erosion controland long-term post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish thethreats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to:
Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion;prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life;control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover andscenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth.
Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving waterbodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring andtransportation of particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstreamproperty.
Intent. It is the intent of the Village of Rothschild Board that this article regulate post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This article may be applied on asite-by-site basis. The Village of Rothschild Board recognizes, however, that the preferredmethod of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is throughthe preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwatermanagement plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal andregional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems,any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge towaters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standardsdeveloped under § 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional stormwater management measures andhave been approved by the Village Board, it is the intent of this article that the approved planbe used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.

The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review commercial and industrial site plans andconditional use applications, as well as all other applications set forth in §
590-108A
. The review willinclude existing and proposed structures, neighboring uses, utilization of landscaping and open space,parking areas, driveway locations, loading and unloading (in the case of commercial and industrialuses), highway access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, sewerage and water systems, andthe proposed operation. The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve said site plans only afterconsidering the following:
The proposed use(s) conform(s) to the uses permitted in that zoning district.
The dimensional arrangement of buildings and structures conforms to the required area, yard,setback, and height restrictions of this chapter.
The proposed use conforms to all use and design provisions and requirements (if any) as found inthis chapter for the specified uses.
There is a proper relationship between the existing and proposed streets and highways within thevicinity of the project in order to assure the safety and convenience of pedestrian and vehiculartraffic.
The proposed on-site buildings, structures, and entryways are situated and designed to minimizeadverse effects upon owners and occupants of adjacent and surrounding properties by providingfor adequate design of ingress/egress, interior/exterior traffic flow, stormwater drainage, erosion,grading, lighting, and parking, as specified by this chapter or any other codes or laws.
Natural features of the landscape are retained where they can enhance the development on thesite, or where they furnish a barrier or buffer between the project and adjoining properties used fordissimilar purposes, or where they assist in preserving the general safety, health, welfare, andappearance of the neighborhood.
Adverse effects of the proposed development and activities upon adjoining residents or ownersare minimized by appropriate screening, fencing, or landscaping, as provided or required in thischapter.
Land, buildings, and structures are readily accessible to emergency vehicles and disabledpersons.
The site plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter, which are to promote thepublic health, safety, and general welfare, to encourage the use of lands in accordance with theircharacter and adaptability, to avoid the overcrowding of population, to lessen congestion on thepublic roads and streets, to reduce hazards to life and property, and to facilitate existingcommunity development plans.
The site plan is consistent with the public goals, objectives, principles, standards, policies, andurban design criteria set forth in the Village's Master Plan or components thereof.
§ 590-118. Architectural review standards.
The following architectural review principles, criteria, and review guidelines are established forcommercial, industrial and multifamily sites:

Building scale and mass. The relative proportion of a building to its neighboring buildings shall bemaintained or enhanced when new buildings are built or when existing buildings are remodeled oraltered.
Building rooflines and roof shapes. Pitched roofs such as hip, gable, etc., shall be utilized whenappropriate. The visual continuity of roofs and their contributing elements (parapet walls, coping,cornices, etc.) shall be maintained in building development or redevelopment. Shingles shall bemade of cedar or asphalt.
Materials.
[Amended
8-16-2010
]
Material selection for architectural design shall be based upon the prevailing material alreadyused on existing buildings in the area. No building shall be permitted where any exposedfacade is constructed or faced with a finished material which is aesthetically incompatible withother commercial, industrial, and multifamily (R-5 and R-6) building facades in the area andwhich presents an unattractive appearance to the public and surrounding properties.
Metal buildings shall be limited to the commercial and industrial districts. All approved metalbuildings shall have front facades constructed of nonmetal materials (masonry, wood, etc.).The remaining facades must have a minimum four-foot-high side wall of nonmetal materials.
Exterior insulating finishing systems (EFIS) (i.e., "Dryvit," "Sto," "cement board," etc.) arepermitted as an accent material only and will not be permitted as the predominant exteriormaterial on any facade without the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The useof EIFS as an accent material should incorporate the use of color, detail, pattern, and textureto take advantage of the design flexibility it affords. EIFS can be used on canopies, spandrels,fascias, soffits, accent bands and trim.
In the I-1 and I-2 zoning classifications, the sides and rear of all industrial buildings shall befinished in an attractive manner in keeping with the accepted standards used for industrialbuildings, subject to the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Buildings must beof approved construction in conformity with all applicable building codes.
Unfaced concrete block and structural concrete may be permitted in I-1 and I-2 ZoningDistricts upon approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Pole buildings shall not bepermitted as a principal structure in any way.
Exterior wall coverage may, upon approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission andthe Village Board, be exempt from Subsection
C(2)
when the building placement is obscuredfrom view from all sides due to existing buildings on the site consistent with compatible uses,or a one-hundred-percent landscape screen at a minimum height of six feet therebyobstructing the lines of sight of the building, or when the structure is located in an interior lotaway from intersecting public streets and lines of sight consistent with compatible uses.
Colors. Since the selection of building colors has a significant aesthetic and visual impact upon thepublic and neighboring properties, color shall be selected in general harmony with the existingneighborhood buildings, subject to approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Colors shallbe nonfluorescent. Earth tones such as grays, browns, greens, burgundies, and tans are required.However, all proposed color schemes shall be reviewed on their individual merit based uponbuilding design, building materials, longevity of the color choice(s) (fad/nonfad), statement inrelation to overall theme, character and color of adjacent structures, and unity with existingstructures on the project site.
Building location. No building shall be permitted to be sited in a manner which wouldunnecessarily destroy or substantially damage the beauty of the area, particularly insofar as itwould adversely affect values incident to ownership of land in the area, or which would

The Village may require the subdivider to install streetlamps along streets proposedto be dedicated within platted subdivisions in accordance with design, quality, and/or energyefficiency standards approved by the Village Board and deemed to be compatible with theneighborhood. Such lamps shall be placed at each street intersection and at such interior blockspacing as may be required by the Village.
Street name signs. The Village may require the subdivider to install at the intersection of all streetsproposed to be dedicated within platted subdivisions a street name sign of a design specified orapproved by the Village.
Stormwater management. The subdivider shall construct stormwater management facilities whichare adequate to serve the subdivision and which do not adversely affect adjacent lands outside ofthe subdivision.
The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater shall be required for all subdivisionsor as required by the Village. The controlled release of stormwater runoff from alldevelopment described above shall not exceed the peak discharge of stormwater runoff asoccurring under the predevelopment conditions of the parcel, based upon a ten-year stormevent. Where site detention is required for runoff control, the detention facilities shall safelypass the runoff of a one-hundred-year storm through an emergency outlet.
In the event that the developer chooses to release more runoff than would occur under thepredevelopment conditions, he/she will be required to provide adequate outlet facilitiesdownstream to accommodate the increased rate of runoff. The specifications to be used indesigning these facilities and computing runoff shall be based upon the standards of theUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Conservation Service, or an alternatemethod as may be approved by the Village.
Erosion control facilities. Erosion control shall be required for all subdivisions or as required by theVillage. The planning process, specifications and construction techniques will be done inaccordance with specifications as stipulated by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.Erosion control plans shall consist of the detailed soil survey map of the area indicating the sitelocation as well as adjacent properties and the identification of any structures or natural featureson the land adjacent to and within 250 feet of the site. The plan shall include a boundary linesurvey of the site, a location and description of the soil types which have been rated severe forerosion limitations by the USDA Soil Conservation Service and the elevation, dimension, locationand extent of all proposed grading. It shall include the location and identification of any proposedadditional structures or development on the site. It shall include plans for and specifications ofdrainage provisions, retaining walls, cribbing, planting, anti-erosion devices or other protectivedevices, whether temporary or permanent, to be constructed in connection with or as a part of theproposed work, together with a map showing the drainage area of the land tributary to the site,upstream culverts and other restrictions which may control the quantity and rate of runoff and astatement explaining the estimated runoff used to determine the design characteristics of anydrainage device. Upstream drainage shall be considered and explained if any adverse effect ispossible. Plans for removal, recontouring or other final disposition of sediment basins or otherstructural improvements or devices shall be included in the plan.
Factors which will be considered in reviewing land suitability and erosion control plans shallrelate to the specific site conditions. The plan should reduce land grading and keep land

disturbance to a minimum. Both surface runoff and stormwater drainage systems should beintegrated to accommodate the increased runoff incurred during land grading. Existingtemporary and future protective vegetation should be emphasized. The plan shall coordinategrading operation and sedimentation control measures so as to minimize land exposure toerosion to the briefest time. Sediment basins below high sediment producing areas should beplanned, installed and maintained as safety devices to catch and trap excessive sedimentfrom the development site. The plan should utilize available technologies to keep soil erosionto a minimum level.
The preparation of surface water, erosion and sediment control plans shall be undertaken bya qualified individual and shall be submitted to the Village Clerk. The Village Clerk shalltransmit those plans to the Village planning or engineering consultant or Village staff whoshall review and then transmit that information for review and recommendation by thePlanning and Zoning Commission for action by the Village Board.
