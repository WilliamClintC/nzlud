with all costs, surcharges, penalty assessments, and any other taxable item of cost as

provision of this Code, and, in default of payment of such forfeiture and costs of prosecution,
shall be imprisoned in the county jail until such forfeiture and costs are paid, but not

action to prevent or remove a violation of any provision of this Code.
Other remedies.
The City shall have any and all other remedies afforded by the Wisconsin Statutes in addition
to the forfeitures and costs of prosecution above.
Execution or assessment against defendant's property. Whenever any person fails to pay a
forfeiture and costs of prosecution upon the order of any court for violation of any ordinance of
the City, the court may, in lieu of ordering imprisonment of the defendant, or after the
defendant has been released from custody, issue an execution against the property of the
defendant for said forfeiture and costs. In the alternative, upon authorization of the court
imposing any such forfeiture and costs, such sum as remains unpaid shall be assessed
against any real property owned by the defendant within the City and shall be added to the
City's portion of the property tax liability.
In addition to any forfeiture imposed under this section or any other penalty section of the
Code of Ordinances of the City of Brodhead, the City may institute an action or proceeding to
enjoin any violation, and such violation or any nonpayment of any forfeiture and costs shall
constitute the basis for revocation or denial of any and all licenses and permits wherein the
City is the issuing authority.
Upon stipulation of the parties, and subject to the approval of the court upon a finding that
such stipulation is in the public interest and serves the interests of justice, the court may
impose terms not to exceed $250 against a defendant upon dismissal of the action. The Clerk
of Municipal Court shall, within seven days of receipt thereof, transfer such sum to the City
Clerk-Treasurer for deposit in the general fund.
Time to pay. Any forfeiture and costs imposed as a penalty pursuant to this section or any penalty
provisions of this Code shall be payable forthwith if so ordered by the court; however, the court
may, in its discretion, allow reasonable time for payment, or reasonable payment plans,
considering the defendant's ability to pay, and the court shall allow any time for payment or
payment plan as provided for by any state law applicable at the time of imposition of the forfeiture.

§ 45-7. National Incident Management System.

governments to work together more effectively and efficiently to prevent, prepare for, respond to
and recover from domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size or complexity;
To facilitate the most efficient and effective incident management, it is critical that federal, state,
local, and tribal organizations utilize standardized terminology, standardized organizational
structures, interoperable communications, consolidated action plans, unified command structures,
uniform personnel qualification standards, uniform standards for planning, training, and exercising,
comprehensive resource management, and designated incident facilities during emergencies or
disasters;
The Common Council establishes the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as the City
standard for incident management, which will standardize procedures for managing personnel,
communications, facilities and resources along with improving the City's ability to utilize federal
funding to enhance local readiness, maintain first responder safety, and streamline incident
management processes.[1]

§ 50-1. Findings; purpose.
The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be
independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be
made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal
gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these
goals, there is hereby established in this chapter a Code of Ethics for all City of Brodhead officials
and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards,
committees and commissions of the City, as well as any individuals who are candidates for
elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination papers with the City.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such
officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best
interests of the City of Brodhead and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of
private financial or other interests in matters affecting the City. The Common Council believes that
a Code of Ethics for the guidance of elected and appointed officials and employees will help them
avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their public responsibilities, will improve
standards of public service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the
citizens of this City in their elected and appointed officials and employees. The Common Council
hereby reaffirms that each elected and appointed City official and employee holds his or her
position as a public trust, and any intentional effort to realize substantial personal gain through
official conduct is a violation of that trust. The provisions and purpose of this chapter and such
rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best interests of the
City of Brodhead.
§ 50-2. Definitions.
The following definitions shall be applicable in this chapter:
ANYTHING OF VALUE

fees and honorariums, or the exchange of seasonal, anniversary or customary gifts among

officer or employee or to any person employing or retaining the services of the officer or
employee.

Disclosure of confidential information. No official or employee shall, without proper legal
authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs of
the City, nor shall such information be used to advance the financial or other private interests of
the official or employee or others.
Gifts and favors.
No official or employee, personally or through a member of his/her immediate family, may
solicit or accept, either directly or indirectly, from any person or organization money or
anything of value if it could be expected to influence the employee's official actions or
judgments or be considered a reward for any action or inaction on the part of the official or
employee.
No official or employee, personally or through a member of his/her immediate family, shall
accept any gift, whether in the form of money, service, loan, thing or promise, from any
person which could reasonably be expected to impair his/her independence of judgment or
action in the performance of his/her duties or grant in the discharge of his/her duties any
improper favor, service or thing of value. However, it is not a conflict of interest for any public
official or employee to receive hospitality that is unsolicited and unrelated to government
business, such as a meal, and that is not intended to influence the official.
An official or employee is not to accept hospitality if, after consideration of the surrounding
circumstances, it could reasonably be concluded that such hospitality would not be extended
were it not for the fact that the guest, or a member of the guest's immediate family, was a City
official or employee. Participation in celebrations, grand openings, open houses, informational
meetings and similar events are excluded from this prohibition. This paragraph further shall
not be construed to prevent candidates for elective office from accepting hospitality, as a
properly reported political contribution, from citizens for the purpose of supporting the
candidate's campaign. (The State Ethics Board has interpreted "hospitality" as it applies to
state officials as including meals, beverages and lodging which a person offers at his/her
residence and would have been offered if the recipient was not an official.)
Gifts received by an official or employee or his/her immediate family under unusual
circumstances shall be referred to the Common Council within 10 days of receipt for
recommended disposition. Any person subject to this chapter who becomes aware that
he/she is or has been offered any gift, the acceptance of which would constitute a violation of
this subsection, shall, within 10 days, disclose the details surrounding said offer to the
Common Council. Failure to comply with this reporting requirement shall constitute an offense
under this chapter.
Representing private interests before City agencies or courts.
Nonelected City officials and employees shall not appear on behalf of any private person
(other than himself or herself, his or her spouse or juvenile children) before any City agency,
board, commission or the Common Council if the official or employee or any agency, board,
commission or committee of which the official or employee is a member has any jurisdiction,
discretion or control over the matter which is the subject of such representation.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Elected City officials may appear before City agencies on behalf of constituents in the course
of their duties as representatives of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic
obligations. However, the disclosure requirements of Subsection A above shall be applicable
to such appearances.
Ad hoc committee exceptions. No violation of the conflict of interest restrictions of this section shall
exist, however, where an individual serves on a special ad hoc committee charged with the narrow
responsibility of addressing a specific issue or topic in which that individual, or the employer or a

client of that individual, has an interest so long as the individual discloses to the Common Council
that such interest exists.
Contracts with the City. No City official or employee who, in his/her capacity as such officer or
employee, participates in the making of a contract in which he/she has a private pecuniary
interest, direct or indirect, or performs in regard to that contract with some function requiring the
exercise of discretion on his/her part shall enter into any contract with the City, unless, within the
confines of § 946.13, Wis. Stats., the contract is awarded through a process of public notice and
competitive bidding or the Common Council waives the requirement of this section after
determining that it is in the best interest of the City to do so. The provisions of this subsection shall
not apply to the designation of a public depository of public funds.
Campaign contributions. Campaign contributions shall be reported by all candidates for City office
in strict conformity with the provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes. Any campaign contribution
tendered to or accepted by a candidate subsequent to the final statutory report shall be reported to
the Common Council.
§ 50-8. Advisory opinions.
When an official or employee has doubt as to the applicability of a provision of this chapter to a
particular situation or definition of terms used in this chapter, he/she should apply to the City Attorney
for an advisory opinion and will be guided by that opinion when given. The official or employee shall
have the opportunity to present his/her interpretation of the facts at issue and of the applicability of
provisions of this chapter before such advisory decision is made. This chapter shall be operative in all
instances covered by its provisions except when superseded by an applicable statutory provision and
statutory action is mandatory, or when the application of a statutory provision is discretionary, but
determined by the City Attorney to be more appropriate or desirable. Advisory requests and opinions
shall be kept confidential, except when disclosure is authorized by the requestor, in which case the
request and opinion may be made public.
§ 50-9. Hiring relatives.
This section governs the proposed hiring of individuals for full-time or part-time work as City
employees who are members of the immediate family of City employees or elected officials.
"Immediate family" includes those relatives by blood or marriage defined in § 50-2 as personal
interests.
Hiring an immediate family member of any current City employee or elected City official will be
considered only if that individual has the knowledge and skills, experience or other job-related
qualifications that warrant consideration for the position. A person cannot be hired for either fulltime
or part-time employment in a position immediately supervised by a member of that person's
immediate family.
This section does not apply to nonelected officials who are asked to accept appointment as
members of a City board, commission or committee; nonelected officials, however, will be
expected to disqualify themselves from participation in matters under consideration which may
affect the hiring, retention, classification or compensation of their immediate family if currently
employed or being considered for employment by the City.
§ 50-10. Employees covered by collective bargaining
agreements.

In the event an employee, covered under a collective bargaining agreement, is allegedly involved in an
Ethics Code violation, the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable collective bargaining
agreement shall prevail in the administration and interpretation of this chapter.
§ 50-11. Outside employment.
No full-time officer or employee of the City shall engage in any other remunerative employment in or
out of the City, provided that the Common Council may approve such outside employment or activity if
it finds that it does not interfere or conflict with such officer's ability to perform his/her duties in an
efficient and unbiased manner. Violation of this provision shall be grounds for removal from office of
any such officer or employee.
§ 50-12. Sanctions.
A determination that a public official's or public employee's actions constitute improper conduct
under the provisions of this chapter may constitute a cause for removal from office, termination of
employment, suspension, reprimand, removal from committee assignment, or other appropriate
disciplinary action. As an alternative or in addition to sanctions imposed herein, any individual
violating the Ethics Code shall be subject to a nonreimbursable forfeiture of not less than $100 nor
more than $1,000, as determined by the City of Brodhead Common Council.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).

Amount to become lien; disputed charges.
If the amount determined to be due to the City is not paid by November 15, then this amount
shall become a lien upon the real estate served by the services referred to in Subsection B(1)

of arrears in payment were given as above specified and which arrears still remain unpaid,
and stating the amount of such arrears, together with the added penalty thereon as herein
provided. Each such delinquent amount, including such penalty, shall thereupon become a
lien upon the lot or parcel of real estate to which the water or electric service was furnished
and payment for which is delinquent, and the Clerk-Treasurer shall insert the same as a tax
against such lot or parcel of real estate. All proceedings in relation to the collection of general
property taxes and to the return and sale of property for delinquent taxes shall apply to said
tax if the same is not paid within the time required by law for payment of taxes upon real
estate.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
The owner or occupant may, within 10 days of the date such notice is sent, request a hearing
relating to any charge disputed. Such a request for hearing shall be in writing and shall be
filed with the City Clerk-Treasurer. No such charge shall be placed upon the tax roll if a
properly filed request for hearing is pending until such time as a decision from the hearing is
rendered. All hearings shall be held by the City of Brodhead Water and Light Commission
within 30 days of the request.[3]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).

Article II. Special Assessments and Charges
[Adopted as Title 3, Ch. 2, of the 1997 Code]
§ 58-21. Authority to levy and collect special assessments.
The City of Brodhead, by resolution of its Common Council, may levy and collect special
assessments upon property in a limited and determinable area for special benefits conferred upon
such property by any municipal work or improvement and may provide for the payment of all or
any part of the cost of the work or improvement out of the proceeds of the special assessments. In
addition to other methods approved by law, special assessments for any public work or
improvement or any special charge for current services may be levied in accordance with the
provisions of this article.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
The amount assessed against any property for any work or improvement which does not
represent an exercise of the police power shall not exceed the value of the benefits accruing to the
property therefrom, and for those representing an exercise of the police power, the assessment
shall be upon a reasonable basis as determined by the Common Council.
The favored procedure in the City for proceeding with making specially assessable public
improvements as generally set forth in this article is not intended in any way to disregard or to bar
proceeding under other methods provided by law for making of public improvements and for the
levying of assessments therefor. Nor is this article intended to be an exhaustive, detailed
recodification of the state law under said statutory section. Detailed requirements still require
reference to said statutory section and the subsections thereunder. The purpose hereof is to
generally define and establish local procedures.
§ 58-22. Procedural requirements.
Public improvements carried out pursuant to § 66.0703, Wis. Stats., and this article shall be
initiated by a preliminary resolution presented to the Council by the City Engineer, which resolution
shall declare the Council's intention to exercise its assessment powers for such municipal
purpose(s), describe the same, the limits of the proposed assessment district, the number of
installments in which special assessment may be paid or that the number of installments will be
determined at hearing thereon, and direct the City Engineer to make a report thereon. After
adoption of such preliminary resolution by the Common Council, copies thereof shall be forwarded
by the City Clerk-Treasurer to the City Engineer. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall forthwith, after
adoption of such preliminary resolution, obtain a list of the names and addresses of all interested
persons, if with reasonable diligence their names and addresses may be obtained, and forward
the same to the City Engineer. Upon receipt of copy of such preliminary resolution, the City
Engineer shall prepare the report thereon.
The report required by Subsection A shall consist of:
Preliminary or final plans and specifications.
An estimate of the entire cost of the proposed work or improvement.
An estimate, as to each parcel of property affected, of:
The assessment of benefits to be levied.
The damages to be awarded for property taken or damages.

A.
The net amount of such benefits over damages or the net amount of such damages over
benefits.
A statement that the property against which the assessments are proposed is benefited,
where the work or improvements constitute an exercise of the police power. In such case, the
estimates required under Subsection B(3) shall be replaced by a schedule of the proposed
assessments.
A copy of the report when completed shall be filed with the City Clerk-Treasurer for public
inspection.
When the Common Council determines by resolution that the hearing on the assessments be held
subsequent to the completion of the work or improvement or rendering of the service, the report
required by § 66.0703(3), Wis. Stats., and Subsections A and B above still contain a statement of
the final cost of the work, service or improvement in lieu of an estimate of the cost.
§ 58-23. Costs to be paid by special assessment.
The cost of any work or improvement to be paid in whole or in part by special assessment on property
may include the direct and indirect cost thereof, the damages occasioned thereby, the interest on
bonds or notes issued in anticipation of the collection of the assessments, a reasonable charge for the
services of the administrative staff of the City and the cost of any architectural, engineering and legal
services, and any other item of direct or indirect cost which may reasonably be attributed to the
proposed work or improvement. The amount to be assessed against all property for any such
proposed work or improvement shall be apportioned among the individual parcels in the manner
designated by the Common Council.
§ 58-24. Exemptions; deductions.
If any property deemed benefited shall by reason of any provision of law be exempt from
assessment therefor, such assessment shall be computed and shall be paid by the City.
A parcel of land against which has been levied a special assessment for the sanitary sewer or
water main laid in one of the streets upon which it abuts shall be entitled to such deduction or
exemption as the Common Council determines to be reasonable and just under the circumstances
of each case when a special assessment is levied for the sanitary sewer or water main laid in the
other street upon which such corner lot abuts. Under any circumstances, the assessment will not
be less than the long way of such lot. The Common Council may allow a similar deduction or
exemption from special assessments levied for any other public improvement.
§ 58-25. Notice of proposed or approved project.
Notice requirements. On the completion and filing of the report and final resolution with the City
Clerk-Treasurer required in § 58-22B(5) of this article, the City Clerk-Treasurer or City Engineer
shall prepare a notice of hearing, which notice shall comply with § 66.0703(7), Wis. Stats., and
state the nature of the proposed or approved work or improvement, the general boundary lines of
the proposed assessment district and the place and time at which the report may be inspected. In
publishing the notice of hearing, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall set the place and time at which all
interested persons, their agents or attorneys may appear before the Common Council or
committee thereof and be heard concerning the matters contained in the preliminary resolution
and report. The notice shall be published as a Class 1 notice, under Ch. 985, Wis. Stats., in the
City, and a copy of the notice shall be mailed, at least 10 days before the hearing or proceeding, to
every interested person whose post office address is known, or can be ascertained with

reasonable diligence. The hearing shall commence not less than 10 days and not more than 40
days after the publication or mailing of said notice.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Waiver of notice, assessments under. The Council may, without any notice of hearing, levy and
assess the whole or any part of the cost of any municipal work or whole or any part of the cost of
any municipal work or improvement as a special assessment upon the property specifically
benefited thereby whenever notice and hearing thereon is in writing waived by all the owners of
property affected by such special assessment. In such cases, the procedure shall be the same as
hereinbefore provided excepting for the noticing and holding of public hearing thereon.
§ 58-26. Council actions after hearing.
After the hearing, the Common Council may:
Approve, disapprove, modify or re-refer the report to the City Engineer, with such directions
as it deems necessary to change the plans and specifications as to accomplish a fair and
equitable assessment.
Continue the public hearing, preliminarily approve plans and specifications and, if the project
requires advertising for bids, authorize and direct the advertisement therefor with a date
certain for consideration and taking action thereon, inclusive of action on said report and
action on final resolution.
If an assessment be made against any property and an award of compensation or damage be
made in favor of the property, the Common Council shall assess only the difference between such
assessment of benefits and the award of compensation or damage.
Approval of work.
If the work or improvement has not been previously authorized or approved, the Common
Council shall approve the work or improvement and, by resolution, direct that the same be
done and paid for in accordance with the report finally approved.
If the work or improvement has been approved by the Common Council or work commenced
or completed prior to the filing of the report or prior to the hearing, then the Common Council
shall, by resolution, confirm the report as made or modified and provide for payment in whole
or in part by assessment.
The City Clerk-Treasurer shall publish the final resolution as required in § 58-22 of this article.
After the publication of the final resolution, any work or improvement provided for and not yet
authorized shall be deemed fully authorized, and all awards of compensation or damage and all
assessments made shall be deemed duly and properly made, subject to the right of appeal by
§ 66.0703(12), Wis. Stats., or any other applicable provision of law.
As soon as the assessable cost of such work or improvement is finalized, the City Clerk-Treasurer
shall issue respective special assessment certificates for each property affected and specifying
the manner in which payment is to be made and shall send copy of the respective assessment
affecting each property to each owner's post office address that is known or can be obtained with
reasonable diligence.
§ 58-27. Combined assessments.
If more than a single improvement is undertaken, the Common Council may combine the assessments
as a single assessment on each property affected, except that the property owner may object to any

one or more of said improvements.
§ 58-28. Authority to amend, cancel or confirm special
assessment.
If, after completion or after the receipt of bids, the actual cost of any work or improvement is found to
vary materially from the original estimate, or the assessment is void or invalid for any reason, or if the
Common Council determines to reconsider an assessment, it is empowered, after giving notice as
required in § 58-25, to amend, cancel or confirm any prior assessment, and notice of this amending,
canceling or confirming shall be given by the City Clerk-Treasurer as provided in § 58-26 of this article.
§ 58-29. Reductions and refunds.
If the cost of the work or improvement is less than the assessment levied, the Common Council,
without notice or hearing, shall reduce each assessment proportionately. If the assessment has been
paid either in part or in full, the City shall refund the property owner such overpayment.
§ 58-30. Appeals.
Any person against whose property a special assessment is levied under this article may appeal
therefrom in the manner prescribed by § 66.0703(12), Wis. Stats., as amended, within 40 days of
the date of the final determination of the Common Council.
Pursuant to § 66.0703(12)(f), Wis. Stats., it shall be a condition to the maintenance of any appeal
that any assessment appealed shall be paid when due and payable, and, upon default in payment,
any such appeal shall be dismissed.
§ 58-31. Payment of special assessments; liens.
Payment of special assessments.
Without interest. Upon receipt of a copy of the special assessment certificate, any person may
pay the same in full, without interest, if paid to the City Clerk-Treasurer within the grace period
therein allowed and as allowed in the final resolution.
After grace period. If any special assessment, or any part thereof, remains unpaid following
the running of the grace period specified for payment without interest, at time of preparation of
the first tax roll thereafter, the same, together with interest computed thereon at the interest
rate established in said final resolution and in said certificates computed from the date of levy
(i.e., date of final resolution) or the finalizing of assessable costs, whichever is later, shall be
entered in such tax roll in such manner as directed in said final resolution and certificate;
thereafter, if the same be payable in installments, subsequent installments, together with
interest at said rate computed on declining balance, shall be entered in subsequent tax rolls
until fully paid. This provision is in no way intended to prohibit the prepayment of the balance
owing at any time on principal together with interest to date of payment only.
Assessment a lien. Pursuant to § 66.0703(13), Wis. Stats., any special assessment levied under
this article shall be a lien on the property against which it is levied on behalf of the City. The
Common Council shall provide for the collection of such assessments and may establish penalties
for payment after the due date. The Common Council shall provide that all assessments not paid
by the date specified shall be extended upon the tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property,

and all proceedings in relation to the collection of such delinquent taxes shall apply to such
assessment, except as otherwise provided by statute.
§ 58-32. Special charges.
In addition to all other methods provided by law, special charges for current services may be
imposed by resolution by the Common Council by allocating all or part of the cost of the service to
the property served. Such resolution shall set forth the property location, the current service
rendered by the City and the special charge therefor or cost thereof. Such resolution for special
charges may include snow and ice removal, weed elimination, street sprinkling, oiling and tarring,
repair of sidewalks or curb and gutter, garbage and refuse disposal, recycling, stormwater

Wis. Stats., or any other service as defined in § 66.0627(1)(c), Wis. Stats. The provision for notice
of such charges shall be optional with the Common Council, except that, in the case of street,
sidewalk, curb or gutter repair, a Class 1 notice shall be published in the official City newspaper at
least 20 days before the hearing or proceeding, and a copy of such notice shall be mailed to every
interested person whose post office address is known, at least 10 days before the hearing or
proceeding. Such notice shall specify that, on a certain date, a hearing will be held by the
Common Council as to whether the service in question shall be performed.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Special charges for current services shall not be payable in installments. If not paid within the
period fixed by the Common Council in said resolution, such delinquent special charges, pursuant
to § 58-31, shall become a lien on said property as of the date of such delinquency and shall
automatically be extended upon the current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the
property, as provided by § 66.0627, Wis. Stats., and all proceedings in relation to the collection,
return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such special charge.
Notice of special charges for current services need not be given except as required by § 66.0627,
Wis. Stats., as amended.
Section 58-22A of this article shall not be applicable to proceedings under this section.
§ 58-33. Miscellaneous provisions.
If any assessment or charge levied under this article is invalid because such statutes are found to
be unconstitutional, the Common Council may thereafter reassess such assessment or charge
pursuant to the provisions of any applicable law.
The Common Council may, without notice or hearing, levy and assess all or any part of the cost of
any work or improvement upon the property benefited if notice and hearing is waived in writing by
property owners affected.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, or this or other ordinance or resolution, it is specifically
intended and provided by this article that the City may levy special assessments for work or
improvement against the property benefited either before or after the approval of the work plans
and specifications, contracting for the work or completing the work or improvement.
§ 58-34. Special assessment bonds.
As an alternative to any other financing method, the Common Council may provide for the payment of
the initial cost of any public improvement from the proceeds of special assessment "B" bonds issued
under § 66.0713(4) and (5), Wis. Stats. Special assessments to retire such bonds and pay the interest

damaged.
A requester shall be charged a fee of $0.25 per page to defray the cost of copying records.
If the form of a written record does not permit copying, the actual and necessary cost of
photographing and photographic processing shall be charged.
The actual full cost of providing a copy of other records not in printed form on paper, such as
films, computer printouts and audio tapes and videotapes, shall be charged.
If mailing or shipping is necessary, the actual cost thereof shall also be charged.
There shall be no charge for locating a record unless the actual cost therefor exceeds $50, in
which case the actual cost shall be determined by the legal custodian and billed to the
requester.
The legal custodian shall estimate the cost of all applicable fees and shall require a cash
deposit adequate to assure payment, if such estimate exceeds $5.
Elected and appointed officials of the City shall not be required to pay for public records they
may reasonably require for the proper performance of their official duties.
The legal custodian may provide copies of a record without charge or at a reduced charge
where he or she determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest.
Pursuant to § 19.34, Wis. Stats., and the guidelines therein listed, each authority shall adopt,
prominently display and make available for inspection and copying at its offices, for the guidance
of the public, a notice containing a description of its organization and the established times and

information and access to records in its custody, make requests for records, or obtain copies of
records, and the costs thereof. This subsection does not apply to members of the Common
Council.
§ 132-5. Access procedures.
A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be
deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested.
However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of
time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made
orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced
under § 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the
person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No
request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is
required under § 132-4F(5). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification
whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or
federal law or regulations so require.
Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay,
either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in
whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City
Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party
making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would
permit reasonable compliance.
A request for a record may be denied as provided in § 132-6. If a request is made orally, the

exempted from disclosure by state law;
Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if

holdup alarm systems," "burglar alarm systems" and "manual holdup alarm systems," as those
terms are hereinafter defined, and fire alarm systems which monitor temperature, humidity or any
other condition directly related to the detection of fire. Excluded from this definition and from the

This subsection is intended to impose a strict liability on the person, business, corporation or
other entity responsible for alarm connection to either the police alarm panel or alarm
receiving firm to which the Police Department or Fire District have responded and shall be
applied regardless of the cause of the false alarm, excepting those alarms excluded from the

constitute a violation of this section, and such charge(s) shall be collectible as a forfeiture
upon prosecution and conviction thereof, together with an additional forfeiture(s) which may
be imposed under the next Subsection D hereof for violation of this section for allowing or
maintaining condition(s) or act(s) volatile of the intent of this section of eliminating and
minimizing the occurrence of false alarms, together with costs of prosecution.
Waiver of fee. If a possessor of the alarm shows to the satisfaction of the Chief of Police or the
Fire Chief, as applicable, that such false alarm was not the result of negligence or improper
maintenance, or other good and sufficient cause beyond the reasonable control of the possessor
of the alarm, such fee may be waived, and the response shall not count as a false alarm in
computing the fee established under Subsection C.
Other violations. Any person, corporation or other entity violating this chapter in any manner, other

be paid but not to exceed a length of time specified by the court, which length of time shall not
exceed six months. Upon nonpayment of the fee, the amount due may be placed on the tax roll as

concerning any provision of this chapter, including, but not limited to, any defects in an alarm system or

more than five months of age without complying with the provisions of §§ 174.05 through
174.10, Wis. Stats., relating to the listing, licensing and tagging of the same.
The owner of any dog more than five months of age on January 1 of any year, or five months
of age within the license year, shall annually, or on or before the date the dog becomes five
months of age, pay a license tax and obtain a license.
The Common Council shall establish the dog license tax in accordance with § 174.05, Wis.
Stats. The license year shall commence January 1 and end December 31.
[Amended 3-17-2015]
Upon payment of the required license tax and upon presentation of evidence that the dog is
currently immunized against rabies, as required by § 178-2 of this chapter, the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall complete and issue to the owner a license for such dog containing all
information required by state law. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall also deliver to the owner, at
the time of issuance of the license, a tag of durable material bearing the same serial number

The owner shall securely attach the tag to a collar and the collar with the tag attached shall be
kept on the dog for which the license is issued at all times, except as provided in § 178-2E.
The fact that a dog is without a tag attached to the dog by means of a collar shall be
presumptive evidence that the dog is unlicensed. Any law enforcement or humane officer
shall seize, impound or restrain any dog for which a dog license is required which is found
without such tag attached.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, every dog specifically trained to lead blind or deaf persons is
exempt from the dog license tax, and every person owning such a dog shall receive annually
a free dog license from the City Clerk-Treasurer upon application therefor.
Kennel licenses.
Any person who keeps or operates a kennel may, instead of the license tax for each dog
required by this chapter, apply for a kennel license for the keeping or operating of the kennel.
Such person shall pay for the license year a license tax as set by resolution of the Common
Council. Upon payment of the required kennel license tax and, if required by the Common
Council, upon presentation of evidence that all dogs over five months of age are currently
immunized against rabies, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall issue the kennel license and a
number of tags equal to the number of dogs authorized to be kept in the kennel. Kennels may
only be located in residential areas following a public hearing and approval by the Plan
Commission; the Plan Commission may attach conditions to such approval as a conditional
use under Chapter 480, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Brodhead.
[Amended 3-17-2015]
The owner or keeper of a kennel shall keep at all times a kennel license tag attached to the
collar of each dog over five months old kept by the owner or keeper under a kennel license,

but this requirement does not apply to a show dog during competition, to a dog securely
confined indoors or to a dog securely confined in a fenced area. These tags may be
transferred from one dog to another within the kennel whenever any dog is removed from the
kennel. The rabies vaccination tag or substitute tag shall remain attached to the dog for which
it is issued at all times, but this requirement does not apply to a show dog during competition,
to a dog securely confined indoors or to a dog securely confined in a fenced area. No dog
bearing a kennel tag shall be permitted to stray or to be taken anywhere outside the limits of
the kennel unless the dog is in leash or temporarily for the purposes of hunting, breeding,
trial, training or competition.
The term "kennel" means any establishment wherein or whereon three or more dogs are kept.
No kennel license shall be issued to the keeper or operator of a kennel who fails to provide
proper food and drink and proper shelter for the dogs in said kennel or who neglects or
abandons said dogs. Designated officials shall investigate any complaints regarding the
failure to maintain proper standards or investigate any kennel premises upon his own
initiative. Expressly incorporated by reference in this section as minimum standards for kennel
keepers or operators are the relevant provisions of Ch. 951, Wis. Stats.
A condition of a kennel license shall be that the licensed premises may be entered and
inspected at any reasonable hour by appropriate City officials without any warrant, and the
application for a license hereunder shall be deemed a consent to this provision. Any refusal to
permit such inspection shall automatically operate as a revocation of any license issued
hereunder and shall be deemed a violation of this section. Should any kennel be found to
constitute a public nuisance, the license shall be revoked and the nuisance abated pursuant
to City ordinances.
§ 178-4. Late fees.
[Amended 3-17-2015]
The City Clerk-Treasurer shall assess and collect a late fee as set by resolution of the Common
Council from every owner of a dog five months of age or over if the owner failed to obtain a license
prior to April 1 of each year or within 30 days of acquiring ownership of a licensable dog or if the owner
failed to obtain a license on or before the dog reached licensable age. Said late fee shall be charged in
addition to the required license fee.

said animal to interfere with the passing public or neighbors. Any animal running at large shall
be seized and impounded by a humane or law enforcement officer or animal warden.
Dogs to be leashed. Any person residing in the City of Brodhead owning or having in his/her
possession a dog shall keep the same tied and upon his/her own premises. It is further
provided that any dog not so tied and being upon the public streets and highways shall be

provisions of this subsection. If any such dog is so seized, restrained and impounded and if
the owner claims said dog, he/she shall be liable for a City-determined per day or fraction
thereof in which the dog has been in possession of said officer besides being subject to either
or both of the penalties and costs provided herein. If no person or owner claims such dog, it

City or surrender it to the police authorities to be destroyed, and upon failure to do so, said
owner may be summoned to appear before the Municipal Court.
Said owner shall, after a finding by the Court that said dog or other animal is in violation of
this section, be subject to a forfeiture as provided in § 178-24. Each day that an owner fails to
comply with this section shall constitute a separate offense. The burden of proof, however, in
any such proceeding shall be upon the complainants, and no such proceeding may be
maintained upon such complaints unless the summons shall have been served upon the
owner within 40 days after the service of the copy of the third complainant's affidavit as herein
before set forth.
As an alternative to the procedure described in Subsection D(1) through (4) of this section,
the City may, on its own initiative, enforce this section by the issuance of a citation or by any

Purpose. This chapter provides certain minimum standards, provisions and requirements for safe
and stable design, methods of construction and uses of materials in buildings and/or structures
hereafter erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, repaired, moved, converted to other uses or
demolished and regulates the equipment, maintenance, use and occupancy of all such buildings
and/or structures. Its purpose is to protect and foster the health, safety and well-being of persons
occupying or using such buildings and the general public.
Scope. New buildings hereafter erected in or any building hereafter moved within or into the City
shall conform to all the requirements of this chapter, except as they are herein specifically
exempted from part or all of its provisions. Any alteration, enlargement or demolition of an existing
building and any installation therein of electrical, gas, heating, plumbing or ventilating equipment
which affects the health or safety of the users thereof or any other persons is a new building to the
extent of such change. Any existing building shall be considered a new building for the purposes
of this chapter whenever it is used for dwelling, commercial or industrial purposes, unless it was
being used for such purpose at the time this chapter was enacted. The provisions of this chapter
supplement the laws of the State of Wisconsin pertaining to construction and use and Chapter
480, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Brodhead and amendments thereto to the date this chapter
was adopted and in no way supersede or nullify such laws and the said Chapter 480, Zoning, of
the Code of the City of Brodhead.
§ 203-2. Building permits; certificates of occupancy.
Permit required.
General permit requirement. No building of any kind shall be moved within or into the City of
Brodhead and no new building or structure, or any part thereof, shall hereafter be erected, or
ground broken for the same, or enlarged, altered, moved, demolished, razed or used within
the City, except as herein provided, until a permit therefor shall first have been obtained by
the owner, or his authorized agent, from the Building Inspector.
Alterations and repairs. The following provisions shall apply to buildings altered or repaired:
Alterations. When any existing building or structure accommodates a legal occupancy
and use but is of a substandard type of construction, then alterations which involve
beams, girders, columns, bearing or other walls, room arrangement, heating and airconditioning
systems, light and ventilation, or changes in location of exit stairways or
exits, or any or all of the above, may be made in order to bring such existing construction
into conformity with the minimum requirements of this chapter applicable to such
occupancy and use and given type of construction, when not in conflict with any other
regulations.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
Repairs. Repairs for purposes of maintenance, or replacements in any existing building
or structure which do not involve the structural portions of the building or structure or
which do not affect room arrangement, light and ventilation, access to or efficiency of any
exist stairways, or exits, fire protection, or exterior aesthetic appearance and which do
not increase a given occupancy or use, shall be deemed minor repairs.
Alterations when not permitted. When any existing building or structure, which, for any
reason whatsoever, does not conform to the regulations of this chapter, has deteriorated
from any cause whatsoever to an extent greater than 50% of the equalized value of the
building or structure, no alterations or moving of such building or structure shall be
permitted. Any such building or structure shall be considered a menace to public safety
and welfare and shall be ordered vacated and thereafter demolished and debris removed
from the premises.

Alterations and repairs required. When any of the structural members of any building or
structure have deteriorated from any cause whatsoever to less than their required
strength, the owner of such a building or structure shall cause such structural members
to be restored to their required strength, failing in which the building or structure shall be
considered a menace to public safety and shall be vacated and thereafter no further
occupancy or use of the same shall be permitted until the regulations of this chapter are
complied with.
Extent of deterioration. The amount and extent of deterioration of any existing building or
structure shall be determined by the Building Inspector.
Application. Application for a building permit shall be made in writing upon a form furnished by the
Building Inspector or his designee and shall state the name and address of the owner of the land
and also the owner of the building if different, the legal description of the land upon which the
building is to be located, the name and address of the designer, the use to which said building is to
be put and such other information as the Building Inspector may require.
Site plan approval.
Site plan approval. All applications for building permits for any construction, reconstruction,
expansion or conversion, except for one- and two-family residences in residentially zoned
districts, shall require site plan approval by the Plan Commission in accordance with the
requirements of this section, unless site plan review is required under Chapter 480, Zoning, of
the Code of the City of Brodhead. The applicant shall submit a site plan and sufficient plans
and specifications of proposed buildings, machinery and operations to enable the Plan
Commission or its expert consultants to determine whether the proposed application meets all
the requirements applicable thereto in this chapter.
Administration. The Building Inspector shall make a preliminary review of the application and
plans requiring site plan review and refer them along with a report of his findings to the Plan
Commission. The Plan Commission shall review the application and may refer the application
and determine whether the application and plans meet all the requirements applicable thereto
in this chapter. Within 30 days of its receipt of the application, the Plan Commission shall
authorize the Building Inspector to issue or refuse a building permit.
Requirements. In acting on any site plan, the Plan Commission shall consider the following:
The appropriateness of the site plan and buildings in relation to the physical character of
the site and the usage of adjoining land areas.
The layout of the site with regard to entrances and exits to public streets; the
arrangement and improvement of interior roadways; the location, adequacy and
improvement of areas for parking and for loading and unloading; and shall, in this
connection, satisfy itself that the traffic pattern generated by the proposed construction or
use shall be developed in a manner consistent with the safety of residents and the
community, and the applicant shall so design the construction or use as to minimize any
traffic hazard created thereby.
The adequacy of the proposed water supply, drainage facilities and sanitary and waste
disposal.
The landscaping and appearance of the completed site. The Plan Commission may
require that those portions of all front, rear and side yards not used for off-street parking
shall be attractively planted with trees, shrubs, plants or grass lawns, and that the site be
effectively screened so as not to impair the value of adjacent properties nor impair the
intent or purposes of this section.

Effect on municipal services. Before granting any site approval, the Plan Commission may,
besides obtaining advice from consultants, secure such advice as may be deemed necessary
from the Building Inspector or other municipal officials, with special attention to the effect of
such approval upon existing municipal services and utilities. Should additional facilities be
needed, the Plan Commission shall not issue the final approval until the City has entered into
an agreement with the applicant regarding the development of such facilities.
Appeals. Denials of building permits contingent upon site plan approval may be appealed to
the Zoning Board of Appeals by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk-Treasurer within
seven days of the denial.
Dedicated street and approved subdivision required. Unless a waiver is granted by the Common
Council, following a recommendation from the Building Inspector, no building permit shall be
issued unless the property on which the building is proposed to be built abuts a street that has
been dedicated for street purposes. No building permits shall be issued until the subdivision
and/or certified survey and required improvements are accepted by the Common Council.
Utilities required for residential and nonresidential buildings. No building permit shall be issued for
the construction of any building until sewer, water, storm sewer, grading, streets, and curb and
gutter are installed in the streets necessary to service the property for which the permit is required.
Elevations. The first-floor minimum elevation of a house shall be 18 inches above the curbline at
the high side. The maximum driveway elevation shall be 12% from the flag of the curb to the
threshold of the garage door.
Plans. With applications for new detached structures or additions, there shall be submitted three
complete sets of plans and specifications, including a plot plan showing the location and
dimensions of all buildings and improvements on the lot, both existing and proposed, dimensions
of the lot, dimensions showing all setbacks of all buildings on the lot, proposed grade of proposed
structure (to City datum), grade of lot and of the street abutting lot, grade and setback of adjacent
buildings (if adjacent lot is vacant, submit elevation of nearest buildings on same side of street),
type of monuments at each corner of lot, watercourses or existing drainage ditches, easements or
other restrictions affecting such property, the signature of the applicant and, if necessary due to
the nature of the project, a construction erosion control plan setting forth proposed information and
procedures needed for control of soil erosion, surface water runoff and sediment disposition at the
building site. One set of plans shall be of reduced size to facilitate copying. Plans, specifications
and plot plans shall be drawn to a minimum scale of 1/4 inch to one foot (fireplace details to 3/4
inch to one foot). One set of plans shall be returned after approval as provided in this chapter. The
second set shall be filed in the office of the Building Inspector. Plans for buildings involving the

the application, he may waive the filing of plans for alterations, repairs or moving, provided
the cost of such work does not exceed $2,000.
Minor repairs. The Building Inspector may authorize minor repairs or maintenance work on
any structure or to heating, ventilating or air-conditioning systems installed which are valued
at less than $2,000 of fair market value as determined by the Building Inspector, which do not
change the occupancy area, exterior aesthetic appearance, structural strength, fire protection,
exits, lights or ventilation of the building or structure without issuance of a building permit. The
Building Inspector may authorize roofing on one- and two-family dwellings, residential
accessory buildings and storage sheds less than 64 square feet in floor area, attached and

If the Building Inspector determines that the building will comply with this Building Code and
with other applicable ordinances and orders of the City, he shall issue a building permit which
shall state the use to which said building is to be put, which shall be kept and displayed at the
site of the proposed building. After being approved, the plans and specifications shall not be
altered in any respect which involves any of the above-mentioned ordinances, laws or orders,
or which involves the safety of the building or the occupants, except with the written consent
of the Building Inspector.
In case adequate plans are presented for part of the building only, the Building Inspector, at
his discretion, may issue a permit for that part of the building before receiving the plans and
specifications for the entire building.
Inspection of work. The qualified inspector, as certified by the Wisconsin Department of Safety and
Professional Services, is hereby authorized and directed to administer and enforce all provisions
of the Wisconsin Administrative Code related to his certification. The builder shall notify the

Inspections.
The Building Inspector shall make a final inspection of all new buildings, additions, and
alterations. If no violations of this or any other ordinance be found, the Building Inspector
shall issue a certificate of occupancy, stating the purpose for which the building is to be
used.
No building or part thereof shall be occupied until such certificate has been issued, nor
shall any building be occupied in any manner which conflicts with the conditions set forth

of any building or structure in the City, prior to issuance of an occupancy certificate, in all such
cases of hardship as, in his judgment and discretion, warrant occupancy before the final stage
of completion as set forth in this chapter. Before granting such permission, the Building
Inspector shall first examine the premises and determine if it is safe and sanitary.[4]
Editor's Note: Original § 15-1-2(l)(5) of the 1997 Code, which pertained to the discontinuation
of a use or occupancy and immediately followed this subsection, was repealed at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Certificate of occupancy by Fire Chief. The Fire Chief, or his designee, shall have dual
authority with the Building Inspector in the issuance of certificates of occupancy for multifamily

commenced within six months or if construction has not been completed within one year from the
date of issuance thereof.

HVAC or electrical permit, certificate of occupancy, or approval issued under the regulations
of this chapter and may stop construction or use of approved new materials, equipment,

Upon the completion of the construction and installation of the electrical wiring and equipment
of any building, it shall be the duty of the firm, person or corporation doing the same to notify
the Electrical Inspector, who shall inspect the installation within 48 hours of the time such
notice is given. If the installation is found to be in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, the Inspector shall issue a certificate of inspection authorizing connection to the
electrical service and the turning on of the current. All wires which are to be concealed shall
be inspected before the concealment, and no other craft shall cover up or conceal such wires
until the installation has been inspected and approved and officially tagged to this effect by
the Electrical Inspector.
No certificate of inspection shall be issued by the Electrical Inspector unless the electrical
wiring and equipment for light, power, heat or other similar purposes is safe both with respect
to life and fire hazard and is in strict conformity with the ordinances of the City, the statutes of
the state and the general or special orders of the State of Wisconsin adopted under authority
of the statutes.
§ 203-6. Plumbing standards.
All plumbing installations to be inspected.
All plumbing to be inspected. All plumbing systems or installations within the boundaries of
the City and those connecting with the City water or sewerage system beyond the boundaries

System of inspection. Whenever any work is ready for inspection, the Plumbing Inspector
shall be notified by the plumber in charge of persons receiving permit, as directed by the
Plumbing Inspector, specifying the street and number when possible and the permit number
under which the work is being done. Unless otherwise especially permitted by the Inspector,
all work, either plumbing, water supply piping, house sewers or drains, shall be left uncovered
for examination until examined and approved by the Inspector. When necessary, the
Inspector shall notify the plumber in charge or the owner of the property at what time the
inspection will be made. The plumber in charge shall make such arrangements as will enable
the Inspector to reach all parts of the building readily and shall have present the proper
apparatus and appliances for making the test and performance of plumbing work. Failure to
respond promptly to official communications shall be deemed a sufficient reason for
withholding permits, and the plumber shall be held responsible for the violation of these
regulations by himself or any of his employees.
Responsibility of property owners for repairs. Repairs of any drainage or waste pipe carrying
domestic sewage from outside the foundation walls of any building or structure to and
including the connection with the "Y" in the sewer main, including private domestic sewage
treatment and disposal systems, such as stoppage of leaks in supply or waste pipes, clearing
stoppages in waste pipes and repairing valves or faucets in the drainage or waste pipe, shall
be the sole responsibility of the property owner, except that, in the event such leak or
stoppage or defective valve or faucet is located between the "Y" (including its connection with
the "Y") in the sewer main and the end of the sewer service lateral to the curb or other
disposal terminal, then the City shall be responsible for such repairs but shall charge the cost
of such repairs to the property owner.
Plumbing Inspector to have supervision of sewers. All sewer service laterals will be under the
supervision of the Plumbing Inspector, and no sewer service lateral shall be laid and no opening
into or connection with a sewer service lateral shall be made, except under his direction and
supervision.

Permit required. No person, firm or corporation shall open any street, alley or public place for
the purpose of connecting to a sewer lateral or other terminal, lay any house sewer or drain
pipe or make any attachment or extension to any old drain or house sewer, or do any kind of
work whatsoever in connection with any public or private sewer inside or outside of any
building, except repairs, without first obtaining from the Plumbing Inspector a written permit to
connect with the public sewer system.
Application for permit. Such permit shall be granted only upon written application by a
licensed master plumber, authorized by the owner or agent of the premises desiring to make
such connection, extension or alteration, stating the name of the owner and that he and such
master plumber will be bound by and be subject to all the rules and regulations prescribed by
the Plumbing Inspector and Common Council, and giving the exact location of the premises,
stating the purpose for which the connection, extension or alteration is to be used and the
time when the work is to be done, and all other particulars in respect thereto.
Permit required before laying drains. No work of laying house sewers or storm drains that are
on the premises and in the hands of a master plumber or one employed by him shall be
commenced or continued without the required permit to connect with the public sewer, which
shall be issued by the Plumbing Inspector.
§ 203-7. New methods and materials.
All materials, methods of construction and devices designed for use in buildings or structures
covered by this chapter and not specifically mentioned in or permitted by this chapter shall not be
so used until approved in writing by the State Department of Safety and Professional Services for
use in buildings or structures covered by the Wisconsin State Building Code, except sanitary
appliances, which shall be approved in accordance with the State Plumbing Code.
Such materials, methods of construction and devices, when approved, must be installed or used in
strict compliance with the manufacturer's specifications and any rules or conditions of use
established by the State Department of Safety and Professional Services. The data, test and other
evidence necessary to prove the merits of such material, method of construction or device shall be
determined by the State Department of Safety and Professional Services.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 203-8. Unsafe buildings.
Whenever the Common Council, upon the inspection and report of the Building Inspector or other
authorized inspector, finds any building or part thereof within the City to be, in its judgment, so old,
dilapidated or out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human
occupancy or use and so that it would be unreasonable to repair the same, the Council may order the
owner to raze and remove such building or part thereof or, if it can be made safe by repairs, to repair
and make safe and sanitary or to raze and remove, at the owner's option. The Council shall give
specific reasons for its determination. Such order and proceedings shall be as provided in § 66.0413,
Wis. Stats.
§ 203-9. Disclaimer on inspections.
The purpose of the inspections under this chapter is to improve the quality of housing in the City. The
inspections and the reports and findings issued after the inspections are not intended as, nor are they
to be construed as, a guarantee. In order to so advise owners and other interested persons, the
following disclaimer shall be applicable to all inspections: "These findings of inspection contained

No warranty of the operation, use or durability of equipment and materials not specifically cited herein
is expressed or implied."
§ 203-10. Garages.
Attached garages.
An "attached garage" is one that is constructed as an integral part of the house or is in the
basement of the house. All such attached garages shall be subject to the rules, regulations
and restrictions relative to the distance from the side and rear lot lines which apply to the
house proper. Framing of an attached garage shall be consistent with that of the dwelling it is
a part. This shall include carports.
Where a private garage is part of a building having habitable rooms over such garage, there
shall be provided a horizontal and vertical separation between the two occupancies of not
less than two-hour fire-resistive construction, except that, in lieu thereof, the spaces between
the joists and studs of the floor and wall shall be filled with approved noncombustible material
four inches in thickness and protected with one-hour fire-resistive construction.
Detached garages.
A "detached garage" is one which lies back of the rearmost part of the house and may be
erected within three feet of the regular and side lot lines. This distance is measured from the
foundation of the building, but such building must be so constructed that no water from roof
overhangs will fall on other property.
Garages of wood frame construction shall be located not less than 10 feet from any residence
building, except that such distance may be reduced to not less than five feet when the interior
walls of such garage adjacent to a residence building are protected with not less than onehour
fire-resistive construction.
Garages of masonry wall construction shall not be located less than five feet from any
residence building.[1]
Editor's Note: Original § 15-1-10(c), Garage size, of the 1997 Code, which immediately
followed this subsection, was repealed 11-17-2014.
Structural requirements.
Bottom of footings of unattached garages shall be not less than 18 inches below grade,
except that an unattached frame garage may be built on a four-inch-thick concrete slab,
reinforced with wire mesh weighing not less than 40 pounds per 100 square feet or equivalent
reinforcing, with a thickened edge.
Bolts 3/8 inch in diameter with nuts and washers attached, six inches long, shall be
embedded four inches in the concrete curb of detached garages eight feet on centers.
Any garage built as an integral part of a house shall have the bottoms of the footings not less
than four feet below grade.
Masonry garages shall have the wall and foundation requirements the same as for a onestory
frame house.
In unattached garages, studs may be two-by-fours placed two feet on center maximum.

siding be used without sheathing under it. When vertical siding or lap siding is used,
brace shall be installed at all external corners, consisting of one-by-fours let into the
outside face of the studs, corner post, sill and plate, set at an angle of 45° and extending
from the bottom of the sill to the top of the plate and nailed at each bearing.
When matched horizontal siding is used without sheathing, there shall be not less than
two nails per board in each stud.
Corner posts may be two two-by-four or one four-by-four.
Top plates may be single, provided rafters occur over studs.
Rafter ties; partitions.
Rafter ties at eaves may be two-by-fours, maximum spacing of six feet center to center.
On all attached garages and carports, there shall be a partition between the garage or
carport and the dwelling extended in such a manner as to completely separate the
dwelling and the garage or carport, said partition consisting of 5/8 inch of plaster on metal
lath or perforated gypsum being the one-hour fire-resistant type of one-half-inch sheet
rock. Any doors between the garage or carport and dwelling shall be of the flush door
type with a minimum thickness of 1 3/8 inches.
In any case where a garage door opening measures 15 feet or more in width, except when it
is located in a gable end or other nonbearing wall, the header shall consist of two two-bytwelves
bolted together with either a wide flange steel H-beam 10 by 5 3/4 inches weighing 21
pounds per foot, ten-inch steel I-beam or ten-inch steel channel, each weighing 25 pounds
per foot, or one-fourth-inch by ten-inch steel plate, its length to be approximately 12 inches
longer than the width of the opening. This requirement shall not be construed to eliminate
other types of beams or supports, providing sufficient engineering data is supplied at the

§ 203-11. Razing buildings.
No building within the City of Brodhead shall be razed without a permit from the Building Inspector.
A snow fence or other approved barricade shall be provided as soon as any portion of the building
is removed and shall remain during razing operations. After all razing operations have been
completed, the foundation shall be filled at least one foot above the adjacent grade, the property
raked clean, and all debris hauled away. Razing permits shall lapse and be void unless the work
authorized thereby is commenced within six months from the date thereof or completed within 30
days from the date of commencement of said work. Any unfinished portion of work remaining
beyond the required 30 days must have special approval from the Building Inspector.
All debris must be hauled away at the end of each week for the work that was done during that
week. No combustible material shall be used for backfill, but shall be hauled away. There shall not
be any burning of materials on the site of the razed building. If any razing or removal operation
under this section results in, or would likely result in, an excessive amount of dust particles in the
air creating a nuisance in the vicinity thereof, the permittee shall take all necessary steps, by use
of water spraying or other appropriate means, to eliminate such nuisance. The permittee shall take
all necessary steps, prior to the razing of a building, through the employment of a qualified person
in the field of pest control or by other appropriate means, to treat the building as to prevent the
spread and migration of rodents and insects therefrom during and after the razing operations.

§ 203-12. Basements; excavations.
Basement subflooring. First-floor subflooring shall be completed within 45 days after the basement
is excavated.
Fencing of excavations. The owner of any premises on which there exists an opening or
excavation after 45 days as to constitute a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic shall erect a
fence, wall or railing at least four feet high between such opening or excavation and the public
right-of-way.
Closing of abandoned excavations. Any excavation for building purposes or any uncovered
foundation which shall remain open for more than 45 days shall be deemed abandoned and a
nuisance, and the Building Inspector shall order that unless the erection of the building or structure
on the excavation or foundation shall commence or continue forthwith, suitable safeguards shall
be provided to prevent accidental injury to children or other frequenters or that the excavation or
foundation be filled to grade. Such order shall be served upon the owner of record or the owner's
agent, where an agent is in charge of the premises, and upon the holder of an encumbrance of
record in the manner provided for service of a summons in the Circuit Court. If the owner or the
holder of an encumbrance of record cannot be found, the order may be served by posting it on the
premises and make publication in the official newspaper for two consecutive publications at least
10 days before the time for compliance stated in the order commences to run. Such time shall be
not less than 14 nor more than 20 days after service. If the owner of the land fails to comply with
the order within the time required, the Building Inspector shall cause the excavation or foundation
to be filled to grade. The cost of such abatement shall be charged against the real estate and
entered on the next succeeding tax roll as a special charge and shall bear interest at a rate
established by the Common Council from the date of the report by the Building Inspector on the
cost thereof, pursuant to the provisions of § 66.0627, Wis. Stats.
Vacant buildings. Whenever any building or structure is vacant and the doors and windows or any
part thereof have been removed or opened, leaving the interior of such building or structure
exposed to the elements and accessible to trespassers, then such building or structure shall be
deemed to be dangerous, unsafe, and a menace to public safety. The Building Inspector shall give
the owner thereof written notice to secure said building or structure and comply with City Code
requirements within 30 days of the date of said notice. Failure to comply with said written notice
shall be sufficient grounds for the Building Inspector to condemn and raze said building or
structure in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 66.0413(2)(a), Wis. Stats.
§ 203-13. Discharge of clear waters.
Discharge. No person shall cause, allow or permit any roof drain, surface drain, subsoil drain,
drain from any mechanical device, gutter, ditch, pipe, conduit, sump pump or any other object or
thing used for the purposes of collecting, conducting, transporting, diverting, draining or
discharging clear water from any part of any private premises owned or occupied by said person
to discharge into a sanitary sewer.
Nuisance. The discharge into a sanitary sewer from any roof drain, surface drain, subsoil drain,
drain from any mechanical device, gutter, ditch, pipe, conduit, sump pump or any other object or
thing used for the purposes of collecting, conducting, transporting, diverting, draining or
discharging clear water from any part of any private premises is hereby declared to be a public
nuisance and a hazard to the health, safety and well-being of the residents of the City and to the
protection of the property.
Groundwater. Where deemed necessary by the Building Inspector, every house shall have a sump
pump installed for the purpose of discharging clear waters from foundation drains and ground
infiltration and where the building is not serviced by a storm sewer shall either discharge into an

Stormwater. All roof drains, surface drains, drains from any mechanical device, gutters, pipe,
conduits or any other objects or things used for the purpose of collecting, conducting, transporting,
diverting, draining or discharging stormwaters shall be discharged either to a storm sewer, a dry
well, an underground conduit leading to a drainage ditch or onto the ground surface in such other
manner as will not constitute a nuisance as defined herein.
Storm sewer lateral. Where municipal storm sewers are provided and it is deemed necessary by
the property owner and/or the City to discharge clear waters from a parcel of land, a storm sewer
lateral shall be installed and connected to the storm sewer main at the expense of the owner.
Conducting tests. If the Building Inspector or his designated agent suspects an illegal clear water
discharge as defined by this chapter or by any other applicable provision of the Wisconsin
Administrative Code, as it may, from time to time, be amended, he may, upon reasonable notice
and at reasonable times, enter the private premises where such illegal clear water discharge is
suspected and conduct appropriate tests to determine whether such suspected illegal clear water
discharge actually exists.
§ 203-14. Moving of buildings and structures.
General requirements.
No person shall move any building or structure upon any of the public ways of the City of
Brodhead without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Building Inspector and upon the
payment of the required fee. Every such permit issued by the Building Inspector for the
moving of a building shall designate the route to be taken, the conditions to be complied with
and shall limit the time during which said moving operations shall be continued.
A report shall be made by City employees with regard to possible damage to trees. The
estimated cost of trimming, removal and replacement of public trees, as determined by the
City, shall be paid to the Building Inspector prior to issuance of the moving permit.
Issuance of moving permit shall further be conditioned on approval of the moving route by the
Common Council.
Continuous movement. The movement of buildings shall be a continuous operation during all the
hours of the day and at night, until such movement is fully completed. All such operations shall be
performed with the least possible obstruction to thoroughfares. No building shall be allowed to
remain overnight upon any street crossing or intersection or so near thereto as to prevent easy
access to any fire hydrant or any other public facility. Lights shall be kept in conspicuous places at
each end of the building during the night.
Street repair. Every person receiving a permit to move a building shall, within one day after said
building reaches its destination, report that fact to the Building Inspector, who shall inspect the
streets, highways and curbs and gutters over which said building has been moved and ascertain
their condition. If the removal of said building has caused any damage to any street or highway,
the person to whom the permit was issued shall forthwith place them in as good repair as they
were before the permit was granted. On the failure of the said permittee to do so within 10 days
thereafter to the satisfaction of the Common Council, the City shall repair the damage done to
such streets and hold the person obtaining such permit and the sureties on his bond responsible
for the payment of same.
Conformance with code. No permit shall be issued to move a building within or into the City and to
establish it upon a location within the said City until the Building Inspector has made an
investigation of such building at the location from which it is to be moved and is satisfied from such

investigation that said building is in a sound and stable condition and of such construction that it
will meet the requirements of this Building Code in all respects. A complete plan of all further
repairs, improvements and remodeling with reference to such building shall be submitted to the
Building Inspector, and he shall make a finding of fact to the effect that all such repairs,
improvements and remodeling are in conformity with the requirements of this Building Code and
that, when the same are completed, the building as such will so comply with said Building Code. In
the event a building is to be moved from the City to some point outside the boundaries thereof, the
provisions with respect to the furnishing of plans and specifications for proposed alterations to
such building may be disregarded.
Bond.
Before a permit is issued to move any building over any public way in the City, the party
applying therefor shall give a bond to the City of Brodhead in a sum to be fixed by the Building
Inspector and which shall not be less than $5,000, said bond to be executed by a corporate
surety or two personal sureties to be approved by the Common Council or designated agent,
conditioned upon, among other things, the indemnification to the City for any costs or
expenses incurred by it in connection with any claims for damages to any persons or property
and the payment of any judgment, together with the costs and expenses incurred by the City
in connection therewith, arising out of the removal of the building for which the permit is
issued.
Unless the Building Inspector, upon investigation, shall find it to be a fact that the excavation
exposed by the removal of such building from its foundation shall not be so close to a public
thoroughfare as to permit the accidental falling therein of travelers or the location, nature and
physical characteristics of the premises and the exposed excavation such as to make
intrusion upon the premises and the falling into such excavation of children under 12 years of
age unlikely, the bond required by Subsection E(1) shall be further conditioned upon the
permittee erecting adequate barriers and, within 48 hours, filling in such excavation or
adopting and employing such other means, devices or methods approved by the Building
Inspector and reasonably adopted or calculated to prevent the occurrences set forth herein.
Insurance. The Building Inspector shall require, in addition to the said bond above indicated,
public liability insurance covering injury to one person in the sum of not less than $100,000 and for
one accident in a sum not less than $200,000, together with property damage insurance in a sum
not less than $50,000, or such other coverage as deemed necessary.
§ 203-15. Fire limits.
The boundary lines for the construction limits of the City of Brodhead which redefined construction
limits are as follows, to wit: Blocks 87, 88, 99, 100, 101 and 109.
Henceforth, after October 2, 1985, requirements as they related to fire limits shall apply only to the
above-described construction limits in the City of Brodhead.
§ 203-16. Fees.
Building Code fees. Fees for building, electrical, plumbing, HVAC and other related permits shall
be as established by resolution of the Common Council.

such violations to the Common Council and City Attorney, who shall bring an action to enjoin the
erection, enlargement, alteration, repair or moving of such building or structure or the
establishment of such use of buildings in violation of this chapter or to cause such building,
structure or use to be removed, and such violation may also be subject to a penalty as provided in
the general penalty provisions of the Code of the City of Brodhead. In any such action, the fact
that a permit was issued shall not constitute a defense, nor shall any error, oversight or dereliction
of duty on the part of the Building Inspector or other City officials constitute a defense. Compliance
with the provisions of this chapter may also be enforced by injunctional order at the suit of the
owner or owners of any real estate within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
Notice of violation.
If an inspection reveals a noncompliance with this chapter or the Uniform Dwelling Code, the
Building Inspector shall notify the applicant and the owner, in writing, of the violation to be
corrected. All cited violations shall be corrected within 30 days after written notification, unless
an extension of time is granted pursuant to § SPS 320.21(3), Wis. Adm. Code.
If, after written notification, the violation is not corrected within 30 days, a stop-work order may
be served on the owner or his or her representative, and a copy thereof shall be posted at the
construction site. Such stop-work order shall not be removed except by written notice of the
Building Inspector after satisfactory evidence has been supplied that the cited violation has
been corrected.
Each day each violation continues after the thirty-day written notice period has run shall
constitute a separate offense. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the City from maintaining
any appropriate action to prevent or remove a violation of any provision of this chapter or the
Uniform Dwelling Code.
If any construction or work governed by the provisions of this chapter or the Uniform Dwelling
Code is commenced prior to the issuance of a permit, double fees shall be charged.
Any person feeling aggrieved by an order or a determination of the Building Inspector may appeal
from such order or determination to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Those procedures customarily
used to effectuate an appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall apply.
Except as may otherwise be provided by the statute or ordinance, no officer, agent or employee of
the City of Brodhead charged with the enforcement of this chapter shall render himself personally
liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or
permitted in the discharge of his duties under this chapter. Any suit brought against any officer,
agent or employee of the City as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his
duties under this chapter shall be defended by the legal representative of the City until the final
determination of the proceedings therein.

§ 209-6. Transfer procedure.
All of the rights and privileges and all the obligations, duties and liabilities created by this chapter shall
pass to and be binding upon the successors of the City and the successors and assigns of the grantee.
The franchise shall not be assigned or transferred by the grantee without the written approval of the
City hereunder, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld without a showing of good cause;
provided, however, that this section shall not prevent the assignment or pledge of a franchise or
system by a grantee as security for debt without such approval; and provided, further, that transfers or
assignments of a franchise between any parent and subsidiary corporation or between entities of
which at least 51% of the beneficial ownership is held by the grantee or any parent corporation shall be
permitted without the prior approval of the City. The sale, transfer or assignment of a material portion of
the tangible assets of a grantee to an unrelated third party shall be considered an assignment subject
to the provisions of this section.
The parties to the sale or transfer of a franchise shall make a written request to the City for its
approval of a sale or transfer of the franchise.
The City shall reply in writing within 30 days of the request with a written notification of any
information it needs to evaluate the request, unless both parties agree that more time may be
granted. Within 30 days of such information being provided, the City shall indicate approval of the
request or its determination that a public hearing is necessary.
If a public hearing is deemed necessary pursuant to Subsection B, the City shall conduct such
hearing within 30 days of such determination. Notice of any such hearing shall be given at least 14
days prior to the hearing by publishing notice thereof once in a newspaper of general circulation in
the areas being served by the franchise. The notice shall contain the date, time and place of the
hearing and shall briefly state the substance of the action to be considered by the City.
Within 60 days after the public hearing, the City shall approve or deny the sale or transfer request
and notify the grantee in writing of its decision.
The parties to the sale or transfer of a franchise only, without the inclusion of a cable
communications system in which at least substantial construction has commenced, shall establish
to the satisfaction of the City of Brodhead that the sale or transfer of a franchise only will be in the
public interest.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
The new holder of a sold or transferred franchise shall, within 30 days of the sale or transfer, file
with the City a copy of the deed, agreement or other written instrument evidencing such sale,
transfer of ownership or control or lease, certified and sworn to as correct by the grantee. The new
holder shall, within the same period, file with the City any and all required bonds, proofs of
insurance and certifications, and accept in writing all responsibilities relating to the cable franchise
and system.
§ 209-7. Franchise territory.
The franchise territory shall be the corporate limits of the City of Brodhead. The grantee shall
extend cable service therein to new subdivisions or other land divisions within the City of
Brodhead when either of the two following criteria are met:
When there exists a density of 20 homes per plant mile or portion thereof measured from the
nearest existing plant from which service can be reasonably provided; or
When the subdivision or other land division is within 300 feet of an existing cable plant and
the grantee has a reasonable opportunity to install cable facilities at the time other utilities

such as electricity and telephone are installed. In this context, the grantee shall be deemed to
have reasonable opportunity when given sufficient notice to acquire the necessary materials
for the installation and when the grantee is not unfairly discriminated against by the developer
and/or other utility companies involved with respect to cost sharing on the project.
For residents requesting service which does not meet the criteria set forth in Subsection A(1) and
(2) above, the grantee shall reasonably cooperate with such residents in reaching a cost-sharing
agreement providing that the grantee pay the cost of the first 300 feet and 60% of the cost of the
extension beyond 300 feet, up to a maximum of 600 feet, and the residents pay 40% of the cost.
Beyond 600 feet, the resident shall pay the actual cost of extending grantee's plant.
§ 209-8. Subscriber privacy.
No monitoring of any authorized terminal connected to the system shall take place without specific
written authorization by the user of the terminal in question on each occasion and written notice to
the City, except as may be required for normal maintenance of the system.
A grantee shall not, except as required by governmental action, provide any data concerning
specific subscribers or users or their use of subscriber services without first securing written
authorization from the subscribers or users as required in the Cable Communications Policy Act of
1984.
Subscribers and users shall retain the right to deactivate their terminals, but shall continue to be
responsible for charges until the grantee is notified to terminate service.
§ 209-9. Technical performance.
The cable system shall be operated to comply with or exceed all guidelines and standards set by the
FCC for signal quality and leakage. The City reserves the right to test the system or any part thereof
and independently measure the signal quality. The grantee shall provide reasonable access to its
facilities and any assistance necessary for such testing. The system shall comply at all times with the
applicable National Electrical Code of the National Fire Protection Association.
§ 209-10. Open books and records.

records vis-a-vis the City. The authorized officers or agents of the City shall have the right to inspect,
upon notice, during normal business hours all books, records, maps, plans, financial statements,
service complaint logs, performance test results, records of request for service and other like materials
of the grantee that relate to the operation of the franchise.
§ 209-11. Subscriber service.
A grantee shall be required to provide a location convenient to the City open during normal
business hours to receive customer payments.

installation, monthly service charges and any other charges related to the operation of the cable
system, together with a statement of the rights and obligations of subscribers.
Subsequent additions or amendments to rates and service charges shall likewise be filed with the

The City reserves the option to regulate rates for cable service, should such power be allowed
under federal and state law.
§ 209-14. Conditions on street occupancy.
Use. All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by a grantee within
the City shall be so located as not to cause interference with the proper use of streets, alleys and
other public ways and places, and not to cause interference with the rights of or reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets, alleys or other public ways and
places.
Restoration. In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other surfacing, the
grantee shall first give notice to the Director of Public Works of any contemplated disturbances of
pavement sidewalk, driveway or other surfacing, and shall, at its own cost and expense and in a
manner approved by the Director of Public Works, replace and restore all pavement, sidewalk,
driveway or other surface of any street or alley disturbed in as good condition as before such work
commenced. The grantee shall otherwise comply with City ordinances relating to street openings.
Relocation. If, at any time during a franchise, the City shall elect to alter or change the location or
grade of any street, alley or other public way, the grantee shall remove, relay and relocate its
poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense. The
City shall notify the grantee of potential City changes affecting grantee's facilities as soon as plans
allow, and give the grantee at least 30 days' advance notification for nonemergency relocations. If
any construction by the grantee is in violation of the provisions of Subsection A, the grantee will
likewise, upon reasonable notice by the City, remove, relay and relocate its property in such a
manner as to remedy such violation at its own expense.
Placement of fixtures. Cables, wires and other equipment in connection with such system shall
only be installed and operated on or under the public rights-of-way upon the poles or in
underground conduit and equipment of the existing utilities within the City and their successors, or
assigns, where conduits exist and where space in installed conduits is available. Installation of any
additional poles, conduit or other equipment for the installation of cables, wires, and other
overhead equipment and underground equipment in public rights-of-way in connection with the
said system shall be subject to the authorization of the Common Council or its designated
representative. In reaching a decision as to such additional poles or equipment, the suggestions, if
any, of the utility companies servicing or planning to serve such area may be considered.
Underground installations shall always be preferred; provided, however, the grantee may construct
its plant aerial so long as there is one utility aerial.

paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee may require such payment in advance.
The grantee shall be given notification at the time a building moving permit is issued by the City, in
no case receiving less than five working days' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire
changes.
Tree trimming. The grantee, to the same extent that the City has such authority, may trim trees
that overhang streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the City so as to prevent the

grantee must apply to the City for a no-fee permit before trimming trees.
§ 209-15. Indemnification; insurance.
Indemnification. The grantee shall defend and save the City and its agents and employees
harmless from all claims, damages, losses, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, sustained by

operations of the grantee under any franchise granted hereunder, in the amounts of

period, from the security fund until proper correction is made. The City also reserves the right to

military action, or other conditions beyond its control, including the unavailability of material or
parts.

grantee.
§ 209-18. Additional regulations; police and fire alarm system;
inspections.
The City hereby reserves the right to adopt, in addition to the provisions contained in this chapter
and existing applicable ordinances, such additional regulations as it shall find necessary in the
exercise of its police powers. Such regulations, by ordinance or otherwise, shall be reasonable
and not be in substantial conflict with the rights granted in this chapter and not be in conflict with
the laws of the state.

§ 236-1. Permit requirements.
Purpose. For the safety of the general public, the City of Brodhead shall determine the location,
size, construction and number of access points to public roadways within the City limits. It is the
City's intent to provide safe access to properties abutting public roadways suitable for the property
to be developed to its highest and best use, provided that access is not deficient or dangerous to

§ 236-2. Location, design and construction requirements.
General requirements. The location, design and construction of driveways shall be in accordance
with the following:
General design. Private driveways shall be of such width and so located that all of such
driveways and their appurtenances are within the limits of the frontage abutting the street of
the property served. Driveways shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from any street
intersection area and shall not encroach upon or occupy areas of the street right-of-way
required for effective traffic control or for street signs or signals. A driveway shall be so
located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it shall have adequate sight
distance along the street. Driveway approaches shall be at least 10 feet apart, except by
special permission from the Director of Public Works, and driveways shall in all cases be
placed wherever possible as not to interfere with utilities in place.
Number. The number of driveways to serve an individual property fronting on a street shall be
one, except where deemed necessary and feasible by the Common Council for reasonable
and adequate service to the property, considering the safety, convenience and utility of the
street.

Island area. The island area in the street right-of-way between successive driveways or
adjoining a driveway and between the highway shoulder and right-of-way shall constitute a
restricted area and may be filled in and graded only as provided in Subsection A(6).
Drainage. The surface of the driveway connecting with street cross sections shall slope
downward and away from the highway shoulder a sufficient distance to preclude ordinary
surface water drainage flowing onto the street roadbed. No driveway apron shall extend out
into the street further than the face of the curb, and under no circumstances shall such
driveway apron extend into the gutter area. All driveway entrances and approaches shall be
so constructed that they shall not interfere with the drainage of streets, side ditches, or
roadside areas or with any existing structure on the right-of-way.
Reconstruction of sidewalks and curb and gutter. When the construction of a driveway
requires the removal of a curb or gutter, the new connections shall be of equivalent
acceptable material, and curb returns shall be provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike
manner. The driveway surface shall be connected with the highway pavement and the
sidewalk, if any, in a neat workmanlike manner. All driveway entrances and approaches shall
include sidewalks paved in accordance with the requirements for sidewalk construction in
§ 398-5 of the Code of the City of Brodhead insofar as such requirements are applicable,
including thickness requirements. Standard thickness of residential driveway approaches will
be six inches thick.
[Amended 9-12-2011]
Restricted areas. The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in and
graded only when the following requirements are complied with:
The filling or draining shall be to grades approved by the Director of Public Works and,
except where highway drainage is by means of curb and gutter, water drainage of the
area shall be directed away from the street roadbed in a suitable manner.
Culvert extensions under the restricted area shall be of the same size and of equivalent
acceptable material as the culvert under the driveway. Intermediate manholes adequate
for cleanout purposes may be required where the total culvert length is excessive.
Where no street side ditch separates the restricted area from the street roadbed,
permanent provision may be required to separate the area from the street roadbed to
prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes by construction of a border, curb, rail or
posts as may be required by the Director of Public Works.
Relocation of utilities. Any costs of relocating utilities shall be the responsibility of the property
owner with approval of the Director of Public Works necessary before any utility may be
relocated and the driveway installed.[1]
Editor's Note: Original § 6-3-2(a)(8), Construction across sidewalks, of the 1997 Code, which
immediately followed this subsection, was repealed at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1,
General Provisions, Art. II).
Variances. Any of the above requirements may be varied by the Common Council in such
instances where the peculiar nature of the property or the design of the street may make the
rigid adherence to the above requirements impossible or impractical.
Special requirements for commercial and industrial driveways. The following regulations are
applicable to driveways serving commercial or industrial establishments:
Width of drive. The maximum permitted width of a commercial or industrial driveway approach
shall be 35 feet at the curbline, except as increased by permissible radii. In instances where
the unique nature of the commercial or industrial activity or the physical characteristics of the
land would require a driveway of greater width than herein specified, the Common Council in
its discretion may permit a driveway of additional width.

curbline shall not be less than 45 feet.
Island areas. Where the public sidewalk is adjacent to the curb, an island of a minimum length
of six feet measured along the curbline shall be placed between each entrance to a City
street. The curb shall be left intact for the length of this island. Where the public sidewalk is
remote from the curb, an island of a minimum length of 10 feet measured along the right-ofway
line shall be maintained along each entrance to the City street. All flares shall be tangent
to the curbline. A curb length of not less than three feet shall be left undisturbed adjacent to
each property line to serve as an island area in the event an adjoining property owner applies
for a driveway permit to serve his property.
Special requirements for residential driveways. The following regulations are applicable to
driveways serving residential property:
Width. Unless special permission is first received from the Plan Commission, a residential
driveway shall be no greater than 24 feet wide at the outer or street edge of the sidewalk and
at the curbline.

Appeal from permit refusal. Any person feeling himself aggrieved by the refusal of the Director of
Public Works to issue a permit for a private driveway may appeal such refusal to the Plan
Commission within 20 days after such refusal to issue such permit is made.
[Amended 9-12-2011]
Prohibited driveways.
No person, firm or corporation shall place, construct, locate in, or cause to be placed,
constructed or located in, any obstruction or structure within the limits of any public road,
highway or street in the City of Brodhead, except as permitted by this section. As used herein,
the word "structure" includes private driveways, a portion of which extends into any public
road, highway or street, and which is in nonconformance with this chapter.
No driveway shall be closer than 35 feet to the extended street line at an intersection. At
street intersections, a driveway shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from the street
intersection area and shall not occupy areas of the roadway deemed necessary by the City
for effective traffic control or for highway signs or signals.
The grade of that portion of any private driveway or pedestrian path located within the limits of
any public road, highway or street shall be such as shall meet the grade of the existing public
roadway at its edge and not cause an obstruction to the maintenance or clearing of such
public roadway.
No driveway apron shall extend out into the street further than the facing of the curb, and
under no circumstances shall such driveway apron extend into any gutter area. All driveway
entrances and approaches shall be constructed as not to interfere with the drainage of
streets, side ditches or roadside areas or with any existing structure on the right-of-way.

other combustibles can this unnecessary health risk and pollution be abated. This section is also
adopted in the interests of safety and to avoid unnecessary property damage within the City.

§ 272-5. Native landscape.
[Amended 4-12-2010; 6-13-2011[1]]
"Native landscape" defined. "Native landscape," as used in this section, shall include common
species of grass and wildflowers native to North America which are designed and purposely
cultivated to exceed eight inches in height from the ground. Specifically excluded in native
landscapes are the noxious grasses and weeds identified in § 272-4 if this chapter. When a native
landscape exceeds 50% of that portion of a parcel not occupied by structures, the growth of a
native landscape in excess of eight inches in height from the ground surface shall be prohibited
within the City corporate limits, unless a native landscape management plan is approved and a
permit is issued by the City as set forth in this section. Native landscape shall not contain litter or
debris and shall not harbor undesirable wildlife.
"Native landscape management plan" defined.
"Native landscape management plan," as used in this section, shall mean a written plan
relating to the management and maintenance of a landscape which contains a legal
description of landscape upon which the planted grass will exceed eight inches in length, a
statement of intent and purpose for the landscape, a detailed description of the vegetational
types, plants and plant succession involved, and the specific management and maintenance
techniques to be employed.
Property owners who wish to plant and cultivate a native landscape must submit their written
plan and related information on the form provided by the City. "Property owner" shall be
defined to include the legal title holder and/or the beneficial owner of any such lot according to
most current City records. Native landscape management plans shall only indicate the
planting and cultivating of native landscape on property legally owned by the property owner.
Applicants are strictly prohibited from developing a native landscape on any street terrace or
street right-of-way. This shall include, at a minimum, property located between the sidewalk
and the street or a strip not less than 10 feet adjacent to the street where there is no sidewalk,
whether the area is under public or private ownership. In addition, native landscapes shall not
be permitted within 10 feet of the abutting property owner's property unless waived in writing

by the abutting property owner on the side so affected. Such waiver is to be affixed to the
landscape management plan.
Any subsequent property owner who abuts an approved native landscape may revoke the
waiver, thereby requiring the owner of the native landscape to remove the native landscape
that is located in the ten-foot section abutting the neighboring property owner. Such
revocation shall be put in writing and presented to the City Clerk-Treasurer by the subsequent
abutting property owner. Upon receiving the written request to revoke the original waiver, the
Common Council shall contact the owner of the approved native landscape and direct the
owner to remove the native landscape located in the ten-foot section abutting the neighboring
property owner. The Common Council shall revise the approved native landscape permit
accordingly. The owner of the approved native landscape shall be required to remove the tenfoot
section abutting the neighboring property owner within 20 days of receipt of the written
notification from the City, provided the notification is received sometime between May 1 and
November 1. Property owners who receive notification from the City between November 1
and April 30 shall be required to remove the ten-foot section abutting the neighboring property
owner no later than May 20 following receipt of the notification.
Application process.
Property owners interested in applying for permission to establish a native landscape shall
obtain and complete an application form available from the City Clerk-Treasurer. The
completed application shall include a native landscape management plan. Upon submitting a
completed application, a nonrefundable filing fee as set by resolution of the Common Council
will be assessed by the City. Upon receiving payment, copies of the completed application
shall be mailed by the City to each of the owners of record, as listed in the office of the City
Assessor, who are owners of the property situated wholly or in part within 300 feet of the
boundaries of the properties for which the application is made. If, within 15 calendar days of
mailing the copies of the complete application to the neighboring property owners, the City
receives written objections from 51% or more of the neighboring property owners, the City
Clerk-Treasurer shall immediately deny the application. "Neighboring property owners" shall
be defined as all those property owners who are located within 300 feet of the proposed
native landscape site.
If the property owner's application is in full compliance with the native landscape management
plan requirements and less than 51% of the neighboring property owners provide written
objections, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall issue a permit to install a native landscape. Such
permit shall be valid for three years. Permit renewals shall follow the procedures in this
section.
Application for appeal. The property owner may appeal the Clerk-Treasurer's decision to deny the
native landscape permit request to the Common Council at an open meeting. All applications for
appeal shall be submitted within 15 calendar days of the notice of denial of the native landscape
management plan. The decision rendered by the Common Council shall be final and binding.
Safety precautions for natural grass areas.
When, in the opinion of the Fire Chief of the District serving the City of Brodhead, the
presence of a native landscape may constitute a fire or safety hazard due to weather and/or
other conditions, the Fire Chief may order the cutting of native landscape to a safe condition.
As a condition of receiving approval of the native landscape permit, the property owner shall
be required to cut the native landscape within the three days upon receiving written direction
from the Fire Chief.
Native landscapes shall not be removed through the process of burning unless stated and
approved as one of the management and maintenance techniques in the landscape
management plan. The Fire Chief shall review all requests to burn native landscapes and
shall determine if circumstances are correct and all applicable requirements have been

fulfilled to insure public safety. Burning of native landscapes shall be strictly prohibited unless
a written permit to burn is issued by the Fire Chief. The Fire Chief shall establish a written list
of requirements for considering each request to burn native landscapes, thereby insuring the
public safety. In addition, the property owner requesting permission to burn the native
landscape shall produce evidence of property damage and liability insurance identifying the
City as a party insured. A minimum amount of acceptable insurance shall be $300,000.
Revocation of an approved native landscape permit. The Mayor, upon the recommendation of the
Weed Commissioner, shall have the authority to revoke an approved native landscape permit if
the owner fails to maintain the native lawn or comply with the provisions set forth in this section.
Notice of intent to revoke an approved native lawn management plan permit shall be appealable to
the Common Council. All applications for appeal shall be submitted within 15 calendar days of
receipt of written notice of intent to revoke the approved native landscape management plan.
Failure to file an application for appeal within the 15 calendar days shall result in the revoking of
the native landscape permit. All written applications for appeal filed within the fifteen-calendar-day
requirement shall be reviewed by the Common Council in an open meeting. The decision
rendered by the Common Council shall be final and binding.
"Public nuisance" defined; abatement after notice.
The growth of a native landscape as defined in this section shall be considered a public
nuisance, unless a native landscape management plan has been filed and approved and a
permit is issued by the City as set forth in this section. Violators shall be served with a notice
of public nuisance by certified mail to the last known mailing address of the property owner.
If the person so served with a notice of public nuisance violation does not abate the nuisance
within 10 days, the enforcement officer may proceed to abate such nuisance, keeping an
account of the expense of the abatement, and such expense shall be charged to and paid by
such property owner. Notice of the bill for abatement of the public nuisance shall be mailed to
the owner of the premises and shall be payable within 10 calendar days from receipt thereof.
Within 60 days after such costs and expenses are incurred and remain unpaid, the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall enter those charges onto the tax roll as a special tax as provided by state
statute.
The failure of the City Clerk-Treasurer to record such claim or to mail such notice or the failure
of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to place the City expense on the
tax rolls for unpaid bills for abating the public nuisance as provided for in this section.
Penalty.
Any person, firm or corporation which does not abate the nuisance within the required time
period or who otherwise violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to the general
penalty found in § 1-4.
In addition to any penalties herein provided, the City may issue stop-work orders upon owners
of lots where work is unfinished under a previously issued building permit for any violation of
this section.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 272-6. Length of lawn and grasses.
Purpose. This section is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated with lawns,
grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow to excessive length in the City of Brodhead.
Public nuisance declared. The Common Council finds that lawns, grasses and noxious weeds on
lots or parcels of land within the City of Brodhead which exceed eight inches in length adversely

affect the public health and safety of the public in that they tend to emit pollen and other
discomforting bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris can be
hidden in the grass, interfere with the public convenience and adversely affect property values of
other land within the City. For that reason, grass or weeds on a lot or other parcel of land which
exceeds eight inches in length is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, except for property
located in a designated floodplain area and/or wetland area or where the lawn, grass or weed is
part of a native landscape as defined in § 272-5A. This section does not apply to crops grown in
conformity with the provisions of Chapter 480, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Brodhead.
[Amended 6-13-2011; 4-16-2012]
Agricultural exemption.
[Added 4-16-2012]
Lots or parcels of land which are used for the growing of crops in conformity with the
provisions of Chapter 480, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Brodhead may apply for an
exemption to the provisions of this section by filing an application therefor with the City Clerk-
Treasurer. The completed application shall include a lawn management plan. Upon submitting
a completed application, a nonrefundable filing fee as set by resolution of the Common
Council will be assessed by the City. On receiving payment, copies of the completed
application shall be mailed by the City to each of the owners of record, as listed in the office of
the City Assessor, who are owners of property situated wholly or in part within 300 feet of the
boundaries of the properties for which the application is made. If, within 15 calendar days of
mailing the copies of the completed application to the neighboring property owners, the City
receives objections from 51% or more of the neighboring property owners, the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall deny the application. "Neighboring property owners" shall be defined as all
those property owners who have property located within 300 feet of the proposed agricultural
use property.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
If the property owner's application is properly filed and less than 51% of the neighboring
property owners provide written objections, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall issue a permit
exempting the property from the provisions of this section. Such permit shall be valid for three
years. Permit renewal shall follow the procedures in this section.
The property owner may appeal the Clerk-Treasurer's decision to deny the agricultural use
exemption permit request to the Common Council at an opening meeting. All applications for
appeal shall be submitted within 15 calendar days of the notice of the denial of the agricultural
use exemption. A decision rendered by the Common Council on the appeal shall be final and
binding.
Nuisances prohibited. No person, firm or corporation shall permit any public nuisance as defined
in Subsection B above to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him within the City.
Inspection. The Weed Commissioner or his designee shall inspect or cause to be inspected all
premises and places within the City to determine whether any public nuisance as defined in
Subsection B above exists.
Abatement of nuisance.
If the Weed Commissioner shall determine with reasonable certainty that any public nuisance
as defined in Subsection B above exists, he shall immediately cause written notice to be
served that the City proposes to have the lot grass or lawn cut so as to conform with this
section and § 272-5.
The notice shall be served at least five days prior to the date of the hearing and shall be
mailed or served on the owner of the lot or parcel of land or, if he/she is not known and there
is a tenant occupying the property, then to the tenant, of the time and place at which the
hearing will be held.

Due process hearing. If the owner believes that his grasses or weeds are not a nuisance, he/she
may request a hearing before the Common Council. The request for said hearing must be made in
writing to the City Clerk-Treasurer's office within the five days set forth in the Weed
Commissioner's notice. Upon application for the hearing, the property owner must deposit a bond
of $25. If a decision is rendered in the property owner's favor, the $25 will be returned to the
property owner. If the property owner fails to appear for the hearing or if the decision is rendered
against the property owner, the deposit shall be forfeited and applied to the cost of City personnel
abating the nuisance, if necessary. When a hearing is requested by the owner of the property, a
hearing by the Common Council shall be held within seven days from the date of the owner's
request. The property in question will not be mowed by the City until such time as the hearing is
held by the Common Council. At the hearing, the owner may appear in person or by his attorney,
may present witnesses in his/her own behalf and may cross-examine witnesses presented by the
City as well as subpoena witnesses for his/her own case. At the close of the hearing, the Common
Council shall make its determination in writing specifying its findings, facts, and conclusions. If the
Common Council determines that a public nuisance did exist, the Common Council shall order the
Weed Commissioner to mow the property in question, unless the property has been mowed by the
owner within 48 hours of the Common Council's decision. If the owner does not abate the
nuisance within the described 48 hours, the Weed Commissioner shall cause the same nuisance
to be abated and cost in excess of the forfeited fee assessed accordingly.

The Commission, upon specific approval of the Common Council, may adopt specific operating
guidelines for historic structure, historic site and historic district designation, providing such are in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 276-5. Powers and duties of Commission; certificate of
appropriateness.
Designation. The Commission shall have the power subject to § 276-6 to recommend designation
of historic districts, historic structures and historic sites within the City limits. Such recommended
designations shall be made based on § 276-4. Historic districts, historic structures and historic
sites may then be designated as such by the Common Council. Once designated, such historic

Regulation of construction, reconstruction, alteration and demolition.
No owner or person in charge of a designated historic structure, historic site or structure
within an historic district shall reconstruct, alter or demolish all or any part of the exterior of
such designated property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or
properties or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such designated property
or demolish such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the
Historic Preservation Commission. The Historic Preservation Commission will not initiate
requests for reconstruction, alteration or demolition of designated historic structures, historic
sites or for structures within a designated historic district. The Historic Preservation
Commission will only react to a request by an owner or person in charge for a building permit
to accomplish proposed reconstruction, alteration or demolition of such designated properties.
Unless such certificate has been granted by the Commission, the Building Inspector shall not
issue a permit for any such work.
Upon filing of any application for a certificate of appropriateness with the Commission, the
Commission shall approve the application unless:
In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would
detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior architectural feature of the
improvement or site upon which said work is to be done;
In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon an historic site, or within an
historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize
with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or within
the district;
In the case of any property located in an historic district, the proposed construction,
reconstruction, exterior alteration or demolition does not conform to the purpose and
intent of this chapter and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation
plan for said district;
The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its
demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare
of the people of the City and state;
The building or structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture, and/or
material that it could not be reproduced without great difficulty and/or expense;

In the case of the request for the demolition of a deteriorated building or structure, any
hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner is self-created or is the result of any failure to
maintain the property in good repair.
In addition, in determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission
shall consider and may give decisive weight to any or all of the following standards:
A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires
minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and
environment.
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of
historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall
be avoided.
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use.
Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural
features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance
in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship
that characterize a property shall be preserved.
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity
of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match
the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic
materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and
preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be
undertaken.
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to
protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a
manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic
property and its environment would be unimpaired.
If the Commission determines that the application for a certificate of appropriateness and the
proposed changes are consistent with the character and features of the property or district
and with the above guidelines, it shall issue the certificate of appropriateness. Upon the
issuance of such certificate, the building permit shall then be issued by the Building Inspector.
The Commission shall make this decision within 45 days of the filing of the application.
Agencies of the City and all public utility and transportation companies undertaking projects
affecting historic structures, historic sites or historic districts shall be required to obtain a
certificate of appropriateness prior to initiating any changes in the character of street paving,

sidewalks, utility installations, lighting, walls, fences, structures, and buildings on property,
easements, or streets owned or franchised by the City.
The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining
other permits and approvals required by the City. A building permit or other municipal permit
shall be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the certificate of appropriateness
required for the proposed work. Insofar as they are applicable to an historic structure, historic
site, or improvement in an historic district designated under this chapter, any provision of the
Plumbing Code, Electrical Code, or Building or Housing Code of the City shall apply, unless
waived by the appropriate state or City officials. The Commission may support or propose
such waivers before the appropriate state or City appeals body.
Compliance with certificates of appropriateness shall be started within 12 months after the
issuance of the certificate, and the work shall conform to the provisions of the certificate. The
City may inspect the work during and after construction in order to assure compliance. Failure
to comply with a certificate of appropriateness or failure to obtain a certificate of
appropriateness shall be a violation of this chapter. In addition to other penalties and
remedies, the City shall issue a stop-work order, and all work shall cease on the designated
property. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as such stop-work order shall
continue in effect.
Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a certificate of
appropriateness, provided that the work involves repairs to existing features of an historic
structure or site or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in
appearance, and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the
structure or site and does not require the issuance of a building permit.
Appeals. Should the Commission fail to issue a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of
the proposal to conform to the guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the Common
Council within 30 days. Upon appeal, the Common Council will review de novo the decision of the
Commission and may issue a certificate of appropriateness if deemed consistent with this chapter.
In addition, if the Commission fails to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall,
with the cooperation of the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of
appropriateness within the guidelines of this chapter.
Recognition of historic structures, sites and districts. At such time as an historic structure, site or
district has been properly designated, the Commission may cause to be prepared and erected on
such property, at City expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property is an historic
structure, site or district. Such plaque shall be so placed as to be easily visible to passing
pedestrians. The plaque shall state the accepted name of the historic property, the date of its
construction or significance, and other information deemed proper by the Commission.
Other duties. In addition to those duties already specified in this chapter, the Commission shall:
Work for the continuing education of the citizens about the historical heritage of this City and
the historic properties designated under the provision of this chapter.
Cooperate with the State of Wisconsin Historic Preservation Office and the State Historic
Preservation Review Board in attempting to include such properties hereunder designated as
landmarks or landmark sites or historic districts in the National Register of Historic Places and
the State Register of Historic Places.
As it deems advisable, receive and solicit funds for the purpose of historic preservation in the
City. Such funds shall be placed in a special City account for such purpose.

Designation of historic structures, historic sites and historic districts.
The Commission may, after notice and public hearing, recommend to the Common Council
that historic structures, historic sites and historic districts be designated as such by the
Common Council, or recommend rescinding such designation after application of the criteria
in § 276-4 above. At least 10 days prior to such hearing, the Commission shall notify the
owners of record, as listed by the office of the City Assessor, who are owners of property in
whole or in part situated within 200 feet of the boundaries of the property affected or within
the boundaries of the historic district. These owners shall have the right to confer with the
Commission prior to final action by the Commission on the recommended designation. Notice
of such hearing shall also be published as a Class 1 notice under the Wisconsin Statutes. The
Commission shall also notify the following: Department of Public Works, Redevelopment
Authority, Parks Division, Fire District, Police Department, Health Department, Building
Inspection Division and Plan Commission. Each such department may respond to the
Commission with its comments on the proposed recommended designation or recommended
rescission.
The Commission shall then conduct such public hearing and, in addition to the notified
persons, may hear expert witnesses and shall have the power to subpoena such witnesses
and records as it deems necessary. The Commission may conduct an independent
investigation into the proposed recommended designation or rescission. Within 10 days after
the close of the public hearing, the Commission may recommend the property be designated
as either an historic structure, historic site, or historic district, or recommend rescinding the
designation.
The Common Council may, after receiving the recommendation of the Commission, designate
the property as either an historic structure, historic site or an historic district or rescind such
designation. After the designation or rescission has been made, notification shall be sent to
the property owner or owners. Notification shall also be given to the City Clerk-Treasurer,
Building Inspection Division, Plan Commission, and the City Assessor. The Common Council
shall cause the designation or rescission to be recorded, at City expense, in the applicable
county register of deeds office.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Zoning of historic properties. The historic structure, historic site or historic district designation shall
constitute a change in zoning (H or HD) for historic preservation purposes and shall be included
as such on the official land use map. The (H or HD) zoning shall be in addition to the existing
underlying land use zoning.
Creation of historic district.
Selection. For preservation purposes, the Historic Preservation Commission shall select
geographically defined areas within the City to be designated as historic districts and shall,
with the assistance of the City Planning Department, prepare an historic preservation plan in
ordinance form for each area. An historic district may be designated for any geographic area
of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the City which:
Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the
nation, state or community; or
Is identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state or local
history; or
Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of architectural types or specimens inherently
valuable for the study of a period or periods, styles, methods or construction, or of
indigenous materials or craftsmanship; or

Is representative of the notable works of master builders, designers, or architects who
influenced their age; or
Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to history or prehistory.
Cultural and architectural analysis. Each historic preservation plan prepared for or by the
Historic Preservation Commission shall include a cultural and architectural analysis
supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development and a
statement of preservation objectives.
Guideline criteria. Guideline criteria to be considered in the development of historic district
plans are as follows:
All new structures shall be constructed to a height visually compatible with the building
and environment with which they are visually related.
The gross volume of any new structure shall be visually compatible with the buildings and
environment with which it is visually related.
In the street elevation of a building, the proportion between the width and height in the
facade should be visually compatible with the building and environment with which it is
visually related.
The proportions and relationships between doors and windows in the street facade
should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually
related.
The rhythm of solids to voids, created by openings in the facade, should be visually
compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related.
The existing rhythm created by existing building masses and spaces between them
should be preserved.
The materials used in the final facade should be visually compatible with the buildings
and environment with which it is visually related.
The texture inherent in the facade should be visually compatible with the buildings and
environment with which it is visually related.
Colors and patterns used on the facade (especially trim) should be visually compatible
with the buildings and environment with which it is visually related.
The design of the roof should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment
with which it is visually related.
The landscape plan should be sensitive to the individual building, its occupants and their
needs. Further, the landscape treatment should be visually compatible with the buildings
and environment with which it is visually related.
The street facade should blend with other buildings via directional expression. When
adjacent buildings have a dominant horizontal or vertical expression, this expression
should be carried over and reflected.
Architectural elements should be incorporated as necessary to relate the new with the old
and to preserve and enhance the inherent characteristics of the area.

responsible therefor as hereinafter provided. Such notice shall:
Be in writing.

thereof is sent by registered mail to his last known address; or if a copy thereof is posted
in a conspicuous place in or about the dwelling or dwelling unit affected by the notice; or
if he is served with such notice by any other method authorized or required under the
laws of this state.
The above notice may contain an outline of remedial action which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and with rules and regulations adopted
pursuant thereto.
Whenever there has been notice of a violation issued to the owner, the agent of any owner, or the
occupant of property which is in violation of this chapter, no further notice shall be necessary for
any reoccurrence of the violation prior to the commencement of any forfeiture action or prior to
seeking an injunction in a court of record.
Any person affected by any notice which has been issued in connection with the enforcement of
any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulations adopted pursuant thereto may request
and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the Building Inspector, provided that such
person shall file, in the office of the Building Inspector, a written petition requesting such hearing

shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show why such notice should be modified or
withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced no later than 10 days after the day on which the

aggrieved by the decision of the Building Inspector may seek relief therefrom in any court of
competent jurisdiction, as provided by the laws of this state.

permit, the license or permit last issued is void. If both licenses or permits are issued

application, and these officials shall inspect or cause to be inspected each application and the
premises, together with such other investigation as shall be necessary to determine whether the
applicant and the premises sought to be licensed comply with the regulations, ordinances and laws
applicable thereto, including those governing sanitation in restaurants, and whether the applicant is a
proper recipient of a license. These officials shall furnish to the City Clerk-Treasurer in writing, who
shall forward to the Common Council, the information derived from such investigation, accompanied by
a recommendation as to whether a license should be granted or refused. No license shall be renewed
without a reinspection of the premises and report as originally required.
§ 290-9. Application review; considerations.

Arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to the limitations imposed by
§§ 111.321, 111.322, and 111.335, Wis. Stats.;
The financial responsibility of the applicant;
The appropriateness of the location and the premises where the licensed business is to be
conducted; and
Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed.
An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the
applicant has been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually
been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been a law offender" is
generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two offenses which are substantially
related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding the license application.
Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right granted solely to the Common

Council, the Common Council reserves the right to consider the severity and facts and
circumstances of the offense when making the determination to grant, deny or not renew a
license. Further, the Council, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of
two or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years
immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one year or more.
§ 290-10. Issuance or denial of license.
Opportunity shall be given by the governing body to any person to be heard for or against the
granting of any license. Upon the approval of the applicant by the Common Council, the City
Clerk-Treasurer shall issue to the applicant a license, upon payment by the applicant of the
license fee to the City.
If the Common Council denies the license, the applicant shall be notified in writing, by certified
mail or personal service, of the reasons for the denial. The notice shall also inform the applicant of
the opportunity to appear before the Common Council and to provide evidence as to why the
denial should be reversed. In addition, the notice shall inform the applicant that the
reconsideration of the application shall be held in closed session, pursuant to § 19.85(1)(b), Wis.
Stats., unless the applicant requests such reconsideration be held in open session and the
Common Council consents to the request. Such written notice shall be mailed or served upon the
applicant at least 10 days prior to the Common Council meeting at which the application is to be
reconsidered.
§ 290-11. Transferability of license; replacement of agent of
licensee.
In accordance with the provisions of § 125.04(12), Wis. Stats., a license shall be transferable from
one premises to another if such transfer is first approved by the Common Council. An application
for transfer shall be made on a form furnished by the City Clerk-Treasurer. Proceedings for such
transfer shall be had in the same form and manner as the original application. The fee for such
transfer is $10. Whenever a license is transferred, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall forthwith notify
the Wisconsin Department of Revenue of such transfer. In the event of the sale of a business or
business premises of the licensee, the purchaser of such business or business premises must
apply to the City for reissuance of said license, and the City, as the licensing authority, shall in no
way be bound to reissue said license to said subsequent purchaser.
Whenever the agent of a corporate holder of a license is for any reason replaced, the licensee
shall give the City Clerk-Treasurer written notice of said replacement, the reasons therefor and the
new appointment. Until the next regular meeting or special meeting of the Common Council, the
successor agent shall have the authority to perform the functions and be charged with the duties
of the original agent. However, said license shall cease to be in effect upon receipt by the City
Clerk-Treasurer of notice of disapproval of the successor agent by the Wisconsin Department of
Revenue or other peace officer of the municipality in which the license was issued. The
corporation's license shall not be in force after receipt of such notice or after a regular or special
meeting of the Common Council until the successor agent or another qualified agent is appointed
and approved by the City.
§ 290-12. Numbering of license.

seminude acts, exhibitions and nude entertainment frequently occurs at commercial
establishments either selling or allowing consumption of alcohol beverages on the
premises; and
The Common Council further finds that there is a direct relationship of the consumption of
alcohol beverages and the nude and seminude activities mentioned above and an
increase in criminal activities, moral degradation, and the disturbance of the peace and
the good order of the community; and
The Common Council further finds that the activity of nude and seminude activity and the
consumption of alcohol beverages is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons
in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining property and harm the
economic welfare of the community as a whole; and
The Common Council has determined that the enactment of an ordinance prohibiting
nudity and sexual conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol beverages within the
City of Brodhead will prevent such undesirable conduct.
Improper exhibitions.
No initial or renewal license to sell alcohol beverages shall be granted to any person
operating a premises in violation of Subsection K(2)(b) below, nor shall any licensed
premises be permitted to operate in violation of Subsection K(2)(b) below.

Procedure. Whenever the holder of any license under this article violates any portion of this article
or Article II of this chapter, proceedings for the revocation of such license may be instituted in the
manner and under the procedure established by this section.
Abandonment of premises. Any licensee holding a license to sell alcohol beverages who
abandons such business shall forfeit any right or preference he may have to the holding of or
renewal of such license. Abandonment shall be sufficient grounds for revocation of any alcohol
beverage license. The losing of the licensed premises for at least six months shall be prima facie
evidence of the abandonment, unless extended by the Common Council. All persons issued a
license to sell alcohol beverages in the City for which a quota exists limiting the number of such
licenses that may be issued by the City shall cause such business described in such license to be

premises the licensee or permittee, the agent named in the license or permit if the licensee or
permittee is a corporation, or some person who has an operator's license and who is
responsible for the acts of all persons serving any fermented malt beverages to customers.
An operator's license issued in respect to a vessel under § 125.27(2), Wis. Stats., is valid
outside the municipality that issues it. For the purpose of this section, any person holding a
manager's license under § 125.18, Wis. Stats., or any member of the licensee's or permittee's
immediate family who has attained the age of 18 shall be considered the holder of an
operator's license. No person, including a member of the licensee's or permittee's immediate
family, other than the licensee, permittee or agent, may serve fermented malt beverages in
any place operated under a Class "A," Class "B," or "Class C" license or permit unless he or

supervision of the licensee, permittee, agent or a person holding an operator's license who is
on the premises at the time of the service.
Use by another prohibited.

of the City.
All applications are subject to an investigation by the Chief of Police and/or other appropriate
authority to determine whether the applicant to be licensed complies with all regulations,
ordinances and laws applicable thereto. The Police Department shall conduct an investigation
of the applicant, including, but not limited to, requesting information from the state,
surrounding municipalities, and/or any community where the applicant has previously resided
concerning the applicant's arrest and conviction record. Based upon such investigation, the
Chief of Police shall recommend, in writing, to the Common Council approval or denial of the
application. If the Chief of Police recommends denial, the Chief of Police shall provide, in
writing, the reasons for such recommendation.

Fee. The fee for a standard operator's license shall be as set by resolution of the Common
Council. There shall be an additional fee in the amount of the cost of an out-of-state

[Amended 4-14-2008[1]]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Provisional license. The City Clerk-Treasurer may issue provisional operator's licenses in
accordance with § 125.17(5), Wis. Stats. The provisional operator's license shall expire 60
days after its issuance or when an operator's license is issued to the holder, whichever is
sooner. The City Clerk-Treasurer may, upon receiving an application for a temporary
provisional license, issue such a license without requiring the successful completion of the
responsible beverage server training course as described herein. However, such temporary
license shall be used only for the purpose of allowing such applicant the privilege of being
licensed as a beverage operator pending his successful completion of the responsible
beverage server training course. The City Clerk-Treasurer may issue a provisional operator's
license upon having received a report from the City Police Department that the applicant does
not have an arrest or conviction record, is not a habitual law offender or has not been
convicted of a felony, unless subsequently pardoned where the circumstances of such arrest
or conviction substantially relates to the circumstances of the job of a licensed operator for
purposes of complying with §§ 125.32(2) and 125.68(2), Wis. Stats. A provisional license may
not be issued to any person who has been denied an operator's license by the Common
Council or who has had his operator's license revoked or suspended within the preceding 12
months. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall provide an appropriate application form to be
completed in full by the applicant. The City Clerk-Treasurer may revoke the provisional
license issued if he discovers that the holder of the license made a false statement on the
application. Following completion of the responsible beverage server training course and
notification from the school, the license application will be presented to the Council, with the
appropriate fee as prescribed in Subsection D(1) above for a one- or two-year operator's
license. If approved by the Council, the operator's license is issued.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Temporary license. The City Clerk-Treasurer may issue a temporary operator's license, at no
fee, provided that:
This license may be issued only to operators employed by, or donating their services to,
nonprofit corporations.
No person may hold more than one license of this kind per year.
The license is valid for any period from one day to 14 days, and the period for which it is
valid shall be stated on the license.
Issuance or denial of operator's licenses.
After the Common Council approves the granting of an operator's license, the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall issue the license. Such licenses shall be issued and numbered in the order
they are granted and shall give the applicant's name and address and the date of the
expiration of such license.
Denial of license; reconsideration hearing.
If the application is denied by the Common Council, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall, in
writing, inform the applicant of the denial, the reasons therefor, and of the opportunity to
request a reconsideration of the application by the Common Council in a closed session.
Such notice must be sent by registered mail to, or served upon, the applicant at least 10
days prior to the Council's reconsideration of the matter. At such reconsideration hearing,

the applicant may present evidence and testimony as to why the license should be
granted.
If, upon reconsideration, the Council again denies the application, the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons therefor. An applicant who is
denied any license upon reconsideration of the matter may apply to the Circuit Court
pursuant to § 125.12(2)(d), Wis. Stats., for review.
Considerations.
Consideration for the granting or denial of a license will be based on:
Arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to the limitations imposed by
§§ 111.321, 111.322, and 111.335, Wis. Stats.;
The financial responsibility of the applicant; and
Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed.
If a licensee is convicted of an offense substantially related to the licensed activity, the
Common Council may act to revoke or suspend the license.
An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the
applicant has been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has
habitually been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been a
law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two offenses
which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately
preceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a
right granted solely to the Common Council, the Common Council reserves the right to
consider the severity and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the
determination to grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the Common Council, at its
discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two or more offenses which are
substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding, act to
suspend such license for a period of one year or more.
Training course.
Except as provided in Subsection F(2) below, the Common Council may not issue an
operator's license unless the applicant has successfully completed a responsible beverage
server training course at any location that is offered by a technical college district and that
conforms to curriculum guidelines specified by the technical college system board or a
comparable training course, which may include computer-based training and testing, that is
approved by the Department of Revenue or the Educational Approval Board, or unless the
applicant fulfills one of the following requirements:[3]
The person is renewing an operator's license.
Within the past two years, the person held a Class "A," Class "B," "Class A," "Class B," or
"Class C" license or permit or a manager's or operator's license.
Within the past two years, the person has completed such a training course.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
The Common Council may issue a provisional operator's license to a person who is enrolled
in a training course under Subsection F(1) above and shall revoke that license if the applicant
fails successfully to complete the course in which he or she enrolls.

offenses.
Any person who shall violate any provision of this article of the Code of the City of Brodhead,

§ 345-5. Reservation of park space.
Policy on reservation. The City-owned park and park facilities and shelter areas are primarily for
the nonexclusive use of the residents and visitors of the City. However, under proper
circumstances, exclusive use of the same or parts thereof may be permitted. This section is
intended to regulate exclusive use of municipally owned parks, park facilities, park shelters or
parts thereof, excluding camping areas, in the City to the end that the general welfare of the City is
protected.
Reservation of park space. A person or group, firm, organization, partnership or corporation may
reserve the use of a park facility or a park shelter by written application filed with the Parks
Director for a permit for exclusive use of the same. The Parks Director shall issue permits for
exclusive use of a portion of a park or park shelter, while the Common Council shall issue permits
for the exclusive use of City parks. Park facilities are reserved on a first-requested-first-reserved
basis.
Application. Applications shall be filed with the Parks Director at least 14 days prior to the date on
which the exclusive use of the entire park is requested, or at least three days prior to the date on
which a park shelter or a portion of a park is to be used, and shall set forth the following
information regarding the proposed exclusive use:
The name, address and telephone number of the applicant.
If the exclusive use is proposed for a group, firm, organization, partnership or corporation, the
name, address and telephone number of the headquarters of the same and the responsible

necessary to a fair determination as to whether a permit should be issued.
Action on application. The Common Council shall act promptly on all applications for permits for
exclusive park use (not shelter use) after consulting with the applicant, if necessary.
Reasons for denial. Applicants may be denied for any of the following reasons:
If it is for a use which would involve a violation of federal or state law or any provision of this
Code.

If the granting of the permit would conflict with another permit already granted or for which
application is already pending.
If the application does not contain the information required by Subsection C above.
The application is made less than the required days in advance of the scheduled exclusive
use.
If it is for a use of the park or park facility at a date and time when, in addition to the proposed
use, anticipated nonexclusive use by others of the park or park facility is expected and would
be seriously adversely affected.
If the law enforcement requirements of the exclusive use will require so large a number of
persons as to prevent adequate law enforcement to the park, park facility or shelter area
involved or of the rest of the City.
The exclusive use will reasonably create a substantial risk of injury to persons or damage to
property.
The exclusive use is so poorly organized that participants are likely to engage in aggressive
or destructive activity.
Indemnification. Prior to granting any permit for exclusive use of the park, the City may require the
permittee to file evidence of good and sufficient sureties, insurance in force or other evidence of
adequate financial responsibility, running to the City and such other third parties as may be injured
or damaged, in an amount depending upon the likelihood of injury or damage as a direct and
proximate result of the exclusive use sufficient to indemnify the City and such third parties as may
be injured or damaged thereby, caused by the permittee, its agents or participants.
Permit not required for City activity. A permit is not required for exclusive use of the park or a park
facility sponsored by the City.
Permit revocation. The Common Council and/or Chief of Police after granting a permit may revoke
a permit already issued if it is deemed that such action is justified by an actual or potential
emergency due to weather, fire, riot, other catastrophe or likelihood of a breach of the peace or by
a major change in the conditions forming the basis of the issuance of the permit.
Form of permit. Each permit shall be in a form prescribed by the Common Council and shall
designate the park, park facility or shelter area involved, date, hours of the exclusive use, purpose
of the exclusive use and the name of the person, group, firm, organization, partnership or
corporation to which the permit is issued.
Class "B" fermented malt beverage wine cooler (picnic) licenses. When fermented malt beverages
or wine coolers are sold at any event in a City park as authorized by the Common Council by
§ 290-21A(4), a valid fermented malt beverage license or wine cooler license shall be obtained,
and the provisions of §§ 290-11 and 290-21 shall be fully complied with. Said license shall be held
by the same organization qualified to hold the Class "B" (picnic) licenses [§§ 125.26(6) and
125.51(10), Wis. Stats.] which also holds the park use permit for the event and shall be presented
to any law enforcement officer upon request.
[Amended 5-9-2005]
Care of facilities. Persons reserving City facilities shall be completely responsible for cleaning up
the facilities after the event to the satisfaction of City officials. Inadequate cleaning shall result in
the permit holders being billed for such cleanup costs.
Permit fee. A fee as set by resolution of the Common Council is hereby imposed to defray the
City's costs in processing and issuing park use permits which must be included with the
application required by Subsection C above.

No dog is permitted to enter a dog park without its owner or the owner's authorized agent
obtaining a yearly or daily dog park permit issued by the City. The owner/handler of the dog

No tobacco products are permitted.
No commercial or professional business may be conducted without prior approval of the

In addition to the vaccination requirements of § 178-2A, all dogs must be vaccinated against

No dog under four months of age is permitted access to the dog park.
All dogs must be accompanied by an owner/handler 16 years of age or older. All children
under 16 years of age must be under the direct supervision of an adult, and such children
enter the dog park at their own risk.
No child strollers or dog strollers are permitted.
Dogs must be under the voice control of their owner/handler at all times. An owner/handler
must stop their dog from digging and must fill any holes created by their dog.
Dog owners/handlers must carry a leash for their dog at all times and may not leave the dog
park without their dog.
All gates must be closed after entering or exiting the dog park.
Owners/handlers must exercise control over their dogs so that they do not disturb wildlife or

Payment of dog park permit fee in an amount determined by resolution of the Common
Council.
All required forms must be filed with and all fees paid to the Office of City Clerk/Treasurer or
the City Police Department.
Yearly permits will be issued on a calendar year basis.
Action on application.
The City Clerk/Treasurer or Chief of Police or their designee (approving authority) will review
each application and approve or deny the application based upon the criteria of Subsection B.
Denial of a permit may be appealed in writing to the Park Board and filed with the City
Clerk/Treasurer or City Police Department within 30 days of receipt of the notice of denial.
The approving authority may condition approval of the application upon such terms and the
conditions as are determined necessary to protect the public and ensure safe operation of the
dog park.
Upon approval of an application, the approving authority shall issue a permit for each dog
granted access to a dog park.
The dog park permit will specify all persons authorized to take the dog to a dog park. The
permit holder is jointly responsible with all persons taking a dog to a dog park to ensure
compliance with the requirements of all applicable ordinances.
Permit revocation, suspension, or nonrenewal.
Upon receipt of a signed and written complaint filed with the City Clerk/Treasurer or the City
Police Department alleging that a dog has bitten a person or another dog, is a vicious dog or
that the dog park permit holder or other person authorized to use said permit is violating dog
park rules, the City Clerk/Treasurer or Police Chief or their designee will send notice to the
dog park permit holder suspending their dog park permit for the dog until a final determination
of the complaint and of the revocation of the dog park permit in the event of a failure to appeal
the suspension. Upon receipt of the notice of suspension, the dog park permit holder has 10
days to submit to the City Clerk/Treasurer or Police Chief a written request for a hearing to
appeal the suspension and contest the complaint. Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the matter
will be scheduled for a hearing before the Park Board. If the dog park permit holder does not
timely appeal, the dog park permit will be revoked.
Following the hearing on an appeal, the Park Board may suspend or revoke the dog park
permit if it finds that the facts justify suspension or revocation for the protection of other users
of the dog park or to ensure continued operation of the dog park in conformity with the
ordinances governing its use. If the Park Board does not so find, it will reinstate the dog park
permit.

this chapter of the Code of the City of Brodhead may be required to forfeit amounts not to

An attempt to commit an act prohibited by Chapter 290, Intoxicating Liquor and Fermented
Malt Beverages, Article II; Chapter 301, Juveniles; Chapter 334, Nuisances; and this chapter
requires that the actor have an intent to perform acts and attain a result which, if
accomplished, would constitute a violation of these chapters and that he/she does acts
towards the commission of the violation which demonstrate unequivocally, under all the
circumstances, that he/she formed that intent and would commit the violation except for the
intervention of another person or some other extraneous factor.
Parties to acts prohibited in Chapter 290, Article II; Chapter 301; Chapter 334; and this chapter.
Whoever is concerned in the commission of an act prohibited by Chapter 290, Intoxicating
Liquor and Fermented Malt Beverages, Article II; Chapter 301, Juveniles; Chapter 334,
Nuisances, and this chapter of this Code is a principal and may be charged with and
convicted of the commission of said act although he/she did not directly commit it and
although the person who directly committed it has not been convicted of some other act
prohibited by these chapters.
A person is concerned in the commission of an act prohibited by these chapters if he/she:
Directly commits the act; or
Intentionally aids and abets the commission of it; or
Is a party to a conspiracy with another to commit it or advises, hires, counsels or
otherwise procures another to commit it. Such party is also concerned in the commission
of any other act which is committed in pursuance of the intended violation and which,
under the circumstances, is the natural and probable consequence of the intended
violation. This paragraph does not apply to a person who voluntarily changes his/her

OBSTRUCT
To interfere with unobstructed travel by any means, including but not limited to standing on

sidewalk.
SIDEWALK
Any sidewalk owned or maintained by the City. The term shall not include sidewalks or

that it is impossible for any pedestrian to travel along the sidewalk without leaving the sidewalk

§ 354-8. Loitering, prowling and soliciting.
[Amended 7-13-2009]
Loitering and prowling.
No person shall loiter or prowl in a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding
individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such
alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon appearance of a police or peace
officer, refuses to identify himself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object.
Unless flight by the actor or other circumstances makes it impracticable, a peace officer shall,
prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the actor an opportunity to dispel
any alarm which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him to identify himself and
explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police or peace officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if it

detained person shall be promptly informed of the purpose of the detention and be permitted to
make telephone calls, but shall not be interrogated or searched against his or her will before the
arrival of a law enforcement officer who may conduct a lawful interrogation of the accused person.
Compliance with this section entitles the official, agent or employee effecting the detention to the
same defense in any action as is available to a peace officer making an arrest in the line of duty.
Damaging material prohibited. No person shall mar, deface or in any other way damage or
mutilate any book, periodical, pamphlet, picture or other article or property belonging to or in

may be established by the approving authority are met.
In addition to all other requirements, the approving authority shall be satisfied that the
offender will not continue in violation of the rules and regulations before authorizing
reconnection of the offender's services. The approving authority may change the rules,
regulations, and sewer rates from time to time as it deems advisable and may make special
rates and contracts in all proper cases.
§ 373-3. Use of public sewers.
Sanitary sewers. No person(s) shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted waters
such as stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, or cooling water to any
sanitary sewer, except stormwater runoff from limited areas, which stormwater may be polluted at
times, may be discharged to the sanitary sewer by permission of the approving authority.
User connections.
The owner(s) of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment,
recreation, or other purposes, situated within the City and abutting on any street, alley or
right-of-way in which there is now located or may in the future be located a public sanitary
sewer, is hereby required at the owner(s) expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein and
connect such facilities directly to the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter within three months after the date of official notice from the approving authority.
The approving authority shall be responsible for properly notifying the owner(s).

Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of causing obstruction
to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the wastewater
facilities, such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal,
glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch
manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either
whole or ground, by garbage grinders.
The following described substances, materials, waters, or waste shall be limited to
discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or quantities which will not harm either
the sewers, wastewater treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect
on the receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or
constitute a nuisance. The approving authority may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations below if, in their opinion, such more severe
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming an opinion as to the
acceptability, the approving authority will give consideration to such factors as the
quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the
wastewater treatment facility, degree of treatability of the waste in the wastewater
treatment facility, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on material or
characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not
be violated without approval of the approving authority are as follows:
Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150° F. (65° C.).
Wastewater containing more than 25 milligrams per liter of petroleum oil,
nonbiodegradable cutting oils, or products of mineral oil origin.

processes.
Materials which exert or cause:
Unusual BOD chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in such
quantities as to constitute a significant load on the wastewater treatment facility.
Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting slugs as defined
herein.
Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to,
fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as,
but not limited to, sodium sulfate).
Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions).
No wastewater, regardless of character, shall be discharged to the wastewater system in such
a manner as to interfere with the designed operation of the collection system or treatment
facility or to cause the treatment works to exceed the limits established by the WPDES permit.
Special arrangements. No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting
any special agreement between the approving authority and any person whereby an industrial
waste of unusual strength or character may be admitted to the wastewater treatment works, either
before or after pretreatment works by reason of the admission of such wastes, and no extra costs
are incurred by the approving authority without recompense by the person, provided that all rates
and provisions set forth in this chapter are recognized and adhered to.
New connections. New connections to the wastewater collection system shall not be permitted if
there is insufficient capacity in the treatment works to adequately transport and/or treat, as
required by the WPDES permit, the additional wastewater anticipated to be received from such
connections.
Free service. No user shall receive free service or pay a user charge less than the user's
proportional share of operation and maintenance costs.
Outside service.
The City, by proper resolution of the Common Council, shall have the right, at its discretion,
upon payments, terms, and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon, to contract in writing
for the right to use any sewer serving property located wholly or partly outside the City's
corporate limits.
In the event a contract is made pursuant to Subsection H(1), a user of any sewer serving
property wholly or partly outside the City's corporate limits shall be subject to all of the terms
and provisions of this section and, in addition to all payments and charges, be treated equally
as to operation, maintenance and replacement charges (volume charge), regardless of their
location with respect to the corporate limits.
If any property of a person desirous of becoming a user is situated outside the City, the City,
at its discretion, may permit such a connection, provided that a contract providing essentially
the following be entered into between the City and the user:
The user may connect buildings situated on the fully described tract set forth in the
agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of the
City and local, state and federal governments.

The wastes and material discharged shall meet all present and future standards for
content and volume, and the user shall further agree to pay all future connections, user
and treatment or service charges which are applicable to all property and users uniformly.
Unmetered connections to individual residential users shall be charged a user fee which
is the average of residential user fees paid in the metered system.
The user, his successors and assigns shall, in addition to costs noted previously, pay
quarterly 150% of the fixed charge portion of the sewer service charge for debt
retirement. The total sewer service charge may be adjusted further to reflect variations in
capital costs for outside users.
The amount computed for use shall be prorated from the date of the contract if the
user used the sewer system for only a partial year.
If the user, or any successor or assigns thereof, shall fail to pay the amount when
due, each and every sewer upon the property, or any subdivided tract thereof, for
which payment is not made shall be disconnected by the owner from any other
sewer which was connected under the contract and ultimately attaches to the City
treatment plan. The user shall have caused or required its sewer system to be
constructed within the property in order that separate tracts may be so disconnected
and hereby gave and granted the City an irrevocable easement for the purpose of
going upon the same and disconnecting any such sewer if the producer, its
successors or assigns fails to disconnect promptly when such is required.
In addition to the right of disconnection, the City shall have a lien upon the property
or subdivision portion of it in the amount of any unpaid charges due therefrom. Upon
the filing of notice, the lien shall be deemed perfected, and the lien may be charged
and redeemed or foreclosed and the property sold to satisfy the unpaid charges in
accordance with the Wisconsin Statutes.
The City shall have the additional right to file a civil suit to recover the amount of the
lien, the full cost incurred in disconnection, and all its reasonable legal expenses and
attorneys' fees incurred as a result of the suit.
All amounts charged under Subsection H(3)(c) are due and shall continue to be due
hereunder, whether or not said sewer is disconnected, and no sewer shall be
reconnected until the City is paid in full for all amounts due it, and, in addition, the
City shall be paid a deposit equal to the estimated charge for the next succeeding
year. This deposit shall be held by the City in escrow and will be returned upon
satisfactory payment of amounts due the City for a period of two years.
The City shall not, without its prior written consent and acceptance, have dedicated to it,
or own, any sewer system installed within the property, and the producer, its successors
and assigns shall maintain the same at its own cost; provided, however, that this
provision shall not be construed to prohibit the dedication of part or all of said sewer
system to another unit of government.
Upon conveyance by the owner of all or any subdivided portion or tract of said property,
the successor in title shall succeed to all rights and liabilities hereunder, and said owner
shall have no future liability to the City thereunder in respect to such tract except as shall
have accrued as of the date the instrument of conveyance is recorded in the office of the
applicable county register of deeds, State of Wisconsin.[1]

The agreement executed under Subsection H(3) shall be recorded in the office of the
applicable county register of deeds, which recording shall constitute notice to any
successor or assign of the owner of its terms and provisions and to which any
subsequent conveyance or assignment of the owner shall be subject.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.

If any part or provision of the agreement shall be found or held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entire agreement shall terminate and
all sewers of the owner or its successors or assigns shall be promptly disconnected from
any such system which ultimately connects to the City treatment plant.
The applicant for treatment service under an agreement pursuant to Subsection H(3)
shall agree to assume user charges, industrial waste charges, and capital surcharges, if
applicable, and to obtain from the City the proper building permit by which the connection
is allowed and the discharge permit, if applicable, which indicates what discharge will be
made to the treatment system.
§ 373-4. Control of industrial wastes directed to public sewers.
Submission of basic data.
Within three months after passage of this chapter, firms discharging industrial wastes to a
public sewer shall prepare and file with the approving authority a report that shall include
pertinent data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the wastes discharged to the
wastewater works. Such information shall be provided as per Ch. NR 101, Wis. Adm. Code.
Similarly, each person desiring to make a new connection to the public sewer for the purpose
of discharging industrial wastes shall prepare and file with the approving authority a report
that shall include actual or predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the
waste to be discharged.
Extension of time. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would create an
unreasonable burden on the person to comply with the time schedule imposed by Subsection A, a
request for extension of time may be presented for consideration to the approving authority.
Industrial discharges.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or proposed to be discharged to the public sewers,
which waters or wastes contain substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this
section and which, in the judgement of the approving authority, may have a deleterious effect
upon the wastewater works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life, health, or constitute a public nuisance, the approving authority may:
Reject the wastes;
Require pretreatment to an acceptable limit for discharge to the public sewers;
Require control over the quantities and rate of discharge; and/or
Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not
covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of this chapter.[1]

need not be limited to, the list of toxic pollutants or combination of pollutants established by
Section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act of 1977 and subsequent amendments.[2] Effluent
standards or prohibitions for discharge to the sanitary sewer shall also conform to the
requirements for Section 307(a) and associated regulations.
Editor's Note: See 33 U.S.C. § 1317(a).
Pretreatment standards for those pollutants which are determined not to be susceptible to
treatment by the treatment works or which would interfere with the operation of such works
shall conform to the requirements and associated regulations of Section 307(b) of the Clean
Water Act of 1977 and subsequent amendments.[3] The primary source for such regulations
shall be 40 CFR 403, General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of
Pollution.
Editor's Note: See 33 U.S.C. § 1317(b).
Control manholes.
Each user discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall construct and maintain one
or more control manholes or access points to facilitate observation, measurement and
sampling of the waste, including domestic wastewater.
Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in a manner acceptable to the
approving authority. If measuring devices are to be permanently installed, they shall be of a
type acceptable to the approving authority.
Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall be installed by the user
discharging the waste, at the user's expense, and shall be maintained by the user so as to be
in safe condition, accessible, and in proper operating condition at all times. Plans for
installation of the control manholes or access facilities and related equipment shall be
approved by the approving authority prior to the beginning of construction.
Measurement of flow from high-strength or toxic waste dischargers.
The volume of flow used for computing the user charge shall be the metered water
consumption of the person as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the
Water Utility, except as noted in Subsection F.[4]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Provision for deductions. In the event that a person discharging industrial waste into the
public sewers produces evidence satisfactory to the approving authority that more than 20%
of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the public sewer,
then the determination of the water consumption to be used in computing the waste volume
discharged into the public sewer may be made a matter of agreement between the approving
authority and the person. Satisfactory evidence shall be evidence obtained by approved
metering.
Metering of industrial waste. Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the approving authority if this volume cannot otherwise be determined from the
metered water consumption records. Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall
be installed, owned, and maintained by the discharger. A maintenance schedule must be accepted
by the approving authority. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed
without the consent of the approving authority.
Waste sampling.
Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and
a determination of character and concentration of said wastes. The determination shall be
made by the industry as often as may be deemed necessary by the approving authority.

authorized representatives at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of
samples to ensure their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was
taken.
Analyses.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which
reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods." Sampling methods, location times, durations, and frequencies are to be
determined on an individual basis, subject to approval by the approving authority.
Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes shall be made by
the user discharging them, or his agent, as designated and required by the approving
authority. The approving authority may also make its own analyses on the wastes, and these
determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges.
Pretreatment. Where required, in the opinion of the approving authority, to modify or eliminate
wastes that are harmful to the structures, processes or operation of the wastewater treatment
works, the person shall provide at his expense such preliminary treatment or processing facilities
as may be determined required to render his wastes acceptable for admission to the public
sewers.
Submission of information. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to
proposed flow equalizations, pretreatment, or processing facilities shall be submitted for review of
the approving authority prior to the start of their construction if the effluent from such facilities is to
be discharged into the public sewers.
Grease and/or sand interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the approving authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in § 373-3D(1)(e)[3], or any
flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters to dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the approving authority and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible
for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the approving
authority. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner's
personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.

regulations of the approving authority or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of
the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight
and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by
the approving authority before installation.
Plumbers. No plumber, pipe fitter, or other person will be permitted to do any plumbing or pipefitting
work in connection with the collection system without first receiving a license from the State
of Wisconsin and posting a one-thousand-dollar bond with the City of Brodhead, except in cases
where state law permits building owners to do their own work without being licensed.
Inspection of connection. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the approving
authority when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The
connection shall be made under the supervision of the approving authority.
Barricades restoration. All excavations for the building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks,
parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a
manner satisfactory to the approving authority.
Installation of building sewers. All building sewers on private property will be installed in
accordance with Ch. 382, Wis. Adm. Code. Per § SPS 382.21, Wis. Adm. Code, all building
sewers will be inspected. The building sewer and/or private interceptor main sewer shall be
inspected upon completion of placement of the pipe and before backfilling and tested before or
after backfilling.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Excavations.
In making excavations in streets or highways for laying building sewers or making repairs, the
paving and earth removed must be deposited in a manner that will occasion the least
inconvenience to the public. No person shall leave any such excavation made in any street or
highway open at any time without barricades; and during the night, warning lights must be
maintained at such excavations.
In refilling the opening, after the building sewers are laid, the earth must be laid in layers of
not more than 12 inches in depth and each layer thoroughly compacted to prevent settling.
This work, together with the replacing of sidewalks, gravel and paving, must be done so as to
make the street as good, at least, as before it was disturbed and satisfactory to the City and
applicable county. No opening of the streets for tapping the pipes will be permitted when the
ground is frozen, except in emergencies.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
A permit from the approving authority or other appropriate governmental body shall be
obtained prior to excavating in any street, alley or other public way. Such permit shall be
obtained and exhibited to the City Clerk before a connection permit will be issued.
Tapping the mains.
No person, except those having special permission from the approving authority, or persons
in their service and approved by them, will be permitted under any circumstances to tap the
mains or collection pipes. The kind and size of the connection with the pipe shall be that
specified in the permit or order from said approving authority.
Pipes should always be tapped on the top, and not within 15 inches (38 cm) of the joint, or
within 36 inches (90 cm) of another lateral connection.

All connections to existing sewer mains shall be made with a saddle "T" or "Y" fitting set upon
a carefully cut opening centered on the upper quadrant of the main sewer pipe and securely
strapped on with corrosion-resistant straps or rods, or with solvent-welded joints in the case of
plastic pipe.
§ 373-7. Connections to wastewater collection system.
Mandatory hookup.
The owner of each parcel of land adjacent to a sewer main on which there exists a building
usable for human habitation or in a block through which such system is extended shall
connect to such system within 90 days of notice in writing from the approving authority. Upon
failure to do so, the approving authority may cause such connection to be made and bill the
property owner for such costs. If such costs are not paid within 30 days, such costs shall be
assessed as a special tax lien against the property, all pursuant to § 281.45(1), Wis. Stats.;
provided, however, that the owner may, within 30 days after the completion of the work, file a
written request with the utility stating that he cannot pay such amount in one sum and asking
that it be levied in not to exceed five equal annual installments, and the amount shall be so
collected with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the completion of the work, the
unpaid balance being a special tax lien, all pursuant to § 281.45(1), Wis. Stats.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
In lieu of the above, the approving authority, at its option, may impose a penalty for the period
that the violation continues, after 10 days' written notice to any owner failing to make a
connection to the sewer system, of an amount equal to 150% of the average residential
charge for sewer service, payable quarterly for the period in which the failure to connect
continues, and, upon failure to make such payment, said charge shall be assessed as a
special tax lien against the property, all pursuant to § 281.45(1), Wis. Stats.
This chapter ordains that the failure to connect to the sewer system is contrary to the
minimum health standards of said approving authority and fails to assure preservation of
public health, comfort, and safety of said approving authority.
Maintenance of services.
The Utility shall maintain sewer service within the limits of the approving authority for the
street mains and sewer laterals, without expenses to the property owner, except when they
are damaged as a result of negligence or carelessness on the part of the property owner, a
tenant, or an agent of the property owner. All sewer services from the point of maintenance by
the system to and throughout the premises must be maintained free of defective conditions,
by and at the expense of the owner or occupant of the property.
When any sewer service is to be relaid and there are two or more buildings on such service,
each building shall be disconnected from such service, and a new sewer shall be installed for
each building.
Application to connect proposed new wastewater system.
Any person located within the corporate limits of the approving authority desiring to connect a
proposed new wastewater system to the wastewater treatment works shall make a written
application to the approving authority for permission to make such connection or use. The
application shall include a statement of the location or locations at which it is desired to
connect and a statement of the character of the wastewater to be transmitted.
The approving authority shall select an engineering consultant to design all proposed
wastewater systems. All costs and expenses incident to the design and bidding, including
engineering, permits and other fees associated with the connection or hookup to the

wastewater collection system, shall be borne by the developer requesting the extension. Prior
to the design of a sewer extension, the developer shall secure and furnish proof of an escrow
account for the estimated amount of the design costs, the amount to be determined by the
approving authority. The account shall be so arranged and an escrow agreement executed
between the developer, the bank, and the approving authority to allow the latter to withdraw
amounts from the account. The account shall be sufficient to cover payments to all parties
under contract with the approving authority for the design of the wastewater system. This
money will not be refunded if the project does not proceed to construction.
Alterations.
Alterations to existing wastewater systems connected to the wastewater treatment works shall
be treated as proposed new wastewater systems. The approving authority may modify this
provision if the sewer connection is not directly connected to an approving authority sewer
and providing the person has previously presented and has had approved a general overall
sewer plan. If such a modification is made, it will be done in writing and must be kept on file
by the person to which it applies.
After sewer connections have been made in a building or upon any premises, no plumber
shall make any alterations, extensions or attachments unless the party ordering such work
shall exhibit the proper permit.
Permit to connect. Prior to permitting such connection or use, the approving authority may
investigate, or cause to be investigated, the wastewater system for which such connection or use
is requested. If the approving authority finds such system to be in a satisfactory condition, it will
grant a permit for such connection or use. If the approving authority finds such system to be
defective in operation, construction, design, or maintenance, the approving authority will so notify
the applicant and will advise him that, upon completion of specified alterations, new construction,
or changes in supervision or operation, a permit will be granted. Should the plans or specifications
not be approved, one copy will be returned to the applicant, who will be informed as to the reason
for nonapproval.
Reserve capacity. Prior to permitting any connection or use of the treatment works, the approving
authority shall ascertain that all downstream sewers, interceptors, lift stations, force mains, and
treatment works have sufficient reserve capacity for volume, suspended solids and BOD, to
assure adequate collection and treatment of the additional wastewater contributed to the
wastewater treatment works. The approving authority reserves the right to refuse a connection or
use permit if the requirements for this subsection cannot be met with the granting of the permit.
Inspections and supervision during construction. During the construction of any wastewater
system which the approving authority has approved, the approving authority may, from time to
time, inspect the same to see that said work is being done in accordance with the approval plans
and specifications. Failure to make such inspections shall not nullify the rights of the approving
authority to require reconstruction should nonadherence to approved plans be subsequently
discovered. Every person in the construction of laterals or wastewater systems, within its
jurisdiction, shall require that such construction be under the direction of a Wisconsin-registered
professional engineer or licensed master plumber, if plan approval was obtained under his license.
The engineer or master plumber shall keep accurate records of the location, depth, and length of
the sewers as built and of the location of the Y-branches or slants.
Permits not granted. Permits shall not be granted for the connection of combined sewers to the
interceptors or municipal sewers. Permits shall not be granted for the connection of any proposed
or existing storm sewers to the approving authority wastewater treatment works. Connection of
catch basin or curb inlets to any sanitary sewer directly or indirectly connected to the wastewater
treatment works is strictly prohibited.
Physical connection. All proposed sewer connections shall be planned to be made at a manhole
with the flow lines of the connecting sewer being at or below the manhole shelf, or the connection

shall be made through an approved drop. At least 24 hours before connection is to be made,
notice of such intent must be given to the approving authority. When the actual connection is
made, it must be done in the presence of an approving authority inspector.
Records. Records of connections to the wastewater collection system shall be kept by the
municipality in which such connections are made, and such records shall be available for
inspection by the approving authority.
User use only. No user shall allow others or other services to connect to the wastewater collection
system through his building sewers and building drains.
User to permit inspection. Every user shall permit the approving authority or its duly authorized
agent, at all reasonable hours of the day, to enter their premises or building to examine the pipes
and fixtures and the manner in which the drains and sewer connections operate, and they must at
all times, frankly and without concealment, answer all questions put to them relative to its use.
Utility responsibility. The Utility and its agents and employees shall not be liable for damages
occasioned by reason of the breaking, clogging, stoppage, or freezing of any building sewers or
building drains, nor from any damage arising from repairing mains, making connections or
extensions or any other work that may be deemed necessary. The right is hereby reserved to cut
off the water and sewer service at any time for the purpose of repairs, or any other necessary
purpose, and permit granted or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding. Whenever it shall
become necessary to shut off the sewer service within any district of the said approving authority,
the approving authority shall, if practicable, give notice to each and every consumer affected
within said approving authority of the time when such service will be so shut off.
User to keep in repair. All users shall keep their own building sewers and building drains in good
repair and protected from frost, at their own risk and expense, and shall prevent any unnecessary
overburdening of the sewer system.
New connection hookup fee. At the time of application pursuant to Subsection C to connect to the
wastewater treatment works, the applicant shall pay to the approving authority a new connection
hookup fee for each connection/lateral or, in the event a connection/lateral serves more than one
dwelling unit (as defined in § 480-110 of the Code of the City of Brodhead), a hookup fee for each
dwelling unit, as approved by the approving authority.

§ 373-8. Septic tanks and holding tanks.
Septic tanks and holding tanks prohibited. The maintenance and use of septic tanks, holding tanks
or other private disposal systems within the sewer service area of the approving authority serviced
by its wastewater collection system are hereby declared to be a public nuisance and a health
hazard. The use of these systems is prohibited, unless a special permit is obtained from the
approving authority. Upon abandonment of the septic tank or holding tank, the tank shall be filled
with sand or gravel in a manner acceptable to the approving authority.
Septic tank and holding tank disposal.
No person in the business of gathering and disposing of septic tank or holding tank wastes
shall transfer such material into any disposal area or manhole located within the approving
authority boundaries, unless a permit for disposal has been first obtained from the approving
authority. Written application for this permit shall be made to the approving authority and shall
state the name and address of the applicant; the number of its disposal units; and the make,
model and license number of each unit. Permits shall be nontransferable except in case of
replacement of the disposal unit for which a permit shall have been originally issued. The

approving authority. Any applicant for a permit shall furnish a bond to the approving authority
in the amount of $5,000 to guarantee performance. The bond shall be provided prior to the
permit being issued. The time and place of disposal will be designated by the approving
authority. The approving authority may impose such conditions as it deems necessary on any
permit granted. Bills shall be mailed on a monthly basis, and if payments are not received
within 30 days thereof, disposal privileges shall be suspended.
Any commercial hauler of septic tank or holding tank wastes agrees to carry public liability
insurance in an amount not less than $100,000 and to protect any and all persons or property
from injury and/or damage caused in any way or manner by any act, or failure to act, by any
of his employees. A certificate certifying such insurance to be in full force and effect shall be
furnished to the approving authority.
Any wastes discharged into the treatment system shall be of domestic origin and will comply
with the provisions of any and all applicable ordinances of the approving authority. A
discharger shall not deposit or drain any gasoline, oil, acid, alkali, grease, rags, waste, volatile
or inflammable liquids or other deleterious substances into any manhole, nor allow any earth,
sand or solid material to pass into any part of the wastewater system.
Any person or party disposing of septic tank or holding tank wastes agrees to indemnify and
save harmless the approving authority from any and all liability and claims for damage arising
out of or resulting from work and labor performed.
§ 373-9. Damaging or tampering with wastewater facilities.
Willful, negligent or malicious damage. No unauthorized persons shall maliciously, willfully or
negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance,
or equipment which is a part of the wastewater facilities. Any persons violating this provision shall
be subject to immediate arrest under a charge of disorderly conduct.
Liability for losses. Any person who intentionally, negligently, or accidentally violates any
provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the approving authority or any downstream user
for any expense, loss or damage occasioned by reason of such violation which the approving
authority or any downstream user may suffer as a result thereof. This section shall be applicable
whether or not a written notice of the violation was given as provided in § 373-10A and without
consideration for any penalties which may be imposed for a violation of this chapter.
§ 373-10. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
Written notice of violation. Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter shall be
served by the approving authority with a written notice stating the nature of the violation and
providing a reasonable time for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the
period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
Accidental discharge. Any person found to be responsible for accidentally allowing a deleterious
discharge into the sewer system which causes damage to the treatment facility and/or receiving
body of water shall, in addition to a fine, pay the amount to cover damage, both values to be
established by the approving authority.
Continued violations. Any person, partnership or corporation, or any officer, agent or employee
thereof, who shall continue any violation beyond the aforesaid notice time limit provided shall,
upon conviction thereof, pay a forfeiture of not less than $10 nor more than $2,500, together with

mandatory hookup provision in § 373-7A or any other right the approving authority may have.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Liability to approving authority for losses. Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall
become liable to the approving authority for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned by reason
of such violation which the approving authority may suffer as a result thereof.
Differences of opinion. The approving authority attorney shall arbitrate differences between the
approving authority and sewer users on matters concerning interpretation and execution of the
provisions of this chapter by the approving authority.
Damage recovery. The approving authority shall have the right to recover any expense incurred by
the approving authority for the repair or replacement of any property owned by the approving
authority damaged in any manner from the person responsible for such damage.
Any user discharging toxic pollutants shall pay for any increased operation, maintenance, and
replacement costs caused by said discharge, in addition to any other charge or penalties provided
herein.
§ 373-11. Billing practice.
Billing period. User charges for all customers shall be billed on a monthly basis.
Payment. User charges shall be payable at the office of the approving authority or any other
officially designated location.
Penalties. Charges levied in accordance with this chapter shall be a debt due to the approving
authority. If the debt is not paid within 20 days after it is due and payable, it shall be deemed
delinquent. There shall be an added penalty of the greater of 3% of the amount of the monthly bill
or $1.50. Charges and penalties shall constitute a lien upon the property serviced and be recorded
on the City's tax roll. Change of ownership or occupancy of the premises found delinquent shall
not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties.
Notification. Each user shall be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate
schedule attributable to wastewater treatment services, including an explanation of the charges.
Billing. The property owner shall be held responsible for all bills on premises that he owns. All bills
and notices of any nature, relative to the sewer service, will be addressed to the owner and/or
occupant and delivered to the addressee by first-class mail.
Failure to receive bill; no penalty exemption. Every reasonable care will be exercised in the proper
delivery of bills. Failure to receive a bill, however, shall not relieve any person of the responsibility
for payment of user charges within the prescribed period, nor exempt any person from any penalty
imposed for delinquency in the payment thereof.
Delinquent bills. On October 15 in each year, notice shall be given to the owner or occupant of all
lots or parcels of real estate to which service has been furnished prior to October 1 and payment
for which is owing and in arrears at the time of given such notice. The Utility shall furnish the City
Treasurer with a list of all such lots or parcels of real estate, and the notice shall be given by the
Utility. Such notice shall be in writing and shall state the amount of such arrears, including any
penalties assessed pursuant to the rules of the Utility; that unless the same is paid by November 1
thereafter, a penalty of 10% of the amount of such arrears will be added thereto; and that, unless
such arrears, with any such added penalty, shall be paid by November 15 thereafter, the same will
be levied as a tax against the lot or parcel of real estate to which service was furnished and for
which payment is delinquent. Such notice may be served by delivery to both such owner and to

the occupant if different from the owner at the post office address of such lot or parcel of real
estate, and if the owner has a different address, at the owner's address as well. Each such
delinquent amount, including such penalty, shall thereupon become a lien upon the lot or parcel of
real estate to which the service was furnished and payment for which is delinquent. All
proceedings in relation to the collection of general property taxes and to the return and sale of
property for delinquent taxes shall apply to said tax if the same is not paid within the time required
by law for payment of taxes upon real estate.
[Amended 11-11-2002]
§ 373-12. Hearing procedures.
No fine shall be levied under § 373-11C and no indemnity shall be assessed under § 373-11G
except upon due hearing regarding the violation permitting the alleged violator to show cause, if
any there be, before the approving authority why a fine should not be imposed pursuant to § 373-
11C or why assessment should not be made pursuant to § 373-11G or any combination of the two.
An order for hearing issued by the approving authority shall be served upon the alleged violator in
the same manner as a summons is served under Wisconsin Statutes, and it shall be returnable
before the approving authority at a time certain, not sooner than five days after service.
The order for hearing may contain ex parte interim orders pendente lite as may appear (by
testimony or appropriate documents filed with the approving authority or both) necessary to
protect the public health, welfare or safety on an emergency basis, including but not limited to
temporary termination of service.
Testimony taken before the approving authority will be under oath or affirmation and recorded
stenographically. A transcript thereof will be made available to any member of the public, including
but not limited to any party to the hearing, upon payment of the usual charges therefor.
After the approving authority has reviewed the evidence, it may impose any fine authorized by
§ 373-11C or assess any indemnity authorized by § 373-11G as, in the judgement of the
approving authority, is warranted by the evidence. The approving authority may issue such further
orders and directives as it deems appropriate, including orders requiring the violator to pay the full
costs of the proceedings, including the approving authority's technical, administrative, and other
costs in developing its proofs and reasonable attorney fees.
A violator may avoid the hearing herein provided by written waiver stipulating guilt presented to
the approving authority at least 24 hours prior to the hearing time. The approving authority will
meet nevertheless, will make no stenographic transcript, will give the violator an opportunity to be
heard in mitigation and may then act in accordance with this section, except that the violator shall
not be required to pay any costs of the proceeding.
§ 373-13. Annual audit.
The City of Brodhead shall conduct an annual audit, the purpose of which shall be to reestablish the
equity and adequacy of the user charges relative to changes in system operation and maintenance
costs.
§ 373-14. Effective date of rates and charges.
The rate increase will take place in two phases. The Phase One rate increase shall take effect and be
in force July 20, 1997. This chapter shall take effect and be in force after the Phase One rate increase.
The fixed and volume charges after the Phase One increase shall be $3.50/1,000 gallons and
$18/quarter per meter equivalent. The Phase Two rate increase shall take effect and be in force
January 20, 2000. The fixed and volume charges shall be as shown in Schedule Nos. 1 through 8.

office of the City Clerk.
Duration of use. Sewer deduction meters may be used only from May 1 through October 1 of
each year.
Billing. Reductions to billings based upon sewer deduction meter readings shall be applied to
the next billing cycle ending October 1 of each year. Sewer deduction meter charges shall be
added to that billing for all installed sewer water deduction meters regardless of actual use of
the sewer deduction meters.
Test and repair. Brodhead Sewer Utility has the right to test and repair sewer deduction
meters as necessary. The residential user property owner shall be billed for all expenses
arising out of said testing and/or repair.

§ 393-2. Findings; purpose.
Policy declaration. The Common Council finds runoff from land disturbing activities carries a
significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to the waters of the state and the City of
Brodhead.
Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to preserve the natural resources; to protect the quality
and quantity of the surface water and groundwater of the state and City; and to protect and
promote the health, safety and welfare of the people, to the extent practicable, by minimizing the
amount of sediment and other pollutants carried by runoff or discharge from land disturbing
activities to lakes, streams and wetlands. The Common Council finds that land uses have
significantly contributed to the process of soil erosion, runoff, and sediment deposition in waters
located within or near the City. It is, therefore, declared to be the purpose of this article to control
and, if possible, prevent soil erosion and water runoff increases and, thereby, to preserve the
natural resources, control floods, and prevent impairment of dams and reservoirs, protect the
quality and quantity of public waters and wetlands, prevent property damage, preserve wildlife,
protect the tax base and protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people
of the City of Brodhead. This article is in accordance and consistent with Chapter 480, Zoning, of
the Code of the City of Brodhead, so far as practicable.
§ 393-3. Applicability; exclusions.
Scope of coverage. This article applies to land disturbing and land developing activities on land
within the boundaries and jurisdiction of the City and the public and private lands subject to
extraterritorial review under Ch. 236, Wis. Stats. All state-funded or -conducted construction is
exempt from this article. This article shall apply outside the City limits within the extraterritorial plat
review area provided by Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., and Chapter 472, Subdivision of Land, but only to
those land disturbing activities relating to, arising from, or connected with a subdivision as defined
in § 236.02(12), Wis. Stats., and certified surveys as defined in this Code.
Exclusions. The following activities are generally excluded from coverage under this article:
State-funded or -conducted activities that are subject to the State Site Erosion Control and
Stormwater Runoff Plan. State-funded or -conducted construction activities must meet the
requirements contained in the State Plan for the Control of Construction Erosion and
Stormwater Runoff, which contains similar requirements as contained in this article, as a
minimum.
Agricultural land uses as defined in this article and quarries, except where the Common
Council, Plan Commission, City Engineer or Building Inspector determine that erosion or
runoff from such agricultural or quarry uses is likely to occur which will threaten watercourses
or other environmentally sensitive areas unless control measures are taken.
Small land disturbing activities such as gardens, minor landscaping modifications and minor
repair of sidewalks, paths or driveways, except where the Common Council, Plan
Commission, City Engineer or Building Inspector determine that erosion or runoff is likely to
occur which will threaten watercourses or other environmentally sensitive areas unless control
measures are taken.

§ 393-8. Erosion and runoff control standards.
Management practices.
Temporary best management practice needs for various drainage areas. The following
temporary best management practices shall be used to control sediment where erosion of the
site, including dirt piles, during construction will result in sediment reaching waters of the
state, public sewers or other off-site areas:
Small drainage areas with overland flow (generally less than one acre). For drainage
areas with overland flow (generally less than one acre), a filter fabric fence or equivalent
best management practice placed along the downslope areas and along the sideslope
areas as required or the disturbed area shall be properly mulched.
Drainage areas of two acres or less with concentrated or channelized flow. For drainage
areas of two acres or less with concentrated or channelized flow, a filter fabric barrier or
equivalent best management practice placed at the downslope point of the disturbed
area or the disturbed area shall be properly mulched.
Drainage areas of five acres or less with concentrated or channelized flow, a sediment
trap or equivalent best management practice placed at the downslope point of the
disturbed area.
Drainage areas of more than five acres with concentrated or channelized flow. For
drainage areas of more than five acres with concentrated or channelized flow, a sediment
basin or equivalent best management practice placed at the downslope point of the
disturbed area. The basin shall be properly maintained and cleared out when necessary.
Steep slopes. Slopes of 12% or more may require use of additional best management
practices.
Sequenced activities. All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to
minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time and the amount of soil leaving the

site.
Site stabilization. When the disturbed area is properly stabilized by established vegetation or
other permanent means, the temporary best management practices may be removed.
NOTE: Permanent best management practices specified in the Wisconsin Construction Site
Best Management Practice Handbook include sodding; seeding; grassed waterway;
geotextile reinforced grassed waterway; and rock- and concrete-lined waterway.
Tracking minimization. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and parking areas
of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private
roadways. Any significant sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by
street cleaning before the end of each workday. Flushing may not be used unless the
sediment will be controlled by a filter fabric barrier, sediment trap, sediment basin or
equivalent.
Drain inlet protection. Downslope on-site storm drain inlets shall be protected.
Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be discharged to an appropriately sized
filter fabric barrier, sediment trap, sediment basin or equivalent best management practice.
NOTE: Site dewatering on some sites is covered under the Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System Permit Program.
Sediment cleanup.
All off-site sediment deposits occurring as a result of a storm event shall be cleaned up
by the end of the next workday following the occurrence.
All other off-site sediment deposits occurring as a result of construction activities shall be
immediately cleaned up.
Waste and material management and disposal. All waste and unused building materials shall
be properly managed and disposed to prevent pollutants and debris from being carried by
runoff off the site.
Roof drainage. All roof drainage from permanent buildings shall discharge to pervious
surfaces to increase infiltration and reduce increases in runoff except where demonstrated to
be infeasible and a written waiver is granted by the City Engineer or Building Inspector.
Additional erosion control standards to be met on larger sites. These control standards are in
addition to the minimum control standards as set forth in Subsection A and thus include, but are
not limited to, all sites involving land divisions, subdivisions or certified survey maps (where land
divisions, subdivisions or certified survey maps involve either one or more acres or create five or
more lots or building sites), or all sites where one or more acres are disturbed at a time, where
special circumstance due to topography, proximity to watercourses or relation to environmentally
sensitive lands make the disturbance a major one, and shall meet the added control plan
requirements as set up by the City Engineer or Building Inspector. These requirements may
include required public dedication of water runoff control measures. The permittee is responsible
for obtaining compliance with the control plan requirements. Informal guidelines for the control
plan for a major land disturbing activity are hereto attached and incorporated herein as a part of
this article as an addendum.
Special circumstances. The control standards set forth in this article are intended to apply on a
typical development site. When land disturbing and/or development activity is proposed for a site
with extraordinary features, the Plan Commission may recommend to the Common Council and
the Council, at its discretion, will require additional and/or more restrictive control standards and
measures before any control plan is approved or permit is issued. Extraordinary sites include, but

slopes of more than 12% grade in designated floodplain, wetland, or conservancy areas or in
environmental corridor areas identified in the City Master Plan.
Land disturbing activities subject to stormwater runoff control.
Land disturbing activities on public lands as defined herein and on all private lands shall be
subject to the runoff control provisions of this section, if:
The activity will be a residential development having less than 50% impervious area,
disturbing more than five acres;
The activity will be a residential development having more than 50% impervious area,
disturbing more than three acres;
The activity will be a nonresidential development, disturbing more than three acres; or
A parking lot of one acre or more; or
In the opinion of the City Engineer, the runoff from the land disturbing activity will create a
hazard by exceeding the safe capacity of the receiving water body in the area; or will
cause undue channel erosion or an undue increase in water pollution by increased scour
and transport of particles; or will otherwise endanger the downstream property owners or
their property. "Safe capacity" is defined as the rate of flow that can be handled without
flooding.
The owner, land occupier or land user shall be in compliance with this subsection if he follows
the procedure of Subsection E and receives from the City Engineer an approved control plan
and a permit before commencement of any land disturbing activities on lands subject to
control under this section.

a written appeal with the City Clerk prior to the utility charge due date if not paid, or within 30 days
of payment. The appeal shall specify all basis for the challenge and the amount of the stormwater
charge the customer asserts is appropriate. Failure to file a timely challenge waives all right to a
later challenge of that charge.
The Superintendent will determine whether the stormwater charge is fair and reasonable or
whether a refund is due the customer. The Superintendent may act with or without a hearing and
will inform the customer in writing of his or her decision.
The customer has 30 days from the decision of the Superintendent to file a written appeal to the

Article I. Grades
[Adopted as Title 6, Ch. 1, of the 1997 Code]
§ 398-1. Establishment of grades.
Grades to be established. The grade of all streets, alleys and sidewalks shall be established by
resolution by the Common Council, upon the recommendation of the Director of Public Works, and
the same recorded by the City Clerk-Treasurer in his office. No street, alley or sidewalk shall be
worked until the grade thereof is established. In all cases where the grade of sidewalks shall not
have been specifically set by ordinance, the sidewalks shall be laid to the established grade of the
street. All such grades heretofore established are hereby confirmed.
Sidewalk grades. Whenever a street shall be improved for the first time or the grade thereof
changed and the street improved so as to conform to the new grade, the grading of the sidewalk
shall be considered a part of the improvement, shall be let by contract with the other work of
improving such street, and the expense thereof shall be provided for and borne in all respects like
that of improving the street, but the construction shall be done by the owners of the abutting lots or
parcels of land or at their expense as hereinafter provided. Before such construction is
commenced by the owners of the abutting lots or parcels of land, the Common Council, or its
designee, shall, upon application by the respective owners for a sidewalk grade, cause such
sidewalk grade to be established.
§ 398-2. Alteration of grade prohibited.
No person shall alter the grade of any street, alley, sidewalk or public ground or any part thereof in the
City of Brodhead by any means whatsoever unless authorized or instructed to do so by the Common
Council or Director of Public Works. All such alterations of grade shall be recorded in the office of the
City Clerk-Treasurer.
§ 398-3. Underground construction.
Elevation. The grade or elevation of all underground construction shall be a minimum of three feet
below the established grade of the street, alley, park, public property or easement. The three feet
shall be measured between the top of the established grade and the top of the underground
construction.
Approval of location. The location of any and all such underground construction must have the
approval of the Director of Public Works.
Filing plans. Complete plans for any such construction must be filed with and be approved by the
Director of Public Works before construction can begin.
Inspection. On request of the Director of Public Works, the utility company must provide
opportunity for City officials to check any construction before it may be covered.
Conflict with other utilities. If the grade or elevation herein set for the underground construction of
utilities shall, in any instance, conflict with other existing utilities, the utility shall be required to
lower the elevation of its underground construction at the election of the Director of Public Works
and in accordance with its directions and specifications.
Establishment of grade. At the request of the utility company, the Director of Public Works shall, at
the City's expense, give the utility company an established grade on any streets, alleys, public

parks or easements where it proposes to install underground utilities.
Emergency. In case of an emergency, when immediate action is necessary in order to protect life
or property, the utility company may proceed with underground construction subject to obtaining
the approval of such work by the Director of Public Works as soon thereafter as is reasonably
possible.
Restoration of surface. In the event of any such underground construction, the utility company
shall leave the surface of the ground, or road, in the same condition as before said work was
commenced, and in the event of its failure so to do, the City may proceed to place the surface of
the ground or street in such condition at the utility company's expense. Such work shall comply
with the provisions of §§ 398-6 and 398-7.
Nonrelief from obligations. Compliance with this section does not relieve the utility company from
any responsibility of any kind whatsoever by reason of the widening of the travelway or any other
improvements which may become necessary, nor does it relieve it from any liability of any kind or
nature whatsoever. Compliance with this section shall not relieve the utility company from the
responsibility or obligation of removing, relocating or moving any of its mains, pipes or property
due to the opening, widening or improving of streets, or due to any other changes which may
occur by reason of which such moving, relocation or removing may be necessary.
Article II. General Regulations
[Adopted as Title 6, Ch. 2, of the 1997 Code]
§ 398-4. Removal of rubbish and dirt from sidewalks.
No owner or occupant shall allow the sidewalk abutting on his premises to be littered with rubbish or
dirt. If such owner or occupant shall refuse or fail to remove any such rubbish or dirt when notified to
do so by the Common Council, or its designee, the City may cause the same to be done and report the
cost thereof to the City Clerk-Treasurer, who shall spread the cost on the tax roll as a special tax
against the premises, pursuant to § 66.0627, Wis. Stats., or such cost may be recovered in an action
against the owner or occupant.

sidewalk contrary to the provisions of this article, unless by petition to the Common Council
and having permission therefor granted by the Council, or upon the Common Council's own
motion, or where such a change in the specifications hereinafter set forth shall be deemed in
the best interests of the City.

[Amended 3-14-2005]
It shall be the duty of the abutting owner to build, repair, construct, and perpetually
maintain sidewalks along or upon any street, alley or highway in the City and to pay the
entire cost thereof. Whenever the Common Council shall by resolution determine that a
sidewalk be laid, rebuilt, repaired, lowered, or raised along or upon any public street,
alley, or highway within the City, it shall proceed according to Subsection E or, at its
option, proceed according to § 66.0703, Wis. Stats. Such costs shall be specially
assessed 100% to the property owner of land adjacent to the right-of-way in which such
sidewalk is located.
Except in the case of new subdivisions, the expense of constructing sidewalks shall be
borne entirely by the owner of the land adjacent to the right-of-way in which such
sidewalk is located, except that on corner lots the City shall pay for all sidewalks lying
within the property lines extended, which portion of the sidewalk would not be abutting
any privately owned lot or piece of property.
Corner lots. The expense of constructing sidewalks shall be borne entirely by the owner of the
land adjacent to the right-of-way in which such sidewalk is located, except that on corner lots
the City shall pay for all sidewalks lying within the property lines extended, which portion of
the sidewalk would not be abutting any privately owned lot or piece of property.
[Amended 3-14-2005]
Sidewalk permit required. No person shall hereafter lay, remove, replace or repair any public
sidewalk within the City of Brodhead unless he/she is under contract with the City to do such work
or has obtained a permit therefor from the Building Inspector or his/her designee at least seven
days before work is proposed to be undertaken. Denial of such permits may be appealed to the
Common Council.
Standard specifications for sidewalk.
General. All sidewalks constructed in the City shall conform to the line and grade established
by the ordinances or resolutions of the City. Where no grade has been established as
ascertained by the records, the City Engineer shall prepare and report a grade for the
approval of the Common Council, and, when the same has been established, the City
Engineer shall stake out the sidewalk as ordered by the Council. No sidewalk shall be laid
under the provisions of this section until a grade therefor has been established by the
Common Council.
Subgrade. All earth, dirt and material shall be removed to a depth, not less than eight inches,
10 inches across private driveways, below the grade line, and the space shall be filled with
crushed stone, sand or gravel. The base shall be left four inches thick after being tamped,
with the stone or gravel to be not larger than 1 1/2 inches in diameter and to be free from dirt,

dust and foreign matter. Soft, porous and unsuitable subgrade material shall be removed and
replaced with sand, gravel, or other satisfactory material, and the subgrade shall be
thoroughly and uniformly compacted and moistened immediately before the concrete is
placed. On embankments, the subgrade shall extend at least one foot beyond each edge of
the sidewalk.
Concrete. The minimum quantity of cement per cubic yard shall be six sacks of 94 pounds
each. Concrete shall be mixed for at least one minute. Gravel shall be of good quality and
washed. Concrete shall test 3,000 pounds compression in 28 days.
Forming. Concrete shall be placed in straight forms of wood or metal of sufficient strength to
resist springing, tipping or other displacement during the process of depositing and
consolidating the concrete. Concrete shall be placed in the forms on a moist subgrade,
deposited just above the finished grade and consolidated and spaded sufficiently to bring the
mortar to the surface and to prevent honeycombing. It shall then be struck off level with the
top of the forms and finished with wooden flats. Forms shall be securely fastened, staked,
braced and held firmly to required line and shall be sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of
mortar, and all forms shall remain in place for 24 hours after pour.
Concrete sidewalks width and thickness. Concrete sidewalks and sidewalk ramps shall be
four inches in thickness, four feet in width, and, unless otherwise directed by the Common
Council, constructed of nonreinforced concrete.
Concrete driveway sidewalk width and thickness. Concrete sidewalk at driveways shall be six
inches in thickness and constructed of nonreinforced concrete.
Joints. Unless otherwise directed by the Common Council, the sidewalk shall be cut into
blocks five feet in length.
Slope. The minimum slope from the top of the curb (either existing or as established by
ordinance) to the street side of the sidewalk shall be 1/4 inch per foot. The maximum slope
from the top of the curb as above described to the street side of the sidewalk shall be one
inch per foot. The sidewalk grade shall, in all cases be parallel to the grade of the top of the
curb. The slope of the sidewalk from the street side to the property side shall be 1/4 inch per
foot.
Extreme grades. In cases where the grade exceeds 15%, steps or special construction shall
be required to fit the existing conditions. Such details shall be prepared by the City Engineer
and approved by the Common Council before construction of the walk is started.
Finishing. The concrete shall be struck off true to grade, finished smooth and given a broom
finish in transverse direction. Edges and joints shall be given a finish with a one-fourth-inch
radius edging tool. Dry cement shall not be spread on a wet surface to take up excess water.
Finishing operations shall be delayed until water has disappeared. No tool marks shall be left
on exposed surfaces. In case of rain, the walk shall be covered to protect the surface from
being damaged. Walks shall be kept free from all traffic at normal temperatures for 48 hours
and in cold weather (below 50° F.) for 96 hours.
Curing and drying. As soon as any of the concrete work hereinbefore mentioned has been
finished and hardened sufficiently to prevent excessive marring of the surface, it shall be
cured and protected against rapid drying. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be
deemed sufficient cause for suspension of the work. Curing shall be accomplished by the
"Impervious Coating," "Wet Fabric" or "Paper" Methods. For impervious coating or membrane
curing, only those materials meeting requirements of ASTM Spec. C156-44T, "Method of Test
for Efficiency of Materials for Curing Concrete," shall be used. Said specifications are hereby
adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein.

different for different streets, and may order by ordinance or resolution sidewalks to be laid as
provided in this subsection.
Defective sidewalks. The Council may order any sidewalk which the Director of Public Works
deems unsafe, defective, or insufficient to be repaired or removed and replaced with a

or sections.
Deterioration of the surface to a vertical depth of 1/2 inch or more within any
individual sidewalk block or section.
A block or section that is depressed or raised 3/4 inch and has more than three

If 75% of the sidewalk in front of any parcel is defective, the entire sidewalk in front of the
parcel shall be replaced.
Notice. A copy of the ordinance, resolution or order directing such laying, removal,
replacement, or repair shall be served upon the owner, or any agent, of each lot or parcel of

Certified or registered mail; or
Publication in the official newspaper as a Class 1 notice, under Ch. 895, Wis. Stats.,

Default of owner. If the property owner shall fail to so repair or remove and replace such
sidewalk within 30 days after service of notice under Subsection E(3), the Common Council
may cause the work to be done at the expense of the owner. All work for the construction of
sidewalks shall be let by contract to the lowest responsible bidder, except as provided in
§ 62.15(1) Wis. Stats.
Minor repairs. If the cost of repairs of any sidewalk in front of any lot or parcel of land does not
exceed the sum of $100, the Director of Public Works may immediately repair such sidewalk
without notice or letting the work by contract and charge the cost thereof to the owner of such
lot or parcel of land, as provided in this section.

be paid in up to seven annual installments with interest.
Illegal sidewalks. No sidewalk which shall be constructed contrary to the provisions of this section
shall be considered a legal sidewalk, and the same may be ordered to be replaced with a legal

harmless the City of Brodhead and its officers from all liability for accidents and damage
caused by any of the work covered by his/her permit, and that he/she will fill up and place in
good and safe condition all excavations and openings made in the street and will replace and
restore the pavement over any opening he/she may make as near as can be to the state and
condition in which he/she found it and keep and maintain the same in such condition, normal
wear and tear excepted, to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works for a period of one
year, and that he will pay all fines or forfeitures imposed upon him/her for any violation of any
rule, regulation or ordinance governing street openings or drainlaying adopted by the

City. Such bond shall also guarantee that, if the City shall elect to make the street repair, the
person opening the street will pay all costs of making such repair and of maintaining the same
for one year. Recovery on such bond for any accident, injury, violation of law, ordinance, rule
or regulation shall not exhaust the bond, but it shall cover any and all accidents, injuries or
violation of law during the period of excavation for which it is given.
An annual bond may be given under this section covering all excavation work done by the
principal for one year beginning January 1, which shall be conditioned as specified above and

The person who does such restoration shall be responsible therefor for one year from the
date of the completion of the work and shall file a written guarantee or surety bond to that
effect with the City in an amount determined by the Director of Public Works.
Whenever the Common Council shall find that any such work has become defective within
one year of the date of completion, it shall give written notice thereof to the contractor or to his
surety stating the defect, the work to be done, the cost thereof and the period of time deemed
by the Common Council to be reasonably necessary to complete said work. After receipt of

other traffic control devices by the permittee as may be required by the City and in
accordance with Section VI of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Sufficient
warning lights shall be kept on from sunrise to sunset. No open-flame warning devices shall
be used. Except by special permission from the Director of Public Works, no trench shall be
excavated more than 250 feet in advance of pipe or conduit laying nor left unfilled more than
500 feet from where pipe or conduit has been laid.
All necessary precautions shall be taken to guard the public effectively from accidents or
damage to persons or property through the period of the work. Each person making such
opening shall be held liable for all damages, including costs incurred by the City in defending
any action brought against it for damages, as well as cost of any appeal, that may result from
the neglect by such person or his employees of any necessary precaution against injury or
damage to persons, vehicles or property of any kind.
Unless otherwise approved, a minimum of one lane of traffic in each direction shall be
provided. Every effort shall be made on the part of the permittee to provide reasonable
access to all properties adjacent to his project. In the event traffic is limited to less than one
lane in each direction, a flagman or temporary traffic control signal shall be provided so as to
safely cycle traffic in each direction past the work area.
The permittee shall perform the work in such a manner so as not to disrupt the flow of traffic

Pavement removal.
Removal of existing pavement shall be to neat, straight lines. The permittee shall make a final
saw cut in the existing pavement after backfilling. Excavations shall be kept to the minimum
possible and acceptable for the convenience and safe performance of his work and in
accordance with all applicable codes and regulations.
If the pavement is damaged during excavation beyond the original saw cut lines, it shall be
saw cut again along neat, straight lines. The finished saw cut shall leave a regular rectangular
section for pavement replacement. Should the street opening occur within adjacent or close to
an existing patch or require more than one opening within a short distance, the permittee shall
identify and locate the existing patches or additional openings on the permit application form.

point of the saw cut to insure a full depth of concrete at the joint.
Excavation.
All excavated material shall be piled in a manner such that pedestrian and motor traffic is not
unnecessarily disrupted. Gutters shall be kept clear or other satisfactory provisions made for
street drainage, and natural watercourses shall not be obstructed.

to be of as little inconvenience as practical to public travel and adjoining tenants.
Backfilling.
All backfill material shall be free from cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable or organic matter,
boulders, rocks or stones greater than eight inches in their greatest dimension, frozen lumps
or other material which, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works or his designee, is
unsuitable.
In refilling the excavation, if there is not sufficient material excavated suitable for refilling, the
deficiency shall be made up with material, approved prior to use by the Director of Public
Works or his designee, hauled in.
When pipelaying has been completed in any street, all trenches shall be refilled with sand
and/or gravel, to a height of not less than the present grade of said street at the time of the
excavation and extending full length into the property line. Sand and/or gravel shall be used

In refilling the opening, the fill must be placed in layers of not more than nine inches in depth
and each layer puddled and/or rammed to more than nine inches in depth and each layer
puddled and/or rammed to prevent aftersetting. If the permit holder shall neglect or refuse to
have such work done immediately upon completion of the work involving the sewer and/or
water connection or any other work requiring the excavation of the street, the proper repairs
or work will be done by the Department of Public Works and the cost thereof charged to the

repairs, and the cost thereof shall be charged to the permit holder.
Backfill material shall be left below the original surface to allow for five inches of three-inch
crushed stone and four inches of three-fourths-inch crushed stone, plus the thickness of the

operation, the balance of the opening to the original surface elevation shall be backfilled with
compacted three-fourths-inch crushed stone.
Bituminous pavement shall be placed the full depth of the existing pavement or three inches,
whichever is greater. Bituminous pavement shall be placed in a maximum of one-and-onehalf-
inch layers, with each layer compacted to maximum density, and shall consist of
Wisconsin Department of Transportation Gradation No. 1 for the binder course and Wisconsin
Department of Transportation No. 3 for the surface course. The finished surface shall be

make an additional payment into the general fund of the City in an amount equal to the increased
costs.
§ 398-37. Emergency revocation.

Intent and purpose. It is the policy of the City of Brodhead to regulate and establish a policy for the
control of planting, removal, maintenance and protection of trees and shrubs in or upon all public
areas and terrace areas of the City to eliminate and guard against dangerous conditions which
may result in injury to persons using the streets, alleys, sidewalks or other public areas; to
promote and enhance the beauty and general welfare of the City; to prohibit the undesirable and
unsafe planting, removal, treatment and maintenance of trees and shrubs located in public areas;
and to guard all trees and shrubs, both public and private, within the City against the spread of
disease, insects or pests.
Power to regulate trees and shrubs.
The Common Council has empowered the City Forester to plant, transplant, remove, trim,
treat and otherwise care for and protect all trees, shrubs and plants on all public lands not
specifically delegated to other City boards, all to insure public safety and to preserve and
enhance the beauty of such public lands.
Public lands under the jurisdiction of the City Forester include but are not limited to all lands
within the lines of all public streets and alleys in the City, more specifically the terrace strip
between the lot line and curb or improved portion of any public street or alley.
The Common Council is empowered to require landowners to remove, trim or treat specified
trees, shrubs or plants under certain conditions and to prohibit the planting of certain trees or
tree species, shrubs or plants on private lands within the City of Brodhead.

Dutch elm and other tree diseases a public nuisance. Whereas the Common Council has
determined that there are many trees growing on public and private premises within the City, the
loss of which would substantially depreciate the value of public and private property, impair the
use and enjoyment of public and private premises and erode the tax base of the City, and that the
health and life of such trees is threatened by fatal diseases such as Dutch elm disease, which is
spread by the elm bark beetles Scolytus multistriatus (Eichb.) or Hylurgopinus rufipes (Marsh.),
the Common Council hereby declares its intention to control and prevent the spread of such
disease and the insect pests and vectors which carry such diseases and specifically declares
Dutch elm disease and the elm bark beetles which carry such disease to be public nuisances.

In order to facilitate the work and minimize the inconvenience to the public of any spraying
operations conducted under this section, the Forester shall cause to be given advance public
notice of such operations by newspaper, radio, television, public service announcements or
other effective means and shall also cause the posting of appropriate warning notices in the
areas and along the streets where trees are to be sprayed at least 24 hours in advance of

tree, bush, shrubbery or vegetation to remove such obstruction.
Any shrub, tree or other plant which obstructs the view at an intersection or the view of a traffic
sign shall be deemed to be dangerous to public travel, and the City Forester may order, by written
notice, the owner or occupant of any private place or premises on which there stands a tree or
shrub which unreasonably interferes with or encroaches upon the street or sidewalk to take such
steps as are necessary to remove such interference. If such owner or occupant fails, within 10
days of receipt of notice, to take such necessary steps, the City Forester shall order City
employees to remove the interference. The cost of removing the interference shall be levied and
collected as a special tax upon the property upon which or in front of which such tree or shrub
stands.

Dangerous, obstructive and infected trees on private property. Any tree or part thereof, whether
alive or dead, which the City Forester shall find to be infected, hazardous or a nuisance so as to
endanger the general public or other trees, plants or shrubs growing within the City, or to be
injurious to sewers, sidewalks or other public improvements growing upon private premises, shall
be removed, trimmed or treated by the owner of the property upon or adjacent to which such tree
or part thereof is located. The City Forester shall give written notice to said owner to remedy the
situation which shall be served personally or posted upon the affected tree. Such notice shall
specifically state the period of time within which the action must be taken, which shall be within not
less than 24 hours nor more than 14 days as determined by the City Forester on the basis of the
seriousness of the condition of the tree or danger to the public. If the owner shall fail to remove,
treat or trim said tree within the time limited, the City Forester shall cause the tree to be removed,
treated or trimmed and shall report the full cost thereof to the City Clerk-Treasurer, who shall
thereupon enter such cost as a special charge against the property.
Dangerous, obstructive and infected trees on public property. Any tree or part thereof, whether
alive or dead, which the City Forester finds to be infected, hazardous or a nuisance so as to
endanger the general public or other trees, plants or shrubs growing within the City, or to be

right of first refusal to keep the wood, provided such wood is not diseased.
Private removal. No person, firm, organization or corporation shall plant, injure, trim, remove or
destroy any tree or shrub located in or upon any public place, until a permit shall have been issued
by the City Forester. Such permit shall be issued only when the removal, trimming or cutting of the
tree or shrub is necessary, as determined by the City Forester, because of disease, damage,
hazardous condition, and/or location, or its location is such that substantial detriment is done to
the property upon which the tree or shrub stands, or property abutting the same. Such permit shall
expressly state the premises upon which the tree stands and the location of the tree thereon.
§ 415-10. Protection of trees.

Application for water service shall be made in writing on a form furnished by the Water Utility. The
application will contain the legal description of the property to be served, name of the owner, the
exact use to be made of the service, and the size of the supply pipe and meter desired. (Note
particularly any special refrigeration, fire protection, and/or air-conditioning water-consuming
appliances.)
Service will be furnished only if:
The premises have a frontage on a properly platted street or public strip in which a cast-iron
or other long-life water main has been laid or where the property owner has agreed to and
complied with the provisions of the Utility's filed main extension rule;
The property owner has installed or agrees to install a service pipe from the curbline to the
point of use and laid not less than seven feet below the surface of an established or proposed
grade, and according to the Utility's specifications; and
The premises have adequate piping beyond the metering point.
The owner of a multiunit dwelling has the option of being served by individual metered water
service to each unit. The owner, by selecting this option, is required to provide interior plumbing
and meter settings to enable individual metered service to each unit and individual disconnection
without affecting service to the other units. Each meter and meter connection will be a separate
Water Utility customer for the purpose of the filed rules and regulations.
No division of the water service of any lot or parcel of land shall be made for the extension and
independent meterage of the supply to an adjoining lot or parcel of land. No division of a water
supply service shall be made at the curb for separate supplies therefrom for two or more separate
premises having frontage on any street or public service strip, whether owned by the same or
different parties.
The Utility is hereby empowered to withhold approval of any application wherein full information of
the purpose of such supply is not clearly indicated and set forth by the applicant property owner.
§ 440-3. Service contract; reconnection charge.
The minimum service contract period shall be one year, unless otherwise specified by special
contract or in the applicable rate schedule. Where the Utility service has been disconnected at the
customer's request prior to expiration of his minimum contract period, a reconnection charge shall
be made, payable in advance, when the customer requests reconnection of service. (See
Schedule R-1 for applicable rate.) The minimum contract period is renewed with each
reconnection.
A reconnection charge shall also be required from consumers whose services are disconnected
(shut off at curb stop) because of nonpayment of bills when due (not including disconnection for
failure to comply with deposit or guarantee rules). (See Schedule R-1 for applicable rate.[1])
Editor's Note: The current rate schedules are on file in the City Clerk-Treasurer's office.
A consumer shall be considered as the same consumer, provided the reconnection is requested
for the same location by any member of the same family or, if a place of business, by any partner
or employee of the same business.
§ 440-4. Temporary metered supply.
An applicant for temporary water supply on a metered basis shall make and maintain a monetary
deposit for each meter installed as security for payment for use of water and for such other charges

which may arise from the use of the supply. A charge shall be made for setting the valve and furnishing
and setting the meter. (See Schedule D-1 for applicable rate.[1])
Editor's Note: The current rate schedules are on file in the City Clerk-Treasurer's office.
§ 440-5. Use for construction purposes.
When water is requested for construction purposes, or for filling tanks or other such uses, an
application therefor shall be made to the Utility, in writing, upon an application provided for that
purpose in the Utility's office, giving a statement of the amount of construction work to be done, or
the size of the tank to be filled, etc. Payment for the water for construction shall be made in
advance at the scheduled rates. The service pipe must be installed inside the building from where
the water must be drawn. No connection with the service pipe at the curb shall be made without
special permission from the Utility.
In no case will any employee of the Utility turn on water for construction work unless the contractor
first presents a permit. Upon completion of the construction work, the contractor must return the
original permit to the Utility, together with a statement of the actual amount of construction work
performed.
Consumers shall not allow contractors, masons or other persons to take water from their premises
without first showing a permit from the Utility. Any consumer failing to comply with this provision
will have water service discontinued.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 440-6. Use of hydrants.
In cases where no other supply is available, permission may be granted by the Utility to use a
hydrant. No hydrant shall be used until it is equipped with a sprinkling valve. In no case shall any
valve be moved except by an employee of the Utility.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Before a valve is set, payment must be made for its setting and for the water to be used at the
scheduled rates. Where applicable, see Schedule H-1 for deposits and charges.[2] Upon
completing use of the hydrant, the customer must notify the Utility to that effect.
Editor's Note: The current rate schedules are on file in the City Clerk-Treasurer's office.
In the use of a hydrant supply, the hydrant valve will be set at the proper opening by the Utility
when the sprinkling valve is set, and the flow of water must be regulated by means of the
sprinkling valve. If the water is to be used through iron pipe connections, all such pipe installations
shall have the swing joint to facilitate quick disconnection from the fire hydrant.
§ 440-7. Unauthorized use.
Any person who shall, without authority of the Utility, allow contractors, masons, or other unauthorized
persons to take water from their premises, operate any valve connected with the street or supply
mains, or open any fire hydrant connected with the distribution system, except for the purpose of
extinguishing fire, or who shall wantonly damage or impair the same shall be subject to a fine as
provided by municipal ordinances. Permits for the use of hydrants apply only to such hydrants as are
designated for the specific use.
§ 440-8. Refunds of deposits.

All moneys deposited as security for payment of charges arising from the use of temporary water
supply on a metered basis, or for the return of a sprinkling valve wheel or reducer, if the water is used
on an unmetered basis, will be refunded to the depositor on the termination of the use of water, the
payment of all charges levied against the depositor, and the return of the wheel and reducer.
§ 440-9. Service connections.
No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any
other material which may cause injury to or disintegration of the service pipe, unless adequate
means of protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be approved by
the Utility. Service pipes passing through curb or retaining walls shall be adequately safeguarded
by provision of a channel space or pipe casing, not less than twice the diameter of the service
connection. The space between the service pipe and channel or pipe casing shall be filled and
lightly caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material, and made impervious to
moisture.
In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected against injury by carefully hand
tamping the ground filling, free from hard lumps, rocks, stones, or other injurious material, around
and at least six inches over the pipe.
All water supplies shall be of undiminished size from the street main into the point of meter
placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve, the piping shall be sized and proportioned to provide,
on all floors, at all times, an equitable distribution of water supply for the greatest probable number
of fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously.
§ 440-10. Service piping for meter settings.
Where the original service piping is installed for a new metered customer, where existing service
piping is changed for the customer's convenience, or where a new meter is installed for an
existing unmetered customer, the owner shall, at his expense, provide a suitable location and the
proper connections for the meter. The Water Utility should be consulted as to the type and size of
meter setting. Where it is possible to set meters in the basement, or other suitable place within the
building, a short nipple shall be inserted after the stop and waste cock, then a union, and then
another nipple and coupling of the proper length. The nipple attached to the union and coupling
shall be cut to a standard length provided by the plans of the Utility (it may require a horizontal run
of 18 inches in such pipeline), which may later be removed for the insertion of the meter into the
supply line.
No permit will be given to change from metered to flat-rate service.
§ 440-11. Turning on water.
The water cannot be turned on for a consumer except by a duly authorized employee of the Utility.
When a plumber has completed a job, he must leave the water turned off. This does not prevent the
plumber from testing the work.
§ 440-12. Failure to read meters; estimated bills.
Where the Utility is unable to read a meter after two successive attempts, the fact will be plainly
indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed, or the minimum charge applied.
The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding
month will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled,
and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding month.

more than two consecutive estimated bills where the billing period is two months or more.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
If the meter is damaged (see § 440-27, Surreptitious use of water) or fails to operate, the bill will
be based on the average use during the past year, unless there is some reason why the use is not
normal. If the average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some
equitable method.

See Ch. PSC 185, Wis. Adm. Code.
§ 440-15. Curb stop boxes.
The customer shall protect the curb stop box in the terrace and shall keep the same free from dirt and
other obstructions. The Utility shall not be liable for failure to locate the curb stop box and shut off the
water in case of a leak on the consumer's premises.
§ 440-16. Installation of meters.
Meters will be furnished and placed by the Utility and are not to be disconnected or tampered with by
the consumer. All meters shall be so located that they shall be protected from obstructions and permit
ready access thereto for reading, inspection, and servicing, such location to be designated or approved
by the Utility. All piping within the building must be supplied by the owner. Where additional meters are
desired by the owner, the owner shall pay for all piping and an additional amount sufficient to cover the
cost of maintenance and depreciation. Where applicable, see Schedule Am-1 for rate.[1]
Editor's Note: The current rate schedules are on file in the City Clerk-Treasurer's office.
§ 440-17. Repairs to meters.
Meters will be repaired by the Utility, and the cost of such repairs caused by ordinary wear and
tear will be borne by the Utility.
Repair of any damage to a meter resulting from the carelessness of the owner of the premises,
owner's agent, or tenant, or from the negligence of any one of them to properly secure and protect
same, including any damage that may result from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to
be injured from the presence of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the consumer
or the owner of the premises.
§ 440-18. Replacement and repair of service pipe.
The service pipe from the main to and through the curb stop will be maintained and kept in repair
and, when worn out, replaced at the expense of the Utility. The property owner shall maintain the

Editor's Note: Original § 9-1-37(a) of the 1997 Code, which immediately preceded this subsection,
was repealed at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
If a consumer fails to repair a leaking or broken service pipe from curb to point of metering or use
within such time as may appear reasonable to the Utility after notification has been served on the
consumer by the Utility, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on again until the repairs
have been completed.
§ 440-19. Charges for water wasted due to leaks.
See Ch. PSC 185, Wis. Adm. Code.
§ 440-20. Inspection of premises.
During reasonable hours, any officer or authorized employee of the Utility shall have the right of access
to the premises supplied with service, for the purpose of inspection or for the enforcement of the
Utility's rules and regulations. Whenever appropriate, the Utility will make a systematic inspection of all
unmetered water taps for the purpose of checking waste and unnecessary use of water.

§ 440-27. Surreptitious use of water.
When the Utility has reasonable evidence that a consumer is obtaining his supply of water, in
whole or in part, by means of devices or methods used to stop or interfere with the proper
metering of the Utility service being delivered to his equipment, the Utility reserves the right to
estimate and present immediately a bill for service unmetered as a result of such interference, and
such bill shall be payable subject to a twenty-four-hour disconnection of service. When the Utility
shall have disconnected the consumer for any such reason, the Utility will reconnect the consumer
upon the following conditions:
The consumer will be required to deposit with the Utility an amount sufficient to guarantee the
payment of the consumer's bills for Utility service to the Utility.
The consumer will be required to pay the Utility for any and all damages to its equipment on
the consumer's premises due to such stoppage or interference with its metering.
The consumer must further agree to comply with reasonable requirements to protect the
Utility against further losses.
Sections 98.26 and 943.20, Wis. Stats., as relating to water service, are hereby adopted and
made a part of these rules.
§ 440-28. Vacation of premises.
When premises are to be vacated, the Utility shall be notified, in writing, at once, so that it may remove
the meter and shut off the supply at the curb cock. The owner of the premises shall be liable to
prosecution for any damage to the property of the Utility by reason of failure to notify the Utility of
vacancy.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 440-29. Repairs to mains.
The Utility reserves the right to shut off the water in the mains temporarily to make repairs, alterations
or additions to the plant or system. When the circumstances will permit sufficient delay, the Utility will
give notification, by newspaper publication or otherwise, of the discontinuance of the supply. No rebate
will be allowed to consumers for such temporary suspension of supply.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
§ 440-30. Public safety requirements.
It shall be the duty of the Utility to see that all open ditches for water mains, hydrants, and service
pipes are properly guarded to prevent accident to any person or vehicle, and at night there shall be
displayed an amber signal light in such manner as will, so far as possible, insure the safety of the
public.
§ 440-31. Responsibility of contractors.
Contractors must ascertain for themselves the existence and location of all service pipes. Where they
are removed, cut or damaged during trench construction, the contractor must, at his own expense,
cause them to be replaced or repaired at once. Contractors must not shut off the water service pipes to
any consumer for a period exceeding six hours.

§ 440-32. Protective devices.
Protective devices in general. The owner or occupant of every premises receiving water supply
shall apply and maintain suitable means of protection of the premises supply, and all appliances
thereof, against damage arising in any manner from the use of the water supply, variation of water
pressure, or any interruption of water supply. Particularly, such owner or occupant must protect
water-cooled compressors for refrigeration systems by means of high-pressure safety cutout
devices. There shall likewise be provided means for the prevention of the transmission of water
ram or noise of operation of any valve or appliance through the piping of their own or adjacent
premises.
Relief valves. On all closed systems (i.e., systems having a check valve, pressure regulator, or
reducing valve, water filter or softener), an effective pressure-relief valve shall be installed either in
the top tapping or the upper side tapping of the hot-water tank, or on the hot-water distributing
pipe connection at the tank. No stop valve shall be placed between the hot-water tank and the
relief valve or on the drainpipe. (See applicable City plumbing codes.)

Definition. As used in this chapter, the following term shall have the meaning indicated:
CROSS-CONNECTION
Any physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of
which contains potable water from the City of Brodhead water system, and the other water
from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or
chemicals, whereby, upon loss of pressure or any pressure condition, there may be a flow
from one system to the other.
Cross-connections prohibited. No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross-connection. No interconnection shall
be established whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other
than the regular public water supply of the City may enter the supply or distribution system of said
municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of
connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the Utility and by the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources in accordance with § NR 811.07, Wis. Adm. Code.
Inspections. It shall be the duty of the Brodhead Water and Light Commission to cause
inspections to be made of all properties served by the public water system where crossconnection
with the public water system is deemed possible. The frequency of inspections and
reinspections based on potential health hazards involved shall be as established by the Brodhead
Water and Light Commission and as approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources.
Right to inspect. Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the Brodhead Water and
Light Commission shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any
property served by a connection to the public water system of the City for cross-connections. If
entry is refused, such representative shall obtain a special inspection warrant under § 66.0119,
Wis. Stats. On request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to

danger of contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be discontinued only after
reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., except as provided in
Subsection F. Water service to such property shall not be restored until the cross-connection(s)
has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this section.
Immediate discontinuation. If it is determined by the Brodhead Water and Light Commission that a
cross-connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires
immediate action, and a written finding to that effect is filed with the City Clerk-Treasurer and
delivered to the customer's premises, service may be immediately discontinued. The customer
shall have an opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., within 10 days of such emergency
discontinuance.

§ 440-35. Private well abandonment.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prevent contamination of groundwater and to protect
public health, safety and welfare by assuring that unused, unsafe or noncomplying wells, or wells
which may serve as conduits for contamination, or wells which may be illegally cross-connected to
the municipal water system, are properly abandoned.
Applicability. All private wells located on any premises which is served by the public water system
of the City of Brodhead shall be properly filled by January 1, 1993. Only those wells for which a
well operation permit has been granted by the City Clerk-Treasurer may be exempted from this
requirement, subject to conditions of maintenance and operation.
Well operation permits.
A permit may be granted to a well owner to operate a private well for a period not to exceed
five years. Permit applications shall be made on forms provided by the Clerk-Treasurer. The
following requirements must be met before a well operation permit is issued:
The well and pump installation meet the requirements of Ch. NR 812, Wis. Adm. Code. A
well constructor's report on file with the Department of Natural Resources, a certification
of the acceptability of the well granted by the Department of Natural Resources, or a
certification by the owner and applicant for the well operation permit that the well and
pump installation meet the requirements of this section shall be sufficient compliance with
this subsection.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
The well has a history of producing safe water and presently produces bacteriologically
safe water as evidenced by three samplings two weeks apart.
The proposed use of the well is justified by the owner and applicant for the well operation
permit as being necessary in addition to water provided by the public water system.
The fact that no physical connection exists between the piping of the public water system
and the private well is certified by the owner and applicant for the well operation permit.
Upon the filing of an application certifying the above conditions are all complied with, the City
Clerk-Treasurer shall be authorized to issue a well operation permit to the applicant.
Terms and conditions of permit. The well operation permit shall be transferred to a subsequent
owner of the property to which it applies and shall remain valid for the entire term of the permit,
provided the owner or subsequent owner files with the City Clerk Treasurer at least annually a well
water test report that certifies the well produces bacteriologically safe water.
Abandonment methods. Wells shall be abandoned according to the procedures outlined in Ch. NR
812, Wis. Adm. Code. The pump and piping must be removed and the well checked for
obstructions prior to abandonment. Any obstruction or liner must be removed, if possible.
Reports and inspection. An well abandonment report must be submitted by the well owner to the
Department of Natural Resources on forms provided by that agency (available at the office of the
City Clerk-Treasurer). The report shall be submitted immediately upon completion of the filling of
the well. The filling must be observed by a representative of the City.
Penalties. A person, firm or other well owner violating any provision of this section shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a forfeiture as prescribed in § 1-4, together with the cost of
prosecution. Each day during which a violation exists shall be deemed and constitute a separate
offense. If any person fails to comply with this section for more than 10 days after notice in writing,

the City may impose a penalty or may cause the abandonment to be done, and the expense
thereof shall be assessed as a special tax against the property.
Inspections and inspection fees. Inspections shall be conducted by the Building Inspector or an
employee of the Utility to ascertain whether or not private wells have been properly filled or have
well operation permits as required by this section. The necessary expenses incurred by the City
for such inspections to insure water quality and to avoid environmental pollution of the
groundwater shall be charged to the owner of the property inspected as a special charge pursuant
to § 66.0627, Wis. Stats.[2]

Article II. General Provisions
§ 455-5. Areas to be regulated.
This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are
derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and
AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO Zones. Regional flood
elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced,
the most restrictive information shall apply.
§ 455-6. Official maps and revisions.
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based
on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any
changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change
process (see Article VIII, Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps
shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the
City Clerk-Treasurer, City of Brodhead. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most
restrictive information shall apply.
Official maps based on the FIS:

C.
A.
B.
The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain
adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE
Zones as shown on the FIRM.
The flood-fringe district (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and
displayed as AE Zones on the FIRM.
The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the
regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and
AO Zones on the FIRM.
§ 455-8. District boundaries.
Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map and actual field conditions
shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection A or B below. If a significant difference exists, the
map shall be amended according to Article VIII, Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a
boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a zoning permit, whether or not a map
amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual
predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and
for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning
Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to § 455-36C
and the criteria in Subsection A and B below. Where the flood profiles are based on established base
flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Article
VIII, Amendments.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district
boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by
the map scale.
§ 455-9. Removal of lands from floodplain.
Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the
floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is
contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Article VIII,
Amendments.
§ 455-10. Compliance.
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
§ 455-11. Municipalities and state agencies regulated.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply
with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if
§ 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state
highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when § 30.2022, Wis.
Stats., applies.

A.
B.
This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under
§ 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall
continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants
or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail.
§ 455-13. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements
liberally construed in favor of the Common Council and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other
powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by Ch. NR 116, Wis.
Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date
of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this
chapter.
§ 455-14. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The flood-protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and research.

chapter does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free
from flooding and flood damages. This chapter does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of
action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result
from reliance on this chapter.
§ 455-15. Annexed areas.
The Green County and Rock County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation
shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the
municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis.
Adm. Code, and 44 CFR 59 to 72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands
are described on the municipality's Official Zoning Map. County floodplain zoning provisions are
incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of
the Municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood
elevation and the floodway location.
§ 455-16. Standards applicable to all floodplain districts.
The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with
flood-resistant materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and
mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for
compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks)
shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the
"subdivision" definition of this chapter and all other requirements in § 455-34A. Adequate drainage
shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and all public utilities and facilities, such as

obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially
adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of Article VIII, Amendments, are
met.
Watercourse alterations.
No zoning permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued
until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and
FEMA regional offices, and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal
permits. The standards of Subsection A of this section must be met, and the flood-carrying
capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse
alteration or relocation and pursuant to Article VIII, Amendments, the community shall apply
for a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA. Any such alterations must be reviewed and
approved by FEMA and the DNR through the LOMC process.
Chapters 30, 31, Wis. Stats., development. Development which requires a permit from the
Department under Chs. 30 and 31, Wis. Stats., such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts,
dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and
amendments to this chapter are made according to Article VIII, Amendments.

components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water
supply systems or connections to public utilities. Any costs associated with the repair of a
damaged structure are not considered maintenance. The construction of a deck that does not
exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not
an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over a portion of
the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure.
If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for 12
consecutive months, it is no longer permitted, and any future use of the property, and any
structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter.

structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions
which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those
modifications represent.
No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a
nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would equal or exceed 50% of its
present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently
changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable
requirements of this chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and
commercial uses in compliance with § 455-24. The costs of elevating the lowest floor of a
nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood-protection
elevation are excluded from the 50% provisions of this subsection.
No maintenance to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use,
the cost of which would equal or exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value, shall
be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with
a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous
dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with
§ 455-24.
If, on a per-event basis, the total value of the work being done under Subsection B(4) and (5)
equals or exceeds 50% of the present equalized assessed value, the work shall not be
permitted unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a
conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous
dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with
§ 455-24.
Except as provided in Subsection B(8), if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a
nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced,
reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet the current ordinance
requirements. A structure is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the
structure to its predamaged condition equals or exceeds 50% of the structure's present
equalized assessed value.
For nonconforming buildings that are substantially damaged or destroyed by a nonflood
disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such nonconforming building shall be permitted in
order to restore it to the size and use in effect prior to the damage event, provided that the
minimum federal code requirements below are met and all required permits have been
granted prior to the start of construction.

supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans
and survey notes.
Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which
the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of
the revised reach shall be identical to those in the effective model and result in
water surface elevations and top widths computed by the revised models
matching those in the effective models upstream and downstream of the revised
reach as required. The effective model shall not be truncated.
Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the
Department for review which meet the following conditions:
Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the revised floodplain and
floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles, topographic work map,
annotated FIRMs and/or Flood Boundary Floodway Maps (FBFMs), construction
plans, bridge plans.
Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour interval, and a planimetric
map showing the applicable items. If a digital version of the map is available, it
may be submitted in order that the FIRM may be more easily revised.
Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised one-percent and two-tenths-percent
annual-chance floodplains and floodway boundaries.
If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping data (GIS or CADD) are
used, then all supporting documentation or metadata must be included with the
data submission, along with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
projection and State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with FEMA
mapping specifications.
The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the effective floodplain
boundaries.
All cross sections from the effective model shall be labeled in accordance with
the effective map, and a cross-section lookup table shall be included to relate to
the model input numbering scheme.
Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown on the map.

the following criteria must be met:
The variance shall not cause any increase in the regional flood elevation;
Variances can only be granted for lots that are less than 1/2 acre and are contiguous to
existing structures constructed below the RFE; and
Variances shall only be granted upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, shall be
the minimum relief necessary, shall not cause increased risks to public safety or
nuisances, shall not increase costs for rescue and relief efforts and shall not be contrary
to the purpose of this chapter.
A variance shall not:
Grant, extend or increase any use prohibited in the zoning district;
Be granted for a hardship based solely on an economic gain or loss;
Be granted for a hardship which is self-created;
Damage the rights or property values of other persons in the area;

not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping,
travel or seasonal use. Manufactured homes that are towed or carried onto a parcel of land, but do
not remain capable of being towed or carried, including park model homes, do not fall within the
definition of "mobile recreational vehicles."
MODEL, CORRECTED EFFECTIVE
A hydraulic engineering model that corrects any errors that occur in the duplicate effective model,
adds any additional cross sections to the duplicate effective model, or incorporates more detailed
topographic information than that used in the current effective model.
MODEL, DUPLICATE EFFECTIVE
A copy of the hydraulic analysis used in the effective FIS and referred to as the "effective model."
MODEL, EFFECTIVE
The hydraulic engineering model that was used to produce the current effective Flood Insurance
Study.
MODEL, EXISTING (PRE-PROJECT)
A modification of the duplicate effective model or corrected effective model to reflect any manmade
modifications that have occurred within the floodplain since the date of the effective model
but prior to the construction of the project for which the revision is being requested. If no
modification has occurred since the date of the effective model, then this model would be identical
to the corrected effective model or duplicate effective model.
MODEL, REVISED (POST-PROJECT)
A modification of the existing or pre-project conditions model, duplicate effective model or
corrected effective model to reflect revised or post-project conditions.

Elevations referenced to mean sea level datum, 1929 adjustment.
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE
An existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural
requirements of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an
existing residential structure in the flood-fringe district is a conforming use. However, if the lowest
floor is lower than the flood-protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.)
NONCONFORMING USE
An existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies (such as a residence
in the floodway).
OBSTRUCTION TO FLOW
Any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development, alone
or together with any future development, will cause an increase in regional flood height.
OFFICIAL FLOODPLAIN ZONING MAP
That map, adopted and made part of this chapter, as described in § 455-6, which has been
approved by the Department and FEMA.
OPEN SPACE USE
Those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures.
ORDINARY HIGH-WATER MARK
The point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so
continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of
terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized
characteristic.

floodplain and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or
proposed buildings.
REGIONAL FLOOD
A flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A
regional flood is a flood with a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE.

https://ecode360.com/print/BR3166?guid=BR3166&children=true 453/637
START OF CONSTRUCTION
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns,
or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling,
nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the "actual start of construction"
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE
Any man-made object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to,
placed upon or set into the ground, streambed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and
walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts.
SUBDIVISION
Has the meaning given in § 236.02(12), Wis. Stats.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
predamaged condition would equal or exceed 50% of the equalized assessed value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs
are considered substantial improvements, regardless of the work performed. The term does not,
however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing
health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the Building Official and that are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of an historic structure,
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic
structure.
UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP
Where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made
strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density
unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this chapter.
VARIANCE
An authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building
or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in
this chapter.
VIOLATION
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure
or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing
certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
WATERSHED
The entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water.

§ 468-1. Statutory authority.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization in §§ 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 281.31, Wis.
Stats.
§ 468-2. Findings; purpose.
Findings of fact. Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and the pollution of the navigable
waters of the City of Brodhead would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience and
general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility
to all municipalities to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and control
water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of
structures and land uses; and preserve shore cover and natural beauty.
Purpose. To promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, this chapter has
been established to:
Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions;
Prevent and control water pollution by filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters and to
maintain stormwater and floodwater capacity;
Protect fish spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other
fish and aquatic habitat;
Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area;
Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover
and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earthmoving activities; and
Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands.

§ 468-3. Title.
"Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Ordinance/Chapter for the City of Brodhead, Wisconsin."
Article II. General Provisions
§ 468-4. Compliance.
The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the City of Brodhead
shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, state or federal
regulations. (However, see § 468-16 of this chapter for the standards applicable to nonconforming
uses.) All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise
expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter.
§ 468-5. Applicability.
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with
this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if § 13.48(13),
Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and
bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when § 30.2022, Wis. Stats.,
applies.
§ 468-6. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under
§ 62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to shoreland-wetlands, except that, where another
municipal zoning ordinance is more restrictive than the provisions contained in this chapter, that
ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not
otherwise.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants
or easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
chapter shall prevail.
§ 468-7. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this
chapter is required by a standard in Ch. NR 117, Wis. Adm. Code, and where the chapter provision is
unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Ch. NR 117 standards in effect on the date of
the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter.
§ 468-8. Annexed areas.
The Green County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation remain in effect
administered by the municipality for all areas annexed by the municipality after May 7, 1982. These
annexed lands are described on the municipality's Official Zoning Map. The Green County shoreland

Article III. Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District
§ 468-9. Purpose of shoreland-wetland zoning.
This chapter is adopted to maintain safe and healthful conditions, to prevent and control water
pollution, to protect fish spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life and wildlife habitation, to preserve
shore cover and natural beauty and to control building and development in wetlands whenever
possible. When development is permitted in a wetland, the development should occur in a manner
which minimizes adverse impacts upon the wetland.
§ 468-10. Official Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps.
The following maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter and are on file in the office of
the City Clerk-Treasurer:

§ 468-11. District boundaries.
The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the City of Brodhead which are five
acres or more and/or wetlands of a smaller acreage within the City that, when connected
(contiguous) to a larger assemblage in the township, equal five acres or more in area and are as
shown on the "Revised Final" Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map, dated March 7, 1995, that has
been adopted and made a part of this chapter in § 468-10 and which are:
Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages.
Lakes, ponds or flowages in the City of Brodhead shall be presumed to be navigable if they
are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base
maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter in § 468-10
of this chapter.
Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams or to the
landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be
presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent
waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base
maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter in § 468-
10. Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary-Floodway
Maps, County Soil Survey Maps or other existing community floodplain zoning maps used to
delineate floodplain area which have been adopted by the City of Brodhead shall be used to
determine the extent of floodplain areas in the City.
Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark shall initially be made by the Zoning
Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district
office of the Department for the final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark.

When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on
the Official Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps
were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the
Department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped is in error. If the
Department staff concurs with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly
mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or
deny a land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct
zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the Official Shoreland-
Wetland Zoning Maps, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a Shoreland-
Wetland Map amendment within a reasonable period.
§ 468-12. Filled wetlands.
Wetlands which are filled prior to the "Revised Final" Wisconsin Wetland Inventory Map, dated March

dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction or prosecution, or grant the application for a
conditional use.

planned unit developments requires greater involvement of public officials in site plan review and
development aspects of both zoning and land division regulation since such developments require
exceptions from both types of regulation.
PLAT
The map, drawing or chart on which the subdivider's plat of subdivision is presented to the City for
approval.
PRELIMINARY PLAT
The preliminary plat map, drawing or chart indicating the proposed layout of the subdivision to be
submitted to the Plan Commission for its consideration as to compliance with the Comprehensive
Development Plan and these regulations, along with required supporting data.
PROTECTIVE COVENANTS
Contracts entered into between private parties or between private parties and public bodies
pursuant to § 236.293, Wis. Stats., which constitute a restriction on the use of all private or platted
property within a subdivision for the benefit of the public or property owners and to provide mutual
protection against undesirable aspects of development which would tend to impair stability of
values.
REPLAT
The process of changing, or a map or plat which changes, the boundaries of a recorded
subdivision plat or part thereof. The legal dividing of a large block, lot or outlot within a recorded
subdivision plat without changing exterior boundaries of said block, lot or outlot is not a replat.
RESIDENTIAL DWELLING UNIT or DWELLING UNIT
A single-family dwelling or part of a duplex, apartment, or other multiple-family dwelling occupied
by one family or one distinct set of inhabitants or occupants.
RIGHT-OF-WAY

§ 472-8. Condominium developments.
Purpose.
The Common Council hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments
that require limited applicability of this chapter to condominium developments. The State
Legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that
subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from
those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of
condominium.
The factor that makes this chapter applicable to a condominium development is the creation
of multiple, distinct property entities at or near the ground surface, subject to property taxation
as separate parcels, with each property entity having different ownership and management.
The City determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar, both
physically and in ownership, from developments in which the land and improvements are
under unitary ownership, management, and control.
Thus, the Common Council hereby finds that new condominium developments can place
impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which are
characterized by division of land into lots. These impacts include:
Additional population density.
Possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the land's characteristics.
Additional demands upon City area parks, recreation areas, utility facilities and schools.
Additional traffic and street use.
Portions of chapter applicable to condominium developments. The following sections of this
chapter shall apply to condominium developments:
Section 472-7 relating to land suitability and construction practices.
Sections 472-9 through 472-12 relating to preliminary and final plat approval. The technical
requirements for preliminary plats set forth in § 472-18 shall not apply, since condominiums
have separate technical standards set forth in Ch. 703, Wis. Stats.
Article IX relating to fees for review.
Article VI relating to required improvements.
Article VII relating to design standards for improvements.
Article VIII relating to dedication requirements.
Exceptions. This section shall not apply to the following condominiums:
Any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of this chapter.
Any conversion of a structure or structures in existence on the effective date of this chapter to
a condominium after the effective date of this chapter.
Article IV. Plat Review and Approval
§ 472-9. Preliminary consultation.

Before filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat or certified survey map, the
subdivider is encouraged to submit a conceptual plan and to consult with City staff for advice
regarding general subdivision requirements. Information on meeting dates, agenda deadlines and
filing requirements may be obtained from the City Clerk-Treasurer. The conceptual plan would
show the relationship of the proposed subdivision or certified survey to traffic arteries and existing
community facilities. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory but is intended to inform the
subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, the Master Plan, Comprehensive
Plan components and plan implementation devices of the City and to otherwise assist the
subdivider in planning his/her development. The subdivider will gain a better understanding of the
subsequent required procedures.
Prior to filing an application for the approval of a preliminary plat, or certified survey map, the
subdivider shall attend a preliminary consultation meeting with the Plan Commission. The Plan
Commission may waive this requirement for small projects.
§ 472-10. Submission of preliminary plat.
Submission. Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary
plat and a letter of application. The subdivider shall submit 10 copies of the preliminary plat. The
preliminary plat shall be prepared in accordance with the standards of this chapter, particularly
§ 472-18, and the subdivider shall file copies of the plat and the application as required by this
section with the City Clerk-Treasurer at least 30 days prior to the meeting of the Plan Commission
at which action is desired. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall submit copies of the preliminary plat to
the Plan Commission and to the City Engineer for review and written report of his/her
recommendations and reactions to the proposed plat.
Public improvements. Simultaneously with the filing of the preliminary plat or map, the owner shall
file with the City Clerk-Treasurer a concept report addressing sewer and water service feasibility,
drainage facilities and center-line grades showing streets in the subdivision.
Property owners' association; restrictive covenants. A draft of the legal instruments and rules for
proposed property owners' associations, when the subdivider proposes that common property
within a subdivision would be either owned or maintained by such an organization of property
owners or a subunit of the City pursuant to § 236.293, Wis. Stats., and proposed deed restrictions
or restrictive covenants shall be submitted at the time of filing the preliminary plat with the City
Clerk-Treasurer.
Affidavit. The surveyor preparing the preliminary plat shall certify on the face of the plat that it is a
correct representation of all existing land divisions and features and that he has fully complied with
the provisions of this chapter.
Supplementary data to be filed with preliminary plat. The following shall also be filed with the
preliminary plat:
Use statement. A statement of the proposed use of lots stating type of residential buildings
with number of proposed dwelling units; types of business or industry so as to reveal the
effect of the development on traffic, fire hazards and congestion of population, except that the
City may not deny approval of a plat or certified survey map under § 236.45(3)(b), 236.10, or
236.13, Wis. Stats., on the basis of the proposed use of land within the extraterritorial plat
approval jurisdiction of the City, unless the denial is based on a plan or regulations or
amendments thereto, adopted by the Common Council of the City of Brodhead under
§ 62.23(7a)(c), Wis. Stats.; and
[Amended 1-10-2011]
Zoning changes. If any zoning changes are contemplated, the proposed zoning plan for the
areas, including dimensions; and

Area plan. Where the subdivider owns property adjacent to that which is being proposed for
the subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the requirements of § 472-18A(5) for the
remainder of the property so as to show the possible relationships between the proposed
subdivision and future subdivision. In any event, all subdivisions must be shown to relate well
with existing or potential adjacent subdivisions.
Street plans and profiles. The subdivider shall provide preliminary street profiles showing existing
ground surface, including extensions, for a reasonable distance beyond the limits of the proposed
subdivision when requested.
Soil testing. The subdivider shall provide a preliminary soils report, listing the types of soil in the
proposed subdivision, their effect on the subdivision and a proposed soil testing and investigation
program. Pursuant to the public policy concerns prescribed in § 472-7, the City Engineer may, in
addition, require that borings and soundings be made in specified areas to ascertain subsurface
soil, rock and water conditions, including depth to bedrock and depth to groundwater table. A
minimum of one boring per thousand feet of center-line street to a minimum depth of 15 feet is
required.
Referral to other agencies and utilities.

adequate number of copies to the Plan Commission. The appropriate county planning
agency, the Wisconsin Department of Administration and the Wisconsin Department of
Transportation shall be hereinafter referred to as "objecting agencies." The City Clerk-
Treasurer shall also transmit a copy of the preliminary plat to other affected City boards,
commissions or departments for their review and recommendations concerning matters within
their jurisdiction.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).

preliminary plat, any state or county agency having authority to object under Subsection H(2)
above shall notify the subdivider and all approving or objecting authorities of any objection
based upon failure of the plat to comply with the statutes or rules which its examination is

City Clerk-Treasurer, approve, approve conditionally, or reject such preliminary plat and shall
state, in writing, any conditions of approval or reasons for rejection, unless the time is
extended by agreement with the subdivider. Failure of the Common Council to act within 90
days or extension thereof shall constitute an approval of the preliminary plat, unless
authorized agencies object to the plat. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall communicate to the
subdivider the action of the Common Council. If the preliminary plat is approved, the City
Clerk-Treasurer shall endorse it for the Common Council.
Upon approval of the preliminary plat, the Common Council shall refer copies of the
preliminary plat as approved to the City Clerk-Treasurer. An abstract of title or registered
property report may be referred to the City Attorney for his examination and report.
Preliminary plat amendment. Should the subdivider desire to amend the preliminary plat as
approved, he may resubmit the amended plat, which shall follow the same procedure outlined
herein, unless the amendment is, in the opinion of the Plan Commission or the Common Council,
of such scope as to constitute a new plat, in which such case it shall be refiled.

Filing requirements.
The subdivider shall prepare a final plat and letter of application in accordance with this
chapter and shall file 20 copies of the plat and the application with the City Clerk-Treasurer at

§ 472-13. Land divisions and consolidations by certified survey
map.
Use of certified survey map.
A certified survey map, prepared and recorded in accordance with § 236.34, Wis. Stats., and
the requirements of § 472-20, and having been approved by the Common Council, may be
used in lieu of a subdivision plat to divide or consolidate lands, or dedicate lands, provided
that one of the following conditions is met:
The division or consolidation is of any lot, outlot, parcel, or other lands previously
approved by the City and recorded with the appropriate county register of deeds as a
subdivision plat, certified survey, or assessor's plat, of any size, which results in not more
than four lots, outlots, parcels, or mortgage descriptions, being created by any division or
successive division, regardless of any changes in ownership, within any five-year period;
or
The division or consolidation is of any lot, outlot, parcel, or other lands previously
recorded with the appropriate county register of deeds, including those recorded by a
metes and bounds description, provided it results in not more than four outlots, parcels,
or mortgage descriptions, any one of which is less than four acres in size, being created
by any division or successive division, regardless of changes of ownership, within any
five-year period.
In the event a proposed land division does not meet the above requirements, the proposed
land division must be pursued as a subdivision plat.
The certified survey map shall include the entire original parcels of land owned or controlled
by the subdivider, including those proposed for division or consolidation. The subdivider shall
comply with all requirements of this chapter, including Article VII, Design Standards, and
Article VI, Required Improvements, when a certified survey map is used. A certification of the
approval of the certified survey map by the Common Council shall be inscribed legibly on the
face of the map. A certificate of the City Clerk-Treasurer stating that there are no unpaid
special assessments or taxes on the lands shall be included on the certified survey map.

and specifications are not satisfactory, the City Engineer shall return them to the owner and
so advise the Plan Commission.
Plan Commission review.
The Plan Commission shall examine the final certified survey map as to its conformance with
the approved preliminary certified survey map, any conditions of approval of the preliminary
certified survey map, this chapter and all applicable ordinances, rules, regulations,
Comprehensive Plans and Comprehensive Plan components that shall be affected and shall
recommend approval, conditional approval or rejection of the map to the Common Council.
If the final certified survey map is not submitted within six months of the last required approval
of the preliminary certified survey map, the Plan Commission may refuse to approve the final
certified survey map.
The Plan Commission shall, within 40 days from the date of the filing of the final certified
survey map with the City Clerk-Treasurer, recommend approval, conditional approval, or
rejection of the map and shall transmit the final map and application along with its
recommendations to the Common Council. The Plan Commission may hold the matter in
abeyance if there is incomplete or inadequate information.
Council review and approval.
The Common Council shall, within 60 days of the date of the filing of the original final certified
survey map with the City Clerk-Treasurer, approve or reject such map, unless the time is
extended by agreement with the applicant for a land division. If the map is rejected, the
reason shall be stated in the minutes of the meeting in a written statement of the reasons
forwarded to the applicant for a land division. If the map is approved, the Common Council
shall cause the City Clerk-Treasurer to so certify on the face of the original map and return the
map to the applicant for a land division.

the subdivider or person wishing to replat shall vacate or alter the recorded plat as provided in
§§ 236.40 through 236.44, Wis. Stats. The subdivider or person wishing to replat shall then
proceed, using the approval procedures for preliminary and final plats prescribed in this article.
Whenever a preliminary plat of a replat is filed, the Plan Commission shall schedule and hold a
public hearing before it acts on the plat. Notices of the proposed replat and public hearing shall be
published as a Class 3 notice and be mailed, at the subdivider's expense, to the owners of all
properties within the limits of the exterior boundaries of the proposed replat and to the owners of
all properties within 200 feet of the proposed replat.
Whenever an approved final plat is submitted for reapproval within six months of the initial
resolution approving the plat, and which is substantially in conformance with the approved plat,
and which has not been recorded with the Register of Deeds, said plat shall be reapproved by the
Common Council. No final plats shall be reapproved by the Common Council following the
expiration of the six-month period. Such plats shall be submitted as a new plat. All previous
approvals shall be null and void and shall have no further bearing on the subsequent review and
approval of the plat by the City.
Where lots are more than double the minimum size required for the applicable zoning district, the
Plan Commission may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow resubdivision of such
parcels into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 472-15. Determination of adequacy of public facilities and
services.
A preliminary plat, final plat or certified survey shall not be approved unless the Plan Commission
and the Common Council determine that adequate public facilities and public services will be
available to meet the needs of the proposed land division and that no public funds other than
those already provided in an adopted capital or operating budget are required.
The applicant shall furnish any data requested by the City Clerk-Treasurer, who shall transmit this
information to the appropriate commission(s), committee(s) and staff for review; the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall act as coordinator of the reports from staff to the Plan Commission and Common
Council on the adequacy of water, sanitary and storm sewers, fire service, police, parks and open
space and recreation facilities, transportation facilities, traffic counts, and schools.
Where the Plan Commission and the Common Council determine that one or more public facilities
or services are not adequate for the proposed development, but that a portion of the area could be
served adequately, or that careful phasing of the development could result in all public facilities
and public services being adequate, conditional approval may include only such portions or may
specify phasing of the development.
No land shall be divided which has been officially mapped as public lands for a stormwater
management facility or is determined by the Common Council to be unsuitable for use by reason
of flooding, bad drainage, soil or rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe
erosion potential or unfavorable topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to health,
safety or welfare of future residents or landowners in the proposed land division or of the
community.
The above requirements shall not apply to those areas outside the corporate limits of the City of
Brodhead and within the City's extraterritorial limits. Areas within the City capable of being served
by public sewer and water shall be required to connect to the City of Brodhead public water
distribution and/or public sewerage system as required by the City Engineer.

§ 472-17. Disclaimers on approvals.
The purpose of requiring approvals under this chapter is to insure the health, safety, morale,
comfort, prosperity and general welfare of the City of Brodhead. This chapter shall not be
interpreted as placing any responsibility or liability on any City official, City employee or the City as
a municipal corporation for the granting of approval or the denial of any approval. All approvals
rendered as part of this chapter shall be considered as being approved conditionally based on the
information and circumstances apparent at that time.

ways or to the provision of planting strips.
Taxes. Certifications by attached information showing that all taxes and special assessments
currently due on the property to be subdivided have been paid in full.
Drainage flows. The subdivider shall cause to be set upon the final plat arrows indicating the
directions of drainage flows for each property line not fronting on a street on all parcels and
along each street as will result from the grading of the site, the construction of the required
public improvements, or which are existing drainage flows and will remain. The arrows

center-line elevation, the subdivider shall place the following note on the plat:
"Subsoil information indicates the presence of groundwater conditions that may require
basement elevations on lot(s) to be at elevation or higher, or that a modified structural
plan of the structure's foundation shall be submitted to the Building Inspector for
approval with the application for a building permit as required information."
The elevation of the basement as described in the paragraph to be placed on the plat
shall be a minimum of two feet higher than the elevation of the groundwater table.
Dimensions of lot lines shall be shown in feet and hundredths; no ditto marks shall be

ratio of 1:5,000, nor in azimuth, four seconds of arc per interior angle. If field measurements
exceed this maximum, new field measurements shall be made until a satisfactory closure of
the field measurements has been obtained; the survey of the exterior boundary shall be
adjusted to form a closed geometric figure.
Street, block and lot dimensions. All street, block and lot dimensions shall be computed as
closed geometric figures based upon the control provided by the closed exterior boundary
survey. If checks disclose an error for any interior line of the plat greater than the ratio of
1:3,000, or an error in measured angle greater than one minute of arc for any angle where the
shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet or longer, necessary corrections shall be made.
Where the shorter side of a measured angle is less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not
exceed the value of one minute multiplied by the quotient of 300 divided by the length of the
shorter side; however, such error shall not in any case exceed five minutes of arc.
Plat location. Where the plat is located within a quarter-section, the corners of which have
been relocated, monumented and coordinated by the City, the tie required by § 236.20(3)(b),
Wis. Stats., may be expressed in terms of grid bearing and distance, and the material and
Wisconsin state plane coordinates of the monument marking the relocated section or quartercorner
to which the plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. The grid bearing and distance of

Article VI. Required Improvements
§ 472-21. General requirements and standards.
General requirement.
In accordance with the authority granted by § 236.13, Wis. Stats., the City of Brodhead
hereby requires that, as a condition of final plat or certified survey approval, the subdivider
agrees to make and install all public improvements required by this chapter and that the
subdivider shall provide the City with security to ensure that the subdivider will make the
required improvements. As a further condition of approval, the Common Council hereby
requires that the subdivider be responsible for the cost of any necessary alterations of any
existing utilities which, by virtue of the platting or certified survey map, fall within the public
right-of-way.
As a condition for the acceptance of dedication of public rights-of-way, the City requires that
the public ways have been previously provided with all necessary facilities constructed to City
specifications, including, but not limited to, sewerage, storm drainage, water mains and
services, grading and improvement of the streets and other public ways, sidewalks, street
signing, streetlighting and such other facilities required by the Common Council, or that a
specific portion of the costs be paid in advance as provided in § 66.0709, Wis. Stats.
Options.
The required public improvements shall be installed by the subdivider at his cost; or
City may enter into a recapture agreement with the subdivider agreeing to require payment of
recapture costs of public improvements from those properties benefiting from the
improvements. The City shall prohibit development on those properties until payment has

been made. The subdivider may contract directly with adjacent property owners and/or
subdividers of adjacent land for reimbursement of the oversize and/or off-site improvements
constructed.
Any workable combination of the above determined by the Common Council as acceptable.
If the City finds that City construction of such public improvements would not be warranted as
a special assessment to the intervening properties, or as a governmental expense until some
future time, the developer shall be required, if he wishes to proceed with the development, to
obtain necessary easements or right-of-way and construct and pay for such public
improvement extensions as provided under Subsection B(1) or (2) above.
General standards. The required public improvements shall be installed in accordance with the
engineering standards and specifications which have been adopted by the Common Council.
Where standards and specifications have not been adopted, the improvements shall be made in
accordance with established engineering practices, approved prior to the start of construction by
the City Engineer. When new or revised standards and/or specifications have been adopted by the
City, work on public improvements not begun within four years of the date of final plat adoption
shall be made to the new or revised standards and/or specifications. The City Engineer shall
review and approve the construction plans, specifications and calculations for the construction of
the required public improvements.
Project manager. The subdivider shall designate a project manager who shall be readily available
on the project site during the construction of the required public improvements. The project
manager shall be granted authority on behalf of the subdivider to make decisions related to the
construction of the required public improvements as they may arise during the course of the
construction. The project manager shall also be responsible for the scheduling and coordination of
the required work to construct the required improvements. Correspondence with or verbal orders
to the designated project manager shall have the same authority as with the subdivider directly.
§ 472-22. Performance guarantees.
Contract. At the time of approving a plat or certified survey map, the subdivider shall, at the option
of the Common Council, be required to enter into a contract with the City for land division
improvements agreeing to install improvements. Pursuant to the authority granted by this section,
the Common Council may, by contract, modify this chapter, or any portion thereof, by deleting or
otherwise modifying the requirements provided for in this chapter to fit the specific circumstances
of each land division. The contract form shall be provided by the City and may provide for a
phasing of public improvements construction, providing such phasing is approved by the Common
Council, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The City reserves the right to control the
phasing through limits, sequence, and/or additional surety so to provide for continuity of streets,
sewers, water mains, and other necessary public improvements within and between the phases.
[Amended 1-10-2011]
Financial guarantees.
The subdivider shall file with said contract, subject to the approval of the City Attorney, a
bond, a certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or certified check in an amount equal
to 125% of the estimate of the cost prepared by the City Engineer as surety to guarantee that
such improvements will be completed by the subdivider or his contractors not later than 18
months from the date of recording the plat or certified survey map. When a certificate of
deposit or certified check is posted as security, the instrument must be negotiable by the City.
When a letter of credit is posted as security, the City must be the beneficiary.
However, the subdivider may elect, with the approval of the City, to install the improvements
in construction phases, provided that:

The phases are specified in the contract for land division improvements;
The developer submits surety in an amount equal to 125% of the estimated costs of
improvements required for the current installation and construction schedules.
Improvements constructed during the first stage and each successive stage of
construction shall not be accepted nor shall any building permit be issued for construction
within the completed area of the subdivision or comprehensive development until the
security required for the current stage of construction has been posted with the City;
[Amended 1-10-2011]
The developer records deed restrictions approved by the City Attorney which specify that
the lots which are included in future construction phases of the land division will not be
transferred or sold unless the City's approval is obtained;
The subdivider minimizes grading and other disturbances to lands included in future
construction phases in order to prevent erosion; and
Erosion control plans and measures submitted and approved herein shall address the
individual phases of construction.
The time limit for completion of a phased improvement program shall take into account the
needs and desires of the City and adjacent property owners for street and other
improvements to serve lands adjacent to and within the land division.
As work progresses on installation of improvements constructed as part of the contract, the
City Engineer, upon written request from the subdivider from time to time, is authorized to
recommend a reduction in the amount of surety as hereinafter provided. When portions of
construction (water, sanitary sewer, street, sidewalk, greenway or other improvements) are
completed by the subdivider and determined acceptable by the City Engineer, the City Clerk-
Treasurer is authorized, upon submission of lien waivers by the subdivider's contractors, to
reduce the amount of surety. The amount of surety may be reduced at the time all
underground utilities are installed and tested. The amount of surety remaining shall be equal
to 125% of the estimate of the City Engineer of costs of work remaining to be completed and
accepted and to insure performance of the one-year guarantee as specified in Subsection C
below against defects in workmanship and materials on work accepted. When the work on the
major components of construction has been substantially completed, except for work which
cannot be completed because of weather conditions or other reasons which, in the judgment
of the City Engineer, are valid for noncompletion, the City Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to
accept a reduction in the amount of surety to an amount in the estimate of the City Engineer,
sufficient to cover the work remaining to be completed, including performance of the one-year
guarantee period against defects in workmanship and materials. As a further guarantee that
all obligations under contract for work on the development are satisfied, the contractor and
subcontractors who are to be engaged in the construction of utilities or street improvements
on the street right-of-way to be dedicated shall be approved for such work by the City
Engineer prior to commencing construction. The Common Council, at its option, may extend
the bond period for additional periods not to exceed one year each.
Governmental units to which these bond and guarantee provisions apply may, in lieu of said
contract or instrument of guarantee, file a resolution or letter from officers authorized to act in
their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this section.
The subdivider shall agree in the development contract to pay all street and sidewalk
assessments, specifically all area charges for sanitary sewer mains and all water main
assessments, including where the land division abuts existing streets which are not improved
within the City standard street improvements (including but not limited to curb and gutter, local
storm sewer, sidewalks and a bituminous pavement).

Improvement guarantee. The subdivider shall include in said contract an instrument of public
improvement guarantee by irrevocable letter of credit, certified check, cash escrow deposit, or
performance bond whereby a bonding company (with assets exceeding $10,000,000 and
authorized to do business in the State of Wisconsin) guarantees maintenance, repair, replacement
by the developer of said public improvements which deteriorate or fail to meet performance or
operating standards during the bond term, or any penalties which may be incurred as a result
thereof, equal to 15% of the City Engineer's estimate of the cost of the public improvements. If
within one year after the date of final acceptance of any public improvement by the Common
Council (or such longer period of time as may be prescribed by laws or regulations or by the terms
of any special guarantee required by the terms of said contract as may be necessary due to the
phasing of the construction of public improvements), any work on any public improvement is found
to be defective, the subdivider shall remove it and replace it with nondefective work in accordance
with written instructions given by the City Engineer. If the subdivider does not promptly comply
with the terms of such instructions, or in an emergency where delay would cause serious risk of
loss or damage, the City may cause the removal and replacement of said defective work and
charge all direct, indirect and consequential costs of such removal and replacement to the
performance bond or improvement guarantee instrument.
Survey monumentation. Before final approval of any plat or certified survey within the corporate
limits of the City, the subdivider shall install monuments placed in accordance with the
requirements of Ch. 236, Wis. Stats. All survey monumentation located adjacent to street or public
rights-of-way, but not located within street pavement, shall be protected with steel fence posts
erected near the survey monumentation. The City Engineer may waive the placing of monuments
for a reasonable time during public improvement construction on condition that the subdivider
executes a surety to insure the placing of such monuments within the time required. On behalf of
the City, the City Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to accept such surety bonds and contracts for
monumentation in an amount approved by the City Engineer. Building permits shall not be issued
until all survey monumentation for the block(s) of lots in which the lot(s) for which building permits
are being applied for within the phase of the land division under development has been installed.
When the land division includes an established 1/2, 1/4, 1/4-1/4, or other such section monument,
the established monument shall be preserved and/or fully restored by the subdivider at his cost.

ordinances and design standards recommended by the City Engineer and approved by the
Common Council or Public Works Committee. If the City Engineer rejects the plans and
specifications, he shall notify the owner, who shall modify the plans or specifications, or both,
accordingly. When the plans and specifications are corrected, the City Engineer shall approve the
plans and specifications for transmittal to the Common Council or Public Works Committee. The
Common Council shall approve the plans and specifications before the improvements are installed
and construction commenced.
Construction and inspection.
Prior to starting any of the work covered by the plans approved above, written authorization to
start the work shall be obtained from the City Engineer upon receipt of all necessary permits
and in accordance with the construction methods of this chapter. Building permits shall not be
issued until all improvements required by this chapter are satisfactorily completed, and the
developer has furnished lien waivers for all contractors.
During the course of construction, the City Engineer shall make such inspections as he or the
Common Council deems necessary to insure compliance with the plans and specifications as
approved. In addition, the various City utility superintendents shall make inspections as they
or the Common Council deems necessary to ensure compliance with the plans and
specifications as approved. The owner shall pay the actual cost incurred by the City for such
inspections. This fee shall be the actual cost to the City of inspectors, engineers and other
parties necessary to insure satisfactory work. The engineering costs will be per the
developer's agreement.

project activities.
Record plans. After completion of all public improvements and prior to final acceptance of said
improvements, the subdivider shall make or cause to be made one Mylar and three blue-line plan
sets showing the actual recorded location of all valves, manholes, stubs, sewers and water mains
and such other facilities as the City Engineer shall require. These plans shall be prepared on the
original Mylars of the construction plans and shall bear the signature and seal of a professional
engineer registered in Wisconsin. The presentation of the record plans shall be a condition of final
acceptance of the improvements and release of the surety bond assuring their completion.
§ 472-24. Street improvements.
The subdivider shall construct streets, roads and alleys as outlined on the approved plans based on
the requirements of this chapter, particularly §§ 472-39 and 472-40.
General considerations. The streets shall be designed and located in relation to existing and

Suitable concrete curb and gutter shall be constructed along the outside edge of all street
pavements. Curb and gutter in residential areas shall have a six-inch barrier curb with a twentyfour-
inch flag, except at driveway aprons where depressed curb shall be constructed. Depressed
curb ramps shall be constructed at all handicap ramps for sidewalks and at all bikeways. Said
curbs and gutters shall be constructed of concrete, 3500 PSI strength at seven days, and contain
three continuous one-half-inch-diameter deformed steel reinforcing rods 10 feet long, six inches
on center in the gutter flag at locations crossing underground utility excavations or where
otherwise directed by the City Engineer. Expansion joints 3/4 inch thick shall be placed in the curb
at each starting and ending of a radius, three feet at each side of inlets, and at intervals not
exceeding 250 feet and where otherwise directed by the City Engineer. Tie bars shall be provided
where curb and gutter is adjacent to rigid pavements.
Contraction joints shall be tooled, saw cut, or formed by insertion of a metal plate in the concrete
at intervals not exceeding 12 feet.
§ 472-26. Sidewalks and bikeways.
Where required. In all new subdivisions and additional areas as required by the Common Council,
the construction of all sidewalks shall be in accordance with plans and standard specifications
approved by the City Engineer and in compliance with § 398-5 of the Code of the City of
Brodhead.
Extra-sized sidewalks. Wider-than-standard sidewalks may be required by the Common Council in
the vicinity of schools, commercial areas and other places of public assemblage, and the Common
Council may require the construction of sidewalks in locations other than required under the
preceding provisions of this section if such walks are necessary, in its opinion, for safe and
adequate pedestrian circulation.
Location.
The subdivider shall be required to provide sidewalks and bikeways, where required by the
City's Sidewalk Master Plan, at City specifications as follows: Sidewalks and bikeways shall
normally be located as far from the traffic lane as is possible, but not closer than six inches to
the right-of-way line. Where, as a result of such major obstructions as large and established
trees, steep hills, drainageways, or major utility lines, the construction costs of the sidewalk or
bikeway in its normal location would be prohibitive, sidewalks or bikeways may be located
elsewhere within the street right-of-way, or within an easement, with the approval of the City
Engineer. Sidewalks and bikeways constructed at street intersections or within five feet of a

legal crosswalk shall include provisions for curb ramping as required by § 66.0909, Wis.
Stats., and in accordance with City standards. In all cases where the grades or sidewalks or
bikeways have not been specifically fixed by ordinance, the sidewalks and bikeways shall be
laid to the established grade of the street. [Refer to § 66.0907(2), Wis. Stats.] In areas where
sidewalks and bikeways are to be laid to the established grade of the street, the street edge
of the sidewalk or bikeway pavement shall be at an elevation above the top of the curb
determined by a slope of a minimum of 1/4 inch per foot up to a maximum of 3/4 inch per foot
times the distance between the curb and the street sidewalk or bikeway edge. The sidewalk
or bikeway pavement shall be sloped at a minimum of 1/4 inch per foot and a maximum of 3/4
inch per foot toward the street, unless public drainage is available behind the sidewalk or
bikeway.
Sidewalks in street rights-of-way shall be specifically intended to serve adjacent lots and the
pedestrian traffic generated from and to those lots.
Bikeways.
Bikeways shall be intended to serve both pedestrian and bicycle traffic in areas where the
majority of the adjoining lots do not have frontage or access to the street or are not being
served by the bikeway. In general, those lots which do not front or have access on the street
in question are not the generating or terminating point for the pedestrian or bicycle traffic.
More specifically, bikeways shall be designed to transport the majority of pedestrian or bike
traffic through the area as opposed to serving the adjoining lots as a sidewalk does.
Bikeways shall not be installed in lieu of sidewalks. However, where permitted by City
ordinance, persons may ride a bicycle upon public sidewalks.
Location determination. The Director of Public Works shall determine where sidewalks and/or
bikeways are required in accordance with this section.
Construction standards.
Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete, at least four feet in width and five inches thick on
a four-inch sand base course that extends six inches beyond the edge of the sidewalk.
Sidewalks are to be six inches thick at driveway crossings. Sidewalks are to be constructed in
accordance with standard City specifications.
Bikeways shall be constructed of bituminous asphalt at least eight feet in width and 2 1/2
inches thick on a four-inch sand base course. Bikeways are to be constructed in accordance
with standard City specifications.
Required locations. The subdivider shall be required to install sidewalks and/or bikeways in
accordance with the following:
On all streets within new subdivisions.
Other streets, both major and minor, which serve as major pedestrian access routes to and
from such pedestrian traffic generators as business establishments, restaurants, schools,
neighborhood parks, high-density multifamily developments, etc.
All streets which currently have sidewalk along only a portion of street between consecutive
intersections shall be completed from intersection to intersection.

sewers larger than eight inches in diameter are required, the land divider shall be responsible for
the cost of an eight-inch sewer. The difference in cost between the eight-inch sewer and that
installed shall be borne by the City.
The subdivider shall construct sanitary sewers in such a manner as to make adequate sanitary
sewerage service available to each lot within the subdivision. Where public sanitary sewers of
adequate capacity are determined by the City Engineer to be available, extensions of the public
sanitary sewer system shall be made so as to provide sewer service to each lot. Gravity sanitary
sewers shall be extended to the land division and to each buildable lot as approved by the City
Engineer. Sewerage service lines of the sizes and materials required by the Plumbing Inspector
shall be installed from the sanitary sewers to the property line of every lot in the subdivision. This
installation will be coordinated with the installation of sanitary sewers. The size, type and
installation of all sanitary sewers proposed to be constructed shall be in accordance with plans
and standard specifications approved by the City Engineer. Where sanitary sewers are located
within the floodplain, sanitary manholes shall be floodproofed.
The ends of the services for each lot shall be accurately measured and recorded with the City
Engineer and marked in the field with appropriate staking.
§ 472-28. Water supply facilities.
There shall be provided a water supply system in conformity with the master plan of the water
system as approved by the City Engineer. The subdivider shall install and connect City water to
serve all lots, subject to specifications and inspection by the City Engineer. The subdivider shall
pay all costs of installing and connecting adequate City water, including the bringing of water from
where it exists to the land division in question, as well as providing all waterworks within the land
division. The subdivider shall provide for a minimum water main diameter of eight inches, except
in culs-de-sac where six inches may be allowed, and the location of public fire hydrants along the
public streets at not greater than a six-hundred-foot spacing. Fire hydrants which have not passed
testing or have not been operationalized shall be covered with securely attached bags to preclude
their being inadvertently used by the Fire District in an emergency situation. The center line of the
pumper nozzle of each hydrant shall be a minimum of 21 inches above the pavement.
The subdivider shall have prepared plan and profile drawings and specifications for the installation
of water main facilities in accordance with the City master water main plan, including the water
main, pipe fittings, valves, hydrants and lateral house connections for each lot in the subdivision
extended to the lot line. Upon approval of the plans by the City Engineer, the subdivider shall
construct all facilities required, and the cost of same, including engineering and inspection fees,
shall be paid for by the subdivider.
Where water mains larger than eight inches in diameter are required, the subdivider shall be
responsible for the cost of an eight-inch main. The difference in cost between the eight-inch main
and that installed shall be borne by the City or its utilities.
The rules of the City's utilities on file with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission are hereby
adopted by reference and made a part hereof as though fully set forth herein.

The subdivider shall construct water mains in such a manner as to make adequate water service
available to each lot within the land division. Extensions of the public water supply system shall be
designed so as to provide public water service to each lot and required fire flow protection to each
hydrant. The size, type and installation of all public water mains proposed to be constructed shall
be in accordance with plans and standard specifications approved by the City Engineer.
§ 472-29. Stormwater drainage facilities.
Pursuant to § 472-43, the subdivider shall provide stormwater drainage facilities, which include curb
and gutter, manholes, catch basins and inlets, storm sewers, storm sewer laterals from the main to the
lot line, detention/retention ponds, road ditches and open channels, as may be required. All such
facilities are to be of adequate size and grade to hydraulically accommodate maximum potential
volumes of flow. The type of facility required and the design criteria shall be determined by the City
Engineer. Storm drainage facilities shall be so designed as to minimize hazards to life or property,
minimize shoreland erosion and siltation of surface waters, shall prevent excess runoff on adjacent
property and shall provide positive drainage away from on-site sewage disposal facilities. The size,
type and installation of all stormwater drains and sewers proposed to be constructed shall be in
accordance with this chapter and plans and standard specifications approved by the City Engineer.
Storm sewers oversized to handle runoff from off-site properties will be installed by the subdivider;
however, the cost of oversizing above a twenty-four-inch diameter storm sewer shall be paid by other
users connecting to the system.
§ 472-30. Other utilities.
Insofar, as possible, all utilities, including but not limited to natural gas, telephone, cable TV and
electric, shall be installed underground with an affidavit by the subdivider that the maintenance of
said public improvements will be guaranteed by the subdivider due to use of the improvements by
purchasers and construction traffic. Prior to any maintenance, repair or replacement being
performed by the developer during the bond period, it shall notify the City Engineer at least three
workdays prior to the doing of the work and obtain approval of the City Engineer as to the nature
and manner of work to be done.
The subdivider shall cause gas, electric power, cable television and telephone facilities to be
installed in such a manner as to make adequate service available to each lot in the subdivision,
certified survey or land division. All new electrical distribution, television cables and telephone
lines from which lots are individually served shall be underground unless the Common Council,
upon the recommendation of pertinent City utilities or the Plan Commission, specifically allows
overhead poles because topography, soil, water table, solid rock, boulders, or other physical
conditions would make underground installation unreasonable or impractical.
Plans indicating the proposed location of all gas, electrical power, cable television and telephone
distribution and transmission lines required to service the plat shall be approved by the City
Engineer.
§ 472-31. Street lamps.
The subdivider shall install street lamps along all streets proposed to be dedicated of a design
compatible with the neighborhood and type of development proposed. Such lamps shall be placed at
each street intersection and at such interior block spacing as may be required by the City Engineer.
§ 472-32. Street signs.

The subdivider shall arrange with the City and pay the costs of providing the street signing
necessary to serve the development. Such signing shall include street name signs and such
temporary barricades and "road closed" signs as may be required by the City Engineer until the
street improvements have been accepted by Common Council resolution.
The City Engineer shall have the authority to impose any restrictions to traffic on street
improvements not yet accepted by the City as he may deem necessary to protect the
improvements from damage and to protect the safety of the public. Such restrictions shall include,
but not be limited by enumeration to, weight restrictions, street closings, access restrictions, or the
posting of temporary traffic control measures.
The subdivider shall arrange with the City for providing directional signs for churches, schools and
public facilities at cost, with the approval of the Public Safety and Welfare Committee.
§ 472-33. Erosion control.
The subdivider shall cause all gradings, excavations, open cuts, side slopes, and other land surface
disturbances to be mulched, seeded, sodded or otherwise protected so that erosion, siltation,
sedimentation and washing are prevented. The subdivider shall submit an erosion control plan that
specifies measures that will be taken to assure the minimization of erosion problems.
§ 472-34. Partition fences.
When the land included in a subdivision plat or certified map abuts upon or is adjacent to land used for
farming or grazing purposes, the subdivider shall erect partition fences, satisfying the requirements of
the Wisconsin Statutes for a legal and sufficient fence, between such land and the adjacent land. A
covenant binding the developer, its grantees, heirs, successors, and assigns to erect and maintain
such fences, without cost to the adjoining property owners, so long as the land is used for farming or
grazing purposes, shall be included upon the face of the final plat or certified survey map.
§ 472-35. Easements.
Utility easements. The Common Council, on the recommendation of appropriate departments,
utilities and agencies serving the City, shall require utility easements for poles, wire, conduits,
storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and head mains or other utility lines. It is the intent of this
chapter to protect all established easements so as to assure proper grade, assure maintenance of
the established grade, prohibit construction of permanent fences or retaining walls over
underground installation and prevent the planting of trees in the easement area.
Drainage easements. Drainage easements shall comply with the requirements of § 472-43F.
Easement locations.
Utility easements shall be at least 12 feet wide, or wider where recommended by the City
Engineer, and may run across lots or alongside of rear lot lines. Such easements should
preferably be located along rear lot lines. Evidence shall be furnished the Plan Commission
that easements and any easement provisions to be incorporated in the plat or in deeds have
been reviewed by the individual utility companies or the organization responsible for
furnishing the services involved.
All easements dedicated on final plat or certified survey maps for survey maps for poles,
cables or conduits for electricity, telephone or other private utility lines shall be noted thereon
as "Utility Easement." All easements for storm and sanitary sewers, water and force mains,

followed by reference to the use or uses for which they are intended.
Deed restrictions for easements. Deed restrictions shall accompany each final plat or certified
survey map and shall be filed in the Register of Deeds office. In addition to whatever else may be
contained therein, such restrictions shall describe the location and width of utility and public
easements which are being established; a description by reference to the final plat or certified
survey map shall suffice. Such restrictions shall further recite that the utility companies and the
public agencies using such easements are granted the right to place and shall state that the
elevation of such easements as graded by the subdivider may not be altered thereafter by him or
any subsequent landowner by more than six inches.
§ 472-36. Extra-sized and off-site facilities.
When any public improvements of adequate capacity are not available at the boundary of a proposed
land division, the City, or its duly authorized representative, shall require, as a prerequisite to approval
of a final plat or certified survey map, assurances that such improvement extensions shall be provided
as follows in accordance with the following standards:
Design capacity. All improvements within or entering or leaving the proposed development shall
be installed to satisfy the service requirements for the entire service or drainage area in which the
development is located, and the improvements shall be of sufficient capacity to handle the
expected development of the overall service area involved.
Extra-sized and off-site improvements. Where improvements of adequate size needed to serve
the development are not available at the boundary of the development, the subdivider shall
proceed under one of the alternatives as identified in § 472-21A.
Lift stations. Where sanitary or storm sewer lift stations and force mains are required to lift sewage
to the gravity system, the subdivider shall have plans, profiles, specifications and estimated
operation and maintenance costs prepared for the installation of such facilities to the City
Engineer's requirements. Equipment similar to existing City equipment shall be utilized whenever
possible. The installation, inspection, supervision and engineering fees for lift stations and/or force
mains shall be paid for by the subdivider unless otherwise determined and agreed upon by the
Common Council. Gravity sanitary sewer service shall be employed whenever determined by the
City Engineer to be feasibly accessible.
§ 472-37. Acceptance of improvements and dedications.
Acceptance of improvements. The dedication of any improvements, utilities, streets, parks,
easements, rights-of-way or other lands or rights to the City or the public shall not be considered
accepted by the City for public ownership until such time as the required public improvements
within the intended dedication or necessary because of the intended dedication have been
completed and accepted by the Common Council by adoption of a resolution accepting such
dedication. The subdivider shall be responsible for and liable for the maintenance, safety and
operation of all required public improvements until such time as the improvements are accepted
by the Common Council by resolution. In the event the City must take measures to maintain,
operate or make safe a public improvement existing or required as a result of the land division but
which has not yet been accepted by the City, the costs of such measures shall hereby be
determined to be City-incurred costs to be reimbursed to the City by the subdivider in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
Inspection and certification of improvements.
After any of the following increments of the required improvements have been installed and
completed, the subdivider shall notify the City Engineer, in writing, that the work is complete

be designed according to engineering and planning standards approved by the City Engineer
and applied so as to properly relate the proposed development with adjacent development,
the topography, natural features, public safety and convenience, and the most advantageous
development of undeveloped adjacent lands. The absence of a street being shown on the
Official Map, streets shall be provided in locations determined necessary by the City Engineer
and to the right-of-way widths required in this article for the classification of street required.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to
City master plans, the Official Map, and to this chapter, and other City planning documents
and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, reasonable circulation
of traffic, topographical conditions, runoff of stormwater, public convenience and safety, and in
their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the appropriate
continuation at the same or greater width of the existing streets in adjoining areas.
Areas not covered by Official Map or plan. In areas not covered by an Official Map or a City
Comprehensive Plan, the layout of streets shall conform to the plan for the most advantageous
development of adjoining areas of the neighborhood. Streets shall be designed and located in

lakes and existing tree growth, public convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to
the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets.
Proposed streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being
subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion
of the Common Council, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the
layout of the subdivision or land division or for the advantageous development of the adjacent
tracts.
Streets classifications. Streets shall be required and classified by the City Engineer in accordance
with the City's Comprehensive Plan and, where not identified in said plan, in accordance with
sound engineering standards into the classifications indicated below:
Arterial streets. Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide through traffic for a heavy volume
of vehicles.
Collector streets. Collector streets shall be arranged so as to provide ready collection of traffic
from individual areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway system
and shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as schools, churches and
shopping centers and other concentrations of population and to the major streets into which
they feed. Collector streets shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 70 feet.
Local minor streets. Local streets shall be arranged to conform to the topography to
discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary
sewerage systems, and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and
convenient access to abutting property. Local streets shall have a minimum right-of-way width
of 66 feet.
Alleys. Alleys shall be located at rear property lines, shall discourage through traffic, shall
serve less than 50 vehicles/day, shall be intended to provide access to off-street loading and
service areas and not primary access to parcels. Alleys shall have right-of-way widths as

exceed 1,000 feet in length and shall terminate with a turnaround of not less than 120 feet in
diameter and a roadway turnaround of 100 feet in diameter.
Continuation. Streets shall be laid out to provide for possible continuation wherever topographic
and other physical conditions permit. The use of culs-de-sac shall be held to a minimum, and
permanently dead-ended streets shall be prohibited. Provisions shall be made so that all proposed
streets shall have a direct connection with, or be continuous and in line with, existing, planned or
platted streets with which they are to connect. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary
lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or
unless, in the opinion of the Common Council, upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission,
such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out so as to discourage their use by through traffic.
Frontage roads. Where a land division abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial highway,
or railroad right-of-way, the subdivider shall provide a frontage road, platted access restriction

Street grades. The grade of major thoroughfares and arterial streets shall not exceed 6%, unless
necessitated by exceptional topography and approved by the Plan Commission. Grades of
collector and local streets shall not exceed 8%. The minimum grade of all streets shall be 0.5%,
unless approved by the City Engineer.
Vertical curves. All changes in street grades for arterials and changes in street grades for collector
and local streets where the algebraic difference in the rate of grade exceeds 1% shall be
connected by vertical curves. The minimum length, in feet, of the vertical curve shall be the
product of the K-value for the associated street design speed times the algebraic difference in the
rate of grade.
Half streets. Half streets shall not be platted unless necessary to provide the full width of an
existing street platted to half width. All newly platted streets shall be platted to the required full
width. Where a half street exists adjacent to a proposed land division, the subdivider shall
endeavor to acquire and dedicate the remaining half street.
Intersections.
Angle of intersect. Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography
and other limiting factors of good design permit. The curved street shall intersect another
street with not less than 40 feet of tangent right-of-way between the end of curvature and the
right-of-way of the street being intersected.
Number of streets converging. The number of streets converging at one intersection shall be
reduced to a minimum, preferably not more than two.
Number of intersections along arterial streets. The number of intersections along arterial
streets shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, the distance between such
intersections shall be not less than 1,200 feet, unless otherwise determined by the City
Engineer.
Local street spacing. Local streets and frontage roads intersecting with other local streets
shall be spaced no closer than 300 feet between center lines and spaced no closer than 800
feet between center lines on collector streets, unless otherwise approved by the Plan
Commission.
Property lines at street intersections. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded
with a minimum radius of 15 feet, except that, with all intersections with arterial and collector
streets, the radius shall be increased to 25 feet or of a greater radius when required by the
City Engineer.
Local streets. Local streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial or collector streets,
but if the center lines of such local streets approach the major streets from opposite sides
within 150 feet of each other, measured along the center line of the arterial or collector
streets, then the location shall be so adjusted that the adjoinment across the major or
collector street is continuous and a jog is avoided.
Additional sight easements. At any intersection determined by the City Engineer, restricted
development easements or additional street right-of-way shall be platted to provide for
adequate sight distances in every direction of travel. At a minimum, the subdivider shall
grade, clear or otherwise provide for an unobstructed sight triangle at all intersections
incorporating the area within a triangle formed by the intersection of the street right-of-way
lines and a point on each right-of-way line being not less than 25 feet from the intersection
point.
Street names.
Duplication of existing street names by similar word, spelling, or sound shall not be permitted.

Where a street maintains the same general direction except for curvilinear changes for short
distances, the same name shall continue for the entire length of the street. House numbering
difficulties shall be considered the determining factor in considering whether a change of
name is necessary due to curvilinear changes.
A street name shall be changed when required to conform to the proposed or existing house
numbering base.
A name which is assigned to a street which is not presently a through street, due to
intervening land over which the street extension is planned, shall be continued for the
separate portions of the planned through street.
The following designations shall be used only in the situations indicated:
"Boulevard": a street with a divided pavement, either existing or planned. If the divided
pavement ends but the street continues, the same street name and suffix shall continue.
"Lane": to be limited to a street, one block long, not ending in a cul-de-sac.
"Circle": to be limited to a cul-de-sac of nine lots or more.
"Court": to be limited to a cul-de-sac of eight lots or less.
"Parkway": to be limited to a street abutting a park or greenway or creek.
The maximum number of street names at one intersection shall be three.
Street names shall be assigned to avoid intersections which have the same exact street
names.
The name of any projection of a street shall remain unchanged even if the projection
terminates in a cul-de-sac.
The changing of a street name that does not duplicate an existing street name shall only be
approved where such change will eliminate conflicts with other provisions of this subsection.
Service roads and highways served by them shall have the same street name and
designation.
Approval of street names on a preliminary plat will not reserve the names, nor shall the City
be required to accept such names at the time of final platting.
A minimum number of letters is desirable in a street name. The maximum number of letters,
not including the prefix or suffix, shall not exceed 12.
Limited-access highway and railroad right-of-way treatment. Whenever the proposed subdivision
contains or is adjacent to a limited-access highway, arterial street or railroad right-of-way, the
design shall provide the following treatment:
Subdivision lots. When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the right-of-way of an
existing or proposed limited-access highway or a railroad, a planting strip at least 30 feet in
depth shall be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot depth.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots but shall have the following restriction lettered on the
face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs; the building of
structures hereon prohibited."
Commercial and industrial districts. Commercial and industrial districts shall have provided,
on each side of the limited-access highway, arterial street or railroad, streets approximately

Natural features. In the dividing of any land, regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as
tree growth, watercourses, historic spots or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add
attractiveness and stability to the proposed development.
Land remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after dividing of a larger tract
must be added to adjacent lots, or a plan shown as to future use, rather than allowed to remain as
unusable parcels.
Large lots. In case a tract is divided and results in parcels of more than twice the minimum lot size
provided for by Chapter 480, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Brodhead, for the zoning district in
which the land is located, such parcels shall be so arranged to permit redividing into parcels in
accordance with this chapter and with Chapter 480, Zoning.
Trunk highway proximity. All lots adjacent to state trunk and federal highways shall be platted with
additional depth necessary to provide for a building setback line not less than 50 feet from the
nearer right-of-way line or 110 feet from the center line, whichever is more restrictive. (Refer to Ch.
Trans 233, Wis. Adm. Code.) The subdivider may appeal this requirement to the City Engineer.
Upon written request of the City Engineer, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is hereby
authorized to then determine building setback requirements equal to or less than those required
above in all land divisions (including certified surveys) adjacent to state and federal highways in
accordance with the authority granted in the Wisconsin Administrative Code. The required building
setback line and additional lot depth shall be platted so as to accommodate such required building
setbacks.
Easement allowance. Lots containing pedestrian or drainage easements shall be platted to include
additional width in allowance for the easement.
Drainageway and watercourses. Lots abutting upon watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream
shall have such additional depth or width as required by the City Engineer to obtain building sites
that are not subject to flooding from a post-development one-hundred-year twenty-four-hourduration
storm event.
§ 472-43. Drainage and stormwater management systems.
Purpose. The following provisions in this section are established to preserve and provide properly
located public sites and facilities for drainage and stormwater management as the community
develops and to insure that the costs of providing and developing such public sites are equitably
apportioned on the basis of serving the need for the management of increased stormwater
quantities resulting from land development.
Drainage system required.
As required by § 472-29, a drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the
subdivider to provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the land division and the
drainage area of which it is a part. Simultaneously with the filing of the final plat or as soon
thereafter as practical, the subdivider shall submit plans, profiles and specifications as
specified in this section, which have been prepared by a registered professional engineer and
approved or modified by the Common Council upon the recommendations of the Plan
Commission and City Engineer. Drainage systems shall be designed to accommodate a tenyear
storm event.
Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual
lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area.
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each
lot to adjacent lots.

The Plan Commission shall not recommend for approval any subdivision plat which does not
provide adequate means for stormwater or floodwater runoff. Any stormwater drainage
system will be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
necessary, shall be designed in accordance with all governmental regulations, and a copy of
design computations for engineering capacities shall accompany plans submitted by the
planning engineer for the final plat. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are
exceeded at a point, or that stormwater will extend more than 10 feet beyond the face of the
curb, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and catch basins or curb
inlets shall be used to intercept flow at that point.
Drainage system plans.
The subdivider shall submit to the City at the time of filing a preliminary plat a preliminary
drainage plan or engineering report on the ability of existing watercourse channels, storm
sewers, culverts and other improvements pertaining to drainage or flood control within the
subdivision to handle the additional runoff which would be generated by the development of
the land within the subdivision. Additional information shall be submitted to adequately
indicate that provision has been made for disposal of surface water without any damage to
the developed or undeveloped land downstream or below the proposed subdivision. The
report shall also include:
Estimates of the quantity of stormwater entering the subdivision naturally from areas
outside the subdivision.
Quantities of flow at each inlet or culvert.
Approximate locations and sizes of required storm drainage culverts, sewers and other
required appurtenances.
Location and approximate size of any retention/detention basins.
A grading plan for the streets, blocks and lots shall be submitted by the subdivider for the
area within the subdivision.
The design criteria for storm drainage systems shall be based upon information provided in
this chapter.
Material and construction specifications for all drainage projects (i.e., pipe, culverts, seed,
sod, etc.) shall be in compliance with specifications provided by the City Engineer.
Drainage system requirements. The subdivider shall install all the storm drainage facilities
indicated on the plans required in Subsection C of this section necessary to serve, and resulting
from, the phase of the land division under development:
Street drainage. All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage system. The
street storm system shall serve as the minor drainage system and shall be designed to carry
street, adjacent land and building stormwater drainage. Stormwater shall not be permitted to
be run into the sanitary sewer system within the proposed subdivision or to run across street
intersections.
Off-street drainage. The design of the off-street major drainage system shall include the entire
watershed affecting the land division and shall be extended to a watercourse or ditch
adequate to receive the storm drainage. When the drainage system is outside of the street
right-of-way, the subdivider shall make provisions for dedicating an easement pursuant to
Subsection E for the City to provide for the future maintenance of said system.
Protection of drainage systems. The subdivider shall adequately protect all ditches to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer. Ditches and open channels shall be seeded, sodded or paved
depending upon grades and soil types. (Generally, ditches or channels with grades up to 1% shall

be seeded, those with grades up to 4% shall be sodded, and those with grades over 4% shall be
paved or lined with riprap.)
Drainage easements. Where a land division is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel
or stream:
There shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming
substantially to the lines of such watercourse and such further width or construction, or both,
as will be adequate for the purpose and as may be necessary to comply with this section; or
The watercourse or drainageway may be relocated in such a manner that the maintenance of
adequate drainage will be assured and the same provided with a stormwater easement or
drainage right-of-way conforming to the lines of the relocated watercourse, and such further
width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and may be necessary to
comply with this section; or
Wherever possible, drainage shall be maintained in an easement by an open channel with
landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume flow. In all cases, such
easements shall be of a minimum width established at the high-water mark plus 10 feet.
Dedication of drainageways. Whenever a parcel is to be subdivided or consolidated and embraces
any part of a drainageway identified on a City comprehensive stormwater management plan,
master plan and/or Official Map or any portion thereof, such part of said existing or proposed
public drainageway shall be platted and dedicated by the subdivider as an easement or right-ofway
in the location and at the size indicated, along with all other streets and public ways in the
land division. Whenever any parcel is to be subdivided or consolidated and is part of a drainage
district established under the authority of Ch. 88, Wis. Stats., the subdivider shall petition the
circuit court to transfer the jurisdiction of that portion of the drainage district being subdivided or
consolidated to the City in accordance with § 88.83, Wis. Stats.
Dedication/preservation of stormwater management facilities.
The subdivider is responsible for the entire cost of the drainage basin at the time of
construction. The drainage basin requirements for the area needed for this project and future
other developments would be determined at this time. If a future developer seeks to develop
included property, such developer would be responsible for a percentage of the original cost
of the drainage basin, payable to the original developer.
The subdivider shall dedicate sufficient land area for the storage of stormwater to meet the
needs to be created by the proposed land development and in accordance with the standards
for on-site detention and as determined by the City Engineer. Whenever a proposed
stormwater management facility (e.g., detention or retention basin) shown on the
comprehensive stormwater management plan (if applicable), master plan and/or Official Map
is located, in whole or in part, within the proposed land division, ground areas for providing
the required storage capacity in such proposed public facility shall be dedicated to the public
to the requirements of the master plan and/or Official Map.
Storm drainage facilities.
The subdivider, at his cost, shall install all drainage facilities identified in the erosion control
plan or determined by the City Engineer as being necessary for the management of all lands
and roadways within the development. In addition, drainage capacity through the
development from other areas shall be provided in accordance with a comprehensive surface
water management study, if applicable. All required storm drainage facilities shall be
constructed and operational prior to acceptance of any dedications and/or public
improvements served by the storm drainage facilities.
The subdivider shall submit to the City Engineer for his review and approval a report on the
ability of existing watercourse channels, storm sewers, culverts and other improvements

which would be generated by the development of the land within the land division. Additional
information shall be submitted to adequately indicate that provision has been made for
disposal of surface water without any damage to the developed or undeveloped land
downstream or below the proposed land division. The report shall also include:
Estimates of the quantity of stormwater entering the land division naturally from areas
outside the land division.
Quantities of flow at each inlet or culvert.
Location, sizes and grades of required culverts, storm drainage sewers and other
required appurtenances.
A grading plan for the streets, blocks and lots shall be submitted by the subdivider for the
area within the land division.
The design criteria for storm drainage systems shall be reviewed by the City Engineer and
approved or modified.
Material and construction specifications for all drainage projects (i.e., pipe, culverts, seed,
code, etc.) shall be in compliance with standards and specifications provided by City
ordinance and/or the City Engineer.
Minor drainage system. The subdivider shall install all minor drainage system components
necessary to reduce inconvenience and damages from frequent storms. Minor drainage
components shall include all inlets, piping, gutters, channels, ditching, pumping and other facilities
designed to accommodate the post-development runoff resulting from a ten-year, twenty-four-hour
rainfall event, as determined in the most current edition of the Natural Resources Conservation
Service Technical Release 55 (TR 55). Temporary accumulations of storm runoff from ponding or
flowing water in or near minor system components shall be permitted, providing such
accumulations do not encroach on any traffic lane of any collector or arterial street, nor on the
center 16 feet of any local street, except on cul-de-sac or permanently dead-end streets serving
less than 10 dwelling units, where such accumulations may not overtop the curb. In drainageways
and drainageway easements, accumulations of water shall not inundate beyond the limits of the
drainageway or drainageway easement. Cross-street drainage channels (valley gutters) shall not
be permitted.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Major drainage system. The subdivider shall install all major drainage system components
necessary to reduce inconvenience and damages from infrequent storms. Major system
components shall include large channels and drainageways, streets, easements and other paths
and shall be capable of accommodating post-development runoff in excess of that accommodated

fencing, partial or total submergence of the outlet, debris grates or other methods approved
by the City Engineer, unless in such a location as to render routine maintenance operations
impossible. Outfalls and their channels shall be protected from damages due to scour and
erosion to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
Agricultural drain tiles which are disturbed during construction shall be restored, reconnected
or connected to public storm drainage facilities.
Open channel systems.
Where open channels are utilized in either the minor or major drainage system, they shall be
designed so as to minimize maintenance requirements and maximize safety. Drainage
easements (in lieu of dedications) shall be utilized to accommodate open channels; adequate
access shall be provided by the City for maintenance of drainage capacity. Side slopes shall
not exceed a four-to-one slope. Drainageways with grades of 0.75% or less, or where subject
to high groundwater, continuous flows, or other conditions as determined by the City Engineer
that would hamper maintenance operations due to consistently wet conditions, shall have a
paved concrete invert of not less than eight feet wide and side slopes to a point one foot
above the channel invert.
In areas where invert paving is not required, the drainageway bottom shall be grass. If the
drainageway has a bare soil bottom or the natural grasses in the drainageway are disturbed
due to development operations, the drainageway bottom shall be sodded and securely staked
to one foot above the elevation of inundation resulting from a predevelopment ten year,
twenty-four-hour storm event. Other disturbed areas shall be seeded and prepared in
accordance with the City's erosion control requirements. Velocities for grass-lined channels
shall not exceed those presented in the City's surface water management study, if one is
adopted.
Standards for on-site detention storage. The subdivider shall employ on-site detention to control
erosion and sedimentation, reduce the post-development peak runoff rate or temporarily store
stormwater runoff due to inadequate downstream drainage facilities. The detention (storage)
facilities shall be subject to regulation in accordance with the following standards:
All temporary detention facilities shall safely contain or pass the runoff from any storm of any
duration which exceeds the maximum storm required to be contained up to the one-hundredyear
storm event of twenty-four-hour duration.
All permanent detention facilities shall safely contain or pass the runoff from any storm of any
duration which exceeds the maximum storm required to be contained up to the one-hundredyear
storm event of twenty-four-hour duration on both public and, if necessary, private
properties without inundating any building at the ground elevation, the travel lanes of any
arterial street, the center 16 feet of any collector street or the top of the curb on any local
street.
Detention facility peak discharge rates for the maximum storm required to be contained shall
not exceed the predevelopment peak discharge rate from a ten-year storm event of twentyfour-
hour duration or the capacity of the downstream drainage facilities, whichever is less.
Determination of on-site detention volumes shall be computed by procedures established by
the United States Natural Resources Conservation Service in the most current edition of its
technical publication entitled "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, TR-55," and as
accepted and approved by the City Engineer.[2]

long down times or permanent water features, or other features requiring additional security
for safety reasons.
§ 472-44. Nonresidential subdivisions.
General.
If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for commercial or industrial purposes,
the layout of the subdivision with respect to such land shall make such provisions as the City
may require.
A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements of site plan approval
set forth in Chapter 203, Building Construction, and/or Chapter 480, Zoning, of the Code of
the City of Brodhead. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of

§ 472-45. Grading.
The subdivider shall grade each land division in order to establish street, block and lot grades in proper
relation to each other and to topography as follows:
Master site grading plan.
A master site grading plan shall be prepared by the subdivider for all new subdivisions. This
plan shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements and standards of the City.
The master site grading plan shall show existing and proposed elevations of all lot corners,
control points and building locations. The plan shall also indicate all overland storm drainage
in and adjacent to the subdivision. The cost of the preparation of such a plan shall be paid for
by the subdivider.
After approval or modification of these plans by the City Engineer, the full width of the right-ofway
of the proposed streets within the subdivision and the entire subdivision lot area shall be
graded in accordance with the master site grading plan. The owners of the subdivision lots
shall adhere to those plans.
Upon completion of all street and subdivision grading, the grades shall be checked and
inspected by the Building Inspector to determine that the completed grading work is in
accordance with the master site grading plan. All grades shall be within 0.4 of a foot of the
elevations shown on the master site grading plan.
The cost of all required grading work, supervision, certification, inspection and engineering
fees shall be paid for by the subdivider.
Right-of-way grading. The subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all proposed
streets in accordance with the approved plans, including the grading of site triangles at each
intersection.
Block grading. Block grading shall be completed by one or more of the following methods prior to
the installation of utilities:
Regrading along the side or rear lot lines which provides for drainage to the public drainage
facilities.
Parts of all lots may be graded to provide for drainage to a ditch or to a swale, provided any
ditches or swales are in public drainage easements.
Draining across rear or side lot lines may be permitted, provided that the course of drainage is
within a public drainage easement and is toward public drainage facilities.
Miscellaneous grading requirements.
Lot grading shall be completed so that water drains away from each building site toward
public drainage facilities at a minimum grade of 1%, and provisions shall be made to prevent
drainage onto properties adjacent to the land division unless to a public drainage facility.
Grading activities shall not result in slopes greater than three to one on public lands or lands
subject to public access.
The topsoil stripped for grading shall not be removed from the site unless identified in the
erosion control plan approved by the City Engineer as not being necessary for erosion control

or site landscaping purposes. Topsoil shall be uniformly returned to the lots when rough
grading is finished. Topsoil piles shall be leveled and seeded for erosion control prior to the
City releasing the one-year guarantee provision on public improvements in the streets
adjacent to the lots on which the topsoil is stockpiled.
Such grading shall not result in detriment to any existing developed lands, either within or
outside of the corporate limits.
Article VIII. Park and Public Land Dedications
§ 472-46. General requirements.
Dedication requirement. In order that adequate open spaces and sites for public uses may be
properly located and reserved, and in order that the cost of providing public areas, such as but not
limited to parks and recreation areas, may be equitably apportioned on the basis of additional
need created by the subdivision development, each subdivider shall be required to dedicate land
or fees in lieu of land for park or other public uses.
General design. In the design of a subdivision, land division, planned unit development or
development project, provision shall be made for suitable sites of adequate area for parks,
playgrounds, open spaces, drainageways and other public purposes. Such sites are to be shown
on the preliminary plat and final plat and shall comply with the City Master Plan or component of
said plan. Consideration shall be given to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of
trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds, ravines and woodlands, prairie
and wetlands, and plant and animal communities.
Site reservations required.
Where the area proposed to be divided contains a park, playground or other public area
which is shown upon the Master Plan of the City, such area shall either be dedicated to the
proper public agency, or it shall be reserved for acquisition thereby within a three-year period
by purchase or other means. If the land is not acquired during this period, it shall be released
to the subdivider.
Whenever any river, stream or important surface drainagecourse is located in the area being
divided, the subdivider of land shall provide an easement along each side of the river, stream
or drainagecourse for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting
the river, stream or drainagecourse for drainage or recreational use.
Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided embraces all or any part of an arterial street or
other public way which has been designated in the Comprehensive Plan component or on the
Official Map of the City, such public way shall be made a part of the plat and dedicated or
reserved by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on such plan.
§ 472-47. Land dedication.
Dedication of sites. Where feasible and compatible with the Comprehensive or Master Plan of the
City, the developer shall provide and dedicate to the public adequate land to provide for park,
recreation and open space needs of the land development within the City of Brodhead. The
location of such land to be dedicated shall be determined by the Common Council at the time of
preliminary plat review. Where the dedication is not compatible with the Comprehensive or Master
Plan, or for other reasons is not feasible as determined by the Common Council, the developer
shall, in lieu thereof, pay to the City a fee as established by this article, or a combination thereof.

Dedication of parks, playgrounds, recreation and open spaces. The developer shall dedicate
sufficient land area to provide adequate park, playground, recreation and open space to meet the
needs to be created by and to be provided for the land division, subdivision or comprehensive
development. The minimum dedication shall be:
Five percent of the total acreage intended to be used for commercial or industrial uses;
Five percent of the total acreage intended to be used for single-family dwelling units;
Ten percent of the total acreage intended to be used for duplexes;
Ten percent of the total acreage intended to be used for multifamily dwellings.
Combination of residential uses. Where a combination of residential uses is intended, the
minimum dedication shall be the sum obtained by adding 5% of the acreage intended for singlefamily
dwellings, 10% of the acreage intended for duplex dwellings and 10% of the acreage
intended for multifamily dwellings. Where a definite commitment is made to the City by the
developer with respect to those portions of the total acreage intended for single-family, duplex and
multifamily dwellings, the dedication shall be based upon the maximum dedications which the
zoning classification of the parcel will permit.
Minimum size of park and playground dedications.
In general, land reserved for recreation purposes shall have an area of at least two acres.
Where the amount of land to be dedicated is less than two acres, the Common Council may
require that the recreation area be located at a suitable place on the edge of the proposed
land division, subdivision or comprehensive development so that additional land may be
added at such time that the adjacent land is subdivided. In no case shall an area of less than
one acre be reserved for recreational purposes if it will be impractical or impossible to secure
additional lands in order to increase its area.
Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of a character and location suitable for use as
a playground, play field or for other recreation purposes and shall be relatively level and dry.
A recreation site shall have a total frontage on one or more streets of at least 200 feet, and no
other dimension of the site shall be less than 200 feet.
Fees in lieu of land.
Where, in the sole discretion of the Common Council, there is no land suitable for parks within
the proposed land division or the dedication of land would not be compatible with the City's
comprehensive development or park plan, the minimum size under Subsection D cannot be
met, or City officials determine that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest,
the Common Council shall require the subdivider to contribute a park and recreation
development fee in lieu of land. The fees collected shall be held in a nonlapsing fund to be
used for purchase, development, improvement and maintenance of parks, playgrounds, open
spaces and other recreational sites and facilities. The total fee shall be computed on the basis
of the maximum residential use of each parcel permitted in the particular zoning district under
Chapter 480, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Brodhead. For each proposed residential
development, the fee shall be as set by resolution of the Common Council for each residential
unit. The fee shall be paid to the City at the time of final plat or certified survey approval.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
The Common Council may, in its sole discretion, permit the subdivider to satisfy the
requirements of this article by combining a land dedication with a fee payment. If a land
dedication of 25% of the required dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute an
amount equal to 75% of the required per-unit fee in lieu of land. If a land dedication of 50% of
the required dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to 50%
of the required per-unit fee in lieu of land. If a land dedication of 75% of the required

dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to 25% of the
required per-unit fee in lieu of land.
The City shall place any fee collected pursuant to the provisions of this section in a separate
account to be used at the discretion of the Common Council in any community park, for
developing adequate parks, playgrounds, recreation and open spaces.
Park development fee. In addition, at the time a building permit is issued for new construction of a
single unit or multifamily residential units, a one-time fee as set by resolution of the Common
Council shall be assessed and paid as a special charge for park development. This fee shall be
annually adjusted by the City Clerk-Treasurer by adding to the base fee the consumer price index
(CPI) cost on March 1 of that year for each possible dwelling unit within the plat/land division
allowed by Chapter 480, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Brodhead.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Limitations. A subdivider shall not be required to dedicate more than 1/3 of the total area of the
plat to meet the objectives of this section.
Suitability of lands. The Common Council shall have sole authority to determine the suitability and
adequacy of parklands proposed for dedication. Drainageways, wetlands or areas reserved for
streets shall not be considered as satisfying land dedication requirements.
Deeded to the City. Land dedicated for public purposes shall be deeded to the City at the time the
final plat is approved.
Access to dedicated land. All dedicated land shall have frontage on a public street and shall have
unrestricted public access of 20 feet in minimum width with a five-foot walkway and one eight-foot
paved entrance.
Utility extensions. The subdivider shall install or provide for installation of water and sanitary sewer
lines to the property line of all dedicated land, where such services are to be provided to the
adjacent properties.
§ 472-48. Reservation of additional land.
When public parks and sites for other public areas as shown on the Master Plan or Master Plan
component lie within the proposed area for development and are greater in area than required by
§ 472-47, the owner shall reserve for acquisition by the City, through agreement, purchase or
condemnation, the remaining greater public area for a period of one year of final plat approval, unless
extended by mutual agreement.
§ 472-49. Development of park area.
When parklands are dedicated to the City, the subdivider is required to:
Properly grade and contour for proper drainage;
Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of area as approved by the City Engineer;
and
Cover areas to be seeded with a minimum of six inches of quality topsoil, seed as specified
by the Recreation Director, fertilized with 16-6-6 at a rate of seven pounds per 1,000 square
feet, and mulched, as specified in the standard "Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction," Section 627 and 629. The topsoil furnished for the park site shall consist of the
natural loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam humus-bearing soils adapted

to the sustenance of plant life, and such topsoil shall be neither excessively acid nor
excessively alkaline. Fine grading and seeding must occur within one year following issuance
of the first building permit within that land division, unless otherwise authorized by the
Common Council. The improved area shall not be deemed officially accepted until a uniform
grass cover to a two-inch height has been established. It shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider to maintain the area until the City accepts the dedication.
It shall be the responsibility of the City to maintain the dedicated areas upon their dedication and
acceptance by the City. The owner of said land shall be responsible for its maintenance and
liability thereon, except that said owner shall not develop the surrounding area in a manner which
would unduly depreciate the purpose, use or value of the dedicated property.
A neighborhood park area shall be provided by the subdivider with a standard residential water
service, unless located directly adjacent to a fire hydrant. A community park area shall be provided
by the developer with a minimum six-inch water service or at least one fire hydrant and at least
one four-inch sanitary sewer lateral, all located at the street property line.
The Common Council may require certification of compliance by City officials. The cost of such
report shall be paid by the subdivider.
If the subdivider fails to satisfy the requirements of this section, the Common Council may contract
said completion and bill such costs to the subdivider, following a public hearing and written notice
to the subdivider of noncompliance. Failure to pay such costs may result in the immediate
withholding of all building permits until such costs are paid.
The subdivider shall pay all costs of public improvements in the public streets adjacent to or within
all public and/or park lands.
Development of parklands is to be completed as soon as 20% of the planned lots in the
subdivision are sold or developed, as determined by the Common Council.
Article IX. Fees and Other Charges

Article X. Variances; Enforcement; Penalties; Appeals
§ 472-60. Variations and exceptions.
Where the subdivider alleges that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from
strict compliance with these regulations, he may request variations or exceptions to the
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that
such variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this
chapter. Application for any such variance shall be made in writing by the subdivider to the City
Clerk-Treasurer at the time when the preliminary plat or certified survey is filed for consideration,
stating fully all facts relied upon by the petitioner, and shall be supplemented with maps, plans, or
other additional data which may aid City officials in the analysis of the proposed project. The plans
for such development shall include such covenants, restrictions or other legal provisions
necessary to guarantee the full achievement of the plan. The City Clerk-Treasurer may request
that the City Engineer, City Attorney or other officials review each situation to insure that the
request is consistent with the requirements and standards of this chapter. The City Clerk-
Treasurer shall refer the matter to the Plan Commission with a written report and recommendation
from City staff. The previous granting of variances or exceptions in the same or similar
circumstances shall not of itself constitute grounds for the granting of a variance or exception, nor
shall strictly financial rationale constitute grounds for the granting of a variance.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
The Common Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to the regulations of this chapter
unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
Failure to grant the variation may be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is
located;
The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the property for
which the variation is sought and are not applicable generally to other property;
Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the
specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, financial hardship or self-imposed hardship, if the strict letter of
the regulations were carried out;

There would be no costs (present or future) to the City resulting from the granting of the
variance or exception.
Any recommendations for variances or exceptions by the Plan Commission must be approved by
a 3/4 majority vote of the Plan Commission and shall be so endorsed by the Secretary and
transmitted to the Common Council. The Common Council, if it approves, shall do so by resolution
adopted by 3/4 vote and shall instruct the City Clerk-Treasurer to notify the Plan Commission and
the subdivider.
Variances from the strict application of this chapter may also be granted in accordance with this
chapter in the case of planned unit developments, provided the Common Council, upon review
and recommendations from the Plan Commission, shall find that the proposed development is fully
consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter, City zoning ordinances, and any City
Comprehensive Plan.
§ 472-61. Enforcement; violations and penalties; revocation of
approval; appeals.
Violations. It shall be unlawful to build upon, divide, convey, record or monument any land in
violation of this chapter or the Wisconsin Statutes, and no person shall be issued a building permit
by the City authorizing the building on, or improvement of, any subdivision, land division or replat
with the jurisdiction of this chapter not of record as of the effective date of this chapter until the
provisions and requirements of this chapter have been fully met. The City may institute
appropriate action or proceedings to enjoin violations of this chapter or the applicable Wisconsin
Statutes.
Penalties.

permit, or of the permit or of any approval.
Whenever, in the opinion of the City Engineer, Director of Public Works or Building

of notification of the rejection of the plat. Where failure to approve is based on an unsatisfied
objection, the agency making the objection shall be made a party to the action. The court shall
direct that the plat be approved if it finds that the action of the approving or objecting agency is
arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory.

required minimum widths and depths for such yards and courts in the two districts which abut the
district boundary line.
Relationship with other laws. Where the conditions imposed by any part of this chapter upon the
use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive
than comparable conditions imposed by any other provisions of this chapter or any other laws,
ordinances, resolutions, rules or regulations of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive
(or impose higher standards or requirements) shall be enforced.
City Plan Commission designated. The City Plan Commission is hereby created to carry out the
intent of the City of Brodhead Comprehensive Plan and this chapter. The makeup of the
Commission and its powers and duties shall be prescribed by § 62.23, Wis. Stats., and Chapter
15, Boards, Commissions and Committees, of the Code of the City of Brodhead.
§ 480-9. Use regulations.
Only the following uses and their essential services may be allowed in any district:
Permitted uses. Permitted uses, being the principal uses, specified for a district.
Accessory uses. Accessory uses and structures as specified are permitted in any district but not
until their principal structure is present or under construction.
Conditional uses.
Conditional uses and their accessory uses are considered as special uses requiring, for their
authorization, review, public hearing and approval in accordance with Article IV of this
chapter, excepting those existent at time of adoption of this chapter.
Conditional use(s), when replaced by permitted use(s), shall terminate. In such case(s), the
reestablishment of any previous conditional use(s) or establishment of new conditional use(s)
shall require review, public hearing and approval in accordance with Article IV of this chapter.
Conditional uses authorized by the Plan Commission shall be established for a period of time
to a time certain or until a future happening or event at which the same shall terminate.
Conditional uses authorized by the Plan Commission shall not be subject to substitution with
other conditional uses, either regular or limited, whether similar type or not, without Plan
Commission approval and the procedures required in Article IV of this chapter.
Classification of unlisted uses. Any use not specifically listed as a permitted use or a conditional
use in the districts established in § 480-12 shall be considered to be prohibited, except as may be
otherwise specifically provided hereinafter. In case of question as to the classification of an
unlisted use, the question shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals for determination in

[Amended 4-15-2014; 5-12-2014]
Application. Application for determination for classification of an unlisted use shall be made in
writing to the Zoning Administrator and shall include a detailed description of the proposed
use and such other information as may be required by the Zoning Board of Appeals to

Determination. The determination of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be rendered in writing
within 60 days from the application and shall include findings supporting the conclusion. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine if the classification of the unlisted use is a permitted
use, conditional use or prohibited use in one or more of the districts established in § 480-12.
Effective date of determination. At the time of this determination of the classification of the
unlisted use by the Zoning Board of Appeals, the classification of the unlisted use shall
become effective.
§ 480-10. Site regulations.
Street frontage. All lots shall abut upon a public street or other officially approved means of
access, and each lot shall have an absolute minimum frontage of 50 feet, except in the case
where the Downtown Design Overlay District applies.
Principal structures. All principal structures shall be located on a lot. Not more than one principal
building or use and its accessory buildings or uses may be located on a lot, except in the case of
planned unit developments and districts zoned Light Industrial (I-1) and General Industrial (I-2),
provided that the requirements of those districts shall be met for each structure. The Common
Council may permit as a planned unit development more than one principal structure per lot in any
district where more than one such structure is needed for the orderly development of the parcel.
Where additional structures are permitted, the Common Council may impose additional yard
requirements, landscaping requirements or parking requirements or require a minimum separation
distance between principal structures.
[Amended 4-15-2014]
Dedicated street. All lots shall abut a public street or approved private road or way which is
constructed to applicable standards. No zoning permit shall be issued for a lot which abuts a
public street dedicated to only a portion of its proposed width and located on that side thereof from
which the required dedication has not been secured.
Lots abutting more restrictive districts. Lots abutting more restrictive district boundaries shall
provide side and rear yards not less than those required in the more restrictive abutting district.
The street yard setbacks in the less restrictive district shall be modified for a distance of not less
than 60 feet from the more restrictive district boundary line so such street yard setbacks shall be
no less than the average of the street yards required in both districts.
Site suitability. No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is held unsuitable for
such use or structure by the Common Council, upon the recommendation of the Plan
Commission, by reason of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock
formation, unfavorable topography, low percolation rate or bearing strength, erosion susceptibility
or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics and general
welfare of this community. The Plan Commission, in applying the provisions of this section, shall,
in writing, recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable
for certain uses. The applicant shall have an opportunity to present evidence contesting such
unsuitability if he so desires. Thereafter, the Plan Commission may affirm, modify or withdraw its
determination of unsuitability when making its recommendation to the Common Council.
Preservation of topography. In order to protect the property owner from possible damage due to
change in the existing grade of adjoining lands and to aid in preserving and protecting the natural
beauty and character of the landscape, no change in the existing topography of any land shall be
made which would result in increasing any portion of the slope to a ratio greater than 1 1/2
horizontal to one vertical, within a distance of 20 feet from the property line, except with the written
consent of the owner of the abutting property and with the approval of the Common Council, upon
the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or which would alter the existing drainage or
topography in any way as to adversely affect the adjoining property. In no case shall any slope

Vacated streets. Whenever any street, alley, easement or public way is vacated by official action,
the zoning district abutting the center line of the said vacated area shall not be affected by such
proceeding.
Obstruction of unplatted lands. All buildings hereafter erected upon unplatted land shall be so
placed that they will not obstruct proper street extensions or other features of proper subdivision
and land platting.
Dwelling units. No cellar, basement or unfinished home, garage, tent, recreational vehicle, trailer
or accessory building shall, at any time, be used as a dwelling unit. Basements shall not be used
as dwelling units, except where specifically designed for such use through proper damp-proofing,
fire-protecting walls and other requirements as may be imposed by the building and housing
codes.
Temporary uses. Temporary uses, such as real estate sales field offices or shelters for materials
and equipment being used in the construction of a permanent structure, may be permitted by the
Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator may impose conditions on such temporary uses.
Unclassified or unspecified uses. Unclassified or unspecified uses shall be classified as set forth in
§ 480-9D.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Screening regulations. Any use required by this chapter to be screened in accordance with this
section shall be confined within an opaque fence or wall eight feet high or a visual screen
consisting of evergreen or evergreen-type hedges or shrubs spaced at intervals of not more than
six feet, located and maintained in good condition or in any way out of view of the public.
Number of tenants. No owner of any dwelling shall lease or enter any lease of any one dwelling
unit to more than three persons not related by blood, marriage, adoption or legal guardianship,
living together as a single housekeeping unit and using common cooking facilities, or more than
10 persons living together as a single housekeeping unit and using common cooking facilities in a
foster home wherein the foster parents have been licensed by the Department of Children and
Families.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).

mobile home park, shall comply with all of the following requirements and limitations:
[Amended 3-12-2007]
The dwelling shall be at least 24 feet in width and 36 feet in length and meet the minimum
floor area requirements for a single-family home in the applicable district.
The dwelling shall be constructed or installed on an approved foundation system in conformity
with the Uniform Building Code, which shall include an exterior foundation wall consisting, at a
minimum, of a four-foot permanent perimeter frost wall. If an approved foundation system
other than a four-foot perimeter frost wall is used, the dwelling shall be constructed such that
the area between the dwelling and the ground has the same visual appearance as a dwelling
with a four-foot perimeter frost wall, the plans for which must be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
The dwelling shall be covered by a roof pitched at a minimum slope of two inches in 12
inches, which is permanently covered with a nonreflective material.

structures having setbacks less than that required by this chapter, setbacks on each
remaining lot shall be determined in accordance with the following rule: The front building line
of a proposed structure shall be no nearer the front lot line than a line joining adjacent front
corners of the nearest principal structures which are in the same block frontage on either side
of the proposed structure. If, on a block frontage, no principal structure exists to one side of a
proposed structure, a structure may be assumed to exist on the corner lot which conforms to
the minimum setback and side yard width requirements of this chapter.

the proposed development shall be submitted in duplicate and shall show the location, size and
proposed use of all structures and land included in the area involved. The plans may provide for a

approved development plan shall be construed to be and enforced as a part of this chapter.
Criteria for approval. As a basis for determining the acceptability of application for zoning to the
Planned Unit Development District, the following criteria shall be applied to the proposed
development plan:
The proposed development shall be compatible with the physical nature of the site, with
particular concern for preserving natural features, existing vegetation and topography.
The proposed development shall be an asset to the community aesthetically. The buildings
and uses shall blend in with the surrounding neighborhood.
The proposed development shall not create a traffic or parking demand incompatible with
existing or proposed facilities. The width and location of streets, other paving, and lighting
should be appropriate to the uses proposed. In no case shall standards be less than those
necessary to ensure public safety as determined by the City.
The proposed development shall not place avoidable stress on the City's water supply,
sanitary sewer and stormwater drainage systems.

The proposed development shall make adequate provisions for the permanent reservation
and maintenance of open space.
Procedures.
Step 1: Procedure for rezoning.
The procedure for rezoning to the Planned Unit Development District shall be the same
as for any other zoning district change, except that, in addition, a general development
plan shall be submitted to the Plan Commission. The general development plan of the
proposed project shall be presented at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet and shall
show at least the following information:
The pattern of public and private roads, driveways and parking facilities.
A description of land uses and building types, size and arrangements.
A utility feasibility analysis.
The location of recreational and open space areas reserved or dedicated to the
public.
General landscape treatment.
The plan for phasing the development.
Any other data required by the Plan Commission or Common Council.
Upon final approval and adoption of the zoning change to the Planned Unit Development
District, all plans submitted, as well as other commitments, restrictions, and other factors
pertinent to assuring that the project will be carried out as presented, shall be filed with
the Building Inspector and shall be referred to in regard to enforcement or modification of
the development plans.
Step 2: Specific implementation plan approval.
Detailed plans are not required to be completed at the time the zoning is approved;
however, the review process may be made faster by doing so. Before any building permit
is issued, the Plan Commission shall review and approve a specific implementation plan.
The applicant shall file the following with the Plan Commission:
A final plat of the entire development area showing detailed lot layout, intended uses
of each parcel, public dedication, public and private streets, driveways, walkways
and parking facilities.
The location and treatment of open space areas.
The arrangement of building groups other than single-family residences and all final
landscape plans.
Architectural drawings and sketches illustrating the design of proposed structures.
A utility plan locating all utility installations.
A stormwater drainage and erosion control plan.
Agreements, bylaws, provisions, or covenants which govern the organizational
structure, use, maintenance, and continued protection of the planned unit
development.

any approved development plans shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for approval. Minor
changes can be granted administratively by the Plan Commission. Major changes shall require a
public hearing preceded by a Class 1 notice.
§ 480-26. DD Downtown Design Overlay District.
Purpose. The Downtown Design Overlay District is provided to regulate the design and
appearance of development activities within the downtown area. The intent of the district is to
preserve and enhance the historical quality of existing downtown buildings; to improve pedestrian
circulation, convenience, and comfort; and to attain a consistent and visually pleasing image for
the downtown area. As an overlay district, the requirements set forth herein are in addition to
those required by the underlying use district. The Plan Commission shall be responsible for
administration of this section. However, at the discretion of the Plan Commission, the Mayor may
appoint an advisory committee, to be known as the "Downtown Design Advisory Committee," to
assist the Plan Commission with the administration of the design guidelines. This Downtown
Design Advisory Committee shall consist of five members appointed by the Mayor utilizing a list of
names supplied by the Brodhead Downtown Revitalization Committee and the Brodhead Business
Improvement District Board of Directors. The Advisory Committee will meet jointly with the Plan
Commission to review proposed plans for new building construction or remodeling projects in the
downtown area.
Review of building plans. Within the Downtown Design Overlay District, all plans for new
construction, remodeling, facade renovation, or demolition shall be reviewed and approved by the
Plan Commission (with advice from the Downtown Design Advisory Committee) prior to beginning
of any development activities.
Professional services. The Plan Commission (with advice from the Downtown Design Advisory
Committee) may consult professional services when it is deemed necessary. The Plan
Commission (with advice from the Downtown Design Advisory Committee) may also require that
plans submitted for review be certified by an architect or appropriate professional.
Plan review procedures.
Any application for zoning approval within the boundaries of the Downtown Design Overlay
District shall be transmitted to the Plan Commission (with advice from the Downtown Design
Advisory Committee) for review and approval. In addition to the information required for a
zoning permit, a detailed description of the construction, alteration, demolition, or use
proposed, together with any architect drawings or sketches if those services have been
utilized by the applicant, and, if not, a sufficient description of the construction, alteration,
demolition, and use to enable a determination of what the final appearance will be, shall be
required. On large-scale projects, it is suggested that conceptual plans be submitted for
preliminary review prior to submitting detailed plans. Upon receiving an application for a
zoning permit requiring approval by the Plan Commission, the Building Inspector shall contact
the Commission Chairperson and schedule a meeting within 15 days. Publication of a public
hearing notice shall not be required. The Plan Commission (with advice from the Downtown
Design Advisory Committee) shall conduct the hearing and act on the application within 15
days following the hearing.

The Plan Commission, with the advice of the Downtown Design Advisory Committee, may
take any of the following actions: approve issuance of the zoning permit; deny issuance of the
zoning permit; condition issuance of the zoning permit on making changes to the submitted
plan. All actions taken by the Plan Commission shall be recorded and shall state the reasons
for the action taken. A copy of any final approved plan shall be attached to the zoning permit.
It shall be the responsibility of the Building Inspector to assure that actual development
conforms to plans approved by the Plan Commission.
Plan review guidelines. The Plan Commission shall use the design guidelines prepared for the
downtown area by the University of Wisconsin Department of Landscape Architecture as its
criteria for reviewing proposed development activities. In addition, the following guidelines shall be
utilized in conducting the review of any proposed plan:[1]
The mass, volume, or setback of proposed structures should appear to be compatible with
existing buildings in the immediate area.
The facade of new or remodeled structures should maintain a compatible relationship with
those of existing structures in terms of window sill or header lines, proportion of window and
door lines, horizontal or vertical emphasis of major building elements, extent of architectural
detail.
The building materials and colors used should complement and be compatible with other
buildings in the immediate area.
Exterior remodeling should be designed to take into account the entire building facade. The
ground-floor exterior should be designed to harmonize with the upper stories.
Existing buildings and structures should be recognized as products of their own time.
Alterations which have no historical basis should be discouraged.
The sizing and placement of signs should fit the building.
All off-street parking and service areas should be landscaped and screened as viewed from
public rights-of-way.
Any landscape treatment should utilize a combination of deciduous and evergreen trees and
shrubs hardy to this region and requiring minimum maintenance. All plant materials should be
of sufficient size to be visually effective at the time of installation.
Demolition should occur only where it is found that the structure is structurally unsound or
physically incapable of supporting a viable use.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Article IV. Conditional Uses
§ 480-27. Purpose.
The development and execution of this article is based upon the division of the City of Brodhead into
districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and bulk and location of buildings and
structures in relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are
certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as
unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of
the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities and of the public need for the
particular use of a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be
allowed in a particular district, provided that due consideration is given to location, development and

operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses and are those uses specifically
designated as conditional uses by the zoning district or which are classified as a conditional use under
the review procedures in this article.
§ 480-28. Conditional use permit; general requirements.
The Plan Commission may authorize the Zoning Administrator to issue a conditional use permit for
either regular or limited conditional use after review and public hearing, provided that such
conditional use and involved structure(s) are found to be in accordance with the purpose and
intent of this chapter and are further found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise
adverse to the environment or the value of the neighborhood or the community. Such Plan
Commission resolution, and the resulting conditional use permit, when for limited conditional use,
shall specify the period of time for which effective, if specified, the name of the permittee, the
location and legal description of the affected premises. Prior to the granting of a conditional use,
the Plan Commission shall make findings based upon the evidence presented that the standards
herein prescribed are being complied with.
Any development within 500 feet of the existing or proposed rights-of-way of freeways,
expressways and within 1/2 mile of their existing or proposed interchange or turning lane rights-ofway
shall be specifically reviewed by the highway agency that has jurisdiction over the trafficway.
The Plan Commission shall request such review and await the highway agency's recommendation
for a period not to exceed 20 days before taking final action.
Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction
commencement and completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing, planting screens, operation
control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access
restrictions, increased yards or parking requirements may be required by the Plan Commission
upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this chapter.
Compliance with all other provisions of this chapter, such as lot width and area, yards, height,
parking, loading, traffic, highway access and performance standards shall be required of all
conditional uses.
§ 480-29. Applicability.
Any person, firm, corporation or organization having a freehold interest or a possessory interest
entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, or an
exclusive possessory interest, and which is specifically enforceable in the land for which a conditional
use is sought may file an application to use such land for one or more of the conditional uses in the
zoning district in which such land is located.
§ 480-30. Application for conditional use.
Required application materials. An application for a conditional use shall be filed in duplicate on a
form prescribed by the City. Such applications shall be forwarded to the Plan Commission on
receipt by the City Clerk-Treasurer. Such applications shall include, where applicable:
A statement, in writing, by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed
conditional use shall conform to the standards set forth in § 480-33 hereinafter.

§ 480-35. Appeals.
Any action of the Plan Commission in granting or denying a conditional use permit may be appealed to
the Zoning Board of Appeals, if a written request for an appeal is filed within 10 days after the date of
the Plan Commission's action in granting or denying the permit. Such request for appeal shall be
signed by the applicant or by the owners of at least 20% of the land area immediately adjacent
extending 100 feet therefrom or by the owners of 20% or more of the land directly opposite thereto
extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite land. The request shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator, who shall submit it to the Zoning Board of Appeals at its next meeting, together
with any documents and other data used by the Plan Commission in reaching its decision. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may consider the matter forthwith, refer the matter to a subsequent meeting or set a
date for a public hearing thereon. In the event the Zoning Board of Appeals elects to hold a public
hearing, notice thereof shall be given by mail to the known owners of the lands immediately adjacent
thereto and directly opposite any street frontage of the lot or parcel in question and by publication of a
Class 1 notice in the official newspaper at least 10 days before the date of the hearing. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may either affirm or reverse by a 2/3 vote, in whole or in part, the action of the Plan
Commission and may finally grant or deny the application for a conditional use permit.
§ 480-36. Conditions and guarantees.
The following provisions shall apply to all conditional uses:
Conditions. Prior to the granting of any conditional use, the Plan Commission, or the Zoning Board
of Appeals on appeal, may stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment,
location, construction, maintenance and operation of the conditional use as deemed necessary to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the community, and to secure compliance
with the standards and requirements specified in § 480-33 above. In all cases in which conditional
uses are granted, the Plan Commission shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may
deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will
be complied with. Such conditions may include specifications for, without limitation because of
specific enumeration:
Landscaping;
Type of construction;
Construction commencement and completion dates;
Sureties;
Lighting;
Fencing;

Increased parking; or
Any other requirements necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this chapter.
Site review. In reviewing each application, the Plan Commission shall evaluate each application
and may request assistance from any source which can provide technical assistance. The Plan
Commission may review the site, existing and proposed structures, architectural plans,
neighboring uses, parking areas, driveway locations, stormwater detention, highway access, traffic
generation and circulation, drainage, sewerage and water systems and the proposed
operation/use.
Alteration of conditional use. No alteration of a conditional use shall be permitted unless approved
by the Plan Commission.
Architectural treatment. Proposed architectural treatment will be in general harmony with
surrounding uses and the landscape. To this end, the Plan Commission may require the use of
certain general types of exterior construction materials and/or architectural treatment.
Sloped sites; unsuitable soils. Where slopes exceed 6% and/or where a use is proposed to be
located on areas indicated as having soils which are unsuitable or marginal for development, onsite
soil tests and/or construction plans shall be provided which clearly indicate that the soil
conditions are adequate to accommodate the development contemplated and/or that any inherent
soil condition or slope problems will be overcome by special construction techniques. Such special
construction might include, among other techniques, terracing, retaining walls, oversized
foundations and footings, drain tile, etc.
Conditional uses to comply with other requirements. Conditional uses shall comply with all other
provisions of this chapter such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking and loading. No
conditional use permit shall be granted where the proposed use is deemed to be inconsistent or
conflicting with neighboring uses for reasons of smoke, dust, odors, noise, vibration, lighting,
health hazards or possibility of accident.
§ 480-37. Validity of conditional use permit.
Where the Plan Commission has approved or conditionally approved an application for a conditional
use, such approval shall become null and void within 12 months of the date of the Plan Commission
action unless the use is commenced, construction is underway or the current owner possesses a valid
building permit under which construction is commenced within six months of the date of issuance and
which shall not be renewed unless construction has commenced and is being diligently prosecuted.
Approximately 45 days prior to the automatic revocation of such permit, the Zoning Administrator shall
notify the holder by certified mail of such revocation. The Plan Commission may extend such permit for
a period of 90 days for justifiable cause, if application is made to the City at least 30 days before the
expiration of said permit.

The Plan Commission shall retain continuing jurisdiction over all conditional uses for the purpose of
resolving complaints against all previously approved conditional uses. Such authority shall be in
addition to the enforcement authority of the Zoning Administrator to order the removal or
discontinuance of any unauthorized alterations of an approved conditional use, and the elimination,
removal or discontinuance of any violation of a condition imposed prior to or after approval or violation
of any other provision of this chapter. Upon written complaint by any citizen or official, the Plan
Commission shall initially determine whether said complaint indicates a reasonable probability that the
subject conditional use is in violation of either one or more of the standards set forth in § 480-33
above, a condition of approval or other requirement imposed hereunder. Upon reaching a positive
initial determination, a hearing shall be held upon notice as provided in § 480-32 above. Any person
may appear at such hearing and testify in person or represented by an agent or attorney. The Plan
Commission may, in order to bring the subject conditional use into compliance with the standards set
forth in § 480-33 or conditions previously imposed by the Plan Commission, modify existing conditions
upon such use and impose additional reasonable conditions upon the subject conditional use as
provided in § 480-36. Additionally, the offending party may be subjected to a forfeiture as set forth in
this chapter and § 1-4. In the event that no reasonable modification of such conditional use can be
made in order to assure that the standards in § 480-33A and B will be met, the Plan Commission may
revoke the subject conditional approval and direct the Zoning Administrator and the City Attorney to
seek elimination of the subject use. Following any such hearing, the decision of the Plan Commission
shall be furnished to the current owner of the conditional use in writing stating the reasons therefor. An
appeal from a decision of the Plan Commission under this section may be taken to the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
§ 480-39. Bed-and-breakfast establishments.

Intent. The intent of this section is to provide a means to accommodate a small home-based family
or professional business without the necessity of a rezoning from a residential to a commercial
district. Approval of an expansion of a home occupation at a future time beyond the limitations of
this section is not to be anticipated; relocation of the business to an area that is appropriately
zoned may be necessary.
Permitted home occupations; restrictions. Home occupations, including professional home offices,
meeting the requirements of this section are a conditional use in all residential districts and are
subject to the requirements of the district in which the use is located, in addition to the following
requirements:
The home occupation shall be conducted only within the enclosed area of the dwelling unit or
an attached garage.
There shall be no exterior alterations which change the character thereof as a dwelling and/or
exterior evidence of the home occupation other than those signs permitted in the district.
No storage or display of materials, goods, supplies or equipment related to the operation of

Purpose and definitions. The purpose of this section is to apply design standards and additional
conditions to large developments proposed in the City of Brodhead to insure that such
developments are properly located and compatible with the surrounding area and community
character, and that such developments do not negatively affect the City and property owners in the
future. These large developments should present high-quality materials and design, promote
pedestrian-friendly environments, encourage responsible stormwater management practices, and
insure that the development is beneficial to the community. A developer's agreement shall be
entered into with the City as a condition for the issuance of a conditional use permit. Any
developer's agreement approved by the Plan Commission and the Common Council pursuant to
this section shall conform as closely as possible to these standards, but shall have the flexibility to
consider the unique requirements of the individual development. "Large developments" are
defined as individual freestanding buildings and group developments in which the combined total
of all structures and outdoor sales areas within a development (regardless of diverse lotting, use
or tenancy) combine to more than 20,000 square feet. Any single retail building 20,000 or more
square feet in size is a conditional use within any zoning district where such use would otherwise
be allowed. Conditional use approval does not exempt such use from the provisions of this
chapter, when applicable. All additions to existing retail and commercial service buildings built
either before or after the adoption of this section, which bring the total building size to over 20,000
gross square feet, shall also require a conditional use permit and become subject to the
requirements of this section.
Compatibility with City plans. The applicant shall provide, through a written report submitted with
the petition for a conditional use permit, adequate evidence that the proposed building and overall
development project is compatible with the City's community character, urban design and actual
area preservation, commercial development, redevelopment or community facility objectives as
expressed in the adopted elements of the City's Comprehensive Plan.
Building materials. Building materials shall be unified throughout the building and shall
complement other buildings in the vicinity. Exterior building materials shall be of high and
comparable aesthetic quality on all sides. Building materials such as glass, brick, decorative
concrete block, or stucco shall be used, as determined by the Plan Commission. Decorative
architectural metal with concealed fasteners may be approved if sensitively incorporated into the
overall design of the building.
Building design. The building exterior shall be unified in design throughout the structure and shall
complement other buildings in the vicinity. The building shall employ varying building setbacks,
height, roof treatments, door and window openings, and other structural and decorative elements
to reduce apparent size and scale. A minimum of 20% of all the combined facades of the structure
shall employ actual facade protrusions or recesses. A minimum of 20% of all of the combined
linear roof eave or parapet lines of the structure shall employ differences in height, with such
differences being six feet or more as measured eave to eave or parapet to parapet. Roofs with
particular slopes may be required by the City to complement existing buildings or otherwise
establish a particular aesthetic objective. Ground-floor facades that face and are within 100 feet of
public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features
along no less than 50% of their horizontal length. The integration of windows into building design
is strongly encouraged.
Building entrances. Public building entryways shall be clearly defined and highly visible on the
building's exterior design and shall be emphasized by on-site traffic flow patterns. Two or more of
the following design features shall be incorporated into all public building entryways: canopies or
porticos, overhangs, projections, arcades, peaked roof forms, arches, outdoor patios, display
windows, distinct architectural details. All sides of the building that directly face or abut a public
street or public parking area shall have at least one public entrance, except that the City shall not
require building entrances on more than two sides of any building.
Building colors. Building facade colors shall be nonreflective, subtle, neutral, or earth tone. The
use of high-intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors on facades shall be

prohibited. Building trim and architectural accent elements may feature brighter colors, but such
colors shall be muted, not metallic, and not fluorescent. Depending upon the intensity and
community aesthetic quality of standard corporate and trademark colors, such colors may be
allowed only on sign face and copy areas.
Building location. Modest building setbacks are encouraged. Where buildings are proposed to be
distant from a public street, the overall development design shall include smaller buildings on pads
or outlets closer to the street.
Screening. Mechanical equipment, refuse containers and any permitted outdoor storage shall be
fully concealed from on-site and off-site ground-level views, with materials identical to those used
on the building exterior. Loading docks shall be completely screened from surrounding roads and
properties. Such screening may be accomplished through loading areas internal to buildings,
screen walls which match the building exterior in materials and design, fully opaque landscaping
at time of planting, or combinations of the above. Gates and fencing may be used for security and
access, but not for general screening, and shall be of high aesthetic quality.
Traffic impact. All projects that include buildings over 20,000 square feet shall have direct access
to an arterial street or shall dedicate public roads which have direct access to an arterial street.
Vehicle access shall be designed to accommodate peak on-site traffic volumes without disrupting
traffic on public streets or impairing pedestrian safety. This shall be accomplished through
adequate parking lot design and capacity; access drive entry throat length, width, design, location,
and number; traffic control devices; and sidewalks. The site design shall provide direct vehicular or
pedestrian connections to adjacent land uses if required by the City. Prior to development
approval, the applicant's traffic engineer shall complete and present a traffic impact analysis
following State Department of Transportation guidelines. Where the project will cause off-site
public roads, intersections, or interchanges to function below Level of Service C, as defined by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers, the City may deny the application, require a size reduction in
the proposed development, or require that the developer construct and/or pay for required off-site
improvements.
Parking. Not more than 50% of the off-street parking spaces shall be located directly between the
front facade of the building over 20,000 square feet and the public street, unless additional
buildings in the overall development are or will be located between the main building and the
public street. Such additional buildings must be sufficient in size, location, and number to provide
an effective visual break between the public street and the parking lot. Parking lots in which the
number of spaces significantly exceeds the minimum number of parking spaces required in § 480-
49 of this chapter shall be allowed only with specific and reasonable justification. Parking lot
design shall employ interior, curbed landscaped islands at all parking aisle ends. In addition, the
project shall provide landscaped islands within each parking aisle spaced at intervals no greater
than one island per every 20 spaces in that aisle. Islands at the ends of aisles shall count toward
meeting this requirement. Each required landscaped island shall be a minimum of 300 square feet
in area. Landscaped medians shall also be used to break large parking areas into smaller pods,
with a maximum of 100 spaces in any one pod.
Landscaping. On-site landscaping shall be provided per the landscaping requirements of § 480-
97D of this chapter. The project shall also provide:
Extensive building foundation landscaping for all building frontage facing public streets,
parking lots, or residential districts to provide visual breaks in the mass of the building.
Extensive paved area landscaping for all parking, driveway, and loading areas to screen and
provide visual breaks in the size of such paved areas. Canopy/shade trees shall be
emphasized within landscaped islands, with shrubs, ground cover, or grass preferred to mulch
or stones.
Existing natural features and vegetation integrated into the site design as a site and
community amenity, to the extent practical.

Q.
Lighting. On-site exterior lighting shall meet all the standards of § 480-69 of this chapter. The color
and design of pole lighting standards shall be compatible with the building and the City's public
lighting in the area, if a particular public lighting theme has been established for the area.
Signage. On-site signage shall meet the standards of Article VII of this chapter. The plan for
exterior signage shall provide for modest, coordinated, and complimentary exterior sign location,
configurations, and colors through the development. All freestanding signage within the
development shall compliment on-building signage. Monument-style ground signs are strongly
preferred over pole signs, and consolidated signs for multiple users are strongly preferred over
multiple individual signs.
Bike and pedestrian access. The entire development shall provide for safe pedestrian and bicycle
access to all uses within the development, connections to existing and planned public pedestrian
and bicycle facilities, and connections to adjacent properties. Sidewalks shall be provided along
the entire length of any facade containing a public entrance, leaving room for foundation planting
beds. Pedestrian walkways shall be provided from all building entrances to existing or planned
public sidewalks or pedestrian/bike facilities. Internal pedestrian walkways must be distinguished
from driving surfaces. Site design shall allow pedestrians to walk parallel to moving cars. The
development shall provide secure, integrated bicycle parking and pedestrian furniture in
appropriate quantities and location. The building shall provide awnings or other weather protection
features within 30 feet of all customer entrances.
Central areas/features. Each development that contains a building over 20,000 square feet in area
shall provide an outside central area or feature, such as a patio/seating area, pedestrian plaza
with benches, outdoor playground area, water feature, and/or other such deliberately designated
area or focal point that adequately enhances the development or community. All such areas shall
be openly accessible to the public, connected to the public and private sidewalk system, designed
with materials compatible with the building and remainder of the site, and maintained over the life
of the building and project.
A minimum of one two-hundred-square-foot cart return area shall be provided for every 100
parking spaces, unless the use does not require carts. Cart returns shall be of durable, all-season
construction and shall be designed and colored to be compatible with the building and parking lot
light standards. There shall be no exterior cart return or cart storage areas located within 25 feet of
the building.
Delivery and loading spaces.
Delivery and loading operations shall be designed and located to mitigate visual and noise
impacts to streets and adjoining residential neighborhoods. If there is a residential use or
residentially zoned area adjacent to the site, such operations shall not be permitted between
9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. For good cause shown, the Plan Commission may permit deliveries
at additional times, provided the applicant submits evidence such deliveries will not negatively
impact nearby residential uses. Delivery and loading areas shall be substantially set back
from a residential use or residentially zoned property that is adjacent to that site. A landscape
buffer of substantial width should be provided adjacent to the delivery and loading area where
it adjoins residential uses or zones. The landscape buffer should include evergreen shrubs
and/or trees plus deciduous canopy trees at regular intervals to provide noise, light, and
visual screening. If the delivery and loading spaces are located within an enclosed building or
underground, no such setback and buffer area shall be required.
Delivery trucks shall not be parked on the premises during nondelivery hours with motor
and/or refrigerators/generators running, unless the truck noise is mitigated so that it does not
significantly affect nearby residential properties.
The delivery and loading areas shall be screened or enclosed so that they are not visible from
public streets, public sidewalks, internal pedestrian walkways or adjacent properties. The

screen shall be of masonry construction and at least 10 feet high or of a design approved by
the Plan Commission to screen the noise and activity of the loading dock.
Maintenance and reuse of properties. Unless otherwise specifically provided in a developer's
agreement approved by the Common Council, all parcels or development sites with a total of
20,000 or more square feet of new retail development shall be subject to the following provisions:
The owner shall maintain the property in compliance with all provisions of the Brodhead
Municipal Code or a plan approved as part of a developer's agreement approved by the
Common Council. If the property is not found to be in compliance with the code or the
approved plan, the City may take action to correct the situation, after providing the owner or
operator with notice of the defective condition and an opportunity to cure the alleged defective
condition. Costs of any such corrective action by the City shall be assessed as a special
charge against the property, to be added to the property tax bill pursuant to § 66.0627, Wis.
Stats.
If the facility is vacated, the owner or operator, within 12 months, shall submit to the Plan
Commission a plan contemplating the removal or reuse of the facility. The time limit may be
extended by the Plan Commission. If the owner or operator is unable to provide a plan which
is acceptable to the Plan Commission, the City may take whatever action is permitted by law
to assure appropriate redevelopment or use of the facility.
Article V. Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
§ 480-42. Existing nonconforming uses.
The lawful nonconforming use of land existing at the time of original adoption of this chapter may
be continued although the use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter. However, only
that portion of the land in actual use may be so continued.
When a use district is changed, any existing, nonconforming use in such changed district may be
continued or changed to a use permitted in the same use district as that in which the existing use
is permitted, provided all other regulations governing the new use are complied with.
Substitution of new equipment may be permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals if such
equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming use with the neighboring uses.
§ 480-43. Existing nonconforming structures.
[Amended 6-12-2006]
The lawful nonconforming use of a structure or water existing at the time of the adoption or
amendment of this chapter may be continued although the use of the structure does not conform
with the provisions of this chapter.
The structure may not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, moved, or structurally
altered, subject to § 480-44C, except when required to do so by law or order so as to comply with
the provisions of this chapter.
The lawful nonconforming structure existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this
chapter may be continued although its size or location does not conform with the lot width, lot
area, yard, height, parking and loading, and access provisions of this chapter; however, it shall not
be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, subject to § 480-44C, except
when required to do so by law or order so as to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 480-44. Abolishment or replacement.
[Amended 6-12-2006]
Discontinuance. If the nonconforming use of a building or premises is discontinued for 12 months,
any future use of the building or premises shall conform to the regulations for the district in which it
is located. A reasonable interim between tenants or occupants shall not be construed to mean
discontinuance.
Extensive repair must be in conformance. Subject to Subsection C, at such time as structural
repairs, reconstruction or alterations are made to nonconforming structures or premises, which
repairs or alterations exceed 50% of the equalized assessed value of such structures or premises
as established by the City Assessor, such structures or premises will be required to conform to the
use restrictions of this chapter.
Restoration of certain nonconforming structures.
Restoration of certain structures. The restrictions contained in this section applicable to
damaged or destroyed nonconforming structures do not prohibit the restoration of a
nonconforming structure if the structure will be restored to the size, subject to Subsection
C(2), location and use that it had immediately before the damage or destruction occurred, nor
shall the limitations of this section concerning the costs of repair, reconstruction or
improvement pertain to such structure if all of the following apply:
The nonconforming structure was damaged or destroyed on or after March 2, 2006;
The damage or destruction was caused by a violent wind, vandalism, fire, flood, ice,
snow, mold or infestation.
Size restrictions. The size of a structure to which this subsection applies may be larger than
the size it was immediately before the damage or destruction if necessary for the structure to
comply with applicable state or federal requirements.
§ 480-45. Changes and substitutions.
Once a nonconforming use or structure has been changed to conform, it shall not revert back to a
nonconforming use or structure. Once the Zoning Board of Appeals has permitted the substitution of a
more restrictive nonconforming use for an existing nonconforming use, the substituted use shall lose
its status as a legal nonconforming use and become subject to all the conditions required by the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
§ 480-46. Substandard lots.
A vacant lot which does not contain sufficient area to conform to the dimensional requirements of this
chapter but which is at least 50 feet wide and 5,000 square feet in area may be used as a single-family
building site, provided that the use is permitted in the zoning district, providing the lot is on record in
the appropriate county register of deeds office prior to the effective date or amendment of this chapter.
If two or more substandard vacant lots with continuous frontage have the same ownership as of the
effective date of this chapter, the lots involved shall be considered to be an individual parcel for the
purposes of this chapter. If one of the substandard lots with continuous frontage under the same
ownership as of the effective date of this chapter is an improved lot, then such lot shall nevertheless be
considered an individual parcel for the purpose of this chapter.

Article VI. Traffic Visibility, Loading, Parking and Access
§ 480-47. Traffic visibility.
Vision setback at intersections of public streets.
No obstructions, such as structures, parking, or vegetation, shall be permitted in any district
between the heights of 2 1/2 feet and 10 feet above the plane through the mean curb grades
within the triangular space formed by any two existing or proposed intersecting street or alley
right-of-way lines and a line joining points on such lines located a minimum of 25 feet from
their intersection.
In situations where trees of large diameter, large numbers of trees, or some combination of
these are present, this provision shall be construed to mean that a sufficient number of trees
shall be removed so as to render an object such as a motor vehicle clearly visible across the
vision clearance triangle from one street or road to another, the intent being to provide for the
public safety, but it shall not necessarily be construed to mean that every tree in the vision
clearance triangle must be removed.
Exception. In the case of arterial streets intersecting with other arterial streets or railways, the
corner cutoff distances establishing the triangular vision clearance space shall be increased to 50
feet.
§ 480-48. Loading requirements.
Loading space requirements. On every lot on which a new business, commercial or industrial use
is hereafter established, off-street loading space with access to a public street or alley shall be

where the floor area for each use is below the minimum required for a loading space but the
aggregate floor area of such uses is above such a minimum, then off-street loading space shall be
provided as if the entire building were devoted to that use in the building for which the most
loading spaces are required.

Location. All loading areas shall be off-street and shall be located on the same lot as the building
or use to be served. A loading area shall not be located less than 25 feet from any street right-ofway,
nor less than 50 feet from a residential district unless within a building. Loading areas shall
not occupy more than 1/2 the required front yard setback. No loading space shall be located within
30 feet of the nearest point of intersection of two streets or require any vehicle to back into a
public street.
Surfacing. All open off-street loading berths shall be improved with a compacted gravel base, not
less than seven inches thick, surfaced with not less than two inches of asphalt or treated with
some comparable all-weather dustless material.
Size. An individual loading space shall be at least 12 feet wide by 70 feet long and have a
minimum high clearance of 16 feet.
Utilization. Space allocated to any off-street loading berth shall not, while so allocated, be used to
satisfy the space requirements for any off-street parking facilities or portions thereof.
Central loading. Central loading facilities may be substituted for loading berths on the individual
zoning lots, provided the following conditions are fulfilled:
Each zoning lot served shall have direct access to the central loading area without crossing
streets or alleys at grade.
Total berths provided shall meet the requirements based on the sum of the several types of
uses served. (Areas of types of uses may be totaled before computing number of loading
berths.)
No zoning lot served shall be more than 300 feet removed from the central loading area.
The tunnel or ramp connecting the central loading area with the zoning lot served shall be not
less than seven feet in width and have a clearance of not less than seven feet.
Unlawful truck use. No truck or semitrailer, or part thereof, shall be used for the purpose of
permanent storage of goods or material or for advertising purposes within the City. Use for a
period in excess of two weeks for the purpose of storage or advertising shall, for the purpose of
construction of this chapter, be deemed permanent use in violation of this chapter.
§ 480-49. Parking requirements.
The off-street parking provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings and structures erected after
the effective date of this chapter. Accessory parking shall be according to the provisions of this article.
Where an intensity of the use of any building structure or premises shall be increased, additional
parking to match the increased intensity of use shall be provided, or wherever an existing building or
structure is converted to a new use, parking shall be provided according to the requirements of the
new use. All new nonresidential parking lots and all alterations of existing lots shall be subject to the
approval of the Zoning Administrator. Requests for said parking lots shall be accompanied with
detailed plans on landscaping, parking layout, drainage provisions and driveway locations. In all
districts, there shall be provided at the time any use or building is erected, enlarged, extended, or
increased off-street parking stalls for all vehicles in accordance with the following:
Access. Each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway designed to
provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street parking
facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a
manner which will least interfere with traffic movement.
Design standards. Each parking space shall not be less than 180 square feet in area, 18 feet in
length and 10 feet in width, exclusive of aisles and access drives. No parking area of more than

two spaces shall be designed as to require any vehicle to back into a public street. Any parking
area of more than five spaces shall be sufficiently screened in the form of a solid fence or
shrubbery to protect adjacent residential uses. Large expanses of unchanneled parking areas
shall be avoided by interior landscaping and safety islands.
Location.
All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot with the building or use
served, or may be located not to exceed 400 feet from the principal use.
No parking stall or parking lot driveway, except in residential districts, shall be closer than 25
feet to a residential district lot line or a street line opposite a residential district, and no
residential driveway shall be closer than eight feet from any lot line except on culs-de-sac.
Off-street parking in the Single-Family and Two-Family Residence Districts is permitted in the
front yard in the driveway, even though closer than five feet to a side lot line, providing the
driveway conforms to the requirements in §§ 236-1 and 236-2 of the Code of the City of
Brodhead.
Surfacing. All off-street parking areas, except parking spaces accessory to a single-family or twofamily
dwelling, shall be surfaced with a dustless all-weather material capable of carrying a wheel
load of 4,000 pounds (normally, a two-inch blacktop on a four-inch base or five inches of portland
cement will meet this requirement). Any parking area for more than 10 vehicles shall have the
aisles and spaces clearly marked. Compacted stone or gravel may be used only with the approval
of the Plan Commission. All parking lots 3,000 square feet or larger shall be internally drained with
catch basins connected to a municipal storm sewer.
Landscaping.
Screening of parking areas. When a required off-street parking area for six cars or more is
located within, adjoining, or along a street line opposite a residential district or adjoining a
public right-of-way in any district, there shall be a landscape barrier or fence of suitable
material of not less than 3 1/2 feet nor more than six feet in height along such lot lines.
Location. Location of landscape areas, plant materials and protection afforded the plantings,
including curbing and provision for maintenance by the property owner, shall be subject to
approval by the Zoning Administrator.
Plans. All plans for such proposed parking areas, at the discretion of the Zoning
Administrator, shall include a topographic survey or grading plan which shows existing and
proposed grades and location of improvements. The preservation of existing trees, shrubs
and other natural vegetation in the parking area may be included in the calculation of the
required minimum landscape area.
Special residential requirements. Those parking areas for five or more vehicles if adjoining a
residential use shall be screened from such use by a solid wall, fence, evergreen planting of
equivalent visual density or other effective means, built and maintained at a minimum height
of four feet. Where a solidly constructed decorative fence is provided along the interior lot line,
the minimum setback for the parking area shall be five feet from said lot line. Said fence shall
be located a minimum of one foot from the said lot line.
Repair and service. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in
association with parking facilities provided in residence districts.

Uses not listed. In the case of structures or uses not mentioned, the provision for a use which is
similar shall apply, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
Computing requirements. In computing the number of spaces required, the following rules shall
govern:
"Floor space" shall mean the gross floor area of the specific use.
For structures containing more than one use, the required number of spaces shall be
computed by adding the space required for each use.
Parking spaces are calculated according to the use of the parcel.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Combined uses. Combinations of any of the above uses shall provide the total of the number of
stalls required for each individual use. Two or more uses may provide required off-street parking
spaces in a common parking facility less than the sum of the spaces required for each use
individually, provided such uses are not operated during the same hours. The following conditions
must be met for any joint use:
The proposed joint parking space is within 400 feet of the use it will serve.
The applicant shall show that there is no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of
the two buildings or uses for which joint use of off-street parking facilities is proposed.
A properly drawn legal instrument approved by the Common Council, executed by the parties
concerned, for joint use of off-street parking facilities shall be filed with the City Clerk-
Treasurer. Said instrument may be a three-party agreement, including the City and all private
parties involved. Such instrument shall first be approved by the City Attorney.
Handicapped parking requirements. In addition to any other requirements relating to parking
spaces contained in this Code, the provisions contained in §§ 101.13, 346.503 and 346.56, Wis.
Stats., and any Wisconsin Administrative Code sections adopted pursuant thereto are hereby
adopted by reference and made applicable to all parking facilities whenever constructed.
Changes in buildings or use. Whenever a building or use is changed, structurally altered or
enlarged to create a need for an increase of 25% or more in the number of existing parking
spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change. Whenever a
building or use is enlarged to the extent of 50% or more in the floor area, said building or use shall
then comply with the parking requirements set forth in the district in which it is located.
Off-lot parking.
Required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot with the principal use, or
such parking spaces may be located off lot, provided the parking spaces are located in the
same district and not over 400 feet from the principal use. In cases where off-street parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the same lot as the principal use, such facilities shall
be in the same possession as the lot occupied by the use to which the parking facilities are
necessary or in the possession of the controller of the principal use to which the parking
facilities are accessory. Such possession shall be by deed whereby the owner of the land on
which the parking facilities are to be located shall be bound by a covenant filed and recorded
in the appropriate county register of deeds office requiring such owner, his heirs or assigns to
maintain the required facilities for the duration of the use served.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Off-lot parking spaces for residential uses shall be within 250 feet of the principal entrance or

Accessory parking may be located in residential districts, provided that said lots or property
are immediately adjacent to a commercial, business or industrial zoning district.
All off-street parking lots adjoining lots zoned for residential use shall have a minimum
setback of 10 feet from any interior lot line, except if the adjoining lot is used for legally
conforming parking purposes.
Signs. Signs located in parking areas necessary for orderly operation of traffic movement shall be
permitted in addition to others permitted in this chapter.
Reduction of parking areas. Off-street parking spaces shall not be reduced in number unless said
number exceeds the requirement set forth herein.
§ 480-50. Highway access.
Highway access. No direct private access shall be permitted to the existing or proposed rights-ofway
of expressways, nor to any controlled-access arterial street without permission of the highway
agency that has access control jurisdiction. No direct public or private access shall be permitted to
the existing or proposed rights-of-way of freeways, interstate highways and their interchanges or
turning lanes nor to intersecting or interchanging streets within 1,500 feet of the most remote end
of the taper of the turning lanes (such as exit and entrance ramps). No driveway openings shall be
permitted within 100 feet of the intersection of an arterial street right-of-way line.
Access barriers. Access barriers, such as curbing, fencing, ditching, landscaping or other
topographic barriers, shall be erected to prevent unauthorized vehicular ingress or egress to the
above-specified streets or highways.
Temporary access. Temporary access to the above rights-of-way may be granted by the Zoning
Administrator after review and recommendation by the highway agencies having jurisdiction. Such
access permit shall be temporary, revocable and subject to any conditions required and shall be
issued for a period not to exceed 12 months.
§ 480-51. Off-street parking restrictions in residential areas.
Where permitted. Unless the district regulations provide otherwise, off-street vehicle parking is
permitted in the following yards of property in a residentially zoned district:
A rear yard.
A side yard not adjoining a street.
A front yard, but only on one paved or graveled driveway not exceeding 24 feet in width and
for not more than three vehicles parked not nearer than five feet to a front property line or
three feet to a side lot line.
Additional permitted areas. Regardless of the provisions of Subsection A above, the Common
Council may permit off-street vehicle parking in any yard of a residential development where the
overall housing plan and design for such development, in the judgment of the Common Council, is
substantially improved thereby, as compared to where off-street parking is limited by Subsection A
above, and where sole access from such development is to local and collector streets. In this
subsection, "substantially improved" means a substantial increase in the value of the property.
Such permission shall be granted only after a conditional use proceeding under Article IV of this
chapter. No such permission shall be granted for any residential development which is adjacent to

provided so as to prevent, to as great a degree as practicable, direct view of such off-street
parking areas from such adjacent areas.

shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants or employees

[Amended 9-14-2015]

the roadway, including semitractors or semitrailers, shall be parked or stored on a
residential lot, except when loading, unloading or rendering a service.
Exception. Notwithstanding Subsection C(2)(a), the Police Department may issue a
semitractor, not trailer, a special heavy traffic parking permit for the period of October 1
through April 1 for a fee in the amount of $50 per period, payable at the time of issuance
or renewal thereof, which will allow said vehicle to be parked on a residential driveway,
provided that the following criteria are met:
The neighbors or adjacent properties within 70 feet of the boundaries of the subject
property do not object to the issuance of the special heavy truck parking permit. If
51% or more of the neighboring or adjacent properties do not object to the issuance
of the special heavy traffic parking permit within 15 calendar days of their notification
for requests for objections or allowance of the special heavy traffic parking permit,
then the Police Department shall issue the permit, provided that all criteria and
provisions are met in this Subsection C(2)(b). If, however, 51% or more of the
neighbors or adjacent properties do object, in writing, to the issuance of the special
heavy traffic parking permit within 15 calendar days of their notification for requests
for objections or allowance of the special heavy traffic parking permit, then the Police
Department shall deny the permit request;
The Public Works Department does not object to the issuance of the special heavy
traffic parking permit;
The City utilities do not object to the issuance of the special heavy traffic parking
permit;
The Police Department does not object to the issuance of the special heavy traffic

The semitractor must be parked on a driveway on a residential lot which is either
paved or graveled, and if the semitractor is driven off a designated heavy traffic route
to reach the location of the residential driveway, the shortest route must be taken to
the location of the driveway.
Enforcement. Violations of permit provisions of Subsection C(2)(b) shall be investigated
by the Police Department. In addition to the penalties and remedies available as set forth
in §§ 1-4 and 480-99 of the Code, violations of permit provisions may result in
suspension or revocation of permit. Suspension or revocation of a permit is not grounds
for the refund of the permit fee. If any utilities are damaged by the permit holder due to
the semitractor parking on his or her driveway, it is the responsibility of the permit holder
for payment of all costs associated with fixing the damage to the utilities.

Zoning Board of Appeals. A Zoning Board of Appeals is established to provide an appeal
procedure for persons who deem themselves aggrieved by decisions of administrative officers in

§ 480-95. Zoning permits.
Permit required. No building shall be erected, moved or structurally altered until a zoning permit
therefor shall have been applied for and issued.
Application. All applications for a zoning permit shall be accompanied by a location sketch in
duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the location, actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built
upon, the exact size and location on the lot of the proposed or existing building and accessory
building, the lines within which the building shall be erected, altered or moved, the existing or
intended use of each building, or part of a building, the number of families the building is intended
to accommodate, and such other information with regard to the lot and neighboring lots or
buildings as may be necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this chapter.
Application; dimensions. All dimensions shown relating to the location and size of the lot shall be
based on actual survey. The lot and the location of the building thereon shall be staked out on the
ground before construction is started.

issue or refuse to issue a zoning permit within 10 days after receipt of an application therefor.
Refusal to issue a zoning permit shall be given in writing, with the reasons for such refusal.

Duly authorized agent for any of the above.

lines of planned widening or extending of existing streets, highways, parkways, parks or
playgrounds. Any person who feels aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator or City
Engineer may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals, which has power in a specific case, by the
vote of a majority of its members, to grant a permit for a building or such street, highway, parkway,
park or playground, which will as little as practicable increase the cost of opening such street,
highway, parkway, park or playground, and such board may impose reasonable requirements as a
condition of granting such permit, which requirements shall be designed to promote the health,
convenience, safety or general welfare of the City. Such board shall refuse a permit where the
applicant will not be substantially damaged by placing his building outside the planned street,
highway, parkway, park or playground.
Fees. Prior to issuing a zoning permit, the Zoning Administrator shall collect from the applicant, to
defray the cost to the City of processing the application, a permit fee.

moving permit shall be issued unless:
Sanitary sewer and water is available, or installation thereof has been approved by the

shall be occupied until a certificate of compliance has been issued by the Zoning Administrator.
Such certificate shall show that the building or premises or part thereof and the proposed use
thereof are in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Such certificate shall be applied for
when the application is made for a zoning permit and shall be issued within 10 days after the
completion of the work specified in such land permit application, but only if the building or
premises and the proposed use thereof conform with all the requirements of this chapter.
Temporary certificate. Under such rules and regulations as may be established by the Common
Council, the Zoning Administrator may issue a temporary certificate of compliance for part of a
building.
Issuance. Upon written request from the owner, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a certificate
of compliance for any building or premises certifying, after inspection, the extent and kind of use
made of the building or premises, and whether or not such use conforms to the provisions of this
chapter.

Commission, Fire Chief and Chief of Police for their review. The applicant shall also submit
sufficient plans and specifications of proposed buildings, machinery and operations to enable the
Plan Commission or its expert consultants to determine whether the proposed application meets
all the requirements applicable thereto in this chapter.
[Amended 6-11-2001]
Administration. The Zoning Administrator, City Engineer and Department of Public Works,
Brodhead Water and Light Commission, Fire Chief and Chief of Police shall make a preliminary
review of the application and plans and refer them, along with a report of their findings, to the Plan
Commission not less than 10 days prior to the meeting of the Plan Commission. The Plan
Commission shall review the application and may refer the application and plans to any expert
consultants selected by the Common Council to advise whether the application and plans meet all
the requirements applicable thereto in this chapter. Within 60 days of its receipt of the application,
the Commission shall authorize the Zoning Administrator to issue or refuse a zoning permit.

and improvement of interior roadways, the location, adequacy and improvement of areas for
parking and for loading and unloading and shall, in this connection, satisfy itself that the traffic

consistent with the safety of residents and the community, and the applicant shall so design
the construction or use as to minimize any traffic hazard created thereby.
The adequacy of the proposed water supply, drainage facilities and sanitary and waste
disposal.
The landscaping and appearance of the completed site. The Plan Commission may require
that those portions of all front, rear and side yards not used for off-street parking shall be
attractively planted with trees, shrubs, plants or grass lawns and that the site be effectively
screened so as not to impair the value of adjacent properties nor impair the intent or purposes
of this section.
Effect on municipal services. Before granting any site approval, the Plan Commission may,
besides obtaining advice from consultants, secure such advice as may be deemed necessary
from the City Engineer or other municipal officials, with special attention to the effect of such
approval upon existing municipal services and utilities. Should additional facilities be needed, the
Plan Commission shall forward its recommendations to the Common Council and shall not issue
final approval until the Common Council has entered into an agreement with the applicant
regarding the development of such facilities.
§ 480-98. Fees.
[Amended 12-10-2012]

Article XIV. Appeals
§ 480-104. Zoning Board of Appeals.
Scope of appeals. Appeals to the Zoning Board of Appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved
or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any decision of the
administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the alleged grievance or
judgment in question by filing with the officer(s) from whom the appeal is taken and with the
Zoning Board of Appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, together with payment
of a filing fee as may be established by the Common Council. The officer(s) from whom the appeal
is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Zoning Board of Appeals all papers constituting the record
upon which the action appealed from was taken.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certified to the Zoning Board of
Appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
immediate peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than
by a restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals or by a court of
record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause
shown.
Powers of Zoning Board of Appeals. In addition to these powers enumerated elsewhere in this
Code, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the following powers:
Errors: to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator or Building Inspector.
Variances: to hear and grant appeals for variances as will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will
result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit and purposes of this
chapter shall be observed and the public safety, welfare and justice secured. Use variances
shall not be granted.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Interpretations: to hear and decide applications for interpretations of the zoning regulations
and the boundaries of the zoning districts after the Plan Commission has made a review and
recommendation.
Substitutions: to hear and grant applications for substitution of more restrictive nonconforming
uses for existing nonconforming uses, provided no structural alterations are to be made and
the Plan Commission has made a review and recommendation. Whenever the Board permits
such a substitution, the use may not thereafter be changed without application.
Unclassified uses: to hear and grant applications for unclassified and unspecified uses,
provided that such uses are similar in character to the principal uses permitted in the district
and the Plan Commission has made a review and recommendation.
Temporary uses: to hear and grant applications for temporary uses in any district, provided
that such uses are of a temporary nature, do not involve the erection of a substantial structure
and are compatible with the neighboring uses and the Plan Commission has made a review
and recommendation. The permit shall be temporary, revocable, subject to any condition
required by the Zoning Board of Appeals and shall be issued for a period not to exceed 12
months. Compliance with all other provisions of this chapter shall be required.

Permits. The Board may reverse, affirm wholly or partly, modify the requirements appealed
from and may issue or direct the issue of a permit.
§ 480-105. Hearing on appeals.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing, cause notice thereof to be
published in the official newspaper not less than seven days prior thereto, and cause notice to be given
to the appellant or applicant and the administrative officer(s) appealed from by regular mail or by
personal service not less than five days prior to the date of hearing. In every case involving a variance,
notice shall also be mailed not less than five days prior to the hearing to the fee owners of record of all
land within 100 feet of any part of the subject building or premises involved in the appeal.
§ 480-106. Decisions.
Time frame. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall decide all appeals and applications within 30 days
after the public hearing and shall transmit a signed copy of the Board's decision to the appellant or
applicant and the Zoning Administrator.
Conditions. Conditions may be placed upon any zoning permit ordered or authorized by the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
Validity. Variances, substitutions or use permits granted by the Board shall expire within 18 months
unless substantial work has commenced pursuant to such grant.
§ 480-107. Variances.
Purpose.
A request for a variance may be made when an aggrieved party can submit proof that strict
adherence to the provisions of this chapter would cause him undue hardship or create
conditions causing greater harmful effects than the initial condition. A variance granted to a
nonconforming use brings that use into conformance with the district and zoning
requirements.
The Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize upon appeal, in specific cases, such variance
from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to
special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in
unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial
justice done. No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in
that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the flood protection elevation for
the particular area or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
For the purposes of this section, "unnecessary hardship" shall be defined as an unusual or
extreme decrease in the adaptability of the property to the uses permitted by the zoning
district which is caused by facts, such as rough terrain or good soil conditions, uniquely
applicable to the particular piece of property as distinguished from those applicable to most or
all property in the same zoning district.
Application for variances. The application for variance shall be filed with the City Clerk-Treasurer.
Applications may be made by the owner or lessee of the structure, land or water to be affected.
The application shall contain the following information:
Name and address of applicant and all abutting and opposite property owners of record.
Statement that the applicant is the owner or the authorized agent of the owner of the property.

[Amended 4-15-2014; 5-12-2014]
Public hearing of application. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct at least one public
hearing on the proposed variation. Notice of such hearing shall be given not more than 30 days
and not less than seven days before the hearing in one or more of the newspapers in general
circulation in the City and shall give due notice to the parties in interest and the Zoning
Administrator. At the hearing, the appellant or applicant may appear in person, by agent or by
attorney. The Board shall thereafter reach its decision within 30 days after the final hearing and
shall transmit a written copy of its decision to the appellant or applicant and the Zoning
Administrator.
[Amended 4-15-2014; 5-12-2014]
Action of the Zoning Board of Appeals. For the Board to grant a variance, it must find that:
Denial of variance may result in hardship to the property owner due to physiographical
consideration. There must be exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances or
conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure, use or intended use that do not apply
generally to other properties or uses in the same district, and the granting of the variance
would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be
changed.
The conditions upon which a petition for a variance is based are unique to the property for
which variance is being sought, and that such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district
and same vicinity.
The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the value or
income potential of the property.
The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the
other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
The proposed variance will not undermine the spirit and general and specific purposes of this
chapter.
Conditions. The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the
premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards established
in this section.
§ 480-108. Review by court of record.
Any person or persons aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may present to a
court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal and specifying the
grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of
the decision in the offices of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

boundary of the leased area shall be considered the lot line. Appurtenances shall
comply with the requirements of the zoning district in which they are located;
A tower's minimum and maximum height shall be as follows:
Monopole: 200 feet or more;
Monopole and self-support: 201 feet to 300 feet;
Monopole and guy wire: 301 feet or greater.
A tower shall be sited not less than 5,280 feet from another whether located in the
City or an adjacent local government unit, unless for reasons beyond the applicant's
control, such as unusual or unique topography, with distances between towers
measured by a straight line between the base of the towers;
Towers and antennas shall be shielded, filtered, and grounded in a manner
consistent with Federal Communications Commission and the Electronic Industries
Association guidelines so as to minimize the possibility of interference with locally
received transmissions;

cannot be accommodated on an existing tower. The City may determine that it is
necessary to consult with a third party considering the feasibility of accommodating
said equipment on an existing tower, with all reasonable costs and expenses
associated with such consultation borne by the applicant. The applicant may provide
names to the City of qualified third-party consultants. The consultant shall undertake
due diligence and provide a report with sufficient data to substantiate all of the
following:
No existing towers are located within the geographic region required to meet the
applicant's engineering requirements;
Existing towers are not of sufficient height to meet the engineering
requirements;
Existing towers do not have the structural capacity to support the applicant's
proposed equipment and the existing tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or
replaced to accommodate said equipment at a reasonable cost;
Locating new equipment on an existing tower would cause interference affecting
the usability of the other existing or planned equipment at the tower or the
existing equipment would cause interference with the applicant's proposed
equipment and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost; and
The fees, cost, or contractual provisions required to share an existing tower are
cost prohibitive.
Antennas mounted on buildings or structures not built specifically for the purpose of
mounting said antennas shall meet all of the following:

A party who is aggrieved by the final decision of the Plan Commission may bring an
action in the circuit court of the county in which the proposed activity, which is the subject
of the application, is to be located.
Abandonment. Any tower or antenna not in operation for a continuous period of 12 months shall
be deemed abandoned. The City shall provide said tower and antenna owner written notice
requiring removal of the tower, antenna, and associated buildings and structures (hereafter
collectively "appurtenances") within 90 days of receipt by the owner of said notice. If the owner
wishes to resume tower or antenna use after the tower or antenna has been deemed abandoned,
the owner shall apply for a new CUP in accordance with the application process identified in this
chapter. If a new tower and antenna CUP is denied in accordance with said application process,
the tower or antenna owner shall remove the tower, antenna, and appurtenances within 90 days of
denial action, with the owner restoring the area on which the tower, antenna, and appurtenances
were located to the manner existing prior to installation. If the tower, antenna, and appurtenances
are not removed within said ninety-day period, they shall be removed by the City at the owner's
expense. If a single tower is utilized by two or more entities, this provision shall not become
effective until all said entities cease operation.
Inspection. All towers or antennas issued a CUP in accordance with this chapter may be inspected
annually by the Zoning Administrator to determine compliance with this chapter and any other
applicable laws or regulations. Deviation from original construction parameters for which the CUP
was issued shall constitute a violation, subject to the penalties in § 480-99 of the Zoning
Ordinance.
