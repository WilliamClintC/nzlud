(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in sub. (6) below. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within 5 business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under §19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney.

Upon written notification from the City Treasurer that a taxpayer has made a tax payment in excess of the tax bill amount, the City Clerk shall approve a claim as a proper charge against the City Treasury and shall endorse his/her approval on the claim after having determined that the following conditions have been complied with:

3.10 - PUBLIC FIRE PROTECTION CHARGES . (Cr. Ord. #18-00) 
(1)  APPLICABILITY. All real property, including property exempted from taxation pursuant to §70.11, Wis. Stats., is subject to the public fire protection charges. "Real property" includes not only the land itself, but all the buildings and improvements thereon and all fixtures and rights and privileges appertaining thereto, as set forth in §70.03, Wis. Stats. 
(2)  EFFECTIVE DATE. The public fire protection (PFP) charge shall be effective with the December 2000 billing period, collectible in January 2001. 
(3)  RATE. The public fire protection charge is computed by taking the total amount of the assessed value of all taxable property and the effective assessed value of all tax exempt property in the City and dividing this figure into the cost of fire protection. "Effective assessed value" means the value placed on the property by the City for purposes of the public fire protection charge and is the same value that would apply to the property if it were taxable and assessed under §70.32, Wis. Stats. Fire protection costs within the City Water Utility include hydrants, hydrant maintenance and indirect costs associated with water capacity and production. The resulting rate is expressed as a "cost per thousand of value." For purposes of implementation of this section, the rate if 63¢ per thousand. 
(4)  DETERMINING VALUE OF TAX EXEMPT PROPERTY. The administrative staff is directed to develop a return form that will be sent to each owner of tax exempt real property in the City limits in order to determine property value. The return shall be completed by the property owner and shall contain the fair market value of the property which shall be based on recent arm's length sales of the property and recent arm's length sales of reasonably comparable property, and any other factors that, according to professionally acceptable appraisal practices, affect the value of the property. For purposes of the public fire protection (PFP) charge, tax exempt real property owners may also use the replacement value (land and improvements) placed on the property by the owner for property insurance purposes. There shall be annexed to such return the declaration of such person or of the managing agent or officer of such firm or corporation that the statements therein are true. The City reserves the right, for verification purposes, to require that each exempt real property owner provide a copy of the insurance certificate upon request. The effective assessed value shall be determined by the City and may be based on the property owner's return and also insurance valuations, appraisals, assessor's office determinations and cost information, if recent. Any person, firm or corporation who fails, neglects or refuses to make and file a return required by this section shall be denied any right to appeal or otherwise contest the value placed on the property by the City. The return shall be completed and filed with the City Clerk's office within 30 days of receipt of the return form. 
(5)  BILLING. The annual charge shall be divided and billed in 12 equal installments. Should the annual bill be below $25, the City reserves the right to charge through a single billing sent out by July 15 of each year. 
(6)  NONPAYMENT OF CHARGE. The PFP charge shall be billed with and be a part of the monthly utility bill. Utility service may be disconnected or refused for failure to pay a delinquent account in accordance with Wis. Adm. Code PSC 185.37. Delinquent accounts shall be collected in the manner provided by law, including the Public Service Commission rules and regulations. 
(7)  NONUTILITY CUSTOMERS. The public fire protection (PFP) charge shall be applied to all real properties within the City, including nonimproved parcels (vacant land). Nonimproved properties are not currently receiving utility services. As a result, the City Utility billing staff shall add all vacant land to the utility billing listing and shall use the assessed value of the land in determining the annual PFP charge. 
(8)  RESIDENTIAL/COMMERCIAL RENTALS. The occupant of a rented/leased premises is typically the utility customer and therefore shall be responsible for paying the PFP charge. To calculate the monthly PFP charge, the City staff shall use the following guidelines to determine property value: 
(a)  Residential Rentals. 
1.  Master Meters. For residential rental buildings with a master meter, the owner shall be billed and responsible for the entire PFP charge based on the assessed value of the buildings, including land. 
2.  Individual/Separate Unit Meters. The renter or utility customer on the account is responsible for the PFP charge. The City shall take the total value of the building, including land, and apportion the value equally across all rental units in the building. 
(b)  Commercial Rentals. 
1.  Master Meters. The owner of the building shall be billed and responsible for the entire PFP charge based on the value of the building, including land. 
2.  Individual Meters. The City shall take the total assessed value of the building, including land, to determine a value per square foot. Included in the calculation are the common areas of the building, i.e. entryways, closets and other storage space and bathrooms. The square foot value shall then be applied to the square footage of each business suite. 
(9)  JURISDICTION. The Finance Committee shall be the committee to oversee the implementation of the public fire protection (PFP) charge.

BACKFLOW. The undesirable flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, solid gases or other substances under positive or reduced pressure into the City of Waupaca Water Utility (hereinafter "Utility") potable supply of water from any source. 
BACKFLOW PREVENTER. A device or means designed to prevent backflow caused by backpressure or back-siphonage; most commonly categorized as air gap, reduced pressure principle backflow assembly, double check valve assembly, pressure vacuum breaker assembly, back-siphonage backflow vacuum breaker (spill resistant pressure vacuum breaker) assembly, pipe applied atmospheric vacuum breaker, flush tank ball cock, laboratory faucet backflow preventer, backflow preventer for carbonated beverage machine, vacuum breaker wall hydrants, chemical dispensing machine, hose connection vacuum breaker, hose connection backflow preventer, backflow preventer with intermediate atmospheric vent and barometric loop. 
BACKPRESSURE. An elevation of pressure in the downstream piping system (pump elevation of piping, or steam and/or air pressure) above the utility supply pressure, which would cause or tend a reversal of the normal direction of flow. 
BACK-SIPHONAGE. The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of the Utility's potable water supply system from any source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the Utility's potable water supply system. 
CROSS CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement between 2 otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the Utility, and the other containing water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or chemicals whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the 2 systems. 
(b)  Cross Connection Prohibited . No person shall establish or permit to be established or maintain or permit to be maintained any cross connection. No interconnection shall be established whereby potable water from a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply, other than the public water supply of the Utility, may enter the supply or distribution system of the Utility, unless such private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the Utility and the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
(c)  Inspections . It shall be the duty of the Utility to cause inspection to be made of all properties serviced by the Utility where cross connection with the public water system is deemed possible. Residential properties serviced by the Utility shall be inspected on a 10-year interval. All nonresidential properties serviced by the Utility shall be inspected on a 2-year interval. The Utility may, but is not required to, perform the cross connection inspection of the owner's property. If, in the opinion of the Utility, the Utility is not able to perform the inspection, the property owner must, at their own expense, have the plumbing inspected for cross connections by a State of Wisconsin Certified Cross Connection Inspector/Surveyor or by a State of Wisconsin Licensed Plumber. The frequency of the required inspections and re-inspections, based on potential health hazards involved, may be shortened by the Utility. The Utility shall charge fees as approved by the State of Wisconsin Public Service Commission for on-premises follow-up visits by Utility personnel for reinspection due to customer noncompliance and for after hours inspections or reinspections. 
(d)  Right of Entry . Upon presentation of credentials, representatives of the Utility shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any property served by a connection to the public water system of the Utility for cross connection. If entry is refused, such representatives shall obtain a special inspection warrant under §66.0119, Wis. Stats. Upon request, the owner, lesser, or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system on such property. 
(e)  Authority to Discontinue Service . The Utility is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this article exists and to take such other precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any damage of contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be discontinued if the means of backflow prevention required by the Utility is not installed, tested, maintained, and repaired in compliance with this article and Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 811, or if it is found that the means of backflow prevention required by this article has been removed or bypassed. Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., except as provided in subsection (j) below. 
(f)  Reconnection of Service . Water service to any property discontinued under the provisions of this article shall not be restored until the cross connection has been eliminated or a backflow prevention device approved by the Utility has been installed in compliance with the provisions of this article. The Utility shall charge fees as approved by the State if Wisconsin Public Service Commission for the reconnection of the water service. 
(g)  Emergency Discontinuance of Service . If it is determined by the Utility that a cross connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety, or welfare and requires immediate action, service may be immediately discontinued. The owner, lessee, or occupant shall have an opportunity for hearing under Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., within 10 days of such emergency discontinuance. Such hearing shall be before the City of Waupaca Common Council and shall conform to all existing due process requirements. 
(h)  Owner Responsibility . The property owner shall be responsible for the elimination of or protection from all cross connections on their premises. The property owner shall, at his or her expense, have installed, maintained, and tested all backflow preventers on his or her premises in compliance with Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 811 and Department of Commerce Chapter 82. The property owner shall have corrected any malfunction, revealed by periodic testing, of any backflow preventer on their premises. The property owner shall inform the Utility of any proposed or modified cross connections and also any existing cross connection that are not protected by an approved backflow prevention device. The property owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow preventer of the same type on the by-pass. Property owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the backflow prevention device must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place. In the event the property owner installs plumbing upstream of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer. The property owner is required to follow the protection practices described in the American Water Works Association publication AWWA M14 titled "Recommended Practice for Backflow Prevention and Cross Connection Control", unless the Utility requires or authorizes other means of protecting the public water system. These requirements or authorizations will be at the discretion of the Utility. 
(i)  Additional Protection . In the case of premises having internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled, or intricate plumbing and piping arrangements where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line. In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a manner that, in the opinion of the Utility, could create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, hospitals, plating plants, and car wash establishments. In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the Utility, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of toxic substances, the Utility may require an approved air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the Utility.

An amalgam separator is a device that employs filtration, settlement, centrifugation, or ion exchange to remove amalgam and its metal constituents from a dental office vacuum system before the wastewater is discharged to the wastewater collection system. Each dental office shall install, operate, and maintain the amalgam separator according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. The installed device must be ISO 11143 certified as capable of removing 95% of amalgam. The amalgam separator system shall be certified at flow rates comparable to the flow rate of the actual vacuum suction system operation. Neither the separator device nor the related plumbing shall include an automatic flow bypass. For facilities that require an amalgam separator that exceeds the practical capacity of ISO 11143 test methodology, a non certified separator will be accepted, provided that small units from the same manufacturer and of the same technology are ISO certified. 
Each existing dental office that places or removes mercury amalgam shall install an amalgam separator on or before November 1, 2015. All dental offices that are newly constructed on and after the effective date of this Chapter, shall include the installation of an ISO 11143 certified amalgam separator device at the dental offices. Each dental office shall submit a report to the Approving Authority within 30 days of the installation of the amalgam separator that certifies that the installation of the amalgam separator is complete, including the installation date, the manufacturer, the model name or number, and proof of certification. 
Any dental office that cannot install an approved amalgam separator by November 1, 2015 shall notify the Approving Authority by letter no later than October 1, 2015 with an explanation for the delay.

Each dental office shall obtain records from the contractors used to remove amalgam waste for each shipment showing volume or mass of amalgam waste shipped, name and address of the destination, and name and address of the contractor. These shipping records shall be maintained for a minimum of 5 years and shall be made available to the Approving Authority for inspection and copying upon request. 
(d)  Reporting Requirements. On or before January 1, 2016 and annually thereafter, each dental office shall provide the Approving Authority with a report using forms provided by the Approving Authority. Reporting information will include at a minimum: 
1.  Dates of routine maintenance of the amalgam separator(s). 
2.  Names and addresses of contractors used to remove mercury amalgam waste. 
3.  Dates, volume, and destination of any mercury amalgam waste shipped. 
4.  Certification that BMP for mercury amalgam as established by the American Dental Association are being implemented. 
5.  Certification that the amalgam separator was installed and is being operated and maintained in accordance with instructions provided by the manufacturer. 
6.  Any updates to the amalgam separator operation and maintenance manual. 
(e)  Inspections. Each dental office shall allow the Approving Authority to inspect manuals, records, the vacuum system, amalgam separator, amalgam waste storage area, and other areas deemed necessary to determine compliance with this Chapter. Inspections shall occur during the normal operating schedule of the dental office. The Approving Authority shall inspect the dental offices according to appointments made in advance whenever possible. 
(f)  State and Federal Regulations. All dental offices that handle amalgam waste shall additionally comply with all additional state and federal regulations, as now exist or may be enacted in the future regarding the disposal of said wastes. 
(12)  NOTIFICATION OF ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE. The accidental discharge of any prohibited waste into any sewer shall be reported to the City by the person responsible for the discharge or by the owner or occupant of the premises where the discharge occurs immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the fact of such discharge so that steps may be taken to minimize its effect on the sewerage system. Notification of such discharge shall not relieve the person of liabilities for any expense, loss or damage to the system, or for any forfeitures imposed on the City on account thereof. 
(13)  NOTIFICATION TO CITY OF SERVICE MAINTENANCE. No person or business shall do any private sanitary sewer service root cutting or similar service pipe maintenance unless they provide the Superintendent or his authorized deputy, agent or representative with notice prior to commencement of the work. The prior notification by sewer user and contractor shall be at least 48 hours before commencement of the work. In an emergency situation where at least 48 hours notification is impractical, the prior notification to the Superintendent or his designee shall be as soon as possible by the quickest available means of communication. The notification shall include the date, time and location of the proposed work. The purpose of the notification requirement is to permit the City to inspect and assist in the removal of roots in the sewer main to prevent sewer backups. No private contractor shall remove any sanitary or storm sewer manhole covers without prior approval by the City. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this subsection shall be subject to the penalty provisions of sec. 25.04. 
(14)  RIGHT OF ENTRY, SAFETY, AND IDENTIFICATION.

(b)  Safety. While performing the necessary work on private premises referred to in sub. (14)(a), the duly authorized City employees shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the owner or occupant and the City shall indemnify the owner against loss or damage to its property by City employees and against the liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the owner and growing out of gauging and sampling operation of City employees, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the owner to maintain safe conditions as required in sub. (10)(d). 
(c)  Identification, Right to Enter Easements. Duly authorized employees of the City bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the City holds a duly negotiated easement for the purpose of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying within said easement, all subject to the terms, if any, of the agreement. 
(15)  SEWER CONSTRUCTION (BUILDING SEWERS). 
(a)  Work Authorized. 
1.  No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written plumbing and public right of way permit from the City's Building Inspector. The fee for the plumbing and public right of way permit shall be determined by the City's Building Inspector and shall be paid prior to the issuance of the permit. 
2.  All contractors, plumbers, pipe fitters or other persons shall be licensed to do work in the City and shall have an acceptable certificate of insurance before being permitted to work on any public sewer or building sewer. A license from the State of Wisconsin shall be received, except in cases where State law permits building owners to do their own work without being licensed. 
Prior to commencement of the work, the permittee shall notify the proper utilities at least 48 hours before beginning excavations. 
(b)  Cost of Sewer Connection. All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the property owner. The property owner shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. 
(c)  Use of Old Building Sewers. The City may allow use of old building sewers for connection with new buildings only if they are found on examination by televising and pressure test by a third party, at sewer user's expense, to meet all requirements for this Chapter. Televising or pressure testing may be required by the Approving Authority at the property owner's expense. 
(d)  Materials and Methods of Construction. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of building sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the requirements of the Wisconsin Administrative Code, the State Department of Natural Resources, the Building and Plumbing Codes and other applicable rules and regulations of the City. In the absence of code provisions or an amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the A.S.T.M. and W.P.C.F. Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. 
(e)  Building Sewer Grade. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(f)  Storm and Groundwater Drains. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. 
All existing downspouts or groundwater drains, etc., connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer shall be disconnected no later than 60 days from the date of an official written notice by the Approving Authority. Failure to disconnect after such notice shall authorize the City to cause disconnection and assessment of the costs of such disconnection against the property involved. The City may, in the alternative, institute legal action for violation of this subsection. Exceptions to the above shall be made only by the Approving Authority in writing. 
(g)  Conformance to Plumbing Codes. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Codes or other applicable rules and regulations of the City or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the A.S.T.M. and the W.P.C.F. Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials shall be approved by the Approving Authority before installation. 
All connections to existing sewer mains shall be made with an approved manufactured "T" or "Y" fitting along with approved manufactured flexible couplings connecting to the existing sewer pipe, all airtight and watertight. 
(h)  Inspection of Connection. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Approving Authority when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the Approving Authority. 
(i)  Barricades and Restoration. All excavations for the building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Advance reflective roadside warning signs shall be used in all traffic flow directions. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City. 
(j)  User to Keep in Repair. All users shall keep their own service pipes in good repair and protected from frost at their own risk and expense and shall prevent any unnecessary overburdening of the sewer system. 
(k)  User Use Only. No user shall allow others or other services to connect the sewer system through his lateral. 
(l)  Mandatory Hookup. 
1.  The owner of each parcel of land adjacent to the sewer main on which there exists a building usable for human habitation or in a block through which such system is extended shall connect to such system within 90 days of notice in writing from the City. Upon failure to do so, the City may cause such connection to be made and bill the property owner for such costs. If such costs are not paid within 30 days, such notice shall be assessed as a special tax lien against the property, all pursuant to §144.06, Wis. Stats., provided, however, that the owner may, within 30 days after the completion of the work, file a written option with the City Clerk stating that he/she cannot pay such amount in one sum and ask that it be levied in not to exceed 5 equal installments and that the amount shall be so collected with interest at the City's current borrowing rate plus 2% per annum from the completion of the work, the unpaid balance being a special tax lien, all pursuant to §144.06, Wis. Stats. 
2.  In lieu of the above, the City, at its option, may impose a penalty for the period that the violation continues after 10 days written notice to any owner failing to make a connection to the sewer system of an amount equal to 150% of the minimum quarterly charge for sewer service payable quarterly for the period in which the failure to connect continues and, upon failure to make such payment, said charge shall be assessed as a special tax lien against the property, all pursuant to §144.06, Wis. Stats. 
This Chapter ordains that the failure to connect to the sewer system is contrary to the minimum health standards of the City and fails to assure preservation of public health, comfort and safety of the City. 
(m)  Maintenance of Services. The user shall be responsible for maintaining the entire private sewer lateral in service including routine blockages and root intrusion. If the City agrees that the sewer lateral must be replaced due to its structural failure in the public right of way, the City shall be responsible for the portion within the street right of way and the sewer user shall be responsible for the portion on the private property. When any sewer service is to be relaid and there are 2 or more buildings on such service, each building shall be disconnected from such service and a new sewer service shall be installed for each building all the way to the public sewer main. Shared use of the sewer lateral is prohibited. 
(n)  Septic Tanks Prohibited. There shall be no additional septic tanks or other private sewage disposal systems allowed within the corporate limits of the City after the date of this Chapter. The maintenance and use of septic tanks and other private sewage disposal systems within the corporate limits of the City serviced by its sewer system are hereby declared to be a public nuisance and a health hazard. 
(o)  Vacating of Premises and Discontinuance of Service. Whenever premises served by the system are to be vacated, or whenever any person desires to discontinue service from the system, the City shall be notified in writing. The owner of the premises shall be liable for any damages to the property or such damage which may be discovered having occurred to the property of the system other than through the fault of the system or its employees, representatives or agents. If the building or structure is to be demolished, the sewer service shall be adequately capped to be airtight, inspected by the City, the remaining sewer lateral location measured from the property line and submitted to the City. 
(p)  Charges on a Rental Property. All sewer services, charges and special assessments on a rental property shall become the responsibility of the lessor in the event of nonpayment by the lessee. Bills shall be mailed to the lessee on a monthly basis and, if payments are not received in 30 days thereof, a subsequent bill shall be mailed to the lessor. The lessor of the premises shall be liable for any damages occurring to the property of the system as a result of the actions, or lack thereof, of the lessee. 
(q)  Charges Are a Lien on Property. All sewer services, charges and special assessments shall be a lien on a lot, part of a lot or land on which sewer services were supplied. All sums which have accrued during the preceding year and which are unpaid by the first day of October in any year shall be certified to the City Clerk to be placed on the tax roll for collection as provided by the Wisconsin Statutes. 
(16)  SEPTIC TANK SLUDGE AND HOLDING TANK WASTEWATER DISPOSAL. 
(a)  No person in the business of gathering and disposing of septic tank sludge or holding tank wastewater shall transfer such material into any portion of the wastewater facilities unless a permit for disposal has been first obtained and approved by the City. Written application for such permit shall be made to the City and shall state the name and address of the applicant, the number of its disposal units and the make, model and license number of each unit. Permits shall be nontransferable, except in the case of replacement of the disposal unit for which a permit shall have been originally issued. The annual permit may be obtained upon payment of a fee in accordance with the Sewer User Charge Schedule. The City may impose such conditions as it deems necessary on any permit granted. Such sewage waste shall only be discharged at locations and quantities approved by the City. The City may require sampling and testing of waste at the discharger's expense. These discharges to the wastewater facilities shall be invoiced to the contractor by the City at the approved rates. 
(b)  Charges. Charges for disposal shall be as determined by the City. Bills shall be mailed on a monthly basis and, if payments are not received in 30 days thereof, disposal privileges shall be suspended. 
(c)  Public Liability Insurance. Any person or party disposing of septic tank sludge or holding tank wastewater shall carry public liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000 to protect any and all persons or property from injury and/or damage caused in any way or manner by any act or failure to act by any of his employees. The person shall furnish a certificate certifying such insurance to be in full force and effect. 
(d)  Hold Harmless. The person disposing waste agrees to indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all liability, claims, damages or costs arising out of or resulting from such disposal. 
(e)  Compliance with Ordinances. The person disposing of waste shall comply with the provision of any and all applicable ordinances of the City. 
(f)  Dumping Limited to Wastewater Treatment System. All dumping shall be done at the dumping facility provided at the wastewater treatment system site. No dumping will be allowed at remote manholes without permission from the City. 
(g)  Suspension of Dumping. If the City determines that they do not have the capacity capable for maintaining separate treatment of septage or holding tank waste, the City shall limit or suspend such dumping until adequate capacity becomes available. 
(17)  DAMAGE OR TAMPERING WITH SEWAGE FACILITIES. 
(a)  Willful, Negligent or Malicious Damage. No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the sewage facilities. Any persons violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under a charge of disorderly conduct. 
(b)  Liability to Discharger For Losses. Any person who intentionally, negligently or accidentally violates any provisions of this Chapter shall become liable to the City or any downstream user for any expense, loss or damage occasioned by reason of such violation which the City or any downstream user may suffer as a result thereof. This Chapter shall be applicable whether or not a written notice of the violation was given as provided in sub. (17)(a) and without consideration for any penalties which may be imposed for a violation of this Chapter. 
(18)  BASIS FOR SEWER SERVICE CHARGES. 
(a)  Sewer Users Served by Water Utility Water Meters. There is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having a connection with the wastewater system and being served with water solely by the water utility a user charge based, in part, on the quantity of water used as measured by the water utility water meter used upon the premises. 
(b)  Sewer Users Served by Private Wells. Sewer users served by private wells have 2 options as described below: 
1.  If any user discharging wastewater into the system procures any part or all of water used from sources other than the Water Utility, all or part of which is discharged into the system, the user shall be required to have water meters installed for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. Where wastewater meters are already installed, the water meters shall not be required. The water meters may be furnished by the Water Utility and installed under its supervision. All costs, including the cost of the meter, shall be charged to the user requiring the meter. 
2.  As an alternative to the installation of a water or wastewater meter, the Approving Authority may, upon petition by the user, establish a flat rate for sewer service which shall be based on the average Water Utility consumption for the classification of service which applies to the petitioner or an estimated discharge volume. 
(c)  Measurement of Flow From Multi Family, Commercial, Industrial and Public Users. The volume of flow used for computing the user charge shall be the metered water consumption of the user as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the Water Utility, except as noted in subs. (18)(d). 
(d)  Exemption Meters For Lawn Sprinklers. Except as provided in this subsection, no exemption meters shall be permitted to sewer users with regard to water used for lawn sprinkling or similar purposes. Governmental subdivisions, school districts or agencies thereof, cemeteries and golf courses may be granted an exemption meter for lawn sprinkling purposes and may have an exemption water meter installed. Said meter shall be furnished and installed by the City. All other costs may be at the expense of the sewer user requesting the meter, including any piping revisions required to ensure that only water not reaching the sanitary sewer is metered by the exemption meter. The City shall charge, for each meter, the labor costs and expenses to compensate for furnishing, installing, reading and servicing the meter. This charge shall be in addition to the water user charge. The amount of exemption water metered shall be subtracted from the total amount of water used by the sewer user to determine the applicable wastewater user charge. 
(e)  Metering of Waste. Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the Approving Authority if this volume cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned and maintained by the discharger. A maintenance schedule must be accepted by the Approving Authority. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the Approving Authority. 
(f)  Waste Sampling. Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of character and concentration of said wastes. The sampling may be accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical equipment acceptable to the Approving Authority. The use of flow proportional composite sampling is preferred. 
(g)  Free Service. No user shall receive free service or pay a sewer use charge less than the user's proportional share of debt retirement, operation and maintenance, and replacement costs. 
(19)  BILLING PRACTICE. 
(a)  Billing Period. User charges shall be billed to coincide with water utility billing as regulated by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. 
(b)  Payment. User charges shall be payable 20 days after the billing date to the City Clerk. 
(c)  Penalties. Charges levied in accordance with this section shall be a debt to the City. If the debt is not paid within 20 days after it is due and payable, it shall be deemed delinquent. There shall be an added penalty of one % monthly of the amount of the monthly bill (penalties shall compound). 
Charges and penalties shall constitute a lien upon the property serviced and be recorded on the municipality's tax roll. Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found delinquent shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties. 
(d)  Notification. Each user shall be notified annually in conjunction with a regular bill of the rate of those portions of the user charges that are attributable to wastewater treatment services. 
(20)  AMOUNT OF USER CHARGES. 
(a)  User Charge System. The user charge system for the City sewer users shall be in accordance with methods and procedures outlined in Appendix "A" (see sub. (24)). 
(b)  Wholesale Users. The user charge system for the Waupaca Chain O'Lakes Sanitary District shall be in accordance with Part 1 of Appendix "A".

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the State of Wisconsin Statutes. Specific statutory references are provided within the body of this chapter solely as a means of assisting the reader. Such references are not to be considered as all inclusive and shall in no manner be construed so as to limit the application or interpretation of this chapter. 
State Law Reference: Sections 62.23(7), 62.231, 87.30 and 144.26, Wisconsin Statutes. 
17.003 - PURPOSE . 
The general purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, morals and the general welfare of the City of Waupaca. The provisions hereof shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and as minimum requirements for the purposes stated. Among other purposes, such provisions are intended, in accordance with a comprehensive plan, to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and general welfare; to provide adequate light, air and solar access; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements. These regulations are made with reasonable consideration, among other things, of the character of the districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view of conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the City. 
17.004 - SEPARABILITY AND NONLIABILITY . 
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Waupaca Common Council that the several provisions of this chapter are separable in accordance with the following: 
(1)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of this chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provisions of this chapter not specifically included in said judgment. 
(2)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the application of any portion of this chapter to a particular property, water, building, or structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said provision to any other property, water, building, or structure not specifically included in said judgment. 
(3)  If any requirement or limitation attached to an authorization given under this chapter is found invalid, it shall be presumed that the authorization would not have been granted without the requirement or limitation and, therefore, said authorization shall also be invalid. 
(4)  The City does not guarantee, warrant or represent that only those areas designated as flood lands will be subject to periodic inundation and hereby asserts that there is no liability on the part of the City, its officers, employees, agents, or representatives for any flood damages, sanitation problems, or structural damages. 
17.005 - ABROGATION . 
It is not intended that this chapter abrogate or interfere with any constitutionally protected vested right. It is also not intended that this chapter abrogate, repeal, annul, impair or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. 
17.006 - RULES OF INTERPRETATION . 
(1)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and welfare, and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and shall not be construed to be a limitation or repeal of any other power now possessed by the City of Waupaca. 
(2)  Where property is affected by the regulations imposed by any provision of this chapter and by other governmental regulations, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements shall prevail. Regardless of any other provision of this chapter, no land shall be developed or used, and no structure erected or maintained in violation of any State or Federal regulations. 
(3)  No structure, land, water or air shall hereafter be used and no structure or part thereof shall hereafter be located, erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, converted or structurally altered without a zoning permit, except structures not requiring a building or zoning permit (swing set, clothesline, etc.), and without full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable local, county and State regulations. 
(4)  Nothing herein contained shall require any changes in plans, construction, size or designated use of any building or part thereof, for which a zoning or building permit has been issued before the effective date of this chapter and the construction of which shall have been started within 6 months from the date of such permit. 
(5)  Except as provided in this chapter, under provisions for Nonconforming Uses (sec. 17.120(1)), Substandard Lots (sec. 17.120(2)), and Nonconforming Structures (sec. 17.120(3)), no building, structure, development or premises shall be hereinafter used or occupied and no applicable permit granted, that does not conform to the requirements of this chapter.

This chapter is applicable to all territory located within the corporate limits of the City of Waupaca. 
17.008 - REENACTMENT AND REPEAL . 
(1)  This chapter, in part, carries forward by reenactment some of the provisions of the regulations governing zoning and related matters, being previously known collectively as the "Zoning Code", Chapter 17 of the Code of Ordinances for the City of Waupaca, adopted prior to the effective date of this chapter. It is not the intention of this chapter to repeal, but rather to reenact and continue in force such existing provisions so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are preserved and may be enforced, unless explicitly surrendered by specific provisions of this chapter or altered by the Official Zoning Map. 
(2)  All provisions of Chapter 17 of the City of Waupaca Code of Ordinances which are not reenacted herein are hereby repealed. 
(3)  The adoption of this chapter shall not adversely affect the City's right to prosecute any violation of the predecessor Zoning Ordinance provided the violation occurred while that chapter was in effect.

(4)  B-4 STRIP COMMERCIAL DISTRICT.

(1)  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. (Cr. Ord. #11-00) 
(a)  Intent . This section is intended to encourage residential and commercial planned unit developments offering greater creativity and flexibility in site plan design than is provided under the strict application of zoning and subdivision regulations while, at the same time, preserving the health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the City. Specifically, the purpose of the planned unit development district is to: 
1.  Assure that growth is planned and accomplished within the City's goals, both for the surrounding neighborhood and the community as a whole. 
2.  Promote flexibility in design and the efficient use of land to facilitate a more economic arrangement of buildings, uses, circulation systems and utilities.

2.  Architectural Style. The architectural style of individual structures shall be compatible with other structures in the PUD, with the overall site design and with surrounding land uses. 
3.  Common Open Space. Whenever possible, common open space shall be linked to the open space areas of surrounding developments. Common open space shall be of a size, shape, location and usability for its proposed purpose. 
4.  Density. Density shall be governed by the standards of the zoning district most similar in function to the proposed use. A residential PUD may provide up to a 25% increase in the number of units per acre if the PUD provides substantially more site amenities than are found in a conventional residential development. The character, use of existing landscape, design variation and environmental concern of a PUD shall govern the amount of approved density increase. 
5.  Determining Standards. Standards for lot area, coverage, setbacks, parking and screening shall be governed by the standards of the zoning district most similar in function to the proposed PUD use, as determined by the Plan Commission. Deviation from those standards may be permitted only if such deviation is consistent with the total design of the development, encourages a desirable living environment and is not detrimental to the welfare of the City. 
6.  Exterior Boundary Setback. No principal building shall be set back less than 20 feet from the exterior of a PUD or a public street right-of-way. No commercial or industrial structure shall be nearer than 50 feet to its side or rear property lines where such line abuts a single-family use.

This restoration shall include removal of any subsurface structure or foundation, including concrete, used to support the telecommunications facility down to 10 feet below the surface. This depth of removal requirement may be modified by the Board of Public Works. After a telecommunications facility is no longer in operation, the facility owner shall have 120 days to effect removal and restoration unless weather prohibits such efforts or unless a longer period is approved by the Director of Public Works based upon a good faith effort to obtain a new user for such facility. 
(b)  Security for Removal . The telecommunications facility owner shall provide to the City, prior to the issuance of the conditional use permit or the issuance of an occupancy permit, a performance bond in the amount of $20,000 per tower or a bond equal to a written estimate from a qualified tower removal contractor to guarantee that the telecommunications tower and any telecommunication support facility will be removed when no longer in operation and guaranteeing any municipal costs associated with said removal. The City will be named as obligee in the bond and must approve the bonding company. 
(10)  PRE-EXISTING TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS. Nonconforming pre-existing telecommunication towers and facilities may extend, move, or replace the tower and facilities upon review and approval of a revised plan and method by the Plan Commission. An existing telecommunication tower may be increased in height to a maximum of 50 feet, relocated, or reconstructed within 100 feet of its existing location to accommodate co-location subject to meeting all other subsections of this section except subsections (7) and (12). Routine maintenance and repair on telecommunications facilities is permitted. 
(11)  COMPLIANCE. 
(a)  Revocation . Grounds for revocation of the conditional/special use permit shall be limited to one of the following findings as determined by the Plan Commission: 
1.  The owner of such site, service provider or tower owner (if applicable) fails to comply with the requirements of this section, as it existed at the time of the issuance of the conditional use permit; 
2.  The permittee has failed to comply with the conditions of approval imposed; 
3.  The facility has not been properly maintained in accordance with applicable codes and safety standards. 
(b)  Revocation Process .

2.  The party not in compliance shall comply with such notice within 30 days to the satisfaction of the Building Inspection Department. 
3.  If compliance is not obtained within 30 days, the Building Inspection Department shall notify the Plan Commission of the noncompliance and request permission to proceed with the revocation process. This time period may be extended by staff to allow for seasonal limitations. 
4.  The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing following publication of a Class 2 notice in the legal newspaper of the City. 
5.  A copy of a hearing notice shall be mailed certified to the owner of record of the tower site, the tower owner, and lessees, as disclosed on the most recent annual information report, at least 2 weeks prior to the hearing date. 
6.  City staff shall appear at the hearing to present the evidence of non compliance. All other interested parties may also give testimony to the Planning Commission. 
7.  In compliance with the procedures of a special use hearing, a written decision of the Planning Commission will be made. 
(c)  Abandonment . Any telecommunication facility or support facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. Time may be extended, upon review and approval of the Plan Commission, if the tower owner demonstrated a good faith effort to secure new tenants. In such circumstances, the following shall apply: 
1.  The owner of such telecommunication facility shall remove said facility including all supporting equipment and building(s) within 90 days of receipt of notice from the Building Inspection Department notifying the owner of such abandonment. If removal to the satisfaction of the Building Inspection Department does not occur within said 90 days, the Building Inspection Director may order removal utilizing the established bond as provided under subsection (9) and salvage said antenna or tower and all supporting equipment and building(s). If there are 2 or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all operations of the tower cease. 
2.  The recipient of a conditional use permit or occupancy permit for a telecommunications facility under this chapter shall notify the Building Inspection Department immediately when the facility is no longer in operation. 
(12)  STRUCTURAL, DESIGN, AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. 
(a)  Tower, Antenna and Facilities Requirements . With the exception of those facilities identified in subsection (3), all telecommunication facilities shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment and be symmetrical to the greatest extent feasible. To this end, all of the following measures shall be implemented: 
1.  All telecommunication facilities shall comply at all times with all applicable Federal Communication Commission (FCC) rules, regulations, and standards. To that end, no telecommunication facility or combination of facilities shall produce at any time power densities in any inhabited area that exceed the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) adopted standard for human exposure, as amended, or any more restrictive standard subsequently adopted or promulgated by the Federal Government which applies to the telecommunication facility. All telecommunication towers and antennas shall meet or exceed the standards and regulations, in place at the time of the issuance of the Condition Use Permit, of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Wisconsin State Bureau of Aeronautics, Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA), the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), and any other agency of the State and/or Federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. 
2.  Subject to the considerations in paragraph 3., below, telecommunication towers shall be constructed out of metal or other nonflammable material, unless specifically permitted by the City to be otherwise. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
3.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials; colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings. Where circumstances so justify, a camouflaged tower or alternative support structure may be required. The design and construction of telecommunication facilities and towers, antennas, and related equipment shall be as symmetrical as possible to minimize visual obtrusion. 
4.  All ground mounted telecommunication towers shall be self-supporting monopoles or lattice towers except where satisfactory evidence is submitted to the Plan Commission that a guyed tower is required. 
5.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
6.  Satellite dish and parabolic antennas shall be situated as close to the ground as possible to reduce visual impact without compromising their function. 
7.  Telecommunication support facilities (i.e., equipment rooms, utilities, and equipment enclosures) shall be constructed out of materials approved in the base zoning district and consistent with the main building on the property. In all noncommercial districts the principal building material shall be assumed to be brick. Telecommunication support facilities shall be measured from the original grade at the base of the facility to the top of the structure, and shall be designed to blend with existing architecture in the area or shall be screened from sight by mature landscaping, and shall be located or designed to minimize their visibility. The height of such structures shall be determined by the Plan Commission in the context of the built environment. 
8.  State or Federal requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the State or Federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed and such changes are applicable to existing towers, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within 6 months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling State or Federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations to the extent required shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
9.  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable State or local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, in effect at the time the tower is constructed. Upon request, the tower owner shall provide documentation from an engineer establishing that the project is complete to their specifications, and which concludes that a tower complies with applicable codes and standards and does not constitute a danger to persons or property. Upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring any such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Said time period may be extended for a reasonable period of time if there is no immediate danger to persons or property and the tower owner is working diligently to correct the failure. 
10.  Telecommunications facilities shall not interfere with or obstruct existing or proposed public safety, fire protection, or Supervisory Controlled Automated Data Acquisition (SCADA) operation telecommunication facilities. Any actual interference and or obstruction shall be corrected immediately including shutting down at no cost to the City. 
11.  Except as required by Federal or State law or as otherwise necessary to provide notice of dangerous conditions, no signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower. 
(b)  Height . The height of a telecommunication tower shall be measured from the original grade at the base of said tower to the highest part of the tower itself. In the case of building mounted towers the height of the tower includes the height of the portion of the building on which it is mounted. In the case of "crankup" or other similar towers whose height can be adjusted, the height of the tower shall be the maximum height to which it is capable of being raised.

17.350 - FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTED ADULT-ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS . 
(1)  FINDINGS OF FACT. 
(a)  The Common Council finds that Adult-Oriented Establishments, as defined and otherwise regulated by the City in its Adult-Oriented Licensing and Regulation Ordinance, require special zoning in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the City. 
(b)  Based its review of studies conducted in Phoenix, AZ; Garden Grove, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Whittier, CA; Indianapolis, IN; Minneapolis, MN; St. Paul, MN; Cleveland, OH; Oklahoma City, OK; Amarillo, TX; Austin, TX; Beaumont, TX; Houston, TX; Seattle, WA; and the findings incorporated in City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc. , 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Coleman A. Young v. American Mini-Theaters, Inc. , 427 U.S. 50 (1976), the Common Council finds that there is convincing evidence that the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments include an increased risk of prostitution, high-risk sexual behavior, crime, and other deleterious effects upon existing businesses and surrounding residential areas, and decreased property values. 
(c)  The Common Council intends to control the impact of these secondary effects in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and areas. 
(d)  It is not the intent of the Common Council to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content-neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments while providing an outlet for First Amendment protected activities. 
(e)  In order to minimize and control the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments upon the City, it is the intent of the Common Council to prevent the concentration of adult-oriented establishments within a certain distance of each other and within a certain distance of other specified locations which are incompatible with and would suffer from the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments. 
(f)  Based upon its review of materials linking alcohol consumption and high-risk sexual behavior and materials linking alcohol consumption and crimes such as sexual assault, the Common Council finds that a geographic separation of adult-oriented establishments from alcohol beverage licensed premises is warranted. 
(2)  LOCATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTED ADULT-ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS. 
(a)  The First Amendment and other provisions of the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court and other courts, require that adult-oriented establishments, as defined and otherwise regulated by the City, are entitled to certain protections, including the opportunity to locate in the City. Therefore, if an adult-oriented establishment license has been granted by the City, and if all the requirements of this section of the zoning code are met, an adult-oriented establishment shall be an allowed use in the I-2 zoning district and shall be a prohibited use in any other zoning district. No other requirements of the zoning code need be satisfied, but for those required in order to obtain an adult-oriented entertainment license from the City. 
(b)  Adult-oriented establishments shall be located at least 1,000 feet from any: 
1.  Residential district line, playground lot line, or public park lot line; 
2.  Structure used as a residence, place of religious worship, public or private school, or youth facility as defined in the City's Adult-Oriented Establishment Licensing and Regulation Ordinance; 
3.  Other structure housing an adult-oriented establishment; 
4.  Structure housing an establishment which holds an alcohol beverage license. 
(c)  Distance requirements are to be measured in a straight line in any direction regardless of intervening structures, from the structure housing the adult-oriented establishment to the above residential district boundary lines, to the lot line of any lot used for a park, playground, or the lot line of any structure listed in subsection (2)(b), above. 
(d)  The measurements from a structure shall be taken from the farthest point a structure extends in the direction of the measurement, including overhanging roofs or similar projections. 
(e)  For adult-oriented establishments located in conjunction with other buildings and clearly separate from other establishments such as in a shopping center, measurements shall be taken from the boundaries of the space occupied by the adult-oriented establishment. 
(f)  For any adult-oriented establishment located above ground level in a multistory structure and clearly separate from other establishments within the structure, the distance measurements shall be taken from the ground floor public entrance/exit nearest the adult-oriented establishment (excluding emergency exits). 
(g)  A licensed adult-oriented establishment is not disqualified from holding an adult-oriented establishment license by the location subsequent to the grant or renewal of its license of any of the establishments described in subsection paragraph 2., above, within 1,000 feet of the licensed premises. This provision applies only to the renewal of an existing license and does not apply when an application for a license is submitted after a license for that location has not been renewed or has been revoked. 
17.360 - ANNEXATION . (Rep. & Recr. Ord. #1-02) 
(1)  Annexation to or consolidations with the City subsequent to the effective date of this Code shall be placed in the A-1 Agricultural District unless the annexation ordinance temporarily places the land in another district. Within one year the Plan Commission shall evaluate and recommend a permanent district classification to the Council. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of §16.53(14), Wis. Stats., the Common Council may, in its sole discretion, pay the annexation petition review fees prescribed by the Department of Administration. 
17.370 - RESERVED . (Rep. Ord. #06-18(2018))

18.12 - IMPROVEMENTS. 
(1)  Before final approval of any plat located within the corporate limits of the City, the subdivider shall install street and utility improvements as hereinafter provided. If such improvements are not installed as required at the time that the final plat is submitted for approval, the subdivider shall, before the recording of the plat, enter into a contract with the City, agreeing to install the required improvements and shall file with said contract a bond meeting the approval of the City Attorney or a certified check in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the improvements, said estimate to be made by the City Engineer, if available, or by a registered engineer designated by the Council as a guarantee that such improvements will be completed by the subdivider or his subcontractors not later than one year from the date of recording of the plat and as a further guarantee that all obligations to subcontractors for work on the development are satisfied.

Stats., and as may be required by the City Engineer, if available, or by a registered engineer designated by the Council. 
18.14 - VARIANCES. 
Where, in the judgment of the Plan Commission, it would be inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of this chapter because of the proposed subdivision being located outside of the corporate limits or because exceptional or undue hardship would result, the Plan Commission shall recommend to the Council that it waive or modify any requirement to the extent deemed just and proper. The final action and determination shall be made by the Council. Such relief shall be granted without impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter or the comprehensive plan of the City. A 3/4 vote of the entire membership of the Plan Commission shall be required to recommend any modification of this chapter and the reasons shall be entered in the minutes of the Commission, a copy of which shall be forwarded to the Council for final action and determination. 
18.15 - LAND SUITABILITY.

The Plan Commission, in recommending the application of the provisions of this section, shall, in writing, recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for residential use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability if he or she so desires.

2.  Flood Inundation Map: 100 Year Flood Dam Failure, prepared by Papke Engineering & Surveying, dated December 1, 1997. Approved by: The DNR 
3.  Waupaca County Flood Storage District Map, panel 2 and 3, prepared by DNR, dated January 20, 2010. Approved by: The DNR. 
(c)  Establishment of Districts . The regional floodplain areas are divided into 4 districts as follows: 
1.  The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
2.  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
3.  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. 
4.  The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
(d)  Locating Floodplain Boundaries . Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to sec. 20.08 of this chapter. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to sec. 20.07(3)(c) of this chapter and the criteria in subpar. 1. and 2. below. 
1.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
2.  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department. 
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to sec. 20.08(1)(f) of this chapter. 
(e)  Removal of Lands from Floodplain . Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least 2 feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to sec. 20.08 of this chapter. 
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC). 
(f)  Compliance . Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(g)  Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated . Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if §13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when §30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies. 
(h)  Abbrogation and Greater Restrictions . 
1.  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under §59.69, 59.692 or 59.694, Wis. Stats., for counties; §62.23, Wis. Stats., for cities; or §61.35, Wis. Stats., for villages; or §87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
2.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(i)  Interpretation . In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(j)  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability . The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this chapter create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter. 
(k)  Severability . Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected. 
(l)  Annexed Areas for Cities and Villages . The Waupaca County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway. 
(m)  General Development Standards . The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a floodprone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this chapter.

(b)  Permitted Uses . Pursuant to sec. 20.05(1)(d) of this chapter, it shall be determined whether the proposed use is located within a floodway or floodfringe area. Those uses permitted in floodway (sec. 20.03(2) of this chapter) and floodfringe areas (sec. 20.04(2) of this chapter) are allowed within the general floodplain district, according to the standards of sec. 20.07(1) of this chapter, provided that all permits or certificates required under sec. 20.05(3) of this chapter have been issued. 
(c)  Standards for Development in the General Floodplain District . Sec. 20.03 of this chapter applies to floodway areas, sec. 20.04 of this chapter applies to floodfringe areas. The rest of this chapter applies to either district. 
(d)  Determining Floodway and Floodproofing Limits . Upon receiving an application for development within the general floodplain district, the Zoning Administrator shall: 
1.  Require the applicant to submit 2 copies of an aerial photograph or a plan which shows the proposed development with respect to the general floodplain district limits, stream channel, and existing floodplain developments, along with a legal description of the property, fill limits and elevations, building floor elevations and floodproofing measures; 
2.  Require the applicant to furnish any of the following information deemed necessary by the Department to evaluate the effects of the proposal upon flood height and flood flows, regional flood elevation and to determine floodway boundaries: 
a.  A typical valley cross-section showing the stream channel, the floodplain adjoining each side of the channel, the cross-sectional area to be occupied by the proposed development, and all historic high water information; 
b.  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size, location and layout of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevations of streets, water supply, and sanitary facilities; soil types and other pertinent information; 
c.  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream; 
d.  Specifications for building construction and materials, floodproofing, filling, dredging, channel improvement, storage, water supply and sanitary facilities. 
3.  Transmit one copy of the information described in subpars. 1. and 2. above to the Department regional office along with a written request for technical assistance to establish regional flood elevations and, where applicable, floodway data. Where the provisions of sec. 20.07(1)(b)3. of this chapter apply, the applicant shall provide all required information and computations to delineate floodway boundaries and the effects of the project on flood elevations. 
(2)  FLOOD STORAGE DISTRICT. The flood storage district delineates that portion of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters has been taken into account and is relied upon to reduce the regional flood discharge. The district protects the flood storage areas and assures that any development in the storage areas will not decrease the effective flood storage capacity which would cause higher flood elevations. 
(a)  Applicability . The provisions of this section apply to all areas within the Flood Storage District (FSD), as shown on the official floodplain zoning maps. 
(b)  Permitted Uses . Any use or development which occurs in a flood storage district must meet the applicable requirements in sec. 20.04(3) of this chapter. 
(c)  Standards for Development in Flood Storage Districts . 
1.  Development in a flood storage district shall not cause an increase equal to or greater than 0.01 of a foot in the height of the regional flood. 
2.  No development shall be allowed which removes flood storage volume unless an equal volume of storage as defined by the predevelopment ground surface and the regional flood elevation shall be provided in the immediate area of the proposed development to compensate for the volume of storage which is lost (compensatory storage). Excavation below the groundwater table is not considered to provide an equal volume of storage. 
3.  If compensatory storage cannot be provided, the area may not be developed unless the entire area zoned as flood storage district, on this waterway, is rezoned to the floodfringe district. This must include a revision to the floodplain study and map done for the waterway to revert to the higher regional flood discharge calculated without flood plain storage, as per sec. 20.08(1) of this chapter. 
4.  No area may be removed from the flood storage district unless it can be shown that the area has been filled to the flood protection elevation and is contiguous to other lands lying outside of the floodplain. 
20.06 - NONCONFORMING USES. 
(1)  GENERAL. 
(a)  Applicability . If these standards conform with §59.69(10), Wis. Stats., for counties or §62.23(7)(h), Wis. Stats., for cities and villages, they shall apply to all modifications or additions to any nonconforming use or structure and to the use of any structure or premises which was lawful before the passage of this chapter or any amendment thereto. 
(b)  The existing lawful use of a structure or its accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may continue subject to the following conditions: 
1.  No modifications or additions to a nonconforming use or structure shall be permitted unless they comply with this chapter. The words "modification" and "addition" include, but are not limited to, any alteration, addition, modification, structural repair, rebuilding or replacement of any such existing use, structure or accessory structure or use. Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered an extension, modification or addition; these include painting, decorating, paneling and the replacement of doors, windows and other nonstructural components and the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing private sewage or water supply systems or connections to public utilities. Ordinary maintenance repairs do not include any costs associated with the repair of a damaged structure. 
The construction of a deck that does not exceed 200 square feet and that is adjacent to the exterior wall of a principal structure is not an extension, modification or addition. The roof of the structure may extend over a portion of the deck in order to provide safe ingress and egress to the principal structure. 
2.  If a nonconforming use or the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, it is no longer permitted and any future use of the property, and any structure or building thereon, shall conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter. 
3.  The municipality shall keep a record which lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions which have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications represent. 
4.  No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would equal or exceed 50% of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with sec. 20.04(3)(a) of this chapter. The costs of elevating a nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded from the 50% provisions of this paragraph. 
5.  a.  Except as provided in subd. b. below., if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet the current ordinance requirements.

(1)  COMPLIANCE. The use of wetlands and the alteration of wetlands within the shoreland area of the City shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable local, State or Federal regulations, subject to the provisions of sec. 21.05 of this chapter, for the standards applicable to nonconforming uses. All permitted development shall require the issuance of a zoning permit unless otherwise expressly excluded by a provision of this chapter. 
(2)  MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if §13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of State highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when §30.12(4)(a), Wis. Stats., applies. 
(3)  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. 
(a)  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under §§62.23 or 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to flood plains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another municipal zoning is more restrictive than this chapter, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(b)  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(4)  INTERPRETATION. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this chapter is required by a standard in Wis. Adm. Code NR 117, and where the chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Wis. Adm. Code NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(5)  SEVERABILITY. Should any portion of this chapter be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected. 
(6)  ANNEXED AREAS. The Waupaca County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation in effect administered by the City for all areas annexed by the City after May 7, 1982. These annexed lands are described on the City's Official Zoning Map. The Waupaca County shoreland zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator. 
21.03 - DEFINITIONS . 
For the purpose of administering and enforcing this chapter, the terms or words used herein shall be interpreted as follows. Words used in the present tense include the future, words in the singular number include the plural number, and words in the plural number include the singular number. The word "shall" is mandatory, not permissive. All distances, unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally.

1.  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds and flowages in the City shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the Department publication, "Surface Water Resources of Portage County," or are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. 
2.  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the flood plain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Flood plain zoning maps adopted in sub. (1) above shall be used to determine the extent of flood plain areas. 
(b)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
(c)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary shown on the Official Zoning Maps and actual field conditions at the time the Maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary, as mapped, is in error. If the Department staff concur with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the Official Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period.

In addition, the owner or caretaker shall conspicuously display a sign with a symbol warning children of the presence of a vicious dog or cat. 
6.  Notification. The owner or caretaker shall notify the Police Department within 24 hours if a vicious dog or cat is on the loose, is unconfined, has attacked another animal or has attacked a human being, has died, has been sold or has been given away. If the vicious dog or cat has been sold or given away, the owner or caretaker shall also provide the Police Department with the name, address and telephone number of the new owner of the vicious dog or cat. If the vicious dog or cat is sold or given away to a person residing outside the city, the owner or caretaker shall present evidence to the Police Department showing that he or she has notified the Police Department or other law enforcement agency at the dog's or cat's new residence, including the name, address and telephone number of the new owner of the vicious dog or cat. 
7.  Determination of a Vicious Dog or Cat. 
a.  Upon investigation, a law enforcement officer or humane officer may declare a dog or cat vicious. If an owner or caretaker contests the designation of the dog or cat as vicious, the Chief of Police or his/her designee shall convene a hearing. At the hearing, the owner or caretaker shall have the opportunity to present evidence as to why the dog or cat should not be declared vicious. The hearing shall be held promptly within no less than 5 days nor more than 10 days after service of notice upon the owner or caretaker of the dog or cat. 
b.  Pending the outcome of the hearing, the dog or cat must be securely confined in a humane manner, either on the premises of the owner or caretaker or with a licensed veterinarian. If the owner or caretaker fails to securely confine the dog or cat, a police officer may seize the dog or cat and impound it in a place designated by the Police Department, pending the outcome of the hearing. 
c.  After the hearing, the owner or caretaker shall be notified in writing of the determination. If a determination is made that the dog or cat is vicious, the owner or caretaker shall comply with this section in accordance with a time schedule established by the Chief of Police, but in no case more than 30 days after the date of the determination. If the owner or caretaker further contests the determination, he or she may, within 5 days of receiving the decision, appeal the decision to the Judiciary Committee. 
8.  Spay and Neuter Requirement. After a dog or cat has been designated vicious, the owner or caretaker of the dog or cat shall provide written proof from a licensed veterinarian that the dog or cat has been spayed or neutered. 
9.  Euthanasia. If the owner or caretaker of a dog or cat that has been designated vicious is unwilling or unable to comply with the regulations for keeping the dog or cat in accordance with this section, he or she may have the animal humanely euthanized by an animal shelter, the humane society or licensed veterinarian. 
10.  Inspection. The Police Department may make whatever inquiry is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with this section. 
11.  Destruction. 
a.  Any dog or cat that has caused serious injury to a person or persons on 2 separate occasions off the owner's premises without reasonable cause may be destroyed as a result of judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, as specified under §174.02(3), Wis. Stats. 
b.  The City Attorney, at the request of the Police Department, may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain a court order to destroy a dog or cat when the court finds any of the following: 
i.  The dog or cat caused great bodily harm to a person. 
ii.  The dog or cat has been designated as vicious by the Police Department pursuant to subpar. 7. above and the owner or caretaker of the dog or cat has failed to comply with the provisions specified in subpars. 3., 4. and 8. above and more than 30 days has elapsed from the date that the owner or caretaker was served with notice that the dog or cat had been declared vicious. 
12.  Exemption. This section does not apply to dogs kept by the Police Department, any other law enforcement agency, or unit of the United States military service. 
(2)  VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES. When any provision of this section is violated and the violation precipitates impoundment of a dog or cat, the owner shall pay all impoundment fees and, in addition, any person violating provisions of this section shall, upon conviction, be assessed a forfeiture of not less than $150 nor more than $1,000 plus applicable costs. Every day that a violation of this section continues, it shall be deemed a separate offense. In addition to the foregoing penalties, any person who violates this section shall pay all expenses, including shelter, food, handling, veterinary care and expert testimony fees necessitated by enforcement of this section. 
(3)  OTHER ORDINANCES APPLICABLE. This section imposes additional regulations for the owners or caretakers of dogs or cats. The owners or caretakers of dogs or cats are also required to comply with all other State Statutes and City ordinances regulating dogs or cats.

The administrator shall hold office for an indefinite term subject to removal at any time by a three fourths vote of the council and mayor, at pleasure. This section, however, shall not preclude the council from establishing other employment terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance or the Municipal Code of the City of Waupaca. 
1A.03  Functions and Duties of the Administrator. The administrator, subject to the limitations defined in resolutions and ordinances of the City of Waupaca and Wisconsin State Statutes, shall be the chief administrative officer of the city, responsible only to the mayor and the council for the proper administration of the business affairs of the city, pursuant to the statutes of the State of Wisconsin, the ordinances of the City of Waupaca, and the resolutions and directives of the council with duties, responsibilities and subject to conditions as maybe set forth by employment contract between the City and said City Administrator. 
    SECTION THREE: This is a Charter Ordinance and shall take effect 60 days after its passage and publication unless within 60 days a referendum petition as provided by §66.01 of the Wisconsin Statutes shall be filed, in which event this ordinance shall not take effect until it shall have been submitted to a referendum of the electors and approved by a majority of the electors voting therein.
