CITY OF RIVER FALLS, WISCONSIN MUNICIPAL CODE 2002 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
City of River Falls, Wisconsin 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 19, 1-09 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The City of River Falls, Wisconsin Municipal Code, originally published by Mathew Bender & Company, Inc., in 2002 has been kept current by regular supplementation. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 19, 1-09, this Code has been kept current by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the city clerk. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 19, 1-09, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2018-15, passed November 27, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 19, 1-09, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 19, 1-09, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 19 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 19, 1-09, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

Said corporation shall have the general powers possessed by municipal corporations at common law; and, in addition thereto, powers hereinafter specifically granted, and the authorities thereof shall have perpetual succession; shall be capable of contracting and being contracted with; of suing and being sued; pleading and being impleaded in all courts, and shall have a common seal and may change the same at pleasure. 
CITY BOUNDARIES. 
    SECTION 2. All of section number one, and the north half of section number twelve, in township number twenty-seven north, of range number nineteen west, and the west half of section number six, in township number twenty-seven north, of range number eighteen west, in the county of Pierce, and the south half of the southwest quarter of section number thirty-one, in township number twenty-eight north, of range number eighteen west, and the south half of the southwest quarter and the south half of the southeast quarter or section number thirty-six, in township number twenty-eight north, of range number nineteen west, in the county of Saint Croix, and state of Wisconsin, shall be included in and constitute the limits of the city of River Falls. 
WARD BOUNDARIES. 
    SECTION 3. The said city shall be divided into four wards, the boundaries of which for the present, and until changed as hereinafter provided, shall be as follows, to wit: All that portion of said city lying north of the north line of township number twenty-seven north, in the county of St. Croix, shall constitute the first ward. All that portion of said city lying south of the north line of township number twenty-seven north, and north of the quarter line running east and west through section number one in township number twenty-seven north, of range number nineteen west, and of section number six in township number twenty-seven north, of range number eighteen west, and east of the north branch of the Kinnickinnic river, shall constitute the second ward. All that portion of said city lying south of the north line of township number twenty-seven north, and west of the north branch of the Kinnickinnic river, shall constitute the third ward. All that portion of said city lying south of the quarter line running east and west through section number one in township number twenty-seven north, of range number nineteen west, and section number six in township number twenty-seven north, of range number eighteen west, to the junction of said quarter-line with the center of Kinnickinnic river, thence following the center of said stream down to its intersection with the west line of said section one, shall constitute the fourth ward. But the common council shall have power to change said lines of divisions as they may deem convenient or proper, when duly authorized by an affirmative vote of the electors of said city. 
COMMON COUNCIL. 
    SECTION 4. The corporate authority of said city shall be vested in one principal officer, styled the mayor; in one board of aldermen, consisting of one member from each ward, who, with the mayor, shall be denominated the common council, together with such other officers as are hereinafter mentioned or may be created under this act. 
ELECTIVE OFFICERS. 
    SECTION 5. The elective officers of said city shall be a mayor, treasurer, assessor, and one justice of the peace to be elected by the city at large, and from each ward, one alderman, one justice of the peace, one supervisor to represent his ward in the county board of supervisors of his county and one constable. All other necessary officers shall be appointed by the common council. All elective officers, except justices of the peace, shall, unless elected to fill vacancy, hold their respective offices for one year, or until their successors are elected and qualified; provided, however, the council shall have power, for due cause, satisfactory to them, to expel any of their own number, and to remove from office any officer or agent of the city, except a justice of the peace, due notice and opportunity for a hearing having been first given to the officer proposed to be removed. Justices of the peace shall hold their offices for two years and until their successors are elected and qualified. The term of office of every officer elected under this act shall commence on the second Tuesday in April of the year for which such officer is elected and the term or office for all appointed officers shall expire with that of the members of the body appointing them. 
    SECTION 6. The council shall at their first meeting after the charter election, appoint a city clerk, a marshal, and a street commissioner and such other officers as they may deem necessary to appoint. Should the common council fail to appoint any officers at such meeting it may appoint such officers at a subsequent meeting. The common council shall at such first meeting, fix the compensation of any officer of the city whose salary or fees have not been otherwise provided for. 
ANNUAL ELECTIONS. 
    SECTION 7. The qualified voters of the city of River Falls shall hold an election on the first Tuesday in April of each year, for election of city and ward officers herein designated, and shall be presided over by the inspectors of election, appointed under the general laws of this state, who shall see the ballots safely deposited in the ballot box; shall decide all questions that may arise as to the legality of the votes presented; shall count the ballots at the close of the polls, and shall certify and seal two returns; and the day following the election, shall direct and return one of the said returns to the city clerk of the city of River Falls, and the other to the county clerk of the county in which his election district is situated. The mayor of the city and members of the common council shall constitute a board of canvassers, who shall, within three days after such election, meet at the council chamber and canvass such returns; and after the aforesaid returns shall have been canvassed by said board, the mayor shall notify by a certificate the persons elected to the respective offices. The poll shall be kept open in the respective election districts from nine o'clock in the forenoon until five in the afternoon, but an adjournment may be made from twelve o'clock, noon, to one o'clock in the afternoon, by notice thereof given at the opening of the polls. Said election shall be conducted in accordance with this act, and of the existing laws of the state of Wisconsin, and any frauds or violation of said laws at such elections shall be punishable in the same manner as any violation of the election laws in any part of the state; for the purpose of holding city and general elections in said city, the city shall be divided into two election districts, one of said districts to comprise all that portion of the city lying in St. Croix county, and to be known as the first election district, and the other election district to comprise all that part of the city lying in Pierce county, and to be known as the second election district, and the common council shall designate a polling place in the First ward for the first election district, and a polling place in the Second ward for the second election district; at all city elections there shall be three ballot boxes for the second election district, one for each ward there voting, with the number of the ward plainly marked thereon and the votes of the electors of each ward shall be deposited in the ballot box for such ward; and a separate poll list shall be kept of the voters of each ward. There shall be three inspectors of election, one from each ward, and three clerks, one from each ward. Each inspector shall have the immediate charge of the ballot box of his ward, and the clerk from such ward shall keep the poll list of such ward, but such inspectors shall act together in any question which may arise. At general elections one ballot box only shall be kept for such general election in such election district. 
QUALIFIED ELECTIONS. 
    SECTION 8. All persons who are qualified electors of the state of Wisconsin, and who shall have resided in any ward in said city ten days prior to an election, shall be deemed qualified electors for such ward at such election. Each ward officer shall be a qualified elector in the ward in which he is elected, and each city officer shall be a qualified elector in the city. 
SPECIAL ELECTIONS. 
    SECTION 9. Special elections to fill vacancies or for any other purpose shall be held and conducted by inspectors of election, as provided by this act, and the returns thereof shall be made in the same manner and form as of annual elections; provided, however, that in case a special election is to be held in the city other than for ward purposes, the common council may order a single poll for the entire city, and appoint the place where the election is to be held, and the inspectors of election and the clerks therefor. 
    SECTION 10. All elections by the people shall be by ballot, and a plurality of votes shall constitute an election. All elections by the council may be viva voce, except as hereinafter provided. When two or more candidates for an elective office shall receive an equal number of votes for the same office, the election shall be determined by the casting of lots in the presence of the council, at such time and in such manner as it may direct.

The common council shall, thereupon, cause a written notice, as prescribed in the next section, to be served upon the occupant or occupants of such lands; and the owner or owners of the same, if the place of residence of such owner or owners is known, or can be ascertained by reasonable diligence, when such residence is within this state, and in case such owner or owners are non-residents of the state, or their place of residence, after due diligence by the city attorney of said city, cannot be ascertained, which fact shall be made to appear by his affidavit, then the common council shall cause service of such notice to be made on such non-resident owner or owners whose residence cannot be ascertained, by causing the same to be published for six weeks in the official paper of the city, at least once in each week, and by causing such notice to be mailed, postpaid, to the address of such owners within five days from the time of the first publication of such notice, when the post office address of such owner is known. 
    SECTION 33. Such notice shall be signed by the city clerk or city attorney, and shall state the adoption of the resolution and embrace a copy thereof, and further, that at a time and place therein named, not less than ten days after the service of such notice, or the expiration of such publication, as the case may be, application will be made to the judge of the circuit court for said counties of Pierce or St. Croix, for a jury to enquire and determine whether it is necessary to take the land or any part thereof described in such resolution for the purposes therein specified. Such notice shall further state the time and place at which such jury will be applied for to meet to discharge such duty; and the judge aforesaid shall fix the time and place so named in the precept hereafter mentioned, and no other notice thereof shall be necessary. 
    SECTION 34. At the time fixed in said notice for the appointment of such jurors the judge named in said notice, upon proof of the service of the same on the owner or owners of the premises described in such notice, which proof shall be made in the same manner as is now required to make proof of the service of a summons in civil actions in courts of record in this state, shall appoint twelve competent persons, having the qualification of jurors in and for the countries of Pierce and St. Croix and not residents of the ward in which such premises are situated, not interested in such application, but residents of the city shall not be disqualified; provided, that if the owner of the land sought to be taken shall, before said judge shall appoint such persons, demand in writing that the jury be taken from any other county in such judicial circuit, then said judge shall appoint such jury from persons having the qualifications of jurors in such other county in the circuit as shall be designated by such land owner in his demand for the inquiry to be made respecting his lands. The same rights of challenge peremptorily or for favor, or cause, may be exercised by the city attorney, and by such land owner whose land is sought to be taken, or by his agent or attorney, as a party to a civil action in the circuit court is entitled to have, and the judge shall decide the same in like manner, and replace the name of any jurors successfully challenged, by the name of some other competent person until a jury of twelve be chosen. The said judge shall thereupon issue his precept directed to such jurors, requiring them and each of them to appear before him, on the day named in the notice for such jurors to meet for the discharge of their duties under such appointment. The precept so issued may be served by the sheriff of said county or by any public officer of said city. The jurors so chosen shall, before entering upon the performance of their duty, take an oath before such judge faithfully and impartially to discharge their duty as such jurors, and a true verdict give, whether it is necessary to take such land or any part thereof, mentioned in such resolution for the purpose therein specified. 
    SECTION 35. If any of the jurors so appointed shall be disqualified from acting, or shall refuse to act, the judge shall appoint others in their places, and a memorandum of such substitution shall be indorsed on the precept. 
    SECTION 36. The said jurors shall forthwith, under the direction of said judge, proceed in a body to view the premises in question, and shall hear such testimony as may be offered by any party interested, which testimony shall be reduced to writing by said judge; and either of the jurors shall be authorized to administer the necessary oaths to witnesses. 
    SECTION 37. After having made such view and heard such testimony as shall have been produced, the said jury shall, under direction of said judge, deliberate apart, and return their unanimous verdict in writing, signed by them, in which they shall find and state whether it is necessary to take the whole of the lands described in such resolution for the purpose therein specified, or any part thereof, describing particularly the part to be taken, if they find only a part thereof so necessary. Such verdict, with all the papers, proceedings and testimony had before him and said jury, shall then be forthwith filed by said judge with the clerk of the circuit court for the county in which said land is situated, together with a certificate by said judge that the same are the originals and the whole thereof. The clerk shall, on application, furnish a certified copy of the same, or any part thereof, which shall have the same force and effect as the originals. In case any jury called under the provisions of this charter shall disagree, another jury shall be forthwith selected in like manner, and all the like proceedings thereafter had, as hereinbefore provided, for the first jury, except that the said judge shall fix a reasonable time for the assembling of such jury in the precept therefor, but no other notice thereof shall be necessary to any party; and the like steps shall be taken in case of any further disagreement until a verdict shall be found. 
    SECTION 38. Should the necessity for the taking of the premises, or any part thereof mentioned in the resolution of the council, be so established by the verdict of the jury, then the common council may enter an order directing the city attorney to proceed to procure to be assessed and appraised the damages to the owner or owners of the premises so found necessary to be taken by reason of the taking of the same for the purpose specified. The city attorney shall thereupon make application to the judge of the circuit court for the county in which said land is situated, briefly setting forth the fact that the necessity for taking such premises has been established by the verdict of a jury, and praying the appointment of three commissioners to appraise the damages of each and all of the several owners of such lands, and showing the amount of land, giving the metes and bounds thereof the purpose for which the same is to be taken, and the names of the several owners so far as the same are known to the city attorney. Five days' notice of the time and place when such application will be presented to such judge, accompanied with a copy of such application, shall then be served on each owner in the cases when required and in the manner provided in section 32 of this act. At the time and place designated, such judge shall hear all parties interested who appear, and shall appoint three disinterested and reputable freeholders of said county as such commissioners, by his order in writing, to ascertain and appraise the compensation to be made to the owners of, or persons interested in the land so found necessary to be taken, and fix the time and place for the first meeting of said commissioners. 
    SECTION 39. If there should be any building standing, in whole or in part, upon the lands to be taken, the commissioners, before proceeding to make their assessment, shall first estimate and determine the whole value of such building to the owner, aside from the value of the land, and the injury to him in having such building taken from him; and secondly, the value of such building to remove. 
    SECTION 40. At least ten days' personal notice of such determination shall be given to the owner or his agent, if known, and a resident of the city, or left at his usual place of abode. If not known, or a non-resident, notice to all persons interested shall be given by publication in the official paper three successive weeks. Such notice shall specify the building and the award of the commissioners. It shall also require the parties interested to appear by a day therein named, or give notice of their election to the common council, either to accept the award of the commissioners, and to allow such building to be taken with the land appropriated, or their intention to remove such building at the rate set thereon by the commissioners to remove. If the owner shall agree to remove such building, he shall have such time for this purpose as the common council shall allow. 
    SECTION 41. If the owner refuse to take the building at the value to remove, or fail to give notice of his election as aforesaid within the time prescribed, the council shall have power to direct the sale of such building at public auction for cash, giving ten days' notice of such sale. The proceeds shall be paid to the owner, or deposited for him in the city treasury. 
    SECTION 42. The commissioners shall take and subscribe the oath prescribed by the twenty-eighth section of the fourth article of the constitution, before entering on the discharge of their duties. A majority of them may ajourn the proceedings before them from time to time, in their discretion. They shall cause notice to be given to each party interested of the time and the place where they will meet to consider the amount of compensation to which he is entitled, which notice shall be personally served on such party, or his authorized agent or attorney, or by leaving the same at his residence or place of business, with a person of suitable age and discretion, at least six days before the time of such meeting. If such party is a non-resident of this state, or his residence is unknown, and he has no authorized agent or attorney in this state, such notice shall be published in a newspaper as aforesaid for such length of time as the court or judge appointing said commissioners shall direct. The commissioners shall file a proof of such notices, or of the appearance of such parties before them, either personally or by attorney with their report. But it shall not be necessary to serve or publish notice of any subsequent meeting held pursuant to adjournment. 
    SECTION 43. The commissioners shall view the premises described in the petition, and hear the allegations of the parties, and shall appraise, ascertain and determine the value of each tract or parcel of land proposed to be taken, with the improvements thereon, and of each separate estate therein, and the damages sustained by the owner by reason of the taking thereof, and fix the amount of such compensation to be made to each of such owners therefor; and in fixing the amount of such compensation, said commissioners shall not make any allowance or deduction from the value of the real estate taken on account of any real or supposed benefits which the parties in interest may derive from the construction of the proposed improvement for which such real estate may be taken, but special benefits to the real estate adjoining the lands so taken, shall be allowed in deduction of any damages sustained by the owner to such adjoining real estate. In case of any building on the land, and proceedings shall have been taken as provided in sections 39, 40, 41, the said commissioners shall include the value of such building as estimated by them, less the proceeds of the sale thereof, or if taken by the owner at the value to remove, in such case, they shall only include the difference between such value and the whole estimated value of such building. A majority of the commissioners, all being present, shall be competent to determine all matters before them. The commissioners shall, within twenty days after viewing any of the lands so taken, make and file in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of such county, a report of their proceedings concerning such lands, setting forth the award made for each tract or parcel thereof, or separate estate therein, to the owner or owners thereof. The commissioners shall be entitled to such compensation as the court may direct, which shall be paid by the city. 
    SECTION 44. If the lands or buildings belong to different persons, or if the lands be subject to lease, judgment or mortgage, or if there be any estate in it less than an estate in fee, the injury done to such person or interest respectively, may be awarded to them by the commissioners, less the benefits resulting to them respectively from the proposed improvement. 
    SECTION 45. Whenever the commissioners shall have completed their duties and filed the report of their proceedings and determination as before provided, the common council may, if it shall deem it expedient by resolution or ordinance, order such improvement to be made, and the land which has been so found necessary to be taken therefor to be taken and used; and in such case the city shall be absolutely liable to the owner or owners or parties entitled thereto for all compensation that be established against said city therefor; and the council may also in that case make an assessment of the compensation to be paid thereof, with the costs of proceedings or such part thereof as they shall determine to be just, upon the lands found by them to be directly benefited by such improvement in such proportion to the benefits enjoyed as they shall determine. If the council shall not deem it expedient to make such improvement, they may by resolution order all further proceedings to be discontinued. 
    SECTION 46. Any person being dissatisfied with the amount of compensation for property taken or the amount assessed as benefits shall have the right to appeal to the circuit court within twenty days from the time of awarding of compensation or assessment of benefits by serving on the mayor or city clerk a notice of appeal therefrom, and giving a bond to the city in not less than one hundred dollars, to be approved by the mayor, acting mayor or city clerk, to pay all costs of appeal in case the appellant shall not, upon such appeal, increase the amount of compensation or decrease the amount assessed as benefits, as the case may be. The common council may appeal in behalf of the city by giving notice to the opposite party without giving bond. Upon filing such notice with the clerk of the circuit court the appeal shall be considered an action pending in court for trial there as other actions, and shall be entered by the clerk upon the records of the court by setting down the party appealing as plaintiff and the other party as defendant. Such appeal shall be tried by jury, unless a trial by jury be waived by both parties; costs shall be allowed to the successful party in accordance with the conditions of said bond.

The report of the commissioners shall be recorded by the clerk of the court, in whose office the same is filed in the judgment book of such court, and at any time after the making of such award the city may set apart in its treasury, to the order of the owner or owners of the lands so taken, or pay the same to such owner or owners, or to the clerk of said court for the use of such owner or owners, the amounts awarded by the commissioners, and thereupon may enter upon, take and use the land for the purposes for which it was condemned, and may obtain from either of said judges, upon twenty-four hours' notice, a writ of assistance to put its officers or agents into possession of the same. If such city be in possession or put in possession of such land, pending an appeal, the owners or parties entitled thereto, shall be entitled to receive the money paid into court or set apart in the city treasury on account of the award appealed from, without prejudice to the appeal taken, but if the city shall have appealed, such money shall only be so withdrawn by leave of court, upon filing a bond in such sum and with such surety as shall be approved by the court or judge to repay the amount by which such award shall be abated on such appeal, with costs. If any defect of title to or incumbrance upon any parcel of the premises shall be suggested in said petition, or if any party to said proceeding or any person not a party shall petition to the said court, setting up a claim adverse to the title set out in said premises and to the money or any part of it to be paid as a compensation for the property so taken, the court shall hear and determine the right of the parties to said money, and for that purpose may order a reference or an issue to be tried by a jury. Either party may except to the decisions of the court and appeal to the supreme court in like manner as in actions. Either court may award costs to the prevailing party, and render judgment therefor against the other party. 
    SECTION 48. When the whole of any lot or tract of land or other premises under lease or other contract shall be taken by virtue of this act, all the covenants, contracts or engagements between landlord and tenant, or any other contracting parties touching the same or any part thereof, shall, upon the confirmation of such report respectively cease and be absolutely discharged. 
    SECTION 49. When only part of the lot or tract of land or other premises so under lease, or other contract, shall be taken or used for any of the purposes aforesaid, all the covenants, contracts or agreements respectively touching the same, upon the confirmation of such report, shall be absolutely discharged as to the part thereof so taken, but shall remain valid as to the residue thereof; and the rents, considerations and payments reserved, payable and to be paid for, and in respect to the same, shall be so proportioned that the part thereof justly and equitably payable for such residue thereof, and no more shall be paid or recoverable for, in respect to the same. 
    SECTION 50. When any known owner or lands or tenements affected by any proceedings under this charter shall be an infant or labor under disability, the judge before whom the proceedings are pending, may, upon the application of the council, or such party by his next friend appoint a guardian for such party, in the same manner as in a civil action in a court of record, and all notices required by this charter shall be served on such guardian. 
    SECTION 51. The judge or court before whom proceedings are pending shall have power at any time to amend any defect or informality in any of the special proceedings authorized by this act as may be necessary, or to cause now parties to be added, and to direct such further notice to be given to any party in interest as he deems proper, and also to appoint other commissioners in place of any who shall die, or refuse or neglect to serve, or be incapable of serving. 
    SECTION 52.

B.  Absences. No member of any board, commission or committee may have more unexcused absences per year from scheduled and special meetings than are allowed in this subsection. An excused absence is an absence necessitated by sickness or immediate personal need; nonetheless, in the case of a vacation, absenting oneself from the city for a period during which four or more scheduled or special meetings of the board, commission or committee in succession are held shall not be an excused absence and shall constitute grounds for removal. The reasons for all absences shall be reported to the chairperson or presiding officer of the commission, board or committee, who shall then determine if the absence was excused or unexcused. If a member reaches a total number of unexcused absences during a calendar year equivalent to twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of meetings scheduled through that point in time, the chairperson or presiding officer shall report such fact to the mayor or other appointing authority, who shall declare the member's seat vacant and shall be free to appoint a successor thereto. Any disagreement by the appointee with the ruling of the presiding officer or chairperson of the board, commission or committee may be appealed to the mayor, if the mayor appointed the member in question, or to the appointing authority, if different than the mayor, for a final determination as to whether or not a given absence should be excused. 
C.  Removal for Absences. In the event an appointee exceeds the unexcused absences listed in subsection B of this section, the mayor or the appointing body shall remove such appointee from further service on the board, committee or commission.

No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 2.76.040(F)(6).

Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the city attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
C.  A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 2.76.060. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Section 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney.

    Construction costs of storm sewers are to be prorated on the following basis: 
A.  The cost of any damages to be awarded for property taken on damages arising from such improvement shall be borne by the city pursuant to state statutes. 
B.  The amount which the owner shall pay shall be based upon the ratio of the area of each owner's contributing parcel fronting on or within five hundred (500) feet of such improvement to the entire contribution area tributary to such improvement. 
C.  A contributing parcel shall be defined as: 
1.  A lot within a platted subdivision, the majority of whose area contributes to an abutting street which contains or drains to such improvement; or 
2.  An unplatted parcel of land which fronts on or contributes to a street containing or draining to the improvement where: 
a.  The depth is one hundred thirty-five (135) feet as measured at right angles to the street line where the drainage area falls away from the street or improvement, 
b.  The depth is defined as the depth of the parcel from the street line or from the improvement, where no street exists, to the rear limits of the contributing drainage area where the drainage area contributes to the improvement and where no future storm sewer extensions shall be made in the parcel's drainage area, or 
c.  In subdivision (2)(b) of this section, where future storm sewer extensions shall be made into the drainage area, the depth shall be considered as one hundred thirty-five (135) feet as measured at right angles to the improvement. 
d.  The "width" is defined as the width of the contributing parcel which falls within the tributary drainage area of the improvement.

I.  The cost per square foot to be assessed to the contributing and/or abutting property shall be the ratio of the total cost of the improvement to the total number of square feet in the contribution area. 
(Prior code § 8.08) 
3.16.020 - Costs to be assessed to annexed property. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide rules and regulations for assignment of costs of improvements to properties that may be annexed to the city after June 5, 1968. These regulations are made with reasonable consideration that such property be assessed at a different rate because properties that were in the city prior to the above date either have, by virtue of time, paid a great amount of money in taxes, or, by nature of other ordinances such as Title 16 of this municipal code, have been and are being charged the full cost of such improvements at the present time. 
B.  Classification. 
1.  For the purpose of this regulation all parcels of property shall be assessed according to this section except those parcels of property that would be regulated by the city's subdivision and platting code, Title 16 of this municipal code. 
2.  Any subdivision presently outside the city limits that is less than fifty (50) percent complete with structures that are in accord with the city's zoning code on June 5, 1968, shall be regulated by Title 16, the subdivision code. Any property annexed to the city which becomes a subdivision after its annexation shall be governed by Title 16, the subdivision code of the city. 
C.  Improvements. The following provisions shall apply to all properties (whether subdivision or not) annexed to the city after June 5, 1968, excepting that property which is subdivided after it has been annexed shall be governed by the subdivision code, Title 16 of this municipal code. 
1.  Improvements requested by the property owners or required by the city shall be made by the city at the property owner's expense with the specifications and supervision of the officials having jurisdiction. 
2.  Improvements which shall be installed at the expense of the property owner are: 
a.  Streets. Streets shall be brought to a final grade including all subgrades at the expense of the benefitting property owners. The benefitting property owners and the abutting property owners who shall benefit shall be assessed on a per front footage basis determined by the total cost of construction. 
b.  Boulevards and Terraces. Boulevards and terraces shall be top-soiled to conform to the city's specifications and shall be included as a part of the overall cost of street improvement. 
c.  Street Construction. The property owners shall not be responsible for any street construction after such streets have been brought up to final improvement as specified in the subdivision code of the city. 
d.  Curb, Gutter and Sidewalks. Curb and gutter shall be installed only after approval by the city engineer who has determined that soil and street conditions are suitable for installation of curb and gutter. Concrete curb and gutter shall be constructed to conform to the specifications established by the city engineer. Concrete sidewalks, if needed, shall be of such width and type as specified by the city engineer. 
e.  Bridges and Culverts. Bridges and culverts large enough to drain all natural flowage of water shall be constructed at the expense of the benefitting property owners in the annexed area on a per front footage basis as determined by the overall cost of such project. If property outside the area is directly benefitted thereby, the city shall bear the pro-rate cost of such improvement and shall take such action as may be required to recover the city's share from the parcels outside the annexed area benefitted thereby. 
f.  Utilities Generally. Utilities shall be installed at the expense of the property owners under the supervision of the city engineer and the utility department. Prior to any assessible water or sewer mains being installed, there shall be a public hearing on the project which shall comply with the statutory provisions for hearings levying special assessments against property for such improvements. 
g.  Sanitary Sewer. A public sanitary sewer system shall be installed upon a request of the majority of the property owners in the area or at the discretion of the city. If the sewage system installed is larger in capacity than is necessary for the immediate area, the city shall not assess the added cost to the present property owners, but the differential shall be paid by the city and charged with interest to additional properties as they connect to the sewer system. 
h.  Pumping Stations. If a pumping station is required to pump sanitary wastes from an area, it shall be installed by the city and assessed to all benefitting property owners on a front footage basis determined by the overall cost of the project. If the pumping station installed is larger in capacity than is necessary for the immediate area, the city shall not assess the added cost to the present property owners but shall pay such differential cost and charge additional property owners such cost with interest as they connect to such pumping station. 
i.  Water. A complete water distribution system, exclusive of hydrants, adequate to serve an area being annexed shall be installed upon the request of the property owners or at the discretion of the city. The entire cost of this project shall be assessed against the property owners on a per front footage determined by the overall cost of the project. If the city determines that it wishes to put in a system larger than is necessary to serve the area being annexed, the additional cost shall not be assessed to the property owners but shall be paid by the city and charged with interest to additional properties as they connect to such water system. 
j.  Storm Sewer. A storm water sewer or drainage system adequate to serve the area being platted and all natural flowage of water that would pass through such development shall be installed with the approval of the city engineer and the city council. If a pumping station is required to pump storm water from an area, it shall be installed by the city and assessed to all benefiting property owners on a front footage basis determined by the overall cost of the project. If the pumping station that is installed is larger in capacity than is necessary for the immediate service area, the city shall not assess the added cost to the present property owners, but the differential shall be paid by the city and charged with interest to additional properties as they connect to the pumping station. 
D.  Notification to Install and Complete Improvements. The city clerk shall give adequate notice to all property owners when a determination has been made that improvements are contemplated. Upon notification, a public hearing shall be held to determine if the plans as proposed by the city meet with the approval of the majority of the property owners in the area. 
E.  Compliance Required. No petition for annexation shall be approved unless the petitioners, as a condition to annexation, agree to abide by and comply with the terms and conditions of this section. 
F.  Variances. The city council may grant variances from the provisions of this section, but only after determining that: 
1.  Because of the unique conditions of the annexed area, literal application of this section would impose hardship; 
2.  The variance will not violate the purpose of this section or the provisions of Ch. 236, Wis. Stats. 
(Prior code § 8.09) 
3.16.030 - Other improvements. 
A.  As a complete alternative to all methods described by this chapter, the city council shall retain the unqualified right and discretion to levy and collect special assessments upon property within the corporate limits of the city for special benefits conferred upon the property by any municipal work or improvement using whatever method of assessing it may choose consistent with requirements as contained in Section 66.0703, Wis. Stats. 
B.  Included in the alternatives listed in subsection A of this section is the right of the city to assess property, whether developed or undeveloped, for city paid costs associated with oversizing of utilities, special design of utilities and design for increased capacities of utilities that were installed in subdivisions or other lands within the corporate limits of the city with future thought given to the fact that the property lying outside corporate limits would someday need such oversizing, special design or increase capacity to adequately handle the utility needs of the property that may someday be annexed to the city. The owner or subdivider of the property to be annexed and assessed shall pay these costs at such time as the property is annexed. This alternative is intended to conform to Section 66.0707, Wis. Stats.

Each application for a license submitted containing the information required under Sections 5.08.040 and 5.08.045 shall be considered upon the basis of the following criteria, it being the further position of the city that such analysis is warranted so as to assist in protecting and promoting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of River Falls. In addition and in accord with Wisconsin law, obtaining a license is deemed to be a privilege and the control of the sale of alcohol beverages is deserving of special regulation, thus occasioning the ability of the common council to review information submitted in accord with the following criteria in determining whether or not to issue a new license. Scott v. Village of Kewaskum, 786 F.2d 338 (7 Circ., 1986). Accordingly, the common council is advised in the premises that no person who applies for a license is automatically entitled to be approved for licensure and that even a nominally qualified applicant does not have the right to a license. Marquette Sav. and Loan Assoc. v. Village of Twin Lakes, 38 Wis.2d 310 (1968). The common council also reserves the right to modify the designation of proposed licensed premises where it deems it to be in the interests of the public health, safety and welfare. 
B.  A personal appearance by the agent listed on the application for both new and renewal licenses is required before the common council at the regular meeting that the application is being considered. Failure of the agent to appear will result in the delay of consideration of the application until the next regular meeting of the common council that a personal appearance can occur. 
C.  In the course of its review of applications for both new and renewal licenses, the city shall take into consideration these criteria: 
1.  The applicant's application materials submitted under Sections 5.08.040 and 5.08.045. 
2.  Consistency between the proposed use of the described premises for the sale of alcohol beverages with existing zoning and other police power regulations of the city. 
3.  Concerns of the city pertaining to issues of operating motor vehicles while intoxicated or incapacitated by the consumption of alcohol beverages. 
4.  Neighborhood circumstances, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The location in close proximity to the proposed licensed premises of other licensed premises. 
b.  The relative concentration of other licensed premises in the immediate vicinity of the premises proposed for licensing. 
c.  Considerations of community concerns in relationship to the licensure of additional premises for the sale of alcohol beverages, either locally or on a city-wide basis. 
5.  An examination of the history of the proposed licensed premises as pertaining to its prior use for or in relationship to the sale of alcohol beverages and incidences of police and other emergency calls to said premises, if previously licensed in the name of another person. 
6.  Consideration of the types of business enterprises which may have use for a license and which the common council desires to attract to the city, given the limited number of available licenses and the relationship of the proposed licensee to said type of enterprise. 
7.  The impact of the granting of the license upon other licensed premises within a reasonable proximity of the proposed licensed premises. 
8.  The impact of the proposed licensed premises upon vehicular and pedestrian traffic patterns and frequency. 
9.  The impact of the operation of the licensed premises upon the peace and cleanliness of the neighborhood in which it is situated. 
10.  Availability of adequate on- or off-street parking to serve the needs of its projected customers. 
11.  The proximity of the proposed licensed premises to residentially zoned properties, and existing schools, hospitals and places of worship. 
12.  The ability of the police department to enforce city code and state laws as pertaining to the operation of the proposed premises given the nature of the proposed alcohol related business and demands for its services, generally, in the city at the time of proposed licensure. 
13.  Examination of the personal history of the person applying for the license as said history pertains to eligibility for licensure. 
14.  Fire and safety issues as pertaining to the proposed licensed premises. 
15.  Such other and further criteria as will in the opinion of the common council on a case by case basis advance and promote the public interest in its health, safety and welfare in the process of determining whether or not to issue a given license. 
16.  The provisions of Ch. 125, Wis. Stats., as well as provisions of Chapter 5.08 and other ordinances of the city.

A.  For purposes of this section, "underage person" is defined to mean a person who is at least sixteen (16) years of age but less than twenty one (21) years of age. 
B.  In addition to the exceptions contained in Ch. 125, Wis. Stats., underage persons may: 
1.  Enter or remain on Class "B" or "Class B" licensed premises separate from any room where alcohol beverages are sold or served if no alcohol beverages are furnished or consumed by any person in the room where the underage person is present; 
2.  Enter or remain on Class "B" or "Class B" licensed premises on a date specified by the licensee or permittee during times when no alcohol beverages are consumed, sold or given away.

D  Before issuing the authorization, the chief of police or an officer designated by the chief of police shall make a determination that the presence of underage persons on the premises will not endanger their health, welfare or safety or that of other members of the community. Among the factors to be considered by the police when issuing an authorization under subsection (A)(1) of this section are:

(Ord. 2003-14 §§ 1-4; prior code § 12.03(15)) 
5.08.160 - Nudity and sexual conduct regulated. 
A.  Authority and Purpose. The common council of the city has explicit authority under § 125.10(1), Wis. Stats., to adopt regulations governing the sale of alcohol beverages which are in addition to those set forth in Ch. 125, Wis. Stats., and has authority under its general police powers set forth in § 62.11(5), Wis. Stats., to act for the good order of the city and for the health, safety and welfare of the public and may carry out its powers by regulation and suppression. 
    The common council recognizes it lacks authority to regulate obscenity in light of § 66.0107(3), Wis. Stats., and does not intend by adopting this subsection to regulate obscenity, since nudity in and of itself is not obscene, and declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing and other nude activity in bars and taverns. Nor is it the intent of the city, by adoption and enforcement of this section, to suppress the content of erotic expression. Instead, this section constitutes a regulation of non-expressive conduct, namely circumstances under which the serving and consumption of alcoholic beverages are controlled. 
    The common council finds that bars and taverns featuring live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing and other nude activity have in other communities tended to further the increase of criminal and other offensive activity, to disrupt the peace and order of the communities, to depreciate the value of real property, to harm the economic welfare of the communities, and to negatively affect the quality of life of the communities, and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare of citizens. It is the express finding of the common council, as based upon the experience in other municipalities nationwide, reports of which have been made available to the common council, and the factual bases of the holdings and findings federal case law construing 1st Amendment rights that Permitting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in conjunction with presentations of nude or semi-nude dancing and other nude activity creates enhanced, adverse secondary effects for the community. 
    The common council recognizes that the United States Supreme Court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment to the United States Constitution and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the first amendment, and the common council further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights, and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights. The common council is aware, based on the experiences of other communities, that bars and taverns in which live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing and other nude activity occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the common council believes are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, namely the potential increase in prostitution and other sex-related offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses; the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing or activity exist; health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; and the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct. 
    The common council, in enacting this section, has taken into consideration case law construing the right to regulate nude dancing and activity in relationship to first amendment, freedom of expression rights, including but not limited to Lounge Management v. Town of Trenton, 219 Wis.2d 13 (1998), Urmanski v. Town of Bradley, 237 Wis.2d 545 (2000), Town of Lyndon v. Beyer, 243 Wis.2d 116 [table] unpublished decision, (2001), Schultz v. City of Cumberland, 228 F.3d 831 (7 Circ., 2000), City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S.Ct. 1382 (2000), California v. LaRue, 93 S.Ct. 390 (1973), as refined and refashioned in 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 116 S.Ct. 1495 (1996). and Ben's Bar v. Village of Somerset, F.3d (2003). and the cases cited therein. The express intent of the city is to regulate the potentially harmful secondary effects of nude dancing and activity while engaging in a de minimis intrusion on expression. 
    The common council thus desires to minimize, prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter urban blight. 
    Therefore, the common council has determined that enactment of this section prohibiting live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing and other nude activity in bars and taverns licensed to serve alcohol beverages with the express exception set forth in subsection D of this section, promotes the goal of minimizing, preventing and controlling the negative, secondary effects associated with such activity, in combination with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. To this effect, the city is not attempting to create a legislative declaration that certain acts are publicly indecent; rather it is establishing a regulation of licensed establishments.

1.  "Licensed establishment" means any establishment licensed by the common council of the city to sell alcohol beverages pursuant to Ch. 125, Wis. Stats.

(Ord. 2003-05 § 1) 
5.08.170 - Abandonment of licensed premises-Grounds for revocation or non-renewal.

Sections: 

5.18.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The city council finds that the services offered by pawnshops provide an opportunity for individuals to readily transfer stolen property to those businesses.

The purpose of this chapter is to prevent pawnshops from being used to facilitate the commission of crimes and to assure that they comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens, and pursuant to the authority granted by Section 134.71, Wis. Stats. 
B.  This chapter implements and establishes the required use of the automated pawn system (APS) to help the police department better regulate current and future pawnshops to decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of pawnshops, and to increase identification of criminal activities in pawnshops through the timely collection and sharing of transaction information.

Sections: 

6.08.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to establish regulations which will allow as a conditional use the keeping of wild animals with a wild animal license in certain zoning districts.

The keeping of wild animals may include animals being used or intended to be used for research, training, breeding, boarding as a personal pet or for agricultural purposes. The keeping of a wild animal may also include wild animals intended to be used for exhibition providing that such animals are not exhibited within the city, such as in the case of a public showing, circus or zoo.

Chapter 8.16 - ENVIRONMENTAL USER FEE 
Sections: 

8.16.010 - Findings. 
    It is determined and declared to be desirable and necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare to remedy the release of organic and inorganic substances from solid waste landfills which have been operated by the city. The releases are potentially detrimental to the air and groundwater, and if allowed to concentrate, may be toxic, combustible or explosive. In order to finance the environmental remediation of these sites, there shall be established a charge upon all improved parcels in the city to include residential, commercial, industrial/heavy commercial, health care and educational facilities. 
(Prior code § 3.30(1)) 
8.16.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter: 
    Commercial Unit. A "commercial unit" is defined in accordance with and includes the provisions of Chapters 17.32 through 17.40. Hospitals/nursing homes and schools/dormitories are assigned to unique environmental fee categories, therefore, are not considered commercial units for this environmental user fee. Trailer parks are included in the residential unit category as one unit per trailer, and therefore are not considered commercial units for this environmental user fee. Each businesses' electrical meter is considered a commercial unit. An average of three employees is used. 
    Educational/School Unit. The "educational/school unit" category shall include public schools as defined by Section 115.01(1), Wis. Stats., private schools as defined in Section 115.01(3r), Wis. Stats., public and private universities and colleges and vocational/technical schools operating under Chapter 38, Wis. Stats. An educational/school unit shall be defined as a single enrolled student. 
    Health Care Unit. The "health care unit" category shall include hospitals defined as follows: an institution open to the public in which sick or injured persons are given medical or surgical care or for the care of contagious diseases and which has bed facilities for persons staying more than twenty-four (24) hours. Clinics are not included in the category. This category also includes nursing homes defined as follows: a facility for the care of aged or infirm or a place of rest for those suffering bodily disorders. Such facility does not contain equipment for surgical care. A health care unit shall be considered a single occupiable bed in the facility. 
    "Improved parcel" means a lot, plot or defined area of land for which exists a legal description and Property Identification Number and upon which a structure or building exists or is erected. Each structure and/or building shall have a defined use, as per Title 17 of this code. A structure may be accessory to a building and its use, or may be an independent structure from any building or other use. Each structure and/or building for which there is an independent or separate use shall constitute an improvement. Each improvement shall be subject to a separate charge and/or fee according to the environmental fee category assigned to the parcel. 
    Industrial/Heavy Commercial Unit. An "industrial/heavy commercial unit" is defined in accordance with and includes the provisions of Chapter 17.48. Each industry is considered an industrial unit. Retail stores greater than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet floor space and supermarkets are considered a heavy commercial unit. An average of twenty-five (25) employees is used. 
    Residential Unit. A "residential unit" is defined in accordance with and includes the provisions of Title 17, zoning code, Section 17.04.020, "apartment," "dwelling code," "mobilehome" and "rooming unit", and Public Health and Welfare Chapter 11, subsection 11.05(2) - Definitions of Garbage and Refuse Collection as follows: a single-family residential home.

An average of three residents per units is used. 
(Prior code § 3.30(2)) 
8.16.030 - User fee established. 
    It is the intent of the city to allocate the cost of landfill remediations, including all mandates by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to monitor groundwater and perform other remediation actions at former city landfill sites, and that the most equitable manner is to establish a user fee which applies to the greatest number of users and has the highest causal relationship to the service being provided. The most equitable fee is one which is based upon the amount of waste generated for any particular type of facility as this ensures the generator to contribute in fee-based on the projected waste volume. 
(Prior code § 3.30(3)) 
8.16.040 - Administration and calculation. 
    The city administrator, finance director and city engineer shall establish procedures for review by the common council to properly allocate the costs for the administration of this service. The base per capita fee shall be calculated based on the following waste generation factors: 
Category* Unit Waste Factor Residential 1 lb./resident/day Commercial 5 lbs./employee/day Industrial/Heavy Commercial 10 lbs./employee/day Health Care 8 lbs./bed/day School with Student Housing 0.75 lb./student/day School without Student Housing 0.45 lb./student/day  
* Corbitt, Robert A.: Standard Handbook of Environmental Engineering, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1990. 
B.  Fees shall be calculated on a average of three persons per residence, three employees per commercial business shift, twenty-five (25) employees per industrial/heavy commercial business, the actual health care beds and the actual student enrollment. Fees shall be reviewed by the city administrator, finance director and city engineer and approved by council resolution. 
C.  Annual Calculation of Fee. The environmental fee shall be calculated on an annual basis and may change depending on the monitoring or remediation actions taken by the city at former landfill sites. 
D.  Fee Responsibility of Owner. The fee shall be the responsibility of the owner of the improved property. The fee may be billed on a unit basis if that unit is normally billed for other utility charges. 
(Prior code § 3.30(4)) 
8.16.050 - Discretionary application. 
    The common council shall retain the discretion to impose or not impose this environmental user fee each year, such discretion to be dependent upon other potential sources of funding or cost mitigation as the same applies to remedial measures taken by the city on former landfill sites. 
(Prior code § 3.30(5))

The fire and police departments respond to alarms as a form of current service provision to the owners of properties at which alarms are maintained. To this extent, the purpose of this chapter is to designate alarm responses as a service for which a fee is established when the fire and police departments are confronted with false alarms. 
(Ord. 2007-23 § 1 (part))

Chapter 12.06 - RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT SYSTEM 

12.06.010 - Purpose. 
    It is declared necessary, in the interest of the residents of the city, to establish a residential parking permit system in accord with Section 349.13(1g), Wis. Stats., whereunder motor vehicles bearing a valid residential parking permit may be parked on city streets in excess of the time limits on specifically designated streets within a specified zone or zones. The reason in support of this chapter is that there exists in the city at this time an excess of commuter parking on city streets, which limits or prevents residents of neighborhoods from parking their own motor vehicles on the streets adjoining their places of residence. It is the intent of this chapter to provide greater opportunity to those residents to avail themselves of the ability to park their motor vehicles on city streets while regulating the length of time, generally, during which commuters may park their motor vehicles on the same streets. It is further intended that this chapter shall assist in reducing automobile commuting and alleviate traffic congestion, illegal parking and related health and safety hazards in the zones established pursuant hereto. It is also the position of the city that the acquisition of a permit under this chapter confers no rights upon the holder. It is merely a privilege which is subject to revocation at the pleasure of the city.

Chapter 12.16 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT* 
Sections: 

12.16.010 - Purpose. 
A.  Authority. 
1.  The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted by the city of River Falls under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. Section 62.234 and Section 62.11(5). This chapter supersedes all conflicting and contradictory stormwater management regulations previously enacted under Wis. Stats. Section 62.23. Except as specifically provided for in Wis. Stats. Section 62.234, Wis. Stats. Section 62.23 apply to this chapter and to any amendments to this chapter. 
2.  The provisions of this ordinance are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the city. 
3.  In instances where the provisions of this chapter conflict with provisions of other city ordinances, zoning regulations, or the provisions of state agencies including, but not limited to, the WPDES Stormwater Discharge Permits issued by the Department of Natural Resources under Wis. Stats. Section 281.31, the more stringent provisions shall apply. 
4.  The city hereby designates the city engineer as the person responsible to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
5.  The requirements of this ordinance do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that maybe imposed by WPDES Stormwater Discharge Permits issued by the Department of Natural Resources under Wis. Stats. Section 283.31. 
B.  Findings of Fact. The city and adjacent townships are growing at a rapid rate. The Kinnickinnic River and its tributaries are valuable trout waters of regional significance, representing a major natural amenity of the community. The effect of stormwater from the city and the surrounding towns has the potential to degrade the physical and biological characteristics of the Kinnickinnic River and its tributaries. The increase in urban and rural runoff, as well as the associated thermal and sediment related pollution from present and future land uses will continue to have a detrimental effect on the cold-water fishery of the Kinnickinnic River and its major tributaries without proper management of surface and ground water. 
    The protection of the water quality of the Kinnickinnic is critical to the environmental and economic future of the community. Development in the Kinnickinnic River Watershed needs to be carefully planned to protect the existing resources. The city has an existing stormwater system, much of which discharges directly into the river. Trout are considered an indicator species of environmental quality. Therefore, trout habitat is a major issue in this urbanizing area. A strategy to protect and enhance this resource must be developed, locally supported, adopted and implemented. 
    With an increase in development pressure, there is less opportunity for groundwater to infiltrate and recharge groundwater and cold-water feeder streams. Uncontrolled stormwater runoff will result in increased water temperatures that threaten high quality trout waters. In addition, uncontrolled rates and volumes of stormwater runoff can: 
1.  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing water temperatures; 
2.  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants; 
3.  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads; 
4.  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading; 
5.  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities; 
6.  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes; 
7.  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding. 
    Beginning in 1991, the city, in cooperation with the towns of River Falls, Kinnickinnic, Troy and Clifton, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Trout Unlimited, and the University of Wisconsin - River Falls, prepared a water management plan entitled Water Management Plan for the Kinnickinnic River and its tributaries herein after referred to as the water management plan. The water management plan was completed in 1995 and may be amended from time to time. The water management plan was designed to "deliver good quality stormwater runoff to the Kinnickinnic River at acceptable rates and volumes to reduce pollutant loading and stream bed/stream bank degradation, and maintain a river temperature suitable to support a cold water fishery." 
    The city was included in the Kinnickinnic Priority Watershed established by St. Croix and Pierce County with the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to address watershed management at the basin level The Priority Watershed Plan, Non-Point Source Control Plan for the Kinnickinnic River Priority Watershed Project, was adopted by St. Croix and Pierce Counties in March 1999, and approved by the DNR on April 13, 1999. 
C.  Purpose. The general purpose of this chapter is to accommodate anticipated community development and land use practices by controlling the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff and properly managing and protecting ground water resources and the physical habitat of the Kinnickinnic River and its tributaries. It sets forth stormwater management and erosion control performance standards that apply to all land development and land disturbing activities. 
    Specific purposes are to: 
1.  To the maximum extent practical, mimic existing hydrology including the existing base flow, infiltration, storm flow and thermal regime of the Kinnickinnic River and its tributaries; 
2.  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater, soil erosion, and water pollution; 
3.  Protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; 
4.  Maintain the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies, prevent undue channel erosion, and control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property; 
5.  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; and 
6.  Control building sites, placement of structures, and extent of impervious surfaces and promote sound economic growth. 
(Ord. 2005-10 § 1;Ord. 2002-08 § 1) 
12.16.020 - Applicability and jurisdiction. 
A.  Applicability. This chapter applies to land development or land disturbing activity of any size, which changes the pre-development hydrology thermal loading, chemical loading, sediment loading or increases the rate or volume of runoff leaving the site as compared to the conditions that existed prior to any planned land development or land disturbing activity. 
B.  Jurisdiction. This chapter applies to all land development or land disturbing activities within the boundaries of the city. No land owner or land operator may undertake a land development or land disturbing activity subject to this ordinance without having met the performance standards set forth in the water management plan and without having received a permit from the city engineer prior to commencing the proposed activity. 
C.  Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to the provisions of this chapter: 
1.  If the conditions in paragraph a, b, or c below are met, owners, builders and developers of single family and duplex homes shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter, with the exception that all provisions related to construction site erosion control shall be met. 
a.  For initial construction on a lot that is less than one acre in area and that was part of an approved preliminary plat or CSM prior to April 1, 2002. 
b.  For initial construction on a lot that is part of a Preliminary Plat or CSM approved after April 1, 2002, the following conditions are met: 
(i)  The sub-divider of the lot has obtained a permit in accordance with this ordinance. 
(ii)  The lot is developed in accordance with the permit that was issued to the sub-divider. 
c.  For subsequent changes to a currently developed lot, the following conditions are met: 
(i)  Activity is disturbing less than two thousand (2,000) square feet of land; and

A.  Maintenance and Monitoring Agreement Required. The maintenance and monitoring agreement required for stormwater management practices under this chapter shall be an agreement between the city and the permittee to provide for both short-term and long-term maintenance and monitoring of stormwater management practices. These documents will be drafted by the city and must be signed by the owner of the property. 
1.  The short-term maintenance and monitoring agreement shall provide for maintenance and monitoring of stormwater management practices necessary to maintain temporary drainage and erosion control measures and to establish permanent drainage and erosion control measures. Short-term maintenance provisions are generally those activities that occur during the construction phase and do not continue in perpetuity. This agreement shall be signed prior to approval of the stormwater management permit. 
2.  The long-term maintenance and monitoring agreement may provide for maintenance and monitoring of stormwater practices that continue in perpetuity. Such long-term maintenance will be required where the stormwater practice serves an individual landowner or organized group of landowners. Agreements with long-term maintenance provisions shall be recorded with the county registrar of deeds so that they are binding upon all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management practices. This agreement is typically for private stormwater facilities and must be completed, signed (by the owner), and notarized before an occupancy permit will be granted. 
B.  Monitoring Requirements. Stormwater facilities shall be monitored in accordance with the stormwater plan, the conditions of the permit and the maintenance and monitoring agreement. Monitoring shall verify whether or not the practice is functioning as designed. Monitoring may include, but is not limited to, quality, temperature and quantity of runoff. See Section 12.16.050(E) for specific maintenance and monitoring requirements. 
C.  Agreement Provisions. The maintenance and monitoring agreement (both long-term and short-term) shall contain but are not limited to the following information and provisions: 
1.  Identification of the stormwater facilities. 
2.  A schedule for regular maintenance and monitoring of each aspect of the stormwater management system that is consistent with the stormwater plan. 
3.  Identification of the landowner(s), organization, or municipality responsible for short-term or long-term maintenance, as is applicable, and monitoring of the stormwater practices. 
4.  Commit the landowner(s), organization, or municipality to maintain and monitor stormwater practices in accordance with the schedule included in the agreement. 
D.  Administration. The city engineer is authorized to enforce the maintenance and monitoring agreements. 
1.  The city engineer is authorized to access the property to conduct inspections and monitor the stormwater practices as necessary to ascertain that the practices are being maintained and operated in accordance with the agreement. 
2.  The city engineer shall maintain public records of the results of the site inspections, inform the landowner responsible for maintenance of the inspection results, and specifically indicate any corrective actions required to bring the stormwater management practices into proper working condition. 
3.  If the city engineer notifies the party designated under the maintenance and monitoring agreement of maintenance or monitoring problems that require correction, the city engineer shall take the specific actions to correct the problem within a reasonable time frame. 
4.  The city engineer is authorized to perform the corrective actions identified in the inspection report if the landowner does not make the required corrections in the specified time period. The city engineer shall initiate proceedings to impose the cost as a special assessment or charge against the property pursuant to Section 66.0627 or Section 66.0703 Wis. Stats. or to charge the cost against the financial guarantee posed under this chapter. 
(Ord. 2007-14 § 6; Ord. 2005-10 § 6; Ord. 2002-08 § 6) 
12.16.070 - Performance standards. 
    Unless the city engineer gives prior written authorization, the methods in conformance with the technical standards shall be followed. 
A.  General Requirements for Stormwater Management Measures. The following shall be observed in managing stormwater runoff: 
1.  The applicant may attend a pre-application meeting with the city before any data will be accepted. The purpose of the meeting is to specifically address required approvals and permits, and applicable technical standards. 
2.  Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater recharge areas shall be preserved and used, to the extent possible, to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
3.  Emergency overland flow for all stormwater facilities shall be provided during and after construction to prevent exceeding the safe capacity of downstream drainage facilities and to prevent endangerment of downstream property or public safety. 
4.  Water quality facilities are required for all developments unless a development is part of a city-approved regional pond drainage area. 
5.  All hydrologic data shall be submitted to the city engineer. Data shall be obtained using NRCS methodology including, but not limited to, HydroCAD or TR20/TR55 as defined by the NRCS. 
6.  Hydrologic analysis shall be based on NRCS methods using a Type II storm distribution, twenty-four (24) hour duration, and average soil moisture conditions (AMC-2), as defined by the NRCS. 
7.  Hydraulic calculations will be accepted in the Rational Method format or in commonly used software packages such as FHWA HV-8, Eagle Point or XP SWMM. 
8.  When runoff from an upstream property passes through a downstream property, and it is desirable in the opinion of the city engineer to oversize a pond or conveyance system to serve increased runoff from predicted development of adjacent properties, the cost of over sizing the facility shall be determined by the city engineer, and assessed in accordance with state law and this code. 
9.  Where appropriate, the plan shall include sediment controls to do all of the following to the maximum extent practicable: 
a.  Prevent tracking of sediment from the construction site onto roads and other paved surfaces. 
b.  Prevent the discharge of sediment as part of site de-watering. 
c.  Protect storm drain inlet structures from receiving sediment. 
10.  The use, storage and disposal of chemicals, cement and other compounds and materials used on the construction site shall be managed during the construction period to prevent their entrance into waters of the state. However, projects that require the placement of these materials in waters of the state, such as constructing bridge footings or BMP installations, are not prohibited by this paragraph. 
B.  Peak Discharge Rate and Volume. By design, BMPs shall be employed to meet the following performance standards. 
1.  For a 1.5-inch rainfall event, the proposed post-development runoff volume must not exceed the runoff volume for pre-development land use conditions. 
2.  For the one-year, two-year, ten-year and one hundred-year rainfall events: the post-development peak flow rate shall not exceed the peak flow rate for pre-development land use conditions. Rate control shall be provided at each location water is leaving the site. 
3.  Pre-development conditions shall assume "good hydrologic conditions" for appropriate land covers as identified in TR-55 or an equivalent methodology. The meanings of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve number" are as determined in TR-55. However, when pre-development land cover is cropland, grassland or woodland, rather than using TR-55 values, the runoff curve numbers in Table 1 shall be used. 
Table 1 

Maximum Pre-Development Runoff Curve Numbers Hydrologic Soil Group A B C D Cropland Curve Number 55 69 78 83 Grassland Curve Number 39 61 71 78 Woodland Curve Number 30 55 70 77  
C.  Infiltration Practices. BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff to meet the runoff rate and volume requirements where Hydrologic Group A or B soils exist. 
1.  Where infiltration practices will be used, the location, surface area, depth, soil types (hydrologic group) and infiltration rate and volume computations shall be submitted to the city engineer. 
2.  Pre-development condition shall be the same as in subsection (B)(3) of this section. 
3.  Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from new road construction in commercial, industrial and institutional areas that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality. Pretreatment options may include, but are not limited to, oil/grease separation, sedimentation, biofiltration, filtration, swales or filter strips. 
4.  Exclusions. The runoff from the following areas are prohibited from meeting the requirements of this paragraph: 
a.  Areas associated with tier 1 industrial facilities identified in section NR 216.21(2)(a), Wis. Adm. Code, including storage, loading, rooftop and parking;

e.  Areas with less than three feet separation distance from the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock. This subsection (C)(4)e), does not prohibit surface infiltration of roof runoff and subsurface infiltration shall only be required to maintain a minimum of one foot separation. 
f.  Areas with runoff from industrial, commercial and institutional parking lots and roads as well as residential arterial roads with less than five feet separation distance from the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of seasonal high groundwater or the top of bedrock; 
g.  Areas within four hundred (400) feet of a community water system well as specified in section NR 811.16(4), Wis. Adm. Code, or within one hundred (100) feet of a private well as specified in section NR 812.08(4), Wis. Adm. Code, for runoff infiltrated from commercial, industrial and institutional land uses or regional devices for residential development; 
h.  Areas where contaminants of concern, as defined in section NR 720.03(2), Wis. Adm. Code is present in the soil through which infiltration will occur; 
i.  Any area where the soil does not exhibit one of the following soil characteristics between the bottom of the infiltration system and the seasonal high groundwater and top of bedrock: at least a three-foot soil layer with twenty (20) percent fines or greater; or at least a five-foot soil layer with ten (10) percent fines or greater. This does not apply where the soil medium within the infiltration system provides an equivalent level of protection. 
5.  Where alternate uses of runoff are employed, such as for toilet flushing, laundry or irrigation, such alternate use shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume required by this chapter. 
6.  Infiltration systems designed in accordance with this chapter shall, to the extent technically and economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance with the preventive action limit at a point of standards application in accordance with Ch. NR 140, Wis. Adm. Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that compliance with a preventive action limit is not achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum extent practicable. 
7.  Notwithstanding the above, the discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement standard at the point of standards application. 
D.  Fueling and Vehicle Maintenance Areas. Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have BMPs designed, installed and maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, such that the runoff that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen. 
E.  Total Suspended Solids. BMPs shall be designed, installed and maintained to control total suspended solids carried in runoff from the post-construction site as follows: 
1.  For new development, reduce to the maximum extent practicable, the total suspended solids load by eighty-five (85) percent, based on the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. 
2.  For re-development, reduce to the maximum extent practicable, the total suspended solids load by forty (40) percent based on the average annual rainfall, as compared to no runoff management controls. 
3.  All water quality analyses shall be based on the P8 Urban Catchment Model, WinSLAMM or other comparable model as approved by the city engineer. 
4.  For this chapter, the following year has been selected as average annual rainfall: Minneapolis, 1959 (Mar. 13-Nov. 4). (note: in P8, the start date shall be: 19580101, the keep date: 19590313, and the stop date: 19591104).

Chapter 12.18 - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION 
Sections: 

12.18.010 - Purpose. 
A.  Authority. 
1.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city of River Falls through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the MS4 in order to comply with requirements of the Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permit process. The objectives of this chapter are: 
a.  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by stormwater discharges by any user. 
b.  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4. 
c.  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter. 
2.  The provisions of this chapter are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the city. 
3.  In instances where the provisions of this ordinance conflict with provisions of other city ordinances, zoning regulation, or the provisions of state agencies, including, but not limited to, the WPDES Stormwater Discharge Permits issued by the WDNR under Wis. Stats. Section 281.31, the more stringent provision shall apply. 
4.  The city designates the city engineer as the person responsible to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Ultimate Responsibility. The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this ordinance are minimum standards; therefore this chapter does not intend or imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants. 
C.  Findings of Fact. The city and adjacent towns are growing at a rapid rate. The Kinnickinnic River and its tributaries are valuable trout waters of regional significance, representing a major natural amenity of the community. Illicit discharges have the potential to severely impact the fish and wildlife habitat of the river.

When the city engineer finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to reoccur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city engineer may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: reoccur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the state which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city engineer may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
a.  Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and 
b.  Take such appropriate preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of state, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The city engineer may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city engineer within five days of receipt of the emergency order as a prerequisite for taking any other action against the violator. 
2.  Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The city engineer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons. 
3.  Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city engineer will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city engineer for a reconsideration and hearing. 
    A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city engineer. 
4.  Prosecution and Penalties. Any person that has violated or continues to violate this chapter shall be liable to prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within the set time period specified by the city engineer, after he/she has taken one or more of the actions described above, he/she may impose a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day, the specific amount of which shall be determined by the severity of the violation in question, for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. The city engineer may also impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling/marking, attendance at compliance workshops, pond or drainage way cleanup, etc. 
E.  Cost of Abatement of the Violation. Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the premises will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. If the amount due is not paid by the date determined by the city, the charges shall become a special charge against the property, and shall constitute a lien on the property, per Section 66.0628, Wis.

(Prior code § 13.09) 
13.04.040 - Violations-Penalties. 
A.  Any person found to be violating any provision of Sections 13.04.010 through 13.04.030 shall be served by the city with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.

Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense. 
(Prior code § 13.10 (part)) 
13.04.050 - Charges. 
A.  Fees shall be charged for water usage as approved by the public service commission. 
B.  Fees for sewer use and/or sewage treatment shall be established by resolution of the common council upon recommendation by the utility advisory board per Section 2.64.070 of this municipal code. The city utilities department shall examine the fee schedule annually upon receipt of the audit report for the preceding year. Any changes in fees shall become effective in the billing period next following publication in the official newspaper of any changes in such fees. The fees shall be set with consideration given to both volume and strength of sewage and shall be established according to applicable regulation established by the public service commission and shall be in compliance with Section 281.57(8)(c), Wis. Stats. 
C.  The city shall conduct an annual audit, the purpose of which shall be to maintain the proportionality between users and user classes of the user charge system and to ensure that adequate revenues are available relative to increasing O, M & R costs. Any excess revenues collected from a user class will be applied to O, M & R costs attributable to that class for the next year. 
D.  Users will be notified annually of the portion of user charges attributable to waste water treatment services. 
E.  User Charge System. Charges for metered general sewer services shall be based upon a schedule of charges that may be established, from time to time, with the approval of both the utility advisory board and common council, said charges to be on file with the city clerk and the finance director. 
F.  Connection Fee for Territory Annexed to the City. 
1.  Established. In addition to all other charges imposed by this title, there shall be imposed a connection fee for ultimate users of a specific municipal improvement that benefits a defined area, including area outside the corporate limits, such fee to be imposed at the time the property annexes to the city and the municipal improvement is actually used by the property owner. The specific municipal improvement shall include such items as a water tower, wastewater treatment plant or similar improvement that benefits and serves a specific, defined area, including land within and without the corporate limits. A connection fee shall not be imposed for any municipal improvement which provides a general benefit to the city as a whole. 
2.  How Calculated. When the specific municipal improvement is completed, the council shall hold a public hearing to specially assess the benefits to the defined area within the corporate limits, utilizing the procedures under Section 66.0703, Wis. Stats., and this municipal code. Cost of the portion of the specific improvement which benefits area outside the corporate limits and remains after the portion of the specific municipal improvement has been specially assessed within corporate limits shall comprise the base figure upon which the connection fee is calculated. The utility advisory board and the city engineer shall then establish a defined area outside the corporate limits which will be benefitted by the specific municipal improvement. The council shall then approve a per unit connection fee which will spread the cost of the base figure over the defined area outside the corporate limits, to be reimbursed to the city on a per unit basis at such time as the property annexes to the city and actual use begins. The per unit connection charge shall be calculated based upon the projected number of units which will be erected or constructed in the defined area outside of the corporate limits. A "unit" is defined as a household containing the U.S. average number of persons per residential family. A commercial unit hooking up shall pay a connection fee based upon its actual average water usage as that usage compares to the usage of a residential unit. As an alternative to a per unit connection fee, the connection fee may be calculated on a per acre basis. 
3.  When Imposed. The council shall approve all per unit or acreage connection charges established under this section by resolution filed with the clerk. Prior to property being annexed and the annexation ordinance being adopted, the clerk shall cause to be mailed to all property owners within the territory to be annexed a copy of the per unit connection charges that will be imposed if actual users connect to the specific improvement. Any connection fees imposed by this section shall be included in any annexation ordinance adopted by the council.

A.  Every owner of land abutting any street in the city shall, upon written notice by the city prior to installation of permanent type surface, make application for service to the utility and provide at his or her own expense a connection from the sanitary sewer and water mains to the lot line of each platted lot. On unplatted and undeveloped building sites, one complete service shall be installed for every seventy-five (75) feet of frontage in residential areas. Failure to apply for a permit and install such facility within sixty (60) days after written notice from the city shall empower the city to install the facilities and charge the cost to the property owner, with interest at the rate allowed by law, as a special assessment. 
B.  No plans for installation of sanitary sewer or water mains in any street shall be approved unless they include provision for connection of sanitary sewer and water laterals to each abutting property site. 
C.  No building permit shall be issued for any site hereafter platted or for any unplatted site unless this section has been complied with and the laterals installed in compliance herewith. 
D.  After November 26, 1973, except for emergencies, no permanently surfaced street shall be broken or cut into without first obtaining the written permission from the city engineer. It is declared to be the policy of the city not to permit such cutting into streets in good surface condition without substantial need therefor being shown. 
E.  The city engineer shall require, when such a permit is granted, that the party requesting such permission completely repair the street at his or her own expense in compliance with city specifications for this purpose and be held responsible for such repairs for two years following the date of acceptance. If there is any failure on the part of the permittee to accomplish such repairs within thirty (30) days' notice from the city, the city shall be empowered to complete the repairs and charge the cost back to the property owner, with interest as specified by law, as a special assessment. 
(Prior code § 13.12) 
13.04.070 - Establishment of water and sewer utility service area. 
A.  Area Defined. Water and sewer utilities shall only be supplied to the property located within the established corporate limits of the city. There shall be no public water and sewer utility service supplied to unincorporated areas or property except upon annexation of the area of property and payment of associated costs by the owner of the unincorporated area or property as provided for in Section 3.16.020 of this municipal code. 
B.  Exception. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the city may provide limited public water and sewer utility service to an unincorporated area without annexation upon the showing of exceptional benefit and need to the city and in accordance with the positive recommendation of city professional staff, the master plan of the city and the general health, safety and welfare of the general public. Among the findings made under this subsection must be a finding that such service to the unincorporated area will be of no or minimal cost to the city. 
(Prior code § 13.16) 
13.04.080 - Engineering standards for utility construction to be enforced. 
    This section shall incorporate by reference such engineering standards as are from time to time adopted, modified, or revised by the city engineer and placed into effect by it for use in conjunction with water and sanitary sewer utilities in subdivisions and in development or redevelopment of commercial and industrial properties in the city. A copy of the current standards shall be maintained at all times in the office of the city engineer. All construction of water and sanitary sewer facilities shall comply with these standards.

Chapter 13.16 - CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-05 , § 1, adopted June 10, 2014, amended Chapter 13.16, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Chapter 13.16, §§ 13.16.010-13.16.070, pertained to similar material, and derived from prior code § 13.15. 

13.16.010 - Definitions. 
    "Backflow" means the undesirable flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases or other substances under positive or reduced pressure into the municipal water utility distribution pipes of the potable supply of water from any source. 
    "Backflow preventer" means a device or means designed to prevent backflow caused by backpressure or back-siphonage; most commonly categorized as air gap, reduced pressure principle backflow preventer, double check valve assembly, pressure vacuum breaker, atmospheric vacuum breaker, hose connection vacuum breaker, hose connection backflow preventer, backflow preventer with intermediate atmospheric vent, and barometric loop. 
    "Backpressure" means an elevation of pressure in the downstream piping system (i.e., pump, elevation of piping, or steam and/or air pressure) above the utility supply pressure, which would cause or tend to cause a reversal of the normal direction of flow. 
    "Back-siphonage" means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of the utility's potable water supply system from any source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the utility's potable water supply system. 
    "Cross-connection" means any physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the city water system and, the other, water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety or steam, gases or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two systems. 
( Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 6-10-14 ) 
13.16.020 - Cross-connection prohibited. 
    No person, firm, or corporation may establish or permit to be established or maintain or permit to be maintained any unprotected cross-connection. Cross-connections shall be protected as required in Chapter SPS 382, Wis. Adm. Code. 
( Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 6-10-14 ) 
13.16.030 - Inspections. 
    The municipal water utility shall cause inspections to be made of all properties served by the public water system where cross-connections with the public water system is deemed possible. Residential properties serviced by the utility shall be inspected on a 10-year interval; such inspections shall be conducted by the utility. All non-residential properties serviced by the utility shall be inspected on a two-year interval following an initial five-year inspection period, or as deemed appropriate by the utility and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
    The utility shall conduct/perform all first-time cross-connection survey/inspections of non-residential properties as a utility expense. Subsequent inspections of non-residential properties are the responsibility of the property owner or business, at their sole expense. The utility will retain a recognized and experienced firm in the area of cross-connection control and backflow prevention to make inspection services available to property owners or businesses in the city. 
    The frequency of required inspections and re-inspections, based on potential health hazards involved, may be shortened by the utility. The utility shall, at its sole discretion, charge property owners for direct and necessary utility costs for on-premises follow-up visits involving re-inspections and/or matters addressing customer non-compliance. 
( Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 6-10-14 ) 
13.16.040 - Reasonable entry. 
    Upon presentation of credentials, the representative of the municipal water utility shall have the right to request entry at any reasonable time to examine any property serviced by a connection to the public water system of the city for cross-connections. If entry is refused, the representative shall obtain a special inspection warrant under Section 66.0119, Wis. Stats. On request, the owner, lessee or occupant of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such property. Refusing entry or refusing to provide requested information shall be sufficient cause for the water utility to discontinue water service to the property, as provided under Section 13.16.050. 
( Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 6-10-14 ) 
13.16.050 - Discontinuance of service. 
    The municipal water utility is authorized and directed to discontinue water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of this chapter exists and to take the other precautionary measures deemed necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water system. Water service shall be discontinued only after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68, Wis. Stats., except as provided in Section 13.16.060. Water service to such property shall not be restored until the unprotected cross-connection has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
13.16.060 - Emergency powers. 
    If it is determined by the municipal water utility that an unprotected cross-connection or an emergency endangers public health, safety or welfare and requires immediate action and a written finding to that effect is filed with the city clerk and delivered to the customer's premises, service may be immediately discontinued. The customer shall have an opportunity for hearing under Chapter 68, Wis. Stats., within ten days of the emergency discontinuance. Water service to such property shall not be restored until the unprotected cross-connection has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
( Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 6-10-14 ) 
13.16.070 - Owner responsibility. 
    The property owner shall be responsible for the elimination of or protection from all cross-connections on their premises. The owner shall, at their expense, have installed, maintained, and tested any and all backflow preventers on their premises in compliance with Wis. Adm. Codes NR 810 and SPS 382. The property owner shall have corrected any malfunction, revealed by periodic testing, of any backflow preventer on their premises. The property owner shall inform the utility of any proposed or modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections that are not protected by an approved backflow prevention device. The property owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the by-pass. Property owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the backflow prevention device must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place. In the event the property owner installs plumbing upstream of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own approved backflow preventer. The property owner is required to follow the protection practices described in the American Water Works Association publication AWWA M14 titled "Recommended Practice for Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control," unless the utility requires or authorizes other means of protecting the public water system. These requirements or authorizations will be at the discretion of the utility. 
( Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 6-10-14 ) 
13.16.080 - Additional protection. 
    In the case of premises having (a) internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled, or (b) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line. In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a manner that, in the opinion of the utility, could create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow preventer. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, hospitals, mortuaries, plating plants, and car wash establishments. In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the utility, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of toxic substances, the utility may require an approved air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the utility. 
( Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 6-10-14 ) 
13.16.090 - Wisconsin Administrative Codes adopted. 
    Wis. Adm. Code SPS 382 is hereby adopted, except any penalty provisions therein. Wis. Adm. Code NR 810 is hereby adopted. 
( Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 6-10-14 ) 
13.16.100 - Supplementary effect. 
    This chapter does not supersede the state of Wisconsin Plumbing Code, SPS 381 - 387, and Chapter 15.08 of this municipal code, but is supplementary to them.

Chapter 13.20 - WATER WELLS 

13.20.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to prevent contamination of groundwater and to protect public health, safety and welfare by assuring that unused, unsafe or noncomplying wells; wells which may serve as conduits for groundwater contamination; or wells which may be illegally cross connected to the municipal system are properly abandoned. 
(Ord. 2001-11 § 21(part): prior code § 13.17(1)) 
13.20.020 - Applicability. 
A.  All private wells within the corporate limits of the city shall be abandoned in accordance with this chapter by June 30, 2003, or if not abandoned by said date, upon ninety (90) day notice to abandon or upon connection to the municipal system, whichever of the last two events occurs first, unless a well operation permit has been granted pursuant to Section 13.20.030. 
B.  Premises where municipal water service is not available are required to obtain a well operation permit. For purposes of this section, water service is deemed to be available when a main has been extended to a point adjacent to the premises in question and notice thereof has been provided to its owner. 
C.  If water from a private well is known to produce water which exceeds a Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) health advisory, a primary standard in Ch. NR. 809, or an enforcement standard in Ch. NR 140, Wis. Adm. Code, a well operation permit shall not be issued without approval of the Department of Natural Resources.

( Ord. No. 2013-10, § 1, 12-10-2013 ) 
13.20.030 - Well operation permits. 
    A permit may be granted to a well owner to operate a private well for a period not to exceed five years, only in cases where municipal water is not yet available or service constraints exist. A waiver must be requested from the utility to obtain this permit. At the end of a permit period, the well owner may apply for a renewal or a permit upon submittal of updated information necessary for a permit application. The city may conduct inspections or have water quality tests conducted at the applicant's expense to obtain or verify information necessary for consideration of a permit. Permit applications shall be made on forms provided by the utility office. The following requirements must be met before a well operation permit is issued. 
A.  The well has a functional pumping system and its use can be justified in addition to or in lieu of water provided by the public water system. 
B.  The well has a history of producing bacteriological safe water and presently produces bacteriological safe water as demonstrated by providing a copy of the results of a water sample analyzed at a state certified laboratory within three months preceding the request for the well operation permit or permit renewal. 
C.  The well and pump installation meets the requirements of Ch. NR. 812, Wis. Adm. Code, as certified by a Department of Natural Resources' licensed well driller or pump installer or by Department of Natural Resources staff evaluation, no less than every ten (10) years. 
D.  No physical connection exists between the piping of the public water system and the private well. 
E.  A fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) is paid to the city for processing a permit. 
(Ord. 2004-14 (part); Ord. 2001-11 § 21(part): prior code § 13.17(3)) 
( Ord. No. 2013-10, § 1, 12-10-2013 ) 
13.20.040 - Abandonment methods. 
    Wells shall be abandoned according to the procedures outlined in Ch. NR 812, Wis. Adm. Code. The pump and piping must be removed and the well checked for obstructions prior to abandonment.

Chapter 13.24 - STORMWATER UTILITY 
Sections: 

13.24.010 - Findings and necessity. 
    The city finds that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharge within and beyond the Kinnickinnic River, classified an outstanding water resource, is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the city, its citizens and businesses and others in the surrounding area. Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the city by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow in the sanitary sewer. In addition, surface water runoff may create erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences with water damage and create sedimentation and other environmental damage in the Kinnickinnic River. Those elements of the system which provide for the collection of and disposal of stormwater and regulation of groundwater are of benefit and provide services to all property within the city, including property not presently served by the storm elements of the system. The cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extension thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the benefits enjoyed and services received therefrom. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the common council is exercising its authority to establish a stormwater utility and set the rates for stormwater management services. The city is acting under the authority of Chapters 62 and 66 of the Wisconsin Statutes, and particularly at least the following statutes: Sections 62.04, 62.11, 62.16(2), 62.18, 66.0621, 66.0809 and 66.0821. 
(Amended during Supplement #1; Ord. 1997-19(part)) 
13.24.020 - Establishment. 
    There is established a city stormwater utility. The operation of the stormwater utility shall be under the supervision of the common council. The city engineer or designee will be in charge of the stormwater utility. 
(Ord. 1997-19 (part)) 
13.24.030 - Authority. 
    The city, through the stormwater utility, may acquire, construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage and finance such facilities as are deemed by the city to be proper and reasonably necessary for a system of storm and surface water management. These facilities may include, without limitation by enumeration, surface and underground drainage facilities, sewers, watercourses, retaining walls and ponds and other facilities as will support a stormwater management system. 
(Ord. 1997-19 (part)) 
13.24.040 - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply: words used in the singular shall include the plural, and the plural, the singular; words used in the present tense shall include the future tense; the word "shall" is mandatory and not discretionary; the word "may" is permissive. Words not defined herein shall be construed to have the meaning given by common and ordinary use as defined in the latest edition of Webster's Dictionary. 
    "Director" means the city engineer or designee of the common council. 
    "Equivalent runoff unit (ERU)" means the typical area of single-family homes within the city and on the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
    "Impervious area" or "impervious surface" means a horizontal surface which has been compacted or covered with a layer of material so that it is highly resistant to infiltration by rain water. It includes, but is not limited to, semi-impervious surfaces such as compacted clay, as well as streets, roofs, sidewalks, parking lots and other similar surfaces. 
(Ord. 1997-19 (part)) 
13.24.050 - Rate charges. 
A.  By this chapter, the common council is establishing the rate structure for each lot and parcel within the city for services and facilities provided by the stormwater utility. The actual charges to be imposed, the establishment of formulas for calculations of the charges, the establishment of specific customer classifications and any future changes in those rates, formulas, rate charges and customer classifications, may be made by resolution. All rates established pursuant to this chapter will be fair and reasonable. The current rates will be on file with the city clerk. 
B.  Rate charges shall be used to share the costs of the stormwater utility. These rate charges may include: 
1.  Base Charge (BC). The base charge may be imposed on all property in the city. The base charge will be designed to reflect the fact that all properties benefit from the stormwater management activities of the city and that all property contribute in some way to the stormwater discharge that must be managed by the city. The BC will be designed to collect the administrative costs of the stormwater utility and the portion of capital costs not covered by special assessments. The BC may be based on the size of a parcel of property. 
2.  Equivalent Runoff Unit Charge (ERU). The ERU will be designed on the basis of a typical residential unit of property. Other units of property will be charged multiples of the ERU based on the impervious area contributing to surface water runoff. 
3.  Special Charge (SC). This charge may be imposed on property that is in an area specifically benefitted by a particular stormwater management facility. The SC will be developed to reflect the benefits services in a particular area that may not be appropriate to spread to property throughout the city. The SC will be calculated on an ERU basis. 
C.  The common council may make such other customer classifications as will be likely to provide reasonable and fair distribution of the costs of the stormwater utility. In so doing, the common council may provide credits against certain of the charges set forth above for facilities installed and maintained by the property owner for the purpose of lessening the stormwater flow from that given property. 
D.  The city department of finance is appointed as the collection agency for the city stormwater utility. Bills shall be prepared monthly according to established procedure and sent to the owner or occupant of each premise served in their public utility bill. The department of finance shall allocate the actual cost of billing and collecting. 
E.  The bills for stormwater utility charges shall be mailed to the designated utility bill recipient, but this mailing shall not relieve the owner of the property from liability for rental property in the event payment is not made as required in this chapter. The owner of any property served which is occupied by tenants shall have the right to examine collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether such rates and charges have been paid for such tenants; provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business. 
F.  Stormwater utility charges shall not be payable in installments. If stormwater utility charges remain unpaid after a period of twenty (20) days from the date of utility bill, such bill shall become a delinquent special charge and shall become a lien as provided in Wis. Stats. Section 66.0703(13). The charges shall automatically be extended upon the current or next tax roll as a delinquent tax against the property, and all proceedings in relation to the collection, return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such special charges. Unpaid charges shall be assessed a late fee and interest rate per city policy. 
G.  All delinquent special charges shall be subject to a ten (10) percent penalty in addition to all other charges and prior penalties or interest when the delinquent special charge is extended upon the tax roll. 
(Amended during Supplement #1; Ord. 1997-19 (part))13.24.050 
13.24.060 - New construction. 
A.  The property owner, excluding single family residential properties, shall be responsible for completing the stormwater utility service application form any time a building permit is issued, or a site plan review is conducted. The form shall be provided by the department of community development with each application, exclusive of single family residential, for a building permit or application for site plan review. Failure to submit a completed stormwater utility service application form, or providing false information on said form, shall result in the forfeiture of not less than ten dollars ($10) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200). 
B.  The owner shall also be liable for stormwater charges, under this chapter, for the improvement from the date construction of the improvement began. 
(Ord. 1997-19 (part)) 
13.24.070 - Method of appeal. 
A.  In addition to rights of review provided by Section 66.0821(5), Wis. Stats., to the public service commission, the stormwater utility charge may be appealed as follows: 
1.  A written appeal shall be filed with the city clerk prior to the utility charge due date; or 
2.  Within thirty (30) days of payment, a written challenge to the stormwater charge must be filed with the city clerk on behalf of the customer, specifying all bases for the challenge and the amount of the stormwater charge the customer asserts is appropriate. Failure to file a challenge within thirty (30) days of payment waives all right to later challenge the charge. 
B.  A review committee shall be formed consisting of: No. 1, the city engineer; No. 2, a council person appointed by mayor and approved by common council; No. 3, one other person appointed by mayor and approved by common council who shall serve at the pleasure of the common council. Person No. 3 shall have suitable expertise in stormwater management. 
1.  Person No. 1 above shall serve as chair of the review committee. 
2.  The city clerk will coordinate the processing of all appeals and challenges, and schedule the meetings of the review committee to assure that all appeals and challenges are processed within the times established by this chapter. 
3.  The review committee shall meet as needed but no more often than once per month to review appeals and challenges, and make a determination of whether the stormwater charge is fair and reasonable, or whether a refund is due the customer. 
C.  The customer has thirty (30) days from the decision of the review committee to file a written appeal to the common council. 
D.  If the common council or review committee determines that a refund is due the customer, the refund will be applied as a credit on the customer's next quarterly stormwater billing, if the refund will not exceed the customer's next quarterly stormwater billing, or will be refunded at the discretion of the director of finance. 
(Ord. 2004-04 § 1; Amended during Supplement #1; Ord. 1998-8: Ord. 1997-19 (part)) 
13.24.080 - Special assessment authority. 
    In addition to any other method for collection of the charges established pursuant to this chapter for stormwater utility costs, the common council finds that these charges may be levied on property as a special charge pursuant to Section 66.0627, Wis. Stats. The charges established hereunder reasonably reflect the benefits conferred on property and may be assessed as special charges.

14.04.080 - Connection fee for sewer service. 
A.  The basis for the imposition of the sewer connection fees is the study and assessment conducted to establish the amount, implementation schedule and rational basis for imposition of the connection fee for sewer service, which has been summarized in the Comprehensive Sanitary Sewer Study (October 1998) Addendum to Comprehensive Sanitary Sewer Study (August 2000), and Sanitary Sewer Collection System Study (2009), prepared by Ayres and Associates and the Sewer Connection Fee and Water Impact Fee Update (August 2014), prepared by Trilogy Consulting, LLC, which are on file in the office of the city clerk and open to public inspection during normal business hours. 
B.  To place Section 14.04.060 into effect, the city adopts a sewer connection fee schedule, a current copy of which is on file with the city clerk, where it shall be available for public inspection. Upon recommendation of the utility advisory board, the common council reserves the right, from time to time, to amend said schedule by means of a resolution to that effect. 
C.  Connection fee for sewer services for single-family units will be based on residential equivalent meters (five-eighths inch and three-fourths inch meter = one REU). Duplexes and twin homes will pay connection fee for sewer services based on two residential equivalent meters. All other residential buildings, three-plexes or larger, and any other buildings (commercial, industrial, schools, etc.) will pay connection fee for sewer services based on the size of the water meter required. 
D.  A connection fee for sewer service, as set forth in subsection C of this section, is levied against each residential equivalent unit constructed, altered, or improved within the city after the effective date of this section. 
1.  For new construction, each residential equivalent unit constructed or caused to be built by the owner of record shall be subject to the assessment of the connection fee for sewer service. 
2.  For alterations or improvements to an existing residential equivalent unit, where a change in water meter size is requested, the owner of record shall be assessed a connection fee for sewer service equal to the difference between the new water meter size and the existing water meter size on the residential equivalent unit. 
3.  The residential equivalent unit is the unit of measurement for assessment of the connection fee for sewer service regardless of whether or not the proposed land development is residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional in nature.

14.04.090 - Exemptions. 
    The following situations shall be exempted from payment of the connection fee for sewer services as outlined in Section 14.04.080. 
A.  Alterations or expansion of an existing building where no additional or larger meter connections are requested. 
B.  The replacement of a building or structure with a new building or structure of the same size and use where no additional or larger water and/or sewer connections are requested and where the use is not changed. 
C.  A change in water meter size shall not be exempted from payment of the connection fee for sewer service; however, a credit shall be given for the current connection fee for sewer service on the old meter size based on current rates. For example, at the time of an application for a change from a five-eighths inch meter to a one-inch meter, the connection fee for sewer service would equal the current connection fee for sewer service for a one-inch meter less the current connection fee for sewer service for a five-eighths inch meter. 
D.  No connection fee for sewer service shall be required, nor credited, for a change in water meter size that results in a decrease in meter size. 
E.  Any claim for exemption shall be made and filed prior to the time required for payment as provided by Section 14.04.060. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
F.  No connection fee for sewer service shall be imposed in an amount necessary to address existing deficiencies in public facilities. 
G.  Upon city council approval, an exemption from or a reduction in the amount of connection fee for sewer services on land development that provides low-income housing may be made. No amount of an connection fee for sewer service for which an exemption or reduction is provided under this subsection may be shifted to any other development in the land development in which the low-income housing is located or to any other land development in the city.

( Ord. No. 2014-09, § 3, 10-14-2014 ) 
14.08.080 - Impact fees. 
A.  The basis for the imposition of the water impact fees is the study and assessment conducted to establish the amount, implementation schedule and rational basis for imposition of the impact fee, which has been summarized in the Comprehensive Water Study Plan (2007), prepared by Short Elliott Hendrickson Inc. and the Sewer Connection Fee and Water Impact Fee Update (August 2014), prepared by Trilogy Consulting, LLC, both of which are on file in the office of the utility director and open to public inspection during normal business hours. 
B.  To place Section 14.08.060 into effect, the city adopts an impact fee schedule, a copy of which shall be placed on file with the office of the city clerk, where it shall be available for public inspection. Upon recommendation of the utility advisory board, the common council reserves the right, from time to time, to amend said schedule by means of a resolution to that effect. 
C.  Beginning in January 2016, the fees adopted pursuant to this section will be adjusted for inflation on an annual basis. This adjustment will apply to all fees in the schedule and will be based on the year-to-year change in the Midwest Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) during the previous twelve (12) months. 
D.  Single-family units will be assessed one residential equivalent meter (five-eighths inches and three-quarters inches meter equals one REU). Duplexes and twin homes will pay impact fees based on two residential equivalent meters. All other residential buildings, three-plexes or larger, and any other buildings (commercial, industrial, schools, etc.) will pay impact fees based on the size of the water meter(s) required. Irrigation meters greater than one inch will pay impact fees based on the size of the water meter(s) required. 
E.  An impact fee, as set forth in subsection D of this section, is levied against each residential equivalent unit constructed, altered, or improved within the city after the effective date of this section. 
1.  For new construction, each residential equivalent unit constructed or caused to be built by the owner of record shall be subject to the assessment of the impact fee. 
2.  For alterations or improvements to an existing residential equivalent unit, where a change in water meter size is requested, the owner of record shall be assessed an impact fee equal to the difference between the new water meter size and the existing water meter size on the residential equivalent unit. 
3.  The residential equivalent unit is the unit of measurement for assessment of the impact fee regardless of whether or not the proposed land development is residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional in nature. 
F.  These impact fees shall be collected until the capital costs associated with the projects specified in the report on impact fees have been incurred and satisfied unless such time period exceeds the limitations prescribed in Section 14.08.040(B).

    The following situations shall be exempted from payment of the impact fees as outlined in Section 14.08.080. 
A.  Alterations or expansion of an existing building where no additional or larger water meter connections are requested. 
B.  The replacement of a building or structure with a new building or structure of the same size and use where no additional or larger water and/or sewer connections are requested and where the use is not changed. 
C.  A change in water meter size shall not be exempted from payment of the impact fee; however, a credit shall be given for the current impact fee on the old meter size based on current rates. For example, at the time of an application for a change from a five-eighths inches meter to a one inch meter, the impact fee would equal the current impact fee for a one inch meter less the current impact fee for a five-eighths inches meter. 
D.  No impact fee shall be required, nor credited, for a change in water meter size that results in a decrease in meter size. 
E.  Any claim for exemption shall be made and filed prior to the time required for payment as provided by Section 14.08.060. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
F.  No impact fee shall be imposed in an amount necessary to address existing deficiencies in public facilities. 
G.  Upon city council approval, an exemption from or a reduction in the amount of impact fees on land development that provides low-cost housing may be made. As set forth in Section 66.0617(7), Wisconsin Statutes, no amount of an impact fee for which an exemption or reduction is provided under this subsection may be shifted to any other development in the land development in which the low-cost housing is located or to any other land development in the city.

J.  Violation. Each day that a building, which has been moved in violation of this chapter, remains on any site other than its original site, shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter.

A sketch of the proposed subdivision drawn on a topographic survey map shall be submitted. The subdivider shall also submit a location map showing the relationship of the proposed subdivision to traffic arteries and existing community facilities. Nothing in this section shall be construed as an assumption of liability by the plan commission or its staff as to the legality or form requirements of the proposed preliminary plat, nor be construed as preventing the plan commission from rejecting a preliminary plat merely because the plan commission or its staff made suggestions or gave advice with reference to it. 
B.  Preliminary Plat. 
1.  The subdivider shall submit to the plan commission and to those agencies having the authority to object to plats under the provisions of Ch. 236, Wis. Stats., a preliminary plat (six copies) based upon an accurate exterior boundary survey by a registered land surveyor which shows clearly the proposed subdivision at a scale of not more than one inch per one hundred (100) feet having two feet contour intervals. A sketch or preliminary layout shall be included for all land contiguous of the same owner so the plat may be reviewed as a portion of a total development. A plat shall be considered submitted when it is considered by the plan commission at the first meeting at which the plat is a scheduled agenda item. 
2.  A preliminary plat shall not be acceptable for review purposes unless all of the following information is clearly indicated: 
a.  Description. 
i.  Name of the proposed subdivision; 
ii.  Name, address of the owner, subdivider, engineer, land surveyor or land planner; 
iii.  Date, graphic scale and north point; 
iv.  Location of the proposed subdivision by quarter section, township, range and county and a location map showing the relationship between the plan and its surrounding area. 
b.  Existing Conditions. 
i.  Contours at vertical intervals of not more than two feet; 
ii.  A scaled drawing of the exterior boundaries of the proposed subdivision referenced to a corner established by the U. S. Public Land Survey and the total acreage encompassed thereby;

v.  Water elevations of adjoining lakes or streams at the date of survey, regional flood elevation data and where determined, high and low water elevations; 
vi.  Location and size of any existing sanitary and storm sewers, culverts or drain pipes and the location and size of any existing water, electric and gas service on or adjacent to the proposed subdivision; 
vii.  Location and names of adjacent subdivisions, parks and cemeteries; 
viii.  Existing land use and zoning included within or adjacent to the proposed subdivision. 
b.  Proposed Conditions. 
i.  Location, width and name of all proposed streets and walkways; 
ii.  Layout and scale dimensions of all lots and proposed lot and block numbers; 
iii.  Draft of proposed protective covenants, if any, to be imposed; 
iv.  Location and approximate dimensions of any sites to be reserved or dedicated for parks, playgrounds, greenways or other public uses; 
v.  Location and size of proposed utilities, including sanitary and storm sewer, water, electric and gas service, plus other required utilities and appropriate easements with widths indicated. 
3.  After review of the preliminary plat and negotiations with the subdivider on changes recommended and the kind and extent of public improvements which will be required, the plan commission shall approve, approve conditionally or reject in writing the preliminary plat within ninety (90) days (effective 11-1-80) after it has been submitted as defined above, unless the time is mutually extended. 
4.  Approval of the preliminary plat shall entitle the subdivider to final approval of the layout as it pertains to lots, streets and other dedicated, lands shown by such plat, provided that the final plat conforms substantially to such layout and all conditions of approval have been met. 
C.  Final Plat. 
1.  Final plats shall be submitted to the plan commission within twenty-four (24) months of preliminary plat acceptance. The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved and to the requirements of all applicable ordinances and state laws and shall be submitted for certification of those agencies having the authority to object to the plat as provided by Section 236.12, Wis. Stats. The final plat shall be accompanied by detailed construction plans of all improvements. The final plat shall be submitted to the plan commission at a regular meeting and shall be accepted or rejected by the plan commission and the city council within sixty (60) days of its submission unless the time is extended by an agreement with the subdivider. Reasons for rejection shall be stated in the minutes of the council meeting and a copy thereof or written statement of such reasons shall be given to the subdivider. Approved final plats shall be recorded in accordance with the statutory requirements prior to the time that lots are offered for sale, reference is made to the map for sale purposes or use is made of lot and block numbers shown on the plat. A reproducible mylar shall be submitted to the city after all approvals and filings have been completed. 
2.  If the original of the final plat has been filed with another approving authority, the subdivider may file a true copy of such plat in lieu of the original. However, before approval of the plan commission and the city council shall be inscribed on the original of the final plat, the surveyor and subdivider shall certify the respects in which the original of the final plat differs from the true copy and all modifications shall first be approved. 
D.  Approval. All approvals shall be in writing and a copy attached to the final plat.

1.  Preliminary Plat. At the time of the filing of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall pay to the city clerk a fee plus a per lot fee for each lot in the proposed subdivision. A reapplication fee shall be paid to the clerk at the time of filing of a preliminary plat which has previously been reviewed. The fees will be set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
2.  Final Plat. At the time of the filing of the final plat, the subdivider shall pay to the clerk a fee plus a per lot fee for each lot in the proposed subdivision. A reapplication fee shall be paid to the clerk at the time of filing of a final plat which has previously been reviewed. The fees will be set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
3.  Certified Survey Map. At the time of the filing of the certified survey map, the subdivider shall pay to the clerk a fee. The fee will be set from time to time by resolution of the city council.

Chapter 16.10 - EXTRATERRITORIAL SUBDIVISIONS 
Sections: 

16.10.001 - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter shall be to govern the subdivision of lands lying within the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction of the city in adjoining towns as determined pursuant to Sections 236.02(5) and 236.10(1)(b)2., Wis. Stats. Underlying the regulations is the need of the city to deal with the effects of growth upon the city and its potential need to provide for or to extend its provision of services and infrastructure to anticipated subdivisions and land developments. Also underlying the regulations is the city's need to finance the installation, construction, and operational costs of services and infrastructure related to development thereof upon the planning for and efficient delivery of public improvements in the city and, as annexations occur, in areas now adjoining the city. A further basis for this chapter is the need to deal with the rapid growth in impervious surfaces resulting from development, the environmental impacts of development adjacent to the Kinnickinnic River and upon the bluffs surrounding the city and the corresponding problems of dealing with presently uncontrolled residential, commercial, and industrial development of lands in adjoining towns which, in the future, may require the extension of city services or may result in requests for annexation to the city, resulting in haphazard or unplanned or under planned streets, sewage disposal and water system extensions and other infrastructure related problems. In addition, unplanned or uncontrolled subdivision of lands and their development outside of the city limits may in the future restrict planned growth of the city, impacting upon the need for and location of parks, schools and other governmental structures and services. This chapter and its regulation of extraterritorial land subdivisions is further designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to that end shall be used as a means of lessening congestion in the streets and highways; to further the orderly layout and use of land; to insure the use of proper legal descriptions and monumenting of land subdivisions; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to promote development of land which is harmonious to the use of adjoining land; to prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water, sewage, storm water drainage, schools, parks and parkways, playgrounds and other public requirements; and to facilitate the resubdivision of larger tracts into smaller parcels of land. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part))

    It is recognized in this chapter that to the extent that streams regulated under Chapter 15.24 of this code flow through the subdivision area, they constitute unique natural features, which require both protection from building encroachments as well as aesthetic protection to maintain their status as unique natural features. To this effect, it is deemed by the city that no principal or accessory structures shall be constructed at any location in relationship to the ordinary high water mark of any such regulated stream which is in conflict with the provisions of Chapter 15.24 of the city code, incorporated herein by reference under Section 16.10.115.

B.  Preexisting Lots. Lots which have been legally created and which exist as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and which are less than thirty-five (35) acres in gross size shall be recognized as preexisting, nonconforming lots and may be used in accord with applicable regulations. However, from a subdivision control standpoint, the following regulations concerning such lots shall apply: 
1.  No preexisting nonconforming lot shall be further subdivided. 
2.  Subject to complete compliance with all other provisions of this chapter, preexisting nonconforming lots may be enlarged. However, this allowance shall be subject to the following limitation. In the process of enlarging a preexisting nonconforming lot, land may not be taken from an adjoining lot or parcel as a result of which the adjoining lot or parcel is reduced to less than thirty-five (35) acres in gross area, except in cases involving lot line adjustments which do not create new lots or building sites, or which render either lot or parcel to become more nonconforming than it was prior to the enlargement of the adjoining lot. 
C.  Lands Annexed to City. Land that adjoins the city limits, for which a petition for annexation has been filed and approved by the common council, subject to terms and conditions of an applicable annexation agreement, may be exempted from the lot size restrictions imposed under subsection A of this section, subject to the remaining criteria of this chapter. 
D.  Farm Related Land Subdivision Exemption. The subdivision of a parcel of land from a farm, which is controlled by Section 16.10.160(B), shall be exempt from the minimum lot size requirement of subsection A of this section.

16.10.135 - Subdivision of existing substandard parcels permissible subject to conditions. 
A.  A pre-existing parcel of real estate which was not created as a lot in a plat or certified survey map division of land and which was of record prior to the effective date of Chapter 16.10 and which is smaller than thirty-five (35) acres in size or which after division in accord with this section will result in the creation of one lot or parcel which shall be less than thirty-five (35) acres in size may be legally divided, subject to the following limitations: 
1.  The pre-existing parcel must already be occupied by an existing residential dwelling. 
2.  The purpose of the division must be to split off from the remainder of the pre-existing parcel containing the existing residential dwelling.

In accord with subsection (B)(3), below, no building permit or other permission shall be granted to the owner or his or her successor or successors in interest to erect or build a principal structure upon that portion of the pre-existing parcel which does not at the time of such division contain a principal structure. If such a permit is applied for to the town in which the parcel is situated, the city may bring an action in injunctive relief to enforce the covenant required under subsection (B)(3), below. 
B.  Divisions of pre-existing lots or parcels for the purpose of creating a lot containing an existing residential dwelling under this section shall be subject to the following standards. 
1.  The resulting lot or parcel containing the existing house shall be no less than two acres in size, nor more than five acres in size. 
2.  The lot or parcel containing the existing house shall be configured in such a manner as to promote, rather than to hinder, open space use of the remainder of the pre-existing lot or parcel as well as to meet the purpose and intent of this chapter in controlling the subdivision of land. 
3.  The owner of the pre-existing lot or parcel shall record a covenant against the title to that portion of the pre-existing lot or parcel which does not contain the existing residential dwelling, which covenant shall prohibit any further subdivision of that lot or parcel as well as prohibit the erection or building thereupon of any type of principal structure except in full compliance with Section 16.10.130 and other applicable ordinances of the city. The city attorney for purposes of compliance with this section shall approve each such covenant. 
4.  The division of a pre-existing lot or parcel shall conform to all other applicable provisions of this chapter. 
C.  A pre-existing lot which was created by a division of land which was of record prior to the effective date of Chapter 16.10, and with a land use designation of Very Low Infill (VLI) as mapped on the City of River Falls Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map may be divided under this chapter to lots whose sizes are authorized in Section 17.108, City of River Falls Municipal Code Extraterritorial Zoning. This type of land division shall be exempt from the requirements under subsection A, above. The utility director and the planning director shall approve of the creation of new lots in accord with a cost of service study and the standards under Section 16.10.200, subject to the appeal of the planning commission and city council. 
D.  Prior to recording a division of a pre-existing lot or parcel in accord with this section, the owner shall meet with the plan director who shall grant permission to the proposed subdivision, subject to the standards under subsection B of this section, if it is in accord with this section. Such authorization may be conditioned upon the owner making changes in his or her proposed division so as to fulfill the objectives of subsection (B)(2) of this section. No division that fails to meet the criteria of this section shall be allowed, in which event the requirements of Section 16.10.130 shall be applied.

16.10.160 - Subdivision of agricultural lands. 
A.  Notwithstanding Section 16.10.130, above, approval for the subdivision of agricultural land shall not be granted even for the creation of a thirty-five (35) acre parcel if it is determined in the course of the review process that to authorize such a subdivision will be detrimental to the continued agricultural use of all or any portion of the tract or parcel sought to be subdivided. In making this determination, the city shall take into consideration applicable town or county zoning which has placed the land in question into an exclusive agricultural district as well as the question of whether such a subdivision would violate any transfer of development rights instruments recorded against and pertaining to the same. The latter limitation on subdivision approval shall not apply if the development restrictions imposed against the land in question have been legally released. 
B.  As a complete exception to the limitations imposed under subsection A of this section, the owner of agricultural lands, who also resides upon said land, may seek to legally divide from an agricultural tract of land, a lot not less than two acres in size for the purpose of accommodating the construction and use of a principal structure for residential use by a person who is employed on the farm which is maintained on the remainder of the parcel to be so divided and who earns a substantial part of his or her livelihood from work on the farm. In addition, such a lot may be created for the parents or a child or children of the operator of the farm from which such lot is to be created. For purposes of this subsection, "substantial part of his or her livelihood from work on the farm" shall be defined to mean at least fifty (50) percent of the individual's annual gross income from his or her labor.

A.  It is compatible with adjacent land uses and shall maintain the general land use pattern of the area in question. 
B.  It will result in a development pattern that is compatible with surrounding developments and land uses. Measures of compatibility shall include lot sizes, traffic generation, access, noise and visual features. 
C.  The proposed subdivision and resulting development shall not adversely affect the city's ability to provide public services, install public improvements or accomplish future annexations. 
D.  The proposed subdivision complies with one or more of the following: 
1.  It represents infilling of vacant land. Infilling is defined as a subdivision of vacant land which will accommodate the development of vacant land located such that surrounding land uses render the land impractical for anything other than uses similar to those proposed to be made of it after subdivision. 
2.  The proposed subdivision shall provide permanent open space lands for use by the general public in conformity with the comprehensive plan and other city ordinances, if applicable. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part))

Trans 233 at Section Trans 233.01 as forming the basis upon which it is determined that regulating the development of land adjoining designated major streets and highways is deemed to be a subject of concern for the city, which concern shall be taken into consideration in the process of approving or rejecting proposed subdivisions of tracts of land, as well as the construction thereupon of improvements. 
B.  No person may erect or construct any structure or improvement upon any land which is subdivided under the terms of this chapter which is within one hundred ten (110) feet of the centerline of a street or highway designated in subsection C of this section, or within fifty (50) feet of the right-of-way line thereof, whichever is further from the centerline of the street or highway. If any portion of a service road right-of-way lies within the setback area described above, the setback shall be increased by the lesser of the following: 
1.  The width of the service road right-of-way, if the entire service road right-of-way lies within the setback area. 
2.  The distance by which the service road right-of-way lies within the setback area, if the entire service road right-of-way does not lie within the setback area. 
C.  The streets and highways subject to this section shall be those which are designated on the city map as principal arterials, minor arterials, and collector streets, designated in accord with the definitions of streets set forth at Section 16.04.020. Incorporated in this chapter is a map identifying these streets in the subdivision area. 
D.  The restriction in subsection B of this section, against the erection or construction of structures or improvements in the described setback zone shall not apply to public utility transmission lines, whether above or below the surface of the ground. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.190 - Procedure for platting divisions of land. 
A.  All persons desiring to subdivide land in the subdivision area by means of a plat may submit a preliminary map or plan of the proposed division to the city plan director. The city plan director shall within a reasonable time from the date of submission of the same either provide the proposed subdivider with an analysis of the proposed land division or shall call for a conference to be held with the subdivider, the purpose of which shall be to discuss applicable standards and the demonstration on the face of the proposed plat or map of its compliance or noncompliance therewith. This step does not require formal application or the filing of a preliminary plat but is intended to inform the proposed subdivider of the objectives of the city regulations and those set forth in the comprehensive plan and the city map to assist the subdivider in planning the development in question and to informally attempt to arrive at mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the subdivision and land development in question. 
B.  Submittal of both preliminary plats and final plats shall conform to the requirements of Chapter 16.08, which shall control. The time periods to which approvals, conditional approvals or rejections of preliminary or final plats are subjected shall not commence until the date of the initial meeting of the plan commission at which the preliminary or final plat is on the agenda for consideration by the said commission. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.200 - Certified survey map divisions of land. 
A.  Subject to the limitations on the availability of a certified survey map for use in the division of land as is set forth at Section 236.34(1), Wis. Stats., a certified survey map may be used in lieu of a final plat if it meets with all requirements of Section 236.34, Wis. Stats., this chapter, Section 16.04.040 and all other applicable ordinances. Unless waived by the city plan director, a preliminary map shall be submitted to the city prior to the filing of a proposed certified survey map of a land division and the city plan director shall comply with the recommendations of the city engineer and the River Falls municipal utilities and may require of the proposed subdivider that sketches or other information be submitted for a determination of whether or not the objectives of this chapter can be achieved by means of the proposed certified survey map. 
B.  The subdivider shall file nineteen (19) copies of each proposed certified survey map with the city plan director together with a written application for approval on a form devised for that purpose by the city. The application shall contain the complete legal description of the land in question and shall certify that all of the owners of the property contained within the proposed map join in the submittal. A preliminary review shall be made of the proposed land division for confirmation of ownership, encumbrances, easements, rights-of-way, leases, unpaid real estate taxes and unpaid special assessments. If necessary, the city plan director shall consult with the city attorney. 
C.  The city plan director shall within ninety (90) days of submittal of the said certified survey map either approve of it, conditionally approve of it or reject it. The failure of the city plan director to so act within the designated period of time shall constitute a rejection of the proposed certified survey map, subject to the right of the subdivider to request of the plan commission that it review the non-action of the city plan director and approve of the map. 
D.  In the event that the city plan director determines that a proposed certified survey map or plat does not meet the standards of this chapter for approval, or fails to react to it during the designated time period, the subdivider may refer this denial to the plan commission which shall schedule the matter for review at its next regularly scheduled meeting following the receipt by it of a written request for review. If the plan commission refuses to approve of the certified survey map division, it shall furnish the proposed subdivider with the reasons for its action, in writing. Such decision by the plan commission shall be made within a reasonable period of time after it has been heard by it. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.210 - Conditional approval of subdivisions allowed. 
    The city plan director and the plan commission, in the case of reviews of decisions of the city plan director with respect to certified survey maps and plats, shall have the authority, where necessary, to enforce the requirements of this chapter, to impose conditions upon its approval of maps or plats for recording purposes. Additionally, where deemed an appropriate means of securing compliance with this chapter, the city plan director or plan commission may require the recording of restrictive covenants against the title of the real estate subject to a proposed land division. A further condition of approval shall be the approval of the subdivision in question by all other authorities having the power to approve of or reject the same. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.220 - Design standards. 
    Standards pertaining to the type, method of construction of, materials to be incorporated in or size, length, and dimensions of proposed public improvements to be constructed in proposed subdivision subject to this chapter shall be prescribed by the town in which the land is situated. This limitation does not, however, limit application of the limitations imposed under the official city map, which under Section 62.23(6), Wis. Stats., shall prevail with respect to limitations on construction and enlargement of building impressed with respect to the location and width of streets, highways, historic districts, parkways, parks and playgrounds. However, nothing in this chapter prevents the city plan director or plan commission from recommending the installation of public improvements which go beyond the specifications required of the subdivider by the town in which the subdivision is to be located, nor from the city and the subdivider nor from the city, the town and the developer from entering into a developer's agreement specifying the types of public improvements to be installed as well as designating who shall defray the costs associated therewith. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.230 - Waiver of subdivision approval jurisdiction under certain conditions. 
    The authority of the city to approve of subdivisions may be waived by the city as to land situated outside of the city limits if more than one-half of the legal description of a proposed subdivision lies outside of the designated subdivision area. After receiving a report from the plan commission, at its discretion, the common council may waive the rights of the city to review such a subdivision if it finds it to be in the best interests of the city to do so. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.240 - Interrelationship between Chapter 16.10 and Title 16, generally. 
    Should there be any conflict between provisions set forth in this chapter and those found in the remainder of this title, for purposes of the subject matter of this chapter, the specific provisions found herein shall control. In the event that a topic is not covered in this chapter, the provisions of this title shall control. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.250 - Severance clause. 
    Should any paragraph or section of this chapter be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or unconstitutional, it shall be deemed to be severed from the remainder of this chapter that shall remain in full force and effect as if the offending provision had never been adopted. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.260 - Subdivision boundaries to be governed by modifications to corporate limits of city. 
    In the event that subsequent to the date of adoption of this chapter or any amendment hereto, the city perfects the annexation to itself of additional territory, the city plan director shall place the issue of extension of the boundary of the subdivision area on an agenda of the plan commission for its consideration and recommendation to the common council. 
(Ord. 2007-06 § 9 (part)) 
16.10.270 - Impact of intermunicipal agreements. 
    In the event that in the future, the city and one or more of the four adjoining towns enter into a Section 66.0301 Municipal Cooperation Agreement or a Section 66.0307, Wis. Stats., Cooperative Boundary Agreement, the city agrees that it will duly consider amending this chapter in order to conform it with the terms and conditions set forth in such agreement as pertaining to subdivisions occurring in the town or towns in question.

Sections: 

16.16.010 - General improvements. 
    The following provisions shall apply to the subdivisions platted within the city and shall also apply to subdivisions platted within the extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction of the city. Where extension of utilities and/or annexation is reasonably expected within five years' time as determined by the city council, all improvements shall be required in the extraterritorial area. No improvements are required in the remainder of the extraterritorial area. 
A.  The improvements required under these regulations shall be constructed by the subdivider at his or her expense in accordance with the specifications and under the supervision of the officials having jurisdiction, prior to filing with the plan commission and city council the final plat for final approval; or 
B.  In lieu of construction of the improvements as required in subsection A of this section, the subdivider shall furnish the city clerk with a surety performance bond or other form of surety running to the city sufficient to cover the subdivision cost of such required improvements, as estimated by the city engineers and approved by the city council, thereby to secure the actual construction and installation of such improvements immediately after final approval of the plat or at a time in accordance with the requirements of the council. The bond shall be in such form as approved by the city attorney's office. Prior to either acceptance of the improvement by the city council or release of the subdivider's bond, all improvements shall be inspected by the city engineer and other appropriate city officials and if they are found to be installed according to the plans and specifications and any other requirements herein defined, a written report of such approval by the appropriate city officers shall be given to the city council who may then consider the same in approving the plat or releasing the bond. 
C.  If the procedure under subsection B of this section is followed, the construction of all improvements required by these rules and regulations shall be completed within two years from the date of approval of the final plat by the council unless good cause can be shown for the granting of an extension of time by authority of the council, but the council shall not grant variances to exceed five years from acceptance of the final plat. If no extension is granted, the city, at its option, may cause all uncompleted required work to be constructed and the parties executing the bond shall be firmly bound for payment of all necessary costs thereof. 
D.  The approval of the final plat by the city council shall constitute acceptance of the dedication of any public street, road or highway dedicated in such plat. 
E.  Where unusual or exceptional factors or conditions exist, the city council may modify the provisions of this title. A written statement of the reasons for such modifications shall be attached to all copies of the construction plans. 
F.  If the city council or city engineer make design requirements that are in excess of requirements for the immediate development as determined by the city engineer and approved by the council, the excess cost shall be equally shared by the city and the developer. "Design requirements" shall include size and materials, but not depth or routing. 
G.  The city reserves the right to require independent testing and inspection of any or all improvements installed in a subdivision. This testing and inspection shall be done at the developer's expense and shall be based upon current city construction specifications. 
(Prior code § 18.07(1)) 
( Ord. No. 2016-08 , § 12, 6-14-2016) 
16.16.020 - Improvements.

D.  Utilities. Utilities shall be installed at the expense of the subdivider under the supervision of the city engineer and utility department. Prior to any water or sewer mains being installed, the plans must be submitted to the utility department for review, recommendation and approval. When approving any subdivision under this title, the council shall require the developer, in addition to any other requirements imposed by this title, to extend the service provided by all utilities to the end of the boundary lines of the property that is to be platted, such that such utilities form a complete extension to allow the abutting property of the subdivision to connect to the utility extensions. The payment for such extensions shall be done at the sole expense of the subdivider, by assessing a portion of the cost to abutting, benefitting properties, or some combination thereof as may be contained in a developer's agreement, as each individual case warrants. 
1.  Sanitary Sewer. The developer shall install a public sanitary sewer system adequate to provide the subdivision with a complete sanitary sewer system, including lateral connection initially into each lot and connected in a satisfactory manner to the city sanitary sewer system. Sewer mains shall be installed at sufficient depth to ensure use by the area adjacent to the subdivision installing the main. The design and construction of the sanitary sewer main extension shall conform to the design criteria of the River Falls Engineering Guidelines. 
a.  Minimum size of eight-inch sewer is required for new development. 
b.  If a pumping station is required to pump sanitary wastes, the subdivider shall install at no expense to the city a pumping station and force main approved by the city engineer and utility department adequate to service a subdivision and shall deed such pumping station, force main, equipment and site to the city prior to acceptance of the final plat. 
c.  No subdivision shall receive preliminary approval of sewer facilities installations until inspection by the city engineer and utility department. The developer shall not be relieved of responsibility for any sewer installation before one full year from the date of acceptance. 
2.  Water. The developer shall install a complete water distribution system adequate to serve the area being platted, including laterals into each lot. The system fire flow shall be adequate to meet commercial risk services standards. Further, the design and construction of the water main extension shall conform to the design criteria of the River Falls Engineering Guidelines. Calculations shall be based upon the maximum density of the lots in accordance with commercial risk services. 
a.  Water mains shall be looped wherever possible to ensure proper circulation of water throughout the system. No "dead-ends" shall be permitted if an interconnection can be made. 
b.  Gate valves shall be installed wherever the city engineer or utility representative deems them necessary in order that sectionalizing of the water system can be accomplished in the event of repairs or tie-ins. 
c.  Standard minimum size of eight inches is required for new development. Smaller than eight inches may only be used if approved by the city engineer. 
d.  Water mains and services shall be so installed at seven feet of cover depth below final finished grade to insure no freezing shall occur during the coldest weather experienced by this community. 
e.  Before final acceptance of the installed system by the city, sufficient evidence shall be presented to the city that the system has passed the state required bacteriological test, the state requirements for pressure and leakage tests and the city requirements for electrical continuity testing. The developer shall not be relieved of responsibility for any water main or services installation before one full year from the date of acceptance. 
f.  The developer shall furnish and install all necessary fire hydrants according to specifications established by the city engineer and the utility department. 
g.  All fire hydrants shall be installed with respect to final grade. Operation and maintenance specifications shall be adhered to when fire hydrants are installed. Adjustments of hydrants due to final grade shall be the developer's responsibility. 
h.  The plan commission, upon advice from the fire chief, city engineer, or the utility director, may require the developer to install private fire hydrants where deemed necessary. Such private fire hydrants shall be maintained at the developer's or land owner's expense. Further, such private fire hydrants shall be installed in compliance with all appropriate city specifications. 
3.  Storm Water Drainage. 
a.  A storm water sewer or drainage system adequate to serve the area being platted shall be required. When natural flowage of water from adjacent property passes through such development and it is desirable in the opinion of the city engineer and approved by the council to install a larger pipe than necessary for such development, the excess cost shall be determined and assessed under Section 16.16.010. In a developed area (seventy-five (75) percent platted) where a trunk storm sewer is constructed, the cost shall be borne equitably by the entire drainage area as provided by Section 13.12.050 of this code. 
b.  All storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the rational method, unless otherwise agreed to by the city engineer. 
c.  Inlets shall be provided so that no surface water shall be carried across any intersection. Inlet spacing shall be determined by specifications outlined by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. 
d.  If a pumping station is required to pump storm water, the subdivider shall install, at no expense to the city, a pumping station and force main as recommended by the city engineer and approved by the city council and adequate to service the subdivision and shall deed such pumping station, force main equipment and site to the city prior to acceptance of the final plat. 
e.  When it is determined that storm water runoff from a subdivision may affect downstream drainage areas, the city engineer shall study the effects of such drainage. No subdivision shall be approved where the city engineer and the plan commission determine that downstream drainage problems may result because of any subdivision. 
4.  Electric. Underground electric utilities shall be required in all new developments, unless determined to be impractical by the utility department. Insofar as possible, lots closest to the sources of power, water and sewer shall be developed first.

A.  Whenever a development is created, or when a parcel of land is developed which involves any division of land by minor subdivision herein referred to as a certified survey map (CSM) or subdivision, e.g., a plat regardless of size, the developer shall be required to dedicate for parks, playgrounds and other open space purposes, a parcel of land equal to ten (10) percent of the gross area of all property proposed for subdivision.

This provision shall also apply to all outlots in existence or annexed to the city as of February 14, 1995.

C.  Where a proposed park, playground, recreation or open space area is shown on the official map or master plan of the city to be located in whole or in part within the proposed development, the council shall require the dedication of such area within the development. If the official map or master plan provides for an area in excess of the required amount, the council shall, before it takes final action on the plat, consider the official map or master plan and together with the appropriate boards, determine if it should take the necessary steps to acquire, through purchase, all or part of the park, playground, recreation or open space area as shown on the official map or master plan. 
D.  Where, with respect to a particular development, the dedication of a parcel of land for parks, playground, recreation or open space purposes, does not comply with the official map or the master plan; and as determined by the park board, the plan commission and the council and the dedication of such parcel would not be in the public interest, the city shall require a dedication fee, as established in accordance with state statute. 
1.  Dedication fees shall be established through periodic fee needs assessments as implemented from time to time upon resolutions adopted by the common council. 
2.  Planned unit development with mixed land uses shall make cash payments and/or land contributions in accordance with this section based upon the percentage of land devoted to the various uses. 
3.  Should the city determine that it is in the best interest of the city to require a land dedication that is less than that specified in Section 16.20.010(B), the fair market value of that dedication shall be determined at the time the final plat or certified survey is approved in accordance with the following: 
a.  The city and developer may agree to the fair market value; or 
b.  The fair market value may be based on the current appraisal submitted to the city by the subdivider at the subdivider's expense. The appraisal shall be made by appraisers who are approved members of the SERA or MAI, or equivalent real estate appraisal societies. 
c.  If the city disputes such appraisal the city may, at their own expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser, said appraisal may be deemed conclusive evidence of fair market value of the land. 
E.  If land dedication is not required, or required in part, the face of the final plat shall include a statement that park dedication fees are due and payable by the owner of each lot at the time of building permit issuance. The statement will also include the percentage of dedication fee due, if less than one hundred (100) percent.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. 2009-10, adopted Aug. 25, 2009, repealed and recreated Ch. 17.56 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 17.56 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from § 21.27 of the prior code; and Ord. 2000-22. 

17.56.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of the C district is to protect and preserve valuable natural resources, open space and visual character. Natural resource areas exhibit diversity and balance, including prairie, hillsides, forestland, waters of the state, wetlands, stormwater facilities, and floodplains, and are managed for nature-based recreation and education activities.

17.72.040 - Review process. 
    The process for initiating a PUD request shall be as outlined in this chapter. The PUD review process includes: (1) pre-application conference, (2) application and general development plan (GDP) filing and review, and (3) specific implementation plan (SIP) filing and review. 
A.  Pre-Application Conference. In order to eliminate unnecessary expenditures of time and money, the applicant shall first schedule a pre-application conference with the community development department to discuss the scope and nature of the proposed development. A preliminary sketch and a narrative description shall be submitted to the community development department in advance of the pre-application conference. 
B.  Application and General Development Plan (GDP) Filing. After a general consensus has been reached by the applicant and City staff as to the general conceptual layout of the proposed PUD at the pre-application conference, the applicant may file an application and GDP with the community development department. The application shall be accompanied by a filing fee in in the amount established by resolution, as well as five 24-inch by 36-inch" hard copies and a digital copy of the GDP, the contents of which shall include all items listed in Section 17.72.050. Such application shall be signed by the owner(s) of every property within the boundaries of the proposed PUD. 
C.  General Development Plan (GDP) Review. 
1.  Within forty-five (45) days after the filing the GDP, the plan commission shall hold a public hearing on the GDP and shall forward to the city council a written report recommending that the plan be approved, disapproved or approved with conditions, and giving the reasons for the recommendations. In making its determination, the plan commission shall consider criteria set forth in Section 17.72.070. 
2.  Within thirty (30) days after the plan commission public hearing, the city council will consider the GDP at a regular meeting and will either approve or reject the GDP, or refer the GDP back to the plan commission for further report. If tentative approval is granted subject to conditions, the applicant shall, within forty-five (45) days after receiving a copy of the written resolution of the city council, notify the city council of the acceptance or refusal to accept all of such conditions. Refusal of the applicant shall constitute a denial of the GDP by the city council. Failure of the landowner to notify the city council of his or her acceptance or denial of the conditions to the GDP constitutes acceptance of the conditions. 
3.  Approval of the GDP shall establish the basic right of use for the area but such approval shall be conditional upon further conformity as required in the specific implementation plan. 
D.  Application and Specific Implementation Plan (SIP) Filing. Once a GDP has been approved by city council, the applicant shall file an application and a SIP with the community development department within twelve (12) months of said approval. If a SIP is not submitted within twelve months, the applicant shall be required to resubmit a GDP subject to all requirements of this section. The application shall be accompanied by a filing fee in in the amount established by resolution, as well as five 24-inch by 36-inch hard copies and a digital copy of the SIP, the contents of which shall include all items listed in Section 17.72.060. Such application shall be signed by the owner(s) of every property within the boundaries of the proposed PUD. 
E.  Specific Implementation Plan (SIP) Review. 
1.  If the SIP as submitted is not in substantial compliance with the GDP, the plan commission or its designee shall notify the landowner regarding the aspects of the SIP that are not in compliance. The landowner may: 
a.  Treat such notification as denial of the final approval; 
b.  Refile his or her SIP so that it does comply with the GDP. 
2.  Within forty-five (45) days after the filing of the SIP, the plan commission shall forward to the city council a written report recommending that the plan be approved, disapproved or approved with conditions and giving the reason for the recommendations. 
3.  Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the plan commission report the city council shall refer either approve or reject the SIP, or refer the SIP back to the plan commission for further report. 
4.  If the SIP or any section thereof is given final approval and thereafter the landowner abandons the plan or any section thereof that has been finally approved and notifies the city council in writing; or, if the landowner fails to commence the PUD within eighteen (18) months after final approval has been granted, such final approval shall terminate and be deemed null and void. 
F.  Approval of Plan. Upon approval of the SIP, the following shall be recorded in the county register of deeds office by the landowner within sixty (60) days of approval: 
1.  The building, site and operational plans for the development as approved; 
2.  All other commitments and contractual agreements with the city offered and required with regard to project value, character and other factors pertinent to an assurance that the proposed development will be carried out basically as presented in the SIP. This shall be accomplished prior to the issuance of any building permit. 
G.  Changes or Additions to Plan. Any subsequent change or addition to the SIP shall first be submitted for approval to the plan commission and if in the opinion of the plan commission such change or addition constitutes a substantial alteration of the GDP, the procedure provided in Section 17.72.040(C) shall be required.

A.  Community Benefits. The proposed PUD to be developed shall be beneficial to the City of River Falls as a whole, in addition to the area being proposed for development. For example, the authorized distribution of buildings, streets and open space will permit better site planning and thus benefit both the residents of the PUD and the city as a whole. 
B.  Character and Intensity of Land Use. The proposed uses and the density, intensity, and general layout of the site shall: 
1.  Be compatible with the physical nature of the site; where possible, natural features and trees shall be preserved. 
2.  Create an attractive environment of sustained aesthetic and ecologic desirability, economic stability and functional practicality compatible with the plans for the area as established by the community. 
3.  Not adversely affect the anticipated provision for school or other municipal services. 
4.  Not create traffic or parking demand incompatible with the existing or proposed facilities to serve it. 
5.  Not unduly increase the density of population or intensity of use to the detriment of areas outside the area by restricting access to light and air or by creating traffic congestion. 
6.  Be compatible with existing development surrounding the proposed PUD. 
C.  Economic Feasibility and Impact. Evidence that the PUD would not adversely affect the economic prosperity of the city or the values of surrounding properties. 
D.  Engineering Design Standards. The width of street right-of-way, width and location of street or other paving, outdoor lighting, location of sewer and water lines, provision for storm water drainage or other similar environmental engineering considerations shall be based upon a determination of appropriate standards necessary to implement the specific function in the specific situation. In no case shall standards be less than those necessary to assure the public safety and welfare as determined by the city. 
E.  Preservation and Maintenance of Open Space. Adequate provision shall be made for the permanent preservation and maintenance of common open space by private reservation and that the care and maintenance of such open space reservation shall be assured by establishment of appropriate management organization for the PUD.

( Ord. No. 2018-02 , § 2, 1-23-2018) 
17.73.040 - Design standards. 
A.  Building Siting. The siting of buildings can reduce the perceived density of multifamily residential developments, maximize open space areas, provide "eyes on the street" surveillance, and enhance neighborliness by creating community gathering spaces. 
1.  Developments shall be oriented so that the main facade faces the public street or the development's private street adjoining its site with some degree of setback variation in order to provide visual interest. 
2.  Multifamily units shall be built close to the street setback line with front doors oriented towards the street. 
3.  Floor elevations of units shall be varied to reflect natural topography. 
B.  Parking and Vehicle Access. Siting shall minimize the impact of parking and driveways on the pedestrian environment, adjacent properties, and maximize pedestrian safety. 
1.  Parking shall be dispersed into smaller parking lots located in the side or rear yards, away from the primary pedestrian walkway. 
2.  A landscape peninsula shall be installed to separate each section of ten (10) parking spaces from additional spaces. 
3.  Parking areas shall be separated from each other by dwelling units or by landscaped buffers. 
4.  The number of driveways and curb cuts shall be minimized. 
5.  Parking areas shall be landscaped or screened by a fence or wall from adjacent properties. 
C.  Open Space. Buildings incorporated into multifamily residential developments shall be sited to maximize the opportunities for creating usable, attractive, well-integrated open space. The following site plan elements shall be included. 
1.  Safe and efficient access to open space, whether public or private, for recreation and social activities including, but not limited to tot lots. The design and orientation of these areas shall take advantage of available sunlight and shall be sheltered from the wind, noise, and traffic of adjacent streets. 
2.  Common areas and courtyards conveniently accessible to the majority of units. Private open spaces, where provided, shall be contiguous with the units they serve, with direct access from the unit and adequate screening from public view. 
D.  Pedestrian Circulation. Pedestrian circulation provides safe, efficient access to facilities and dwelling units for residents, encourages opportunities for casual social encounters, and allows natural surveillance by residents. The following pedestrian circulation site plan elements shall be included: 
1.  All site plans shall illustrate designated pedestrian circulation areas. Designated pedestrian circulation areas shall include, but not be limited to, pedestrian walkways/paths, sidewalks, and bench seating areas. 
2.  Cross circulation between vehicles and pedestrians shall be minimized. A continuous, clearly marked walkway shall be provided from the parking areas to main entrances of the buildings. Walkways shall be provided between residences, parking areas, and all site facilities for safe access. 
3.  Walkways shall not be sited directly against a building. A landscaped planting area shall be installed between walkways and building facades. 
4.  Walkways shall be accessible to disabled persons and in conformance with the Americans with Disability Act (ADA). 
E.  Pedestrian Entrances Visible from the Street. Pedestrian entries that are visible from the street make a development more approachable and encourage a sense of association among neighbors. The following pedestrian entrance site plan elements shall be included: 
1.  The dwelling entry shall be a prominent facade feature; 
2.  Clearly identifiable and lighted pedestrian entries to buildings from both the streets and the parking lots shall be provided; 
3.  Clearly marked paths using buildings and landscaping elements shall be installed to enhance building entries that are not on the street. 
F.  Building Design. Building facades shall be broken up to give the appearance of a collection of smaller structures. Each of the units shall be individually recognizable, accomplished through the use of architectural details and design. 
1.  Garage doors shall be offset between adjacent units and recessed beyond the front building face or front porch facade a minimum of four feet or located to the rear or side of the front building face or front porch facade, along with providing a variety of styles as it relates to color, texture and trim. 
2.  Projection eaves and gables shall relate to the building mass and extend a minimum of two feet from the facade while utilizing architectural facade treatments. 
3.  A variety of building heights, color, architectural elements, and styles shall be incorporated as part of the overall building. 
G.  Adjacent Sites. In designing a multifamily residential development, compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood shall be given consideration. Buildings shall relate to adjacent properties by being so situated on their lots to minimize abrupt height, bulk and scale changes and minimize the disruption of privacy and outdoor activities of residents in adjacent buildings. The building's height, bulk and scale shall create a transition from the adjacent existing residential development, rather than form abrupt changes. 
H.  Common Services. Common services for multifamily residential developments shall not be visible from public areas. All mechanical equipment, utility meters, transformers, and stationary trash bins shall be screened from view at the public right-of-way and neighboring properties.

Also, unless such certificates has been granted by the commission, the building inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work. 
2.  The owner of record of any site or structure which previously was designated as historic, or in the case of a historic district, the owner of record of a parcel included therein, may make application for a certificate of appropriateness with the commission, which shall approve the application unless:: 
a.  In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior feature of the improvement or site upon which said work is to be done; 
b.  In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon a historic site, or within a historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or within the district; 
c.  In the case of any property located in a historic district the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration or razing of any structure does not conform to the purpose and intent of this section and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for the district; 
d.  The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its razing would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the city and state;

(Ord. 2003-11 § 1 (part) 
17.77.050 - Design guidelines. 
    The design guidelines have the following functions: 
A.  To guide builders and homeowners wishing to propose expansions, renovations, exterior alterations and replacement of designated residential structures; 
B.  To assist city officials and the public in reviewing development proposals; 
C.  If there is a conflict or inconsistency between design ordinances, the provisions of this chapter shall apply. 
1.  Porches. Preservation and renovation of the existing porch and original dimensions is encouraged especially if the porch faces the street. If necessary, replace in-kind an entire porch or section of porch that is too deteriorated to repair. Replacement should match the original in appearance, shape, texture, detail and dimension. When replacing items such as handrails, balusters, columns, ceiling or flooring boards, every effort should be made to maintain and duplicate the original profiles of these items. Rebuild steps with materials matching the historic precedent as closely as possible. Avoid enclosing porches especially those located in the front unless historically appropriate. 
    All wood on exterior porches, except flooring and stair treads, shall be painted or opaque stained. 
2.  Decks. Decks in the front and side yard shall be consistent with the historic character of the structure and neighborhood. 
3.  Windows. Repair the original structure before entire replacement. Most windows can be repaired or reinforced. If replacement is necessary, replace windows so that they are compatible with the historic character of the structure. If any of the original windows that are compatible with the historic character of the structure has true divided lights, the replacement sash shall duplicate the original window appearance. If windows have been altered in the past, restoration to the original appearance is encouraged. Window openings should not be reduced in size. Vinyl windows or other synthetic materials are not appropriate because they lack the resemblance of historical wood windows. 
    On the sides and rear facades of the structure, new windows in locations where no window previously existed may be approved provided they retain a similar ratio or height to width as original windows on the structure, are the same type of window as others on the structure (e.g. double-hung or casement) and are trimmed and finished to match the appearance of other windows. 
4.  Entrance Doors. If the entrance door is original and compatible with the historic character of the structure, restoration of the original door and its surrounding (including leaded glass or stained glass decorations, or columns and transoms of windows) is encouraged. 
    If determined that the door and its surrounding is beyond repair, replace in-kind an entire entrance. All doors shall be painted, varnished or prefinished. 
5.  Patio Doors. Patio doors may be permitted provided they have frames, similar to full view doors. Installation of raw aluminum or other metallic finishes are not permitted. Patio doors shall be painted or finished with a material that resembles a painted finish. Patio style doors on street facades shall be hinged doors, rather than sliding doors. If new sliding glass doors are installed, they should be placed at the rear of the building, away from the principal façade. 
6.  Storm Windows and Doors. Aluminum or other metallic storm windows and doors shall be enameled, painted or otherwise coated with a colored surface to resemble a painted surface and shall be compatible with the historic character of the structure. Painted or varnished storm doors of wood and glass to match the original design on the structure or on similar structures in the district are encouraged. Storm doors of simple design that do not contrast with the style of the house may be used. Full view storm doors will be permitted. 
7.  Skylights. Skylights on the roof slope over the main street façade are not permitted unless not visible from the street. Skylights may be permitted on rear roof slopes and on side roof slopes provided that the skylight is not obtrusive as to detract from the general appearance of the structure. The design of new skylights shall be as simple as possible, of the flat (not bubble) type, and finished to blend with the color of the roof. 
8.  Roof Materials. Retain and preserve historic materials whenever possible. If replacement is necessary, use new materials to match the original in composition, size, shape, color, pattern and texture. Consider substitute material only if original is not technically feasible. Vents shall be located as inconspicuously as possible and shall be similar in color to the color of the roof. Rolled roofing, tar-and-gravel, rubberized membranes and other similar roofing materials shall only be used on flat or slightly sloped roofs, which are not visible from the ground. 
9.  Dormers and Other Roof Alterations. Repair and retain existing dormers, maintaining the original roof slope and windows. New dormers should be compatible with the architectural character of the structure and neighborhood. Retain the shape of the original roofline, especially when visible from a public way. Other roof alterations shall be compatible with the roof shape and other historic features of the structure, such as siding and trim details. 
10.  Chimneys. The exterior appearance of original chimneys visible from the street shall be maintained in good repair. New chimneys shall be constructed of material that maintains the historic integrity of the structure. 
11.  Structure Exterior. Restoration of original wood siding and original decorative details such as cornices, brackets, shutters, columns and trim is encouraged. Soffits may be replaced provided the proposed material matches as closely as possible to the original. 
    Original wood siding or siding that maintains the historic character of the structure shall be retained and restored as necessary. If original siding is beyond repair, it shall be replaced with wood, composite wood or other materials that match the original appearance. 
    All architectural details including, but not limited to, window trim, frieze boards, cornices and other ornaments, must either remain uncovered or be duplicated in appearance and shall project beyond the siding the same dimensions as the original. Restoration of lost architectural trim is encouraged. 
    Original brick, stone and stucco siding should be retained. Replace or repair only the damaged portion. If any masonry feature is extensively deteriorated or missing, that feature should be replaced in-kind. Mortar, stucco and other exterior materials should match the original in strength, composition, color and texture. Old mortar joints should also be matched in width and joint profile. Painting of unpainted brick is not permitted. 
12.  Foundations. All original foundation masonry, such as brick, stone or concrete block, shall be retained unless it is determined that significant repairs are required, in which case replacement with materials to duplicate the original appearance is encouraged. If duplicating the original appearance is not practical, other materials may be approved provided they blend with the historic character of the structure and the district. 
13.  Additions. Construct a new addition so that there is the least possible loss of historic materials and so that character-defining features of the original structure are not obscured, damaged or destroyed. New additions should be located on an inconspicuous side or rear elevation so that the work does not radically change the character of the historic structure. Additions should be compatible in terms of mass, materials, relationship of solids to voids and color. A rooftop addition should be set back from the wall plane and be as inconspicuous as possible when viewed from the street. 
    Foundation material on new additions shall duplicate the original foundation material whenever practical. Other foundation materials may also be permitted provided they do not detract from the historic character of the structure. 
14.  Fire Escapes and Rescue Platforms. Fire escapes and rescue platforms shall be located such that they are as unobtrusive from the street as possible. No fire escapes or rescue platforms shall be permitted on the front façade of a structure unless it is determined that no other location is practical. The design of fire escapes and rescue platforms shall be painted to blend with the colors of the house. Handicap access and appropriate compatible design shall be considered. 
15.  Shutters. Shutters will be permitted provided that they are compatible with the historic character of the structure. 
16.  Accessory Structures.

A separate plot plan shall be required for parking facilities to support existing uses. No permit fees shall be applicable for parking lots used to support principal uses. 
C.  Off-Street Parking Facilities as a Special Use. All off-street parking facilities that are proposed as a special use shall be subject to the conditions and specifications that are determined through the special use process as outlined in Section 17.104.040.

Sections: 

17.82.010 - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to permit the use of their residences by citizens for employment under certain conditions, but also to ensure that the surrounding residential areas are protected from adverse impacts of these commercial activities. Any time a citizen conducts business from their home or uses their home address as the place of business then they must obtain a home occupation permit. 
(Ord. 2006-13 § 1 (part)) 
17.82.020 - Standards. 
    Home occupations are permitted in all zoning districts within the city of River Falls which permit residential use of property subject to the following conditions: 
A.  General Standards. 
1.  The home occupation shall involve the sale of goods or services in connection with such home. 
2.  The home occupation shall be conducted entirely within the principal building and shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the permitted principal use of the building. 
3.  The home occupation shall be conducted by a person residing on the premises in which the home occupation is conducted. Not more than one person, other than members of the family residing on the premises in which a home occupation is conducted, shall be regularly engaged in such occupation. 
4.  A home occupation shall not produce any offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat, gas, glare, electrical or audible interference, nor shall it otherwise create a risk to health, safety or property of residents and occupations of adjacent and neighboring properties. 
5.  Customers or clients, or deliveries shall not enter the premises between the hours of ten p.m. and six a.m. Depending upon the nature of the home occupation and the neighborhood, the city staff may reduce the hours of operation. 
B.  Structural Standards.

2.  Nothing incidental to the conduct of a home occupation shall be constructed, installed, placed or stored outside of the principal building in which it is carried on, nor shall any exterior evidence of a home occupation be permitted to exist on the lot in question if it is visible from any adjacent or neighboring properties or if it is not in keeping with the residential character of the neighborhood surrounding the lot, except for a sign and off-street parking as is set forth below. 
3.  One unlighted sign per dwelling shall be allowed and shall not exceed four square feet in area or project six feet above the surface of the ground.

The notice shall include the nature of the home occupation, if there is an employee who will be engaged in such occupation, whether or not customers or clients will visit the site and shall contain an acknowledgment that the applicant will be willing to meet with neighboring residents and property owners before the permit is issued, and that the applicant understands that the application will be placed on file at City Hall and shall be available for public inspection. Review and written comments shall be provided fifteen (15) days from the date the notice was mailed. Staff shall collect and evaluate any written comments, which will be used in determining whether the home occupation complies with the home occupation regulations and what restrictions, if any, shall be placed on it. Staff shall thereupon either issue, with or without conditions, or deny the issuance of a home occupation permit and provide written notice of its decision to the applicant. In addition, a one time processing fee shall be filed with the city. 
2.  Each person who seeks to engage in a home occupation shall register the type of home occupation in question with the city on forms provided by the city, including therein such information as is required by the city, as well as an acknowledgement that the home occupation engaged in on and from the property shall be in full compliance not only with this chapter but with all applicable codes and laws, which compliance requirement shall be a condition of the right to engage in such home occupation. Within seven business days after the public review process the city planning director or his designee will prepare a report that approves or denies the request based on whether or not it complies with the home occupation regulations. 
3.  If approved, the applicant will receive a certificate of home occupation. The permit so granted shall be personal to the resident of the house and lot from which the home occupation shall be conducted. It shall not be transferable, either as and between successive occupants of the property in question, nor from one property in the city to another. 
4.  No person shall conduct a home occupation in violation of this section. In addition to any other remedies available, the city may revoke the home occupation or the certificate of occupancy for any building in which a home occupation is being conducted in violation of this section. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall be subject to a penalty.

The city planning director or his designee shall investigate the grounds of the complaint and shall issue a written decision as to whether or not the home occupation in question or the manner in which it is conducted is in violation of the terms and conditions of the permit granted under this chapter. If a violation is found to exist, the city staff shall determine what action should be taken by the city to correct the same. All complaints filed hereunder shall be kept on file and shall be open to public inspection. Prior complaints concerning a given home occupation shall be considered by staff in the course of investigation of a later complaint. 
6.  Persons aggrieved by the decision of the city staff in response to a complaint concerning a home occupation may appeal such decision to the common council, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the staff issued its decision.

The board of appeals may not permit as a variance any use that is not permitted under this title for property in the zone where the affected person's land is located. The board of appeals may impose conditions in the granting of variances to ensure compliance with the variance and to protect the adjacent properties. 
E.  The board of appeals may grant a variance subject to the following conditions:

3.  That the purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the value or the income potential of the parcel of land; 
4.  That granting of the variance is necessary for the preservation and employment of substantial property rights of the petitioner and the alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this chapter and has not been created by any person having an interest in the parcel of land; 
5.  That granting of such variance will not, under the circumstances of this particular case, materially affect adversely the health and safety of persons residing or working in a neighborhood of the property of the applicant and will not, under the circumstances of this particular case, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such neighborhood. 
F.  The following procedures shall be applicable in making an appeal to the board of appeals:

5.  Paving. Reduction of impervious surfaces through the use of interlocking pavers is strongly encouraged for areas such as remote parking lots and parking areas for periodic uses. 
G.  Architectural Standards. Due to the mixed-use nature of the development, architectural compatibility is necessary in order to visually integrate development and allow for proximity of varied uses. The design style of the TND shall be conveyed with drawing or computer simulations of typical proposed building elevations (including dimensions of building height and width, and facade treatment). 
1.  Guidelines for Existing Structures. Existing structures, if determined to be historic or architecturally significant, shall be protected from demolition or encroachment by incompatible structures or landscape development.

Chapter 17.120 - FLOODPLAIN PROTECTION REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

17.120.001 - Statutory authorization. 
    This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization under Section 62.23, Wis. Stats., and the requirements of Section 87.30, Wis. Stats. 
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-24-2009) 
17.120.005 - Finding of fact. 
    Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers in the city will impair the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare and tax base. It is correspondingly deemed to be in the public interest to adopt and enforce the following regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-24-2009) 
17.120.010 - Statement of purpose. 
    This chapter is intended to regulate floodplain development to: 
A.  Protect life, health and property; 
B.  Minimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers; 
D.  Minimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain; 
F.  Minimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain; 
G.  Discourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers; 
H.  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
I.  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-24-2009) 
17.120.020 - General provisions. 
A.  Areas To Be Regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood. 
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-zones on the city's Flood Insurance Rate Map. 
B.  Official Maps and Revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of River Falls Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the planning director, City of River Falls. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
C.  Official Maps. The City of River Falls is located in two counties, St. Croix and Pierce: 
1.  St. Croix County - Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Panel Numbers are: 
a.  55109C0345E 
b.  55109C0363E 
c.  55109C0482E 
d.  55109C0501E 
    dated March 16, 2009 with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated March 16, 2009, Volume Number 55109CV000A. 
    Panel Number 55109C0345E, amended by Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), Case #10-05-1230P, effective date October 1, 2010. 
    Panel Number 55109C0345E, amended by Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), Case #15-05-3405P, effective date December 15, 2015. 
2.  Pierce County - Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Panel Numbers are: 
a.  55093C0107E 
b.  55093C0109E 
c.  55093C0126E 
d.  55093C0127E 
e.  55093C0130E 
    dated November 16, 2011 with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated November 16, 2011, Volume Number: 55093CV000A 
D.  Establishment of Districts. The regional floodplain is divided into three districts as follows: 
1.  The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
2.  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
3.  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. 
E.  Locating Floodplain Boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs 1. or 2. below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Section 17.120.140. The planning director can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The planning director shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the planning director and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection 17.120.100C. and the criteria in 1. and 2. below. 
1.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
2.  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the department. 
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to subsection 17.120.140A.6. 
F.  Removal of Lands From Floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Section 17.120.140. 
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a letter of map change (LOMC). 
G.  Compliance. All development and use of land within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
H.  Municipalities and State Agencies Regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Section 13.48(13), Wis. Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Section 30.2022, Wis. Stats., applies. 
I.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. 
1.  This chapter supersedes all provisions of any other zoning ordinance enacted under Section 62.23, Wis. Stats. or Section 87.30, Wis. Stats., which relate to floodplains in the city. Only if another ordinance is more restrictive than this chapter, shall such control. 
2.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
J.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and are not a limitation on nor do they repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
K.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. The application of this chapter to designated areas in the city does not imply or guarantee that nonfloodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damage. Nor does this chapter create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter. 
L.  Severability. Should any portion of this chapter be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected. 
M.  Annexed Areas for Cities and Villages. The Pierce County or St. Croix County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the city for all areas annexed from either of those counties until the city adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Annexed lands will be described as such on the city's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the planning director. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway. 
N.  General Development Standards. The city planning director shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a floodprone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads. Additionally, all structures shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage and be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the said components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions of land shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2009-2, § 1, 2-24-2009; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1, 9-14-2010; Ord. No. 2011-10, § 1, 10-11-2011; Ord. No. 2015-05 , § 1, 11-10-2015)

Sections: 

18.08.010 - Grant of franchise. 
    This franchise is granted pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein and in applicable law. The grantee shall comply with all provisions of this franchise and applicable laws, regulations and codes. Failure of the grantee to construct, operate and maintain a system as described in this franchise, or to meet obligations and comply with all provisions herein, may be deemed a violation of this franchise. 
(Ord. 2001-27 § 2 (part)) 
18.08.020 - Grant of nonexclusive authority. 
A.  Subject to the terms of this franchise, the city hereby grants the grantee the right to own, construct, operate and maintain a system along the rights-of-way. The grant of authority set forth in this franchise applies only to the grantee's provision of cable service; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit grantee's ability to use the system for other purposes not inconsistent with the provision of cable service; and provided further, that any local, state and federal authorizations necessary for the grantee's use of the system for other purposes are obtained by the grantee. This franchise does not confer any rights other than as expressly provided herein, or as provided by federal, state or local law. No privilege or power of eminent domain is bestowed by this franchise grant. The system constructed and maintained by grantee or its agents pursuant to this franchise shall not interfere with other uses of the rights-of-way. The grantee shall make use of existing poles and other aerial and underground facilities available to the grantee to the extent it is technically and economically feasible to do so. 
B.  Notwithstanding the above grant to use rights-of-way, no right-of-way shall be used by the grantee if the city determines that such use is inconsistent with the terms, conditions, or provisions by which such right-of-way was created or dedicated, or with the present use of the right-of-way. 
C.  This franchise and the right it grants to use and occupy the rights-of-way shall not be exclusive and this franchise does not, explicitly or implicitly, preclude the issuance of other franchises or similar authorizations to operate cable systems within the city. Provided, however, that the city shall not authorize or permit either a governmental entity or another person to construct, operate or maintain a cable system on terms or conditions more favorable or less burdensome than those in this franchise with respect to: (1) the area served; (2) public, educational or governmental access requirements; (3) franchise fees; or (4) other material terms and conditions which are, taken as a whole, more favorable or less burdensome than those applied to the grantee. 
D.  This franchise authorizes only the use of rights-of-way for the operation of a system. Therefore, the grant of this franchise and the payment of franchise fees hereunder shall not exempt the grantee from the obligation to pay compensation or fees for the use of city property, both real and personal, other than the rights-of-way; provided, however, that such compensation or fees are required by city ordinance, regulation or policy and are non-discriminatory.

EXHIBIT A 
DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM 
1. The Cable System shall be designed, constructed, routinely inspected and maintained to guarantee that the Cable System meets or exceeds the requirements of the most current editions of the National Electrical Code (NFRA 70) and the National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2). In all matters requiring interpretation of either of these codes, the City's interpretation shall control over all other sources and interpretations. 
2.  General Requirements. Grantee shall use equipment used in high-quality, reliable, modern Cable Systems of similar design. 
3.  General Description. The Cable System shall provide Subscribers with a technically advanced and reliable Cable System. The System shall have at least 750 MHz of bandwidth capacity, capable of delivering approximately 80 analog channels of programming. The System will be two-way active, and it will be designed to have capability to transmit return signals upstream in the 5-40 MHz spectrum. The design will provide the benefits of proven 80 channel electronics while positioning the System for expansion of bandwidth and channel capacity as technology and future services develop. 
4.  Design. The design of the System shall be based upon a "fiber to the node" architecture that will deliver the signals by fiber optics directly to each neighborhood. Grantee's initial design includes a minimum of six (6) fibers to each node site having a neighborhood group average of approximately five hundred (500) homes. If Grantee splits nodes into smaller sizes, fewer fibers will extend to such smaller nodes. There shall be no more than seven (7) active amplifiers in a cascade from each node to the residential dwelling. The incorporation of stand-by power supplies, strategically placed throughout the System including all hubs, will further reduce the likelihood of service interruptions. 
5.  Technical Standards. The System shall meet or exceed FCC requirements. In no event shall the System fall below the following standards: 
a. The System shall be capable of meeting the following distortion parameters: 
i. Carrier to RMS Noise 48 dB ii. Carrier to Second Order 53 dB iii. Carrier to Cross Modulation 51 dB iv. Carrier to Composite Triple Beat 53 dB  
b. The frequency response of a single channel as measured across any 6 MHz analog channel shall not exceed +/-2 dB. 
c. The frequency response of the entire passband shall not exceed N/10+2 dB for the entire System where N is the number of amplifiers in cascade. 
d. The System shall be designed such that at a minimum all technical specifications of this Franchise Agreement are met. 
e. The System shall be designed such that no noticeable degradation in signal quality will appear at the Subscriber terminal. 
(Ord. 2001-27 Exh. A) 
EXHIBIT B 
RIVER FALLS INSTITUTIONAL HYBRID FIBER COAX NETWORK DESIGN 
1. Pursuant to Section 7 of the Franchise and this Exhibit B, Grantee will make available to designated institutional buildings in the River Falls area capacity on a hybrid fiber coax distribution system that is independent of the subscriber network. This institutional capacity will consist of a broadband Independent Hybrid Fiber Coax Network ("Network"). The Network will extend from a hub of Grantee to a node located near each designated institution. The buildings identified as "designated institutions" are those designated in Section 7.3 of the Franchise Agreement. 
2. The Network will include stand-by power at both the hub and at each node. The connection of each institution shall consist of a coaxial line from the node. Grantee shall pursue the potential of co-location of nodes within or close to institutions as necessary. 
3. The Network will have a bandwidth from 5 MHz to 40 MHz from the institution to Grantee's Hub located in River Falls and from 50 MHz to 450 MHz from the Hub to the institution. The network will use fiber optic transmission from the Hub to a location (node) near the institution. One node may serve more then one institution if the institutions are located close together. Each node contains a receiver to convert the light signal in the forward direction to RF and a laser transmitter to convert the RF return signals to light and transmit in the return direction going back to the Hub. The Network will utilize the same equipment and architecture used in the subscriber network. 
4. Designated institutions must provide their own end-user terminal equipment and hub processing equipment, including but not limited to, modems, personal computers, routers, modulators, demodulators and processors. Grantee shall be responsible for providing the transportation electronics which includes lasers along with the broadband path. 
5. Use of the network by the City, or designated institutions will be limited to their own noncommercial uses, and no institution may provide any service to any third party or provide any service in competition with Grantee. 
6. Grantee's subscriber return bandwidth, specifically 5-40 MHz, shall be reserved for Grantees exclusive use. 
RIVER FALLS NETWORK PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 
Upon completion of the Network: 
1. Video Transmission 
A. Video transmission will comply with the following performance standards: 
1. Carrier to noise ratio = 45 dB or better 
2. Carrier to composite triple beat = 53 dB or better 
3. Carrier to composite second order = 55 dB or better 
4. Carrier to cross modulation = 55dB or better 
5. System signal level variations (peak to valley) = n ) 10 + 2 or better for all coaxial cable portion of the Network (where N = the number of amplifiers in cascade). 
B. Testing will occur annually following the timing established in CFR 76.601 and 76.605. 
1. From the institution to the longest subscriber cascade. 
2. Performed using existing Network carriers active at the time of the testing, which will subject them to service interruptions. 
3. Completed at Company-designated entry demarcation point at the institution. 
4. The system will meet calculated worst case fully loaded video and audio measurements, taking into consideration existing Network data loading at the time the measurement is taken. 
5. Under ordinary operating conditions. 
2. Digital Transmission 
A. For Network that is 50% or more coaxial cable, a Bit Error Rate of 1 × 10(-8) at the demarcation point. 
1. Outage times not included 
2.2. Ordinary operating conditions 
B. For Network that is 50% or more fiber optic cable, a Bit Error Rate of lx10(-9) at the demarcation point. 
1. Outage times not included 
2. Ordinary operating conditions 
3. For both coaxial and fiber network, the company will meet or exceed a reliability factor of 99.965% on an annual basis. 
4. Testing will occur twice yearly, during the months of January/February and July/August. 
3. Repair and Maintenance 
A. Company will provide a repair force of technicians capable of responding properly to all requests for service by Network Users and available on a 7 × 24 × 365 basis. 
B. Under normal operating conditions, the initial page to the technician on call will be within a 1 hour time frame. Barring situations that are outside the control of the company (i.e., physical damage to the network caused by third parties not under the control of the cable company, weather related restriction, etc.), the company will continue to work on a service problem until it is resolved and complete its resolution of such problem within eight (8) hours, if resolution of such problem is within control of company. 
C. Fiber may be incorporated, where necessary, to reduce amplifier cascades to meet performance standards. Where possible, fiber nodes may be located within the building or facility of the Network user provided no there is no additional cost to the company. 
D. Network Users will be notified at least forty eight hours in advance of any scheduled maintenance that will interrupt service on the Network, unless Network Users agree to waive such time frame. Where possible, such maintenance will be scheduled at times of low usage.

3.  Capital Costs. The costs of providing capital improvements, as considered in the capital cost study described in subsection C of this section shall be considered. Ordinarily an annexation will not be approved unless the owners of the property proposed to be annexed agree to pay the capital costs as shown by the capital cost study. 
4.  Annual Budget Costs. The effect of the annexation on the annual budget of the city, including not only additional costs to serve the territory, but also new revenues from real estate taxes, anticipated business license fees, sales taxes and other revenues from the area shall be considered all as to be shown on the budget study provided in subsection D of this section. 
C.  Capital Cost Study. 
1.  The cost of capital improvements to serve the area shall be estimated by the appropriate city staff. Capital costs shall include, but not be limited to, water mains, sanitary sewer mains, storm drainage facilities, new street pavement or street widening, storm water control projects, parks, fire stations or equipment and any other capital costs related to serving the area. Costs of streets, sewers, water mains and storm water projects to be constructed in the area proposed to be annexed may be dealt with separately, if these will be constructed by the subdivider or developer developing the property. The owners of property proposed to be annexed will be notified of the capital costs related to the proposed annexation. The owners will be informed that it is the policy of the city to have a commitment from the owners to pay the capital costs or the owners proportionate share of capital costs, for the property to be annexed. In the absence of strong circumstances to indicate a contrary decision, ordinarily territory will not be annexed to the city unless the owners of the land to be annexed agree to pay their proportionate share of the capital costs, as prescribed by the city council policy on assessments, and place their proportionate share of the capital costs in an escrow account prior to the final action of the city council on the annexation. 
2.  All costs to complete the capital cost study shall be borne by the property owners petitioning to be annexed. 
D.  Budget Study. The appropriate city staff shall cause a budget study to be made, showing not only the estimated annual costs of providing municipal services to the territory proposed to be annexed, but also the estimated revenues to the city from the territory proposed to be annexed, including real estate taxes, business license fees, sales taxes and any other municipal revenue anticipated to be received from the territory proposed to be annexed. The territory may be annexed whether the costs exceed the estimated revenues or whether the estimated revenues exceed the estimated costs but the city council will consider the impact of the proposed annexation on the city budget. 
E.  Master Plan. The policies set out in this subsection shall be a part of the master plan of the city at the time of its adoption and shall be applicable to all subsequent amendments. 
(Prior code § 21.67(3)) 
(Ord. No. 2008-36, § 2, 12-9-2008) 
19.100.040 - Annexations of real estate containing existing residences; deferral of water and sewer connections. 
A.  Direct annexations by one-half approval under § 66.0217(3), Wis. Stats., may bring real estate into the city upon which existing residences are situated, together with undeveloped or partially developed land, the latter of which is proposed for residential or other development which shall require an extension of city water and sanitary sewer services or the construction of city streets and associated curbs, gutters, and storm sewers. The purpose of this section shall be to afford to the owners of existing residences the option to defer from having to hook up to city water and sanitary sewer service at the time that it is made available to their properties. 
B.  1.  If upon or after such an annexation, water or sanitary sewer services or both are extended into the annexed territory on rights-of-way which adjoin or abut parcels of real estate containing existing residences, at the option of the owner of each existing residences they may either immediately apply to connect their systems with city water and sewer services or shall be afforded a period of five years plus an option for one five-year renewal term within which to hook their residences up to city water and sanitary sewer services. Said period of time shall be measured from the date of a notice of such availability provided to them by the city. No later than the end of said five-year period or ten-year period if the option to extend has been exercised, each existing residence shall be hooked up to city water and sewer service and such steps as are required under Chapter 13.20 shall be taken to legally abandon existing water wells. This ordinance shall prevail notwithstanding the following provisions of the City Code: 
a.  Section 13.08.030 which requires hookup to city water within ninety (90) days of the notice of availability of city water to a given parcel of real estate. 
b.  Section 13.12.020 C. which requires hookup to city sanitary sewers within ninety (90) days of the notice of availability of city sanitary sewer service to a given parcel of real estate. 
c.  Chapter 13.20 which requires that certain steps be taken to legally abandon existing water wells and septic systems upon receipt of notice of the availability of city water to real estate upon which such well or wells are located. 
2.  At the time that water or sewer mains are installed adjoining real estate containing existing residences, laterals shall be stubbed into parcels of real estate containing existing residences so as to allow connection to take place then or at a later point in time. If the owner opts not to immediately connect, subject to the following requirements, the cost of the laterals and of the mains reasonably attributed to that parcel of real estate shall be carried on the records of the city as a deferred special assessment, to be collected at the time when hookup is required in accord with the provisions of this section, which shall be further defined as meaning the end of the deferred hook up period as prescribed under 1., above. 
a.  The cost of installation of the water and sewer mains and laterals to be specially assessed at the time that the owner voluntarily or involuntarily hooks up to said city services shall be based upon the actual cost to the city at the time of said installation together with the addition thereto of a sum of money calculated upon the basis of the Engineering News Records (ENR) Construction Cost Index for Minneapolis which shall be added to the cost at the time of installation so as to make the city whole as to the cost of such installation in dollars as of the time of hook up. 
3.  It shall be the responsibility of each affected real estate owner, upon receipt of the ninety (90) day notice to connect to city water or sewer services to notify the city utilities in writing of his or her intent not to hook up. Upon receipt of such notice from an affected real estate owner, the city utilities shall provide him or her with an acknowledgment indicating the period of time remaining before the said residence must mandatorily be hooked up to city water and sewer services in accordance with 1., above. 
4.  Not less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the deferral period under B., above, the city utilities shall provide the owner of each existing residence who decided not to connect with a notice under Sections 13.08.030 and 13.12.020 of the need to hook up their residences with city water and sanitary sewer services. 
5.  For failure of an affected real estate owner to hook up his or her real estate to city water or sewer services at the end of the prescribed period of time in accord with B., above, the city may effect such hookup through its own employees, equipment and resources and if it does so, it shall bill the cost thereof to the real estate owner as a charge for current services under § 66.0627, Wis. Stats., subject to the collection methods authorized thereunder. 
6.  In the event of groundwater contamination, well failure, septic system failure, or the incapacity of the soil to absorb and treat sanitary sewage, notwithstanding the allowance under this section to the owners of existing residences to defer from hooking their properties up to city water and sanitary sewer services, upon such failure or incapacity occurring they shall take the steps to immediately connect their properties thereto. This subsection shall apply at all times from and after the date of the annexation of such real estate to the city. 
7.  Impact fees, as prescribed under Title 14 of the City Code, shall be collected at the time of hook up to the city water and/or sewer systems. 
C.  All costs associated with the construction of city streets and associated curbs, gutters, and storm sewers, attributable to properties described in A., above, shall be deferred until such time as when such parcel is connected to either or both the city water or sewer systems. The ENR Cost Index increase shall be added to each such determination of costs in accord with B. 2. a., above. so as to arrive at actual cost in dollars as of the time of assessment. 
D.  For purposes of this ordinance, "existing residence" shall mean a dwelling place used by one or more families as their place or places of domicile prior to the effective date of the annexation ordinance pursuant to which the real estate upon which such existing residence was situated was annexed to the city. 
E.  Parcels of real estate which do not contain existing residences at the time of adoption of an annexation ordinance shall not be eligible for deferral of hook up nor deferral of the costs thereof under this section. For purposes of this section the term "parcel" shall mean a legally described lot, tract or parcel, recorded in the office of the register of deeds. 
F.  The rights afforded to the owners of parcels containing existing residences shall terminate at such time as when those parcels are subdivided for purposes of more intensive development or when such parcels are sold or in the event that the use thereof changes from residential to other types of property uses. 
G.  This section, both as to the rights and responsibilities imposed, shall be binding upon and shall inure to the owner of existing residences at the time that utilities are installed, as well as at the time when mandatory hook ups are required hereunder.
