PREFACE\ 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Omro, Wisconsin. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1998 Code, as supplemented through August 4, 2015 and ordinances adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1998 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE INDEX\CDi:1 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Jean Lindsay, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

CHAPTER 2.36. - ETHICS CODE 

Sec. 2.36.010. - Statement of purpose. 
A.  The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is established in this chapter a code of ethics for all city officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of boards, committees and commissions of the city, as well as any individuals who are candidates for elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination papers with the city. 
B.  The purpose of this ethics code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. The common council believes that a code of ethics for the guidance of elected and appointed officials and employees will help them avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their public responsibilities, will improve standards of public service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the citizens of this city in their elected and appointed officials and employees. The common council reaffirms that each elected and appointed city official and employee holds his/her position as a public trust, and any intentional effort to realize substantial personal gain through official conduct is a violation of that trust. The provisions and purpose of this ethics code and such rules and regulations as may be established are declared to be in the best interests of the city.

Such official shall not participate in debate or discussion or vote for adoption or defeat of such legislation. 
4.  Any city employee who has a financial interest or personal interest in any proposed legislative action of the common council or any board, commission or committee upon which the employee has any influence of input, or of which the employee is a member, that is to make a recommendation or decision upon any item which is the subject of the proposed legislative action shall disclose on the records of the common council or the appropriate board, commission or committee the nature and extent of such interest. 
B.  Disclosure of Confidential Information. No official or employee shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs of the city, nor shall such information be used to advance the financial or other private interests of the official or employee or others. 
C.  Gifts and Favors. 
1.  No official or employee, personally or through a member of his/her immediate family, may solicit or accept, either directly or indirectly, from any person or organization, money or anything of value if it could be expected to influence the employee's official actions or judgments or be considered a reward for any action or inaction on the part of the official or employee. 
2.  No official or employee, personally or through a member of his/her immediate family, shall accept any gift, whether in the form of money, service, loan, thing or promise, from any person which could reasonably be expected to impair his/her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his/her duties or grant in the discharge of his/her duties any improper favor, service or thing of value. However, it is not a conflict of interest for any public official or employee to receive hospitality that is unsolicited and unrelated to government business, such as a meal, and that is not intended to influence the official. 
3.  An official or employee is not to accept hospitality if, after consideration of the surrounding circumstances, it could reasonably be concluded that such hospitality would not be extended were it not for the fact that the guest, or a member of the guest's immediate family, was a city official or employee. Participation in celebrations, grand openings, open houses, informational meetings and similar events are excluded from this prohibition. This subsection further shall not be construed to prevent candidates for elective office from accepting hospitality, as a properly reported political contribution, from citizens for the purpose of supporting the candidate's campaign. (The State Ethics Board has interpreted "hospitality" as it applies to state officials as including meals, beverages and lodging which a person offers at his/her residence and would have been offered if the recipient was not an official.) 
4.  Gifts received by an official or employee or his/her immediate family under unusual circumstances shall be referred to the common council within ten days of receipt for recommended disposition. Any person subject to this chapter who becomes aware that he/she is or has been offered any gift, the acceptance of which would constitute a violation of this Subsection C, shall, within ten days, disclose the details surrounding the offer to the common council. Failure to comply with this reporting requirement shall constitute an offense under this chapter. 
D.  Representing Private Interests before City Agencies or Courts. 
1.  Non-elected city officials and employees shall not appear on behalf of any private person (other than himself, his/her spouse or minor children) before any city agency, board, commission or the common council if the official or employee or any board, commission or committee of which the official or employee is a member has any jurisdiction, discretion or control over the matter which is the subject of such representation. 
2.  Elected city officials may appear before city agencies on behalf of constituents in the course of their duties as representatives of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations. However, the disclosure requirements of Subsection A of this section shall be applicable to such appearances. 
E.  Ad Hoc Committee Exceptions. No violation of the conflict of interest restrictions in this section shall exist, however, where an individual serves on a special ad hoc committee charged with the narrow responsibility of addressing a specific issue or topic in which that individual, or the employer or a client of that individual, has an interest so long as the individual discloses to the common council that such interest exists. 
F.  Contracts with the City. No city official or employee who, in his/her capacity as such officer or employee, participates in the making of a contract in which he/she has a private pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, or performs in regard to that contract with some function requiring the exercise of discretion on his/her part shall enter into any contract with the city unless, within the confines of Wis. Stats. § 946.13: 
1.  The contract is awarded through a process of public notice and competitive bidding or the common council waives the requirement of this section after determining that it is in the best interest of the city to do so. 
2.  The provisions of this Subsection F shall not apply to the designation of a public depository of public funds. 
G.  Campaign Contributions. Campaign contributions shall be reported by all candidates for city office in strict conformity with the provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes. Any campaign contribution tendered to or accepted by a candidate subsequent to the final statutory report shall be reported to the ethics board. 
(Prior Code, § 2-5-7; Code 1998, § 2.36.070) 
Sec. 2.36.080. - Advisory opinions. 
    When an official or employee has doubt as to the applicability of a provision of this ethics code to a particular situation or definition of terms used in this chapter, he/she should apply to the ethics board for an advisory opinion and will be guided by that opinion when given. The official or employee shall have the opportunity to present his/her interpretation of the facts at issue and of the applicability provisions of this chapter before such advisory decision is made. This chapter shall be operative in all instances covered by its provisions except when superseded by an applicable statutory provision and statutory action is mandatory, or when the application of a statutory provision is discretionary, but determined by the ethics board to be more appropriate or desirable. Advisory requests and opinions shall be kept confidential, except when disclosure is authorized by the requestor, in which case the request and opinion may be made public. 
(Prior Code, § 2-5-8; Code 1998, § 2.36.080)

B.  Hiring an immediate family member of any current city employee or elected city official will be considered only if that individual has the knowledge and skills, experience or other job-related qualifications that warrant consideration for the position. A person cannot be hired for either full-time or part-time employment in a position immediately supervised by a member of that person's immediate family. 
C.  This section does not apply to non-elected officials who are asked to accept appointment as members of a city board, commission or committee; non-elected officials, however, will be expected to disqualify themselves from participation in matters under consideration which may affect the hiring, retention, classification or compensation of their immediate family if currently employed or being considered for employment by the city.

Violation of this provision shall be grounds for disciplinary action.

(Prior Code, § 2-5-12; Code 1998, § 2.36.120) 
Sec. 2.36.130. - Sanctions. 
A.  Violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute cause for suspension, removal from office or employment or other disciplinary action. A determination that a public official's or public employee's actions constitute improper conduct under the provisions of this chapter may constitute a cause for removal from office, termination of employment, suspension, reprimand, removal from committee assignment, or other appropriate disciplinary action. As an alternative or in addition to sanctions imposed herein, any individual violating the ethics code shall be subject to a nonreimbursable forfeiture of not less than $10.00 nor more than $200.00 as determined by the city common council.

c.  The item is no longer able to reliably or economically perform the work required of it.

A key for the lock shall be supplied to a guest who has attained the legal drinking age upon request at registration. The hotel shall prominently display a price list of the intoxicating liquor in the hotel room. Intoxicating liquor may be furnished at the time the guest occupies the room, but for purposes of this chapter, the sale of intoxicating liquor furnished under this Subsection 2 is considered to occur at the time and place that the guest pays for the intoxicating liquor. Notwithstanding Wis. Stats. § 125.68(4)(c), the guest may pay for the intoxicating liquor at any time if he/she pays in conjunction with checking out of the hotel.

D.  Class "B" Fermented Malt Beverage Retailer's License. 
1.  License.

An individual who stocks or accepts payment for alcohol beverages under this subsection shall be the licensee, the agent named in the license if the licensee is a corporation or limited liability company or the holder of a manager's or operator's license or be supervised by one of those individuals. 
2.  Eligibility. Class "B" licenses may be issued to any person qualified under Wis. Stats. § 125.04(5). Such licenses may not be issued to any person acting as agent for or in the employ of another except that this restriction does not apply to a hotel or restaurant which is not a part of or located on the premises of any mercantile establishment, or to a bona fide club, society or lodge that has been in existence for at least six months before the date of application. A Class "B" license for a hotel, restaurant, club, society or lodge may be issued in the name of an officer who shall be personally responsible for compliance with this chapter. Except as provided in Wis. Stats. § 125.297, Class "B" licenses may not be issued to brewers or fermented malt beverages wholesalers.

A license issued to a county or district fair licenses the entire fairgrounds where the fair is being conducted and all persons engaging in retail sales of fermented malt beverages from leased stands on the fairgrounds. The county or district fair to which the license is issued may lease stands on the fairgrounds to persons who may engage in retail sales of fermented malt beverages from the stands where the fair is being held.

1.  License. 
a.  Notwithstanding Wis. Stats. § 125.68(3), temporary "Class B" licenses may be issued to bona fide clubs and chambers of commerce, to county or local fair associations or agricultural societies, to churches, lodges, or societies that have been in existence for at least six months before the date of application, and to posts of veterans' organizations authorizing the sale of wine in an original package, container, or bottle or by the glass if the wine is dispensed directly from an original package, container, or bottle at a particular picnic or similar gathering, at a meeting of the post, or during a fair conducted by the fair association or agricultural society. The amount of the fee for the license shall be determined by the common council, except that no fee may be charged to a person who at the same time applies for a temporary Class "B" license under Wis. Stats. § 125.26(6) for the same event. A license issued to a county or district fair licenses the entire fairgrounds where the fair is being conducted and all persons engaging in retail sales of wine from leased stands on the fairgrounds. The county or district fair to which the license is issued may lease stands on the fairgrounds to persons who may engage in retail sales of wine from the stands while the fair is being held. If a county or district fair leases any stand to a winery holding a permit under Wis. Stats. § 125.53, in addition to making retail sales of wine from the leased stand, the winery may provide taste samples anywhere on the fairgrounds of wine manufactured by the winery. If a license is issued under this subsection to a fair association solely for the purpose of conducting on the licensed premises wine judging or tasting events involving servings of wine no greater than one fluid ounce each, Wis. Stats. § 125.68(2) does not apply to these licensed premises. Except as provided in Subsection F.2.b of this section, not more than two licenses may be issued under this subsection to any club, chamber of commerce, county or local fair association, agricultural association, church, lodge, society, or veterans post in any 12-month period. 
b.  The city may issue up to 20 licenses under Subsection F.1.a of this section to the same licensee if all of the following apply: 
i.  Each license is issued for the same date and times and the licensee is the sponsor of an event held at multiple locations within the city on this date and at these times.

iii.  Within the immediately preceding 12-month period, the city has issued licenses under authority of this Subsection F.1.b for fewer than two events. 
c.  The duration of an event under Subsection F.1.b of this section may not exceed one day. 
d.  For purposes of the two-license limit imposed under Subsection F.1.a of this section, each event for which multiple licenses are issued as provided in Subsection F.1. of this section shall count as one license toward this two-license limit. 
e.  The city clerk upon authorization by the common council may, upon issuance of a temporary "Class B" license as provided in Subsection F.1.a of this section, authorize the licensee to permit underage persons to be on the licensed premises for the purpose of acting as designated drivers. 
2.  Application. Application for such license shall be signed by the president or corresponding officer of the society or association making such application and shall be filed with the city clerk together with the appropriate license fee for each day for which the license is sought. Any person fronting for any group other than the one applied for shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a forfeiture of $200.00 and will be ineligible to apply for a temporary "Class B" wine license for one year.

CHAPTER 5.32. - NUDE ENTERTAINMENT 

Sec. 5.32.010. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
1.  Licensed establishment means an establishment licensed by the common council to sell alcohol beverages pursuant to Wis. Stats. ch. 125. 
2.  Licensee means the holder of a retail Class "A," "Class A," Class "B," "Class B," or "Class C" license granted by the common council pursuant to Wis. Stats. ch. 125. 
(Code 1998, § 5.32.010; Ord. No. 433, 1-6-2009) 
Sec. 5.32.020. - Authority. 
A.  The common council has explicit authority under Wis. Stats. § 125.10(1) to adopt regulations governing the sale of alcohol beverages which are in addition to those set forth in Wis. Stats. ch. 125. 
B.  The common council has authority under its general police powers set forth in Wis. Stats. § 62.11(5) to act for the good order of the city and for the health, safety and welfare of the public, and may carry out its powers by regulation and suppression. 
C.  The common council recognizes it lacks authority to regulate obscenity in light of Wis. Stats. § 66.0107(3), and does not intend, by adopting this chapter, to regulate obscenity, since nudity in and of itself is not obscene, it declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing in bars and taverns. 
D.  Bars and taverns featuring live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing have, in other communities, tended to further the increase of criminal and other offensive activity, to disrupt the peace and order of the communities, to depreciate the value of real property, to harm the economic welfare of the communities and to negatively affect the quality of life of the communities; and such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare of citizens. 
E.  The common council recognizes that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the First Amendment. The common council further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights, and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights. 
F.  The common council is aware, however, that based on the experiences of other communities, bars and taverns in which live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the common council believes are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. Among such secondary effects are: 
1.  The potential increase in prostitution and other sex-related offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses; 
2.  The potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist; 
3.  Health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; and 
4.  The potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct. 
G.  The common council desires to minimize, prevent and control the adverse effects as set forth in Subsection F of this section, and thereby protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight. 
H.  The common council has determined that enactment of an ordinance prohibiting live, totally nude, nonobscene, erotic dancing in bars and taverns licensed to serve alcohol beverages within the city promotes the goal of minimizing, preventing and controlling the negative secondary effects associated with such activity.

CHAPTER 5.36. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 5.36.010. - Intent and Purpose. 
A.  It is the intent of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented adult entertainment establishment businesses, referred to in this chapter as "adult-oriented establishments"; to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city; to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city; to aid in the alleviation and prevention of the adverse and deleterious effects of criminal activity and disruption of the public peace associated with such establishments; to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the serious health hazards associated with unsafe and unsanitary conditions known to exist in such establishments; and to alleviate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other contagious diseases in such establishments. 
B.  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the city presented in hearings and in reports made available to the common council and findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); and on studies in other communities, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the common council finds: 
1.  Sexually oriented establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities. There is presently no mechanism to make the owners of such establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
2.  Certain employees of sexually oriented establishments such as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
3.  Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented establishments, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows. 
4.  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
5.  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other sexually oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such establishments. 
6.  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non-A, non-B amebiasis, salmonella and shigella infections. 
7.  Since 1981 to the present time there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. 
8.  The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States, reported annually, has risen. 
9.  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States, reported annually, remains at a high level. 
10.  The Surgeon General of the United States, in his/her report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
11.  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
12.  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of such facilities to self-regulate such activities and maintain such facilities. 
13.  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented establishments where persons view adult-oriented films. 
14.  The findings noted in Subsections B.1. through 13 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
15.  Sexually oriented establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect such substantial governmental concerns. 
16.  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of such reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators of such establishments to ensure that the sexually oriented establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented establishment, and is fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring in such establishment. 
17.  Prohibiting booths, private rooms and cubicles advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
18.  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
19.  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented establishment, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
20.  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
21.  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in such conduct in contravention of this chapter. 
22.  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
23.  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

B.  Wherever this article imposes the cost of abatement as a special charge against the premises, the City of Omro elects not to be subject to the administrative review provisions contained within Wis. Stats. ch. 68 and establishes the following as a complete and final review procedure: As a condition precedent to challenging any special charge, the owner of the premises must timely pay the charge in full under protest to the city. An appeal shall be to the city administrator and can be undertaken only by filing a written appeal with the city administrator concurrent with the date of payment. The written appeal shall specify all grounds for the challenge to the amount of the special charge and shall state the amount of the charge that the appellant considers to be appropriate. Failure to timely and properly appeal shall deprive the city administrator of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

Such appeal shall be by writ of certiorari and the reviewing court shall be limited solely to the record created before the city administrator. Costs, but not attorney fees, shall be awarded to the prevailing party, at the sole discretion of the court. Failure to timely and properly file an appeal shall deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear such appeal.

The notice shall contain the street address or legal description sufficient to identify the premises, a description of the nuisance activities that have occurred at the premises, a statement indicating that the cost of future enforcement may be assessed as a special charge against the premises, and a notice as to the appeal rights of the owner. The notice shall be delivered by any one of these methods: 
a.  By personally serving the owner or by leaving the notice at the owner's abode or principal place of doing business with a person who is apparently in charge of the principal place of doing business;

c.  By publication as a Class 1 notice together with mailing the notice to the owner's last known residential or business address; the mailing may be omitted if the post office address cannot be ascertained with reasonable diligence. 
B.  Abatement Plan. Any owner receiving notice pursuant to this section shall, unless other arrangements are agreed to in writing, meet with the chief of police within five business days of receipt of such notice. The parties shall review the problems occurring at the property. Within ten business days of this meeting, the owner shall submit to the chief of police a written abatement plan to the end of public nuisance activity on the property. The plan shall also specify a name, address, and telephone number of a person living in the State of Wisconsin who can be contacted in the event of further police, fire or inspection contact.

Whenever the chief of police determines that additional public nuisance activity has occurred at a premises for which notice has been issued pursuant to this section, that this public nuisance activity has occurred not less than 15 business days after notice has been issued, and that reasonable efforts have not been made to abate the public nuisance activity, the chief of police shall calculate the cost of police response and enforcement for this and any subsequent public nuisance activities and shall cause such charges and administrative costs to be assessed and collected as a special charge against the premises. 
D.  Additional Public Nuisance Activity during Implementation of Agreed Upon Abatement Plan. If additional public nuisance activity occurs on a rental property subject to an abatement plan during the timely implementation of the agreed upon abatement plan, the property owner shall not be subject to penalties described in this Code. 
1.  A property owner is in compliance with this section if the property owner follows the abatement plan, or undertakes the remedies provided by Wis. Stats. ch. 704 as may be amended from time to time, or takes one or more legal steps as identified in the abatement plan to remove the tenants creating the public nuisance allowable under Wisconsin Statutes and Consumer Protection Rules when notified by the police department in writing that an illegal public nuisance exists.

CHAPTER 12.04. - STREETS AND SIDEWALKS GENERALLY 

Sec. 12.04.010. - Removal of rubbish and dirt from sidewalks. 
    No owner or occupant shall allow the sidewalk abutting on his/her premises to be littered with rubbish or dirt. If such owner or occupant shall refuse or fail to remove any such rubbish or dirt when notified to do so by the common council, or its designee, the city may cause the same to be done and report the cost thereof to the city administrator who shall spread the cost on the tax roll as a special tax against the premises, pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627 or such cost may be recovered in an action against the owner or occupant. 
(Prior Code, § 6-2-1; Code 1998, § 12.04.010) 
Sec. 12.04.020. - Construction and repair of sidewalks. 
A.  Construction and Repair Procedures. No person, whether owner, builder or contractor, shall build any new sidewalk or repair or renew, or cause to be built, repaired or renewed any existing sidewalk contrary to the provisions of this chapter, unless by petition to the common council and having permission therefore granted by the council, or upon the common council's own motion, or where such a change in the specifications hereinafter set forth shall be deemed in the best interests of the city. 
B.  Cost of Sidewalks. 
1.  All work by the city will be by contract to the lowest responsible bidder. 
2.  All work under city contract performed at the street intersections will be paid for by the city. 
3.  Because the city council has determined sidewalks to be in the public interest, the city will pay 75 percent of the per foot cost of sidewalk construction under city contract with the remaining 25 percent born by the abutting property. 
4.  For corner lots, Subsection B.3 of this section will apply to the long side and the city will pay all costs for city contract work on the short side, not to exceed 66 linear feet. 
5.  An informal public hearing will be held prior to passage of the resolution directing the laying, removal, replacement or repair of sidewalk. The common council may waive the informal public hearing by majority vote. 
C.  Standard Specifications for Sidewalk. 
1.  General. Concrete sidewalk construction shall meet the specifications and provisions set forth in this section and shall be constructed in locations and to line and grade as established by the city. All sidewalks constructed in the city shall conform to the line and grade established by the ordinances or resolutions of the city. Where no grade has been established as ascertained by the records, the director of public works shall prepare and report a grade for the approval of the common council; and, when the same has been established, the director of public works shall stake out the sidewalk as ordered by the council. No sidewalk shall be laid under the provisions of this section until a grade therefor has been established by the common council. 
2.  Subgrade. All earth, dirt and material shall be removed to a depth, not less than eight inches, ten inches across private driveways, below the grade line; and the space shall be filled with crushed stone, sand or gravel. The base shall be left four inches thick after being tamped, with the stone or gravel to be not larger than 11/2 inches in diameter and to be free from dirt, dust and foreign matter. Soft, porous and unsuitable subgrade material shall be removed and replaced with sand, gravel, or other satisfactory material, and the subgrade shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted and moistened immediately before the concrete is placed. On embankments, the subgrade shall extend at least one foot beyond each edge of the sidewalk. 
3.  Concrete. The minimum quantity of cement per cubic yard shall be six sacks of 94 pounds each. Concrete shall be mixed for at least one minute. Gravel shall be of good quality and washed. Concrete shall test 3,000 pounds compression in 28 days. 
4.  Forming. Concrete shall be placed in straight forms of wood or metal of sufficient strength to resist springing, tipping or other displacement during the process of depositing and consolidating the concrete. Concrete shall be placed in the forms on a moist subgrade, deposited just above the finished grade and consolidated and spaded sufficiently to bring the mortar to the surface and to prevent honeycombing. It shall then be struck off level with the top of the forms and finished with wooden flats. Forms shall be securely fastened, staked, braced and held firmly to required line and shall be sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mortar, and all forms shall remain in place for 24 hours after pour. 
5.  Jointing, Floating and Finishing. Soon after screening and while the concrete is still plastic, the surface shall be floated with wood, cork or metal floats or by a finishing machine. At all places where the sidewalk intersects another sidewalk or curb line, a one-half inch expansion joint shall be placed. Transverse expansion joints of one-half inch thick and four inches wide and five feet long or premolded material shall be located every 30 feet. Sidewalks must be marked off to make blocks five-foot square and be at right angles to the parallel lines. Any new sidewalk adjoining an old sidewalk or a sidewalk which abuts curb and gutter shall have one-half by four-inch expansion joints of premolded material. 
6.  Slope. 
a.  All forms must be approved by the director of public works or his/her designee before concrete is poured. To provide adequate drainage, the sidewalk shall slope toward the curb at a minimum rate of one-half inch per foot of width of sidewalk. All joints and edges shall be finished with a one-fourth inch radius edging tool. 
b.  In cases where the grade exceeds 15 percent, steps or special construction shall be required to fit the existing conditions. Such details shall be prepared by the city engineer and approved by the common council before construction of the walk is started. 
c.  Sidewalks shall be constructed within the limits of the street, and unless otherwise specifically indicated, there shall be a one-foot strip of street property left between the property line and the edge of the sidewalk. 
7.  Width and Thickness. Residential walks shall be a minimum of five feet in width and not less than four inches thick, or shall match existing sidewalk width in that block. However, in driveway approaches, the minimum sidewalk thickness shall be six inches. Such sidewalks shall have a grade one inch higher than the adjacent curb on the curb side of the sidewalk. All such sidewalks shall be constructed eight inches from the adjacent lot line. In the case of a laydown type curb, the pitch shall be one-half inch per foot from the curb in the parkway to the sidewalk with a three inch minimum. Sidewalks in front of commercial or industrial establishments shall have a width as determined by the common council and be five inches thick, except within driveway approaches where the minimum thickness shall be seven inches. 
8.  Finishing. The concrete shall be struck off true to grade, finished smooth and given a broom finish in transverse direction. Edges and joints shall be given a finish with a one-quarter inch radius edging tool. Dry cement shall not be spread on a wet surface to take up excess water. Finishing operations shall be delayed until water has disappeared. No tool marks shall be left on exposed surfaces. In case of rain, the walk shall be covered to protect the surface from being damaged. Walks shall be kept free from all traffic at normal temperatures for 48 hours and in cold weather (below 50 degrees Fahrenheit) for 96 hours. 
9.  Curing and Drying. As soon as any of the concrete work herein before mentioned has been finished and hardened sufficiently to prevent excessive marring of the surface, it shall be cured and protected against rapid drying. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be deemed sufficient cause for suspension of the work. Curing shall be accomplished by the "impervious coating," "wet fabric" or "paper" methods. For impervious coating or membrane curing, only those materials meeting requirements of ASTM Spec. C156-44T, Method of Test for Efficiency of Materials for Curing Concrete shall be used. These specifications are adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein. 
10.  Cold Weather Requirements. When the temperature is less than 40 degrees Fahrenheit, all concrete placed in the forms shall have a temperature between 50 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and shall meet the requirements as per Wisconsin Department of Transportation specifications for cold weather concrete. 
11.  Minor Repairs. Nothing in this section shall apply to minor repairs, the cost of which does not exceed $500.00; such repairs may be made at the direction of the director of public works without notice, and the cost thereof may be charged to the abutting property owner in the same manner as provided in this section for major repairs. 
D.  Illegal Sidewalks. No sidewalk which shall be constructed contrary to the provisions of this section shall be considered a legal sidewalk and the same may be ordered to be replaced with a legal sidewalk and with one that is in conformity with this section, the same as if no sidewalk whatsoever had been built or constructed in the place where any such sidewalk is located.

H.  Bond. 
1.  Before a permit for excavating or opening any public street, sidewalk, ditch, alley or public right-of-way may be issued, the applicant may be required to execute and deposit with the city a bond in the amount of $2,000.00, conditioned that he/she will indemnify and save harmless the city and its officers from all liability for accidents and damage caused by any of the work covered by his/her permit, and that he/she will fill up and place in good and safe condition all excavations and openings made in the street, and will replace and restore the pavement over any opening he/she may make as near as can be to the state and condition in which he/she found it, and keep and maintain the same in such condition, normal wear and tear excepted, to the satisfaction of the director of public works for a period of one year, and that he/she will pay all fines of forfeitures imposed upon him/her for any violation of any rule, regulation or ordinance governing street openings or drainlaying adopted by the common council and will repair any damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the excavation in accordance with the ordinances, rules and regulations of the city. Such bond shall also guarantee that, if the city shall elect to make the street repair, the person opening the street will pay all costs of making such repair and of maintaining the same for one year. Recovery on such bond for any accident, injury, violation of law, ordinance, rule or regulation shall not exhaust the bond but it shall cover any and all accidents, injuries or violation of law during the period of excavation for which it is given. 
2.  An annual bond may be given under this section covering all excavation work done by the principal for one year beginning January 1, which shall be conditioned as specified above and in the amount determined by the director of public works as necessary to adequately protect the public and the city. 
3.  Faulty work or materials shall be immediately replaced by the permittee upon notice by the city. Failure to correct deficiencies shall result in a one-year revocation of the right to obtain a street opening permit. The director of public works shall repair the deficiencies and bill the permittee for all labor, materials and equipment used plus 20 percent for administration. 
4.  The person who does such restoration shall be responsible therefor for one year from the date of the completion of the work and shall file a written guarantee or surety bond to that effect with the city in an amount determined by the director of public works. 
5.  Whenever the common council shall find that any such work has become defective within one year of the date of completion, it shall give written notice thereof to the contractor or to his/her surety stating the defect, the work to be done, the cost thereof and the period of time deemed by the common council to be reasonably necessary to complete the work. After receipt of such notice, the contractor or the surety must, within the time specified, repair the defect or indemnify the city for the cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. 
I.  Public Utilities. All public utilities as defined in Wis. Stats. § 196.01 are required to be bound by the terms and conditions of this section and Section 12.04.040, as well as any and all subsections thereunder, except that a public utility as defined within this section shall not be required to post the indemnity bond. 
(Prior Code, § 6-2-3; Code 1998, § 12.04.030) 
Sec. 12.04.040. - Regulations governing excavations and openings. 
A.  Frozen Ground. No openings in the streets, alleys, sidewalks or public ways shall be permitted between November 15 and May 1 except where it is determined by the director of public works or his/her designee to be an emergency excavation. 
B.  Protection of Public. 
1.  Every opening and excavation shall be enclosed with sufficient barriers, signing, and such other traffic control devices as may be required by the city and in accordance with Section VI of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Sufficient warning lights shall be kept on from sunrise to sunset. No open flame warning devices shall be used. Except by special permission from the director of public works, no trench shall be excavated more than 250 feet in advance of pipe or conduit laying nor left unfilled more than 500 feet from where pipe or conduit has been laid. 
2.  All necessary precautions shall be taken to guard the public effectively from accidents or damage to persons or property through the period of the work. Each person making such opening shall be held liable for all damages, including costs incurred by the city in defending any action brought against it for damages, as well as cost of any appeal, that may result from the neglect by such person or his/her employees of any necessary precaution against injury or damage to persons, vehicles or property of any kind. 
3.  Unless otherwise approved, a minimum of one lane of traffic in each direction shall be provided. Every effort shall be made on the part of the permittee to provide reasonable access to all properties adjacent to his/her project. In the event traffic is limited to less than one lane in each direction, a flagman or temporary traffic control signal shall be provided so as to safely cycle traffic in each direction past the work area. 
4.  The permittee shall perform the work in such a manner so as not to disrupt the flow of traffic in the area or endanger the safety of workpersons or passersby. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to prevent traffic backup during construction operation. The permittee shall notify the director of public works 24 hours prior to commencement of excavation of the location and extent of the excavation, unless the excavation is an emergency excavation as identified in this section. 
5.  When the operations will result in the loss of any utility service to private properties, the private properties shall be notified in writing or by personal contact at least 12 hours prior to the loss of service, unless the operations are part of an emergency excavation as defined in Subsection G of this section. 
C.  Pavement Removal. 
1.  Removal of existing pavement shall be to neat, straight lines. The permittee shall make a final saw cut in the existing pavement after backfilling. Excavations shall be kept to the minimum possible and acceptable for the convenience and safe performance of his/her work and in accordance with all applicable codes and regulations. 
2.  If the pavement is damaged during excavation beyond the original saw cut lines, it shall be saw cut again along neat, straight lines. The finished saw cut shall leave a regular rectangular section for pavement replacement. Should the street opening occur within adjacent or close to an existing patch or require more than one opening within a short distance, the permittee shall identify and locate the existing patches or additional openings on the permit application form. The director of public works or his/her designee shall, on the basis of an on-site inspection, approximate the boundaries of the pavement replacement area. 
3.  Pavement replacement areas with the long dimension in the direction of travel shall have the long dimension parallel with the curb line or the direction of travel. Pavement replacement areas in concrete pavements shall be parallel with or at right angles to the direction of travel. 
4.  The director of public works or his/her designee may order the permittee to remove and replace up to one full lane width of pavement along the patched or excavated area. Special care shall be taken with concrete pavement to produce a vertical face on the existing concrete at the point of the saw cut to ensure a full depth of concrete at the joint. 
D.  Excavation. 
1.  All excavated material shall be piled in a manner such that pedestrian and motor traffic is not unnecessarily disrupted. Gutters shall be kept clear or other satisfactory provisions made for street drainage, and natural watercourses shall not be obstructed. 
2.  Excavated material to be used for backfilling of the trench must be so handled and placed as to be of as little inconvenience as practical to public travel and adjoining tenants. 
E.  Backfilling. 
1.  All backfill material shall be free from cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable or organic matter, boulders, rocks or stones greater than eight inches in their greatest dimension, frozen lumps or other material which, in the opinion of the director of public works or his/her designee, is unsuitable. 
2.  In refilling the excavation, if there is not sufficient material excavated suitable for refilling, the deficiency shall be made up with material, approved prior to use by the director of public works or his/her designee, hauled in. 
3.  Wherever an excavation crosses an existing utility, pipe or other structure, backfill shall be carefully compacted in stages from the bottom of the excavation. Any sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water, telephone, natural gas or other service shall not be interrupted by the permittee. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to have the various utilities locate and mark their facilities prior to excavation. 
4.  Mechanical compaction shall be used on all materials used for trench backfill. Each layer (12-inch maximum) shall be uniformly compacted. Compaction or consolidation by flooding shall not be permitted. Earth must be puddled or laid in layers not more than 12 inches in depth and each layer rammed and tamped to prevent settling. The Public Works Department will test the fill to meet the city's specifications. Contractors will be instructed by the city inspector, if he/she meets the specifications, to proceed to fill the opening. 
5.  All excavations shall be subject to testing by the city. Backfilled material not achieving the above compaction requirements shall be removed and recompacted by the permittee. The cost of any retesting shall be paid by the permittee. 
6.  When the sides of the trench will not stand perpendicular, sheathing and braces shall be used to prevent caving. No timber, bracing, lagging, sheathing or other lumber shall be left in any trench. At no time shall any street pavements be permitted to overhang the excavation. 
F.  Notice. It shall be the duty of the permittee to notify the director of public works and all public and private individuals, firms and corporations affected by the work to be done at least one business day before such work is to commence. The director of public works shall also be notified at least four hours prior to backfilling and/or restoring the surface. 
G.  Pavement Replacement and Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter and Driveway Restoration. 
1.  Backfill material shall be left below the original surface to allow for five inches of three-inch crushed stone and four inches of three-quarter-inch crushed stone, plus the thickness of the required pavement structure. If paving will not occur as part of the initial street restoration operation, the balance of the opening to the original surface elevation shall be backfilled with compacted three-quarter-inch crushed stone. 
2.  Bituminous pavement shall be placed the full depth of the existing pavement or three inches, whichever is greater. Bituminous pavement shall be placed in a maximum of 11/2 inch layers with each layer compacted to maximum density and shall consist of Wisconsin Department of Transportation Gradation No. 1 for the binder course and Wisconsin Department of Transportation No. 3 for the surface course. The finished surface shall be smooth and free of surface irregularities and shall match the existing pavement and any castings or street appurtenances. Allowable deviations shall be no more than one-quarter inch as measured with a ten-foot straight edge. 
3.  Concrete pavement shall be placed to the full depth of the existing pavement or seven inches, whichever is greater. Concrete used shall not contain calcium chloride. The surface shall be given a light broom finish. The edges shall be tooled to prevent spalling at the saw cut edge. The surface shall be evenly and completely sealed with a white pigmented curing compound. The surface shall be protected from traffic for a minimum of three days. Tie bars shall be installed as directed by the director of public works or his/her designee. 
4.  All permanent restoration of street, curb and gutter shall be of the same type and thickness as the curb and gutter which abuts. The grade of the restored curb and gutter shall conform with the grade of the existing adjacent curb and gutter. 
5.  All permanent restoration of driveways and sidewalks shall conform to the manner of construction as originally placed and to the lines and grades as given by the city engineer. No patching of concrete driveway areas will be allowed between joints or dummy joints. 
6.  Sidewalks shall be replaced the full width of the walk and minimum length shall be 60 inches. All replaced walk shall be four inches thick, except at driveways where it shall be six inches thick. The new walk shall slope to conform to existing construction across the width of the walk toward the street. 
7.  In emergency excavations during winter months when it is not possible to replace the removed pavement with a like material, the excavation shall be temporarily resurfaced with a minimum of 31/2 inches of cold mix bituminous material. This temporary wearing surface shall be compacted and rolled smooth. These temporary wearing surfaces shall be removed and replaced with material as specified above by not later than the following June 1, except as provided above. Permanent pavements shall be replaced within 60 days of the date of the permit. 
8.  When a street is reconstructed, utility laterals shall also be installed, including sump pump laterals, even if not immediately needed. 
H.  Emergency Excavation. In the event of an emergency, any person, firm or corporation owning or controlling any sewer, gas main, water main, conduit or other utility in or under any public street, alley easement, way or ground and his/her agents and employees may take immediate proper emergency measures to remedy dangerous conditions for the protection of property, life, health or safety without obtaining an excavation permit, provided that such person, firm or corporation shall apply for an excavation permit not later than the next business day and shall notify city officials immediately. 
I.  Excavation in New Streets Limited. Whenever the city determines to provide for the permanent improvement or repaving of any street, such determination shall be made not less than 30 days before the work of improvement or repaving shall begin. Immediately after such determination, the city shall notify in writing each person, utility or other agency owning or controlling any sewer, water main, conduit or other utility in or under the street or any real property abutting the street, that all such excavation work in such street must be completed within 30 days. After such permanent improvement or repaving, no permit shall be issued to open or excavate the street for a period of five years after the date of improvement or repaving unless, in the opinion of the common council, or committee thereof, conditions exist which make it absolutely essential that the permit be issued. Every effort shall be made to place gas, electric, telephone and television cable lines in street terraces. 
J.  Repair by City. The city may elect to make the pavement repair for any street or sidewalk opening, in which case the cost of making such repair and of maintaining it for one year shall be charged to the person making the street opening. In the event such charges are not paid within 90 days of actual notice of the same having been furnished to the applicant and owner of the premises for which the permit was issued, it shall become a lien against the premises and thereafter be assessed and collected as a special tax. 
(Prior Code, § 6-2-4; Code 1998, § 12.04.040) 
Sec. 12.04.050. - Obstructions and encroachments.

Sec. 12.04.110. - Street numbers. 
A.  Numbering System Established. A uniform system of numbering houses and buildings fronting on all streets, avenues and public ways in the city is established. 
B.  Base Lines. Webster Avenue shall be the base line for numbering along all streets running east and west. Main Street shall be the base line for numbering along all streets running north and south. 
C.  Numbering. 
1.  The numbering for each street shall begin at the base line. The numbers within the first block shall be from 100 through 199 and the numbers in each succeeding block shall increase from the base line in units of 100, namely, the first block shall be 100 through 199, the second block shall be 200 through 299, the third block shall be 300 through 399, etc. There shall be assigned 100 numbers to each block, square or space that would be one block or square, if streets each way were so extended as to intersect each other, and one number shall be assigned to each 15 feet of frontage. In blocks or equivalent space longer than 750 feet which is not intersected by a street, the total length of space divided by 50 shall be used to determine the feet of frontage assigned to each number. 
2.  The numbers assigned to each block shall be as shown on the map entitled, "A Building Numbering System for the City of Omro, Winnebago County, Wisconsin," which map is made a part of this section and is on file with the city administrator. Whenever a new street, not appearing on such map, shall be laid out, the city administrator shall assign numbers to the buildings on such street in accordance with this section and in such a manner as to conform, as nearly as possible, with the numbers which are shown on the map for neighboring streets running in the same general direction. 
3.  All buildings and lots on diagonal streets shall be numbered the same as north and south streets if the diagonal runs more from the north to the south, and the same as east and west streets if the diagonal runs more from the east to the west. 
4.  All lots and houses on the north and west side of any street shall be numbered with odd numbers, each commencing with the 100 assigned to that block, and shall increase from the base line, one number for each 15 feet of frontage or fraction thereof, except as provided in this subsection. Where any building has more than one door serving separate occupants, a separate number shall be assigned to each door serving a separate occupant, provided the building is 15 feet or more in width. If the building is not 15 feet or more in width and the entrances are not that far apart, the next consecutive number shall be marked fractional. Buildings fronting on two or more streets shall have a number assigned only to the main entrance, unless other entrances serve different occupants. 
5.  All streets not extending through to the base line shall be assigned the same relative numbers as if such street had extended to such base line. 
D.  Council to Assign Numbers. The common council shall make the necessary survey and assign to each house and building located on any street, avenue, alley or highway in the city its respective number under the uniform system provided for in this section. Within 60 days after the council has completed such survey and assigned to each building its respective number or numbers, the owner or occupant thereof or their agent, shall cause the number to be placed on the respective house or building. 
E.  Numbers. 
1.  All numbers shall be no less than three inches high. Numbers shall be made only of such material as is rustproof. Where a lighted fixture is desired, its installation shall conform with state law and city ordinances. Numbers assigned to the respective houses shall be obtained at the city administrator's office. The council may declare such forms of numbers as it may deem unsightly or illegible as a public nuisance, and require such numbers to be replaced. Such action would require a majority vote of the council. 
2.  All numbers shall be conspicuously placed immediately above, on or at the side of the proper door of each building so that the number can be seen plainly from the street. Whenever any building is situated more than 50 feet from the street line, the number of such building shall be conspicuously displayed at the street line, near the walk, driveway or common entrance to such building and upon a gate post, fence, tree post or other appropriate place easily discernible from the street. 
3.  Where only one number can be assigned to any house or building, the owner, occupant or agent of such house or building, who shall desire distinctive numbers for the upper and lower portion of any such house or building, or for any part of such house or building, fronting on any street, shall use the suffix, "A," "B," "C," etc., as may be required. 
F.  Plats. To facilitate the correct numbering of houses, a plat book of all streets, avenues and public highways within the city, showing the proper numbers of all lots or houses fronting upon all streets, avenues or highways, shall be kept on file in the office of the city administrator. Such plats shall be open to inspection during the office hours of the city administrator. 
G.  Duty of City Administrator. The city administrator shall inform any party applying therefor of the number or numbers belonging or embraced within such lot or property as provided herein. If the city administrator has any doubt as to the proper number to be assigned, he/she shall determine the number of such lot or building. 
H.  Newly Constructed Buildings. Whenever any house, building or structure shall be hereafter erected or located in the city, in order to preserve the continuity and uniformity of numbers of the houses, buildings and structures, the owner or his/her agent shall procure the correct number or numbers as designated by the city administrator for the property and shall immediately fasten such number or numbers so assigned upon the building as provided herein. No building permit shall be issued for any house, building or structure until the owner has procured from the city administrator the official number of the premises. 
I.  Penalty. If the owner of any building required to be numbered by this section shall neglect for 60 days to attach and maintain the proper number on such building, the city administrator shall serve notice requiring such owner or occupant to properly number the same within ten days. If the owner or occupant does not attach the number within ten days, he/she shall be in violation of this section and subject to a penalty as provided in Chapter 1.24.

I.  Reserved Permit Cancellation. The permit fee for the exclusive use of park facilities will not be refunded if a cancellation occurs.

Lots, or fractions of lots, for which lot deeds have been issued by the city, will not thereafter be divided except by consent of the city. All lots are exempt from taxation and cannot be seized for debt (except those owed to the cemetery) nor can they be mortgaged. 
3.  All repossessed vacant grave spaces shall be subject to the same fees and charges. 
4.  The lot owner shall have acquired the lot for interment of himself and members of his/her family. However, the lot owner may grant written permission (which must be notarized and placed on file with the city administrator) for the burial of other persons. No corpse shall be interred in a lot except the corpse of one having an interest therein, or a relative, or the husband, or wife of such person, or his/her relative, except by the consent of all persons having an interest in the lot. 
B.  Unless otherwise directed in writing and filed with the city clerk, the lot owner, his/her devisees, or his/her heirs, the cemetery will permit the interment of members of his/her family at the request of any interested person upon proof of eligibility for burial as follows: 
1.  The surviving spouse of the lot owner shall have the first right to interment or to direct the right of interment.

3.  In the event the owner, his/her devisees or heirs shall not have arranged for future interments, then the devisees or the heirs, as the case may be, of such owner, shall have the right to interment in order of their need. 
C.  All burial rights in cemetery lots purchased from the city occupy the same position as real estate at the death of the owner.

In case of the death of a lot owner, when the cemetery lot is disposed of by a will, and when ownership is to be determined, a certified copy of the will must be delivered to the city clerk before the city will recognize the change of ownership. If the deceased lot owner left no will, satisfactory proof of descent must be provided.

3.  No owner of a cemetery lot shall sell, transfer or assign the same or the unused portion thereof to any other person without the cemetery operator's consent.

A.  No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders, rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause injury to or disintegration of the service pipe, unless adequate means of protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may be approved by the utility. Service pipes passing through curb or retaining walls shall be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel space or pipe casing, not less than twice the diameter of the service connection. The space between the service pipe and channel or pipe casing shall be filled and lightly caulked with an oakum, mastic cement, or other resilient material, and made impervious to moisture. 
B.  In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected against injury by carefully hand tamping the ground filling, free from hard lumps, rocks, stones, or other injurious material, around and at least six inches over the pipe. 
C.  All water supplies shall be of undiminished size from the street main in to the point of meter placement. Beyond the meter outlet valve the piping shall be sized and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an equitable distribution of water supply for the greatest probable number of fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously.

A.  In cases where a new customer whose service is to be metered installs the original service piping or where an existing metered customer changes his/her service piping for his/her own convenience, or where an existing flat rate customer requests to be metered, the customer shall, at his/her expense, provide a suitable location and the proper connections for the meter. The water utility should be consulted as to the type and size of meter setting. Where it is possible to set meters in the basement, or other suitable place within the building, a short nipple shall be inserted after the stop and waste cock, then a union, and then another nipple and coupling of the proper length. The nipple attached to the union and coupling shall be cut to a standard length provided by the plans of the utility (it may require a horizontal run of 18 inches in such pipe line) which may later be removed for the insertion of the meter into the supply line. 
B.  No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service.

Sec. 13.04.120. - Failure to read meters. 
A.  Where the utility is unable to read a meter after two successive attempts, the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed, or the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding quarter will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding month. Only in unusual cases or where approval is obtained by the customer shall more than two consecutive estimated bills be rendered. 
B.  If the meter is damaged or fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past year unless there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method.

It is expressly stipulated that no claim shall be made against the city or acting representative by reason of the breaking, clogging, stoppage, or freezing of any service pipes; nor from any damage arising from repairing mains, making connections or extensions or any other work that may be deemed necessary. The right is reserved to cut off the service at any time for the purpose of repairs or any other necessary purpose, any permit granted or regulations to the contrary notwithstanding. Whenever it shall become necessary to shut off the sewer within any portion of the city or its sewer service area, the city clerk shall, if practical, give notice to each consumer within the city or its sewer service area, of the time when such service will be shut off. 
M.  Excavations. In making excavations in streets or highways for laying service pipe or making repairs, the paving and the earth moved must be deposited in a manner that will occasion the least inconvenience to the public. Prior to excavation or work in the public right-of-way, notification and permits if required must be obtained from the city. 
1.  No person shall leave any such excavation made in any street or highway open at any time without barricades; and during the night, warning lights must be maintained at such excavations. All work in the public roadways must be performed subject to the approval of and under the requirements of the city. 
2.  In backfilling the opening, after the service pipes are laid, the earth must be laid in layers of not more than nine inches in depth, and each layer thoroughly compacted to prevent settling. This work, together with the replacing of sidewalks, gravel, and paving, must be done to make the street, at a minimum, as good as before it was disturbed, and satisfactory to the city. 
N.  Tapping the Mains. No person, except those having special permission from the city council or persons in their service and approved by them, will be permitted, under any circumstances, to tap the mains or collection pipes. The kind and size of the connection shall be that specified in the permits or order from the city council to ensure that new sewers and connections to the wastewater collection system are properly designed and constructed. 
1.  Pipes should always be tapped on a 45-degree angle from a horizontal plane, and not within six inches (15 centimeters) of the joint, or within 24 inches (60 centimeters) of another lateral connection. All service connections to mains must comply with state plumbing code. Service connections to an existing sewer main shall be made by means of a saddled wye or specially adapted tee. 
O.  Installation of Private Laterals. All service pipes (laterals) on private property will be installed in accordance with Wis. Admin. Code ch. SPS 382 "Design, Construction, Installation, Supervision and Inspection of Plumbing." All private laterals shall, as a minimum, be Schedule 40 PVC pipe. 
1.  All laterals will be inspected. The building sewer and/or private interceptor main sewer shall be inspected upon completion of placement of the pipe and before backfilling and tested before or after backfilling. The applicant for a lateral connection permit shall notify the city when the private lateral is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer and the lateral shall be inspected by the city prior to backfilling. 
P.  Extensions. The city shall extend sewer mains in accordance with the following charges and the following conditions: 
1.  When an extension main is desired by a prospective user, such person shall make an application for such an extension in writing to the city council by filing a written application for the same with the city clerk. After the filing of such an application, the city engineer shall first consider the feasibility of the additional service extension with respect to the available treatment capacity. If extension appears feasible, then the city engineer shall determine the location of the next manhole or manholes, or the means by which service may be extended. Next, the city engineer shall design the extension, taking into consideration the prospective demands for service, the capacity of downstream facilities, and the orderly development of the particular area and obtain all local and state approvals. No extension shall be made for a distance less than to the next manhole. All sewer extensions shall be constructed in compliance with local and state laws, ordinances, and regulations. 
2.  The person who requests the extension shall pay the entire cost of such extension including the manhole or manholes that are part of the extension. If more than one user is involved, the entire cost shall be divided among these users, as they mutually agree to. The assessment of cost and method of payment may be established by the city council in a manner similar to that established for the initial sewer project. 
Q.  Additional Authority. The city has established a specific connection charge for any connection to the wastewater collection system beyond the initial construction. It is further provided that the city may amend or alter any connection charge after its establishment under the terms of this section or previous ordinance or resolution. 
R.  State of Wisconsin Statutes and Administrative Code Provisions. In addition to the provisions provided in this section, all applicable State of Wisconsin Statutes and Wisconsin Administrative Code Provisions shall apply. The city has the authority to enforce any such statute or code. If there is a conflict between this section and state statutes or the administrative code, the most restrictive requirements shall govern.

A.  Policy. It shall be the policy of the city council to obtain sufficient revenues to pay the debt service costs and the costs of the operation, maintenance, and equipment replacement of the wastewater treatment and collection system through a system of sewer service charges as defined in this chapter. The system shall ensure that each user of the system pays a proportionate share of the cost of such facilities. 
B.  Assignment of Sewer Users. The city will assign sewer users into appropriate sewer service charge categories if wastewater sampling programs and other related information indicate a change of categories is necessary. 
C.  User Charge Methodology. The following methodology shall be used to calculate the debt service and operation, maintenance and repair (OM&R) charges for the collection and treatment of city wastewater: 
1.  Quarterly Fixed Charge. The quarterly fixed charge is a charge imposed upon all connections to the system. The fixed charge shall be established by the city and applied to all users. This cost is based entirely on meter size and is independent of wastewater flow. The fixed charge shall be applied to debt service with any remaining amounts applied to the operating costs of the city until such time that the city project financing is paid and the fixed charge can be deleted. 
2.  Quarterly Variable OM&R Charge. The quarterly variable OM&R charge shall be paid by all users based on the cost per 1,000 gallons of flow. The total annual costs are divided by the total annual loadings to obtain the unit cost per billing parameter. 
(Code 1998, § 13.08.060; Ord. No. 421(part), 2006) 
Sec. 13.08.070. - Septic tank and holding tank waste. 
A.  Septic Tanks and Holding Tanks Prohibited.

Sampling methods, locations, times, durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the city. 
2.  Determination of the character and concentration of wastewater shall be made by the person discharging them or his/her agent, as designated and required by the city. The city may also make its own analyses of the wastes and these determinations shall be used as a basis for charges. If the person discharging the waste contests the determination, the city may elect to have an independent laboratory determine the character and concentration of the waste. Such independent laboratory shall be acceptable to both the city and the person discharging the waste. The discharger shall assume all costs incurred by the independent laboratory in making the determination. 
D.  Submission of Information. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to any proposed pretreatment, grease trap, or sand interceptor shall be submitted for review of the city prior to the start of construction if the effluent from such facilities is to be discharged into the public sewers. 
E.  Submission of Basic Data. Commercial users desiring to make a new connection to a public sewer for discharging wastes shall prepare and file with the city a report that shall include actual or predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the waste to be discharged. 
F.  Time Schedule. For a new hook-up to the wastewater collection system which requires a grease trap or sand interceptor, such grease trap or sand interceptor shall be installed by the owner, and inspected and approved by the city prior to initiating wastewater flow to the city. 
1.  For an existing discharger, such grease trap or sand interceptor shall be installed by the owner, and inspected and approved by the city within 90 days of notification of such requirement. 
2.  When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would create an unreasonable burden on the person proposing to discharge a waste, to comply with the time schedule imposed in this section, a request for extension of the time may be presented for consideration by the city council. 
G.  Cost. The city shall have the authority to install any pretreatment system if the owner does not comply with these requirements within 90 days of notification and charge the owner for all costs incurred or at its option place this cost as a lien on the owner's property taxes.

B.  Fixed Charge. The city shall charge the district a fixed charge to recover the district's share of the city's fixed asset costs (other than those fixed asset costs related to the city's wastewater collection system). 
1.  The city's fixed charge shall be comprised of debt service, debt service coverage at a rate of 1.25 times lending requirements, and equipment replacement funds. 
2.  The fixed asset costs do not change based on volume of wastewater conveyed to the treatment plant, therefore, the fixed charge is allocated to customers based on connections and meter equivalents. 
3.  The district's share of fixed asset costs, other than those fixed asset costs related to the city's wastewater collection system) is based on the number of connections to the District's system. 
4.  All fixed charges collected from the district shall be used for the equipment replacement fund, debt service or debt service reserves for capital improvements to the city's wastewater system (other than the city's collection system) or placed in a reserve, replacement or depreciation fund to be used for future capital improvements to the city's wastewater system (other than the city's collection system). 
C.  Wholesale Volume Charge. The city shall charge the district a wholesale volume charge equal to the district's volume of wastewater conveyed by the district to the city's wastewater treatment plant multiplied by the wholesale volumetric rate. The wholesale volumetric rate shall be set by the common council taking into account the city's operation and maintenance costs (other than those operation and maintenance costs related to the city's wastewater collection system), and the volume of all wastewater treated at the wastewater treatment plant. 
D.  Billing Dates and Payment Terms . The city will bill the District quarterly for services rendered. Invoices shall be due and paid in full within 40 days of the date of mailing. Payment received by the city after the due date will be subject to a three percent late payment charge.

Any conversion to multi-family or condominium use that increases the number of residential equivalents on a property shall be subject to additional connection fees. 
B.  A property loses its eligible property status if it converts from an existing residential use to industrial or commercial use unless the district receives city common council approval for the conversion, and the district pays any additional connection fees owed as a result of the conversion. 
C.  A property loses its eligible property status if it discharges or will discharge wastewater that exceeds normal domestic strength wastewater unless the district receives city common council approval for the discharge of wastewater exceeding normal domestic strength waste from that property.

CHAPTER 13.12. - UTILITIES 

Sec. 13.12.010. - Purpose. 
    It is the intention of the city to require all utilities to be buried underground wherever it is consistent with the law and existing development.

This requirement shall include feeder cables and individual service connections. The planning commission may waive this requirement for any of the following reasons: 
1.  The location, topography, soil, solid rock, boulders, or other physical conditions would make underground installation unreasonable or impractical; or 
2.  The lots to be served by the facilities can be served directly from existing overhead facilities. 
(Code 1998, § 13.12.020; Ord. No. 401(part), 2005) 
Sec. 13.12.030. - Utilities in municipal right-of-way.

(Code 1998, § 15.20.030; Ord. No. 340(part), 1996) 
Sec. 15.20.040. - Historic preservation commission; powers and duties. 
A.  Power to Designate. Upon nomination of a property improvement or site as historic under Section 15.20.030C, the commission shall have the power, subject to Section 15.20.050, to designate historic structures and historic sites and to recommend designation of nominated historic districts.

Once designated, such historic structures, sites, and districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter. A nomination by a property owner allows, but does not require, the commission to designate the nominated structure or site as "historical" as defined hereunder. Upon nomination, the commission is authorized to proceed under the terms and conditions as referenced hereunder. Once designated, a structure, site or district shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter notwithstanding a subsequent sale/conveyance of the property to a subsequent legal owner of record. 
B.  Regulation of Construction, Reconstruction, Alteration and Demolition. 
1.  No owner or person in charge of a designated historic structure, historic site, or structure within a historic district shall reconstruct, alter or demolish all or any part of the exterior of such property or construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such designated property or demolish such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the commission. The building inspector shall not issue a permit for any such work on a designated building, unless such certificate has been granted by the commission. 
2.  Upon filing of any application for a certificate of appropriateness with the commission, the commission shall approve the application unless: 
a.  In the case of a designated historic structure or historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or adversely affect any exterior feature of the improvement or site upon which the work is to be done; 
b.  In the case of the construction of a new improvement upon a historic site, or within a historic district, the exterior of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or within the district; 
c.  In the case of any property located in a historic district, the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration or demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this chapter and to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for the district; 
d.  The building or structure is of such architectural or historical significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the city;

The commission shall make its decision on whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness within 30 days of the filing of the application. 
4.  The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required by the city. A building permit or other municipal permit shall be null and void if obtained without the acquisition of a certificate of appropriateness when required under the terms of this chapter. 
5.  Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken without a certificate of appropriateness provided that the work involves repairs to existing features of a historic structure or site or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the structure or site and does not require the issuance of a building permit. 
C.  Appeals. Should the commission fail to issue a certificate of appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the applicable guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the city council within 30 days. In addition, if the commission fails to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall, with the cooperation of the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a certificate of appropriateness. 
D.  Recognition of Historic Structures, Sites and Districts.

For preservation purposes, the commission may, upon nomination by all the affected legal owners of record of property to be included within a proposed district, recommend a geographically defined area within the city to be designated as a historic district to the city council and may prepare a historic preservation plan for such area. A historic district may be designated for any geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the city, upon appropriate nomination by all the affected property owners and after application of the criteria in Section 15.20.030. Each historic preservation plan prepared for or by the commission shall include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development, and a statement of preservation objectives. No property owner, at the time of the nomination, may have his/her property included in the district unless the property owner consents to the nomination in writing. Upon designation, the property/district boundaries so designated as defined by the property owners joining in the nomination for the formation of the historic district, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter which shall bind all subsequent purchases and later legal owners of record within the affected geographic area.

48.  Nonconforming structure means an existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use. However, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.) 
49.  Nonconforming use means an existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building that is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies, such as a residence in the floodway. 
50.  Obstruction to flow means any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development alone or together with any future development will cause an increase in regional flood height.

Sec. 15.24.080. - Establishment of districts. 
    The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts defined in Section 15.24.060 of this chapter and as follows: 
A.  The floodway district (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters. 
B.  The floodfringe district (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limits and the floodway. 
C.  The general floodplain district (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood. It includes both the floodway and floodfringe districts. 
(Code 1998, § 15.24.080; Ord. No. 424(part), 2006) 
Sec. 15.24.090. - Locating floodplain boundaries. 
    Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection A or B of this section. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Section 15.24.240. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to Section 15.24.230C.3 of this chapter and the criteria in Subsections A and B of this section. Note: where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to Section 15.24.240. 
A.  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
B.  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the department. 
(Code 1998, § 15.24.090; Ord. No. 424(part), 2006) 
Sec. 15.24.100. - Removal of lands from floodplain. 
    Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Section 15.24.240 of this chapter. This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a letter of map change (LOMC).

Sec. 15.24.140. - Interpretation of provisions. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter required by Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116 is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(Code 1998, § 15.24.140; Ord. No. 424(part), 2006) 
Sec. 15.24.150. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The flood protection standards in this chapter are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this chapter create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.

The municipality shall keep a record that lists all nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, their present equalized assessed value, the cost of all modifications or additions that have been permitted, and the percentage of the structure's total current value those modifications represent. 
d.  No modification or addition to any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use, which over the life of the structure would exceed 50 percent of its present equalized assessed value, shall be allowed unless the entire structure is permanently changed to a conforming structure with a conforming use in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter. Contiguous dry land access must be provided for residential and commercial uses in compliance with Section 15.24.210C.1. The costs of elevating a nonconforming building or a building with a nonconforming use to the flood protection elevation are excluded from the 50 percent provisions of this subsection. 
e.  Except. 
i.  Except as provided in Subsection A.2.e.ii of this section, if any nonconforming structure or any structure with a nonconforming use is destroyed or is substantially damaged, it cannot be replaced, reconstructed or rebuilt unless the use and the structure meet the current chapter requirements. A structure is considered substantially damaged if the total cost to restore the structure to its pre-damaged condition exceeds 50 percent of the structure's present equalized assessed value. 
ii.  For nonconforming buildings that are damaged or destroyed by a nonflood disaster, the repair or reconstruction of any such nonconforming building may be permitted in order to restore it after the nonflood disaster, provided that the nonconforming building will meet all of the minimum requirements under applicable FEMA regulations (44 CFR 60), or the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
f.  A nonconforming historic structure may be altered if the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure, the alteration will comply with Section 15.24.190C.1, flood-resistant materials are used, and construction practices and floodproofing methods that comply with Section 15.24.230E are used. 
B.  Floodway Areas.

CHAPTER 15.28. - SHORELAND-WETLAND REGULATIONS 

Sec. 15.28.010. - Statutory authorization. 
    The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted pursuant to the authorization Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 281.31. 
(Code 1998, § 15.28.010; Ord. No. 279(part), 1988) 
Sec. 15.28.020. - Findings and purpose. 
    Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the city would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. The Legislature of Wisconsin has delegated responsibility to all municipalities to: 
A.  Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare; 
B.  Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands; 
C.  Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
D.  Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat; 
E.  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and 
F.  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities. 
(Code 1998, § 15.28.020; Ord. No. 279(part), 1988) 
Sec. 15.28.030. - Definitions. 
A.  For the purpose of enforcing and administering this chapter, the terms or words used in this chapter shall be interpreted as follows: Words used in the present tense include the future; words in the singular number include the plural number; words in the plural number include the singular number. The word "shall" is mandatory, not permissive. All distances, unless otherwise specified, shall be measured horizontally. 
B.  As used in this chapter: 
1.  Accessory structure or use means a detached subordinate structure or a use which is clearly incidental to and customarily found in connection with the principal structure or use to which it is related, and which is located on the same lot as that of the principal structure or use. 
2.  Boathouse means a permanent structure used for the storage of watercraft and associated materials and includes all structures which are totally enclosed, have roofs or walls or any combination of structural parts. 
3.  Class 2 public notice means publication of a public hearing notice under Wis. Stats. ch. 985 in a newspaper of circulation in the affected area. Publication is required on two consecutive weeks, the last at least seven days prior to the hearing. 
4.  Conditional use means a use which is permitted by this chapter, provided that certain conditions specified in this chapter are met and that a permit is granted by the board of appeals or, where appropriate, the planning agency designated by the municipal governing body. 
5.  Department means the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
6.  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures or accessory structures; the construction of additions or substantial alterations to buildings, structures or accessory structures; the placement of buildings or structures; ditching, lagooning, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction of earthen materials. 
7.  Drainage system means one or more artificial ditches, tile drains or similar devices which collect surface runoff or groundwater and convey it to a point of discharge.

Environmental control facility means any facility, temporary or permanent, which is reasonably expected to abate, reduce or aid in the prevention, measurement, control or monitoring of noise, air or water pollutants, solid waste and thermal pollution, radiation or other pollutants, including facilities installed principally to supplement or to replace existing property or equipment not meeting or allegedly not meeting acceptable pollution control standards or which are to be supplemented or replaced by other pollution control facilities. 
9.  Fixed houseboat means a structure not actually used for navigation which extends beyond the ordinary high-water mark of a navigable waterway and is retained in place either by cables to the shoreline or by anchors or spudpoles attached to the bed of the waterway. 
10.  Navigable waters means Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, all natural inland lakes within Wisconsin, and all streams, ponds, sloughs, flowages and other waters within the territorial limits of the state, including the Wisconsin portion of boundary waters which are navigable under the laws of this state. Under Wis. Stats. § 281.31(2)(d), notwithstanding any other provision of law or administrative rule promulgated thereunder, shoreland ordinances required under Wis. Stats. § 62.221, and Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117 do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if: 
a.  Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or river; 
b.  Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams before ditching; and 
c.  Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use. 
Wisconsin's Supreme Court has declared navigable bodies of water that have a bed differentiated from adjacent uplands and levels or flow sufficient to support navigation by a recreational craft of the shallowest draft on an annually recurring basis (Muench v. Public Service Commission, 261 Wis. 492 (1952), and DeGaynor and Co., Inc. v. Department of Natural Resources, 70 Wis. 2d 936 (1975)).

15.  Unnecessary hardship means that circumstance where special conditions, which were not self-created, affect a particular property and make strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this chapter. 
16.  Variance means an authorization granted by the board of appeals to construct or alter a building or structure in a manner that deviates from the dimensional standards of this chapter. 
17.  Wetlands means those areas where water is at, near or above the land surface long enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which have soils indicative of wet conditions. 
18.  Wetland alteration means any filling, flooding, draining, dredging, ditching, tiling, excavating, temporary water level stabilization measures or dike or dam construction in a wetland area.

(Code 1998, § 15.28.040; Ord. No. 279(part), 1988) 
Sec. 15.28.050. - Municipalities and state agencies regulated. 
    Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns and counties are required to comply with the ordinance codified in this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022 applies. 
(Code 1998, § 15.28.050; Ord. No. 279(part), 1988) 
Sec. 15.28.060. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
A.  This chapter supersedes all provisions of any city zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. § or 87.30 which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another city zoning ordinance is more restrictive, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
B.  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(Code 1998, § 15.28.060; Ord. No. 279(part), 1988) 
Sec. 15.28.070. - Interpretation of provisions. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. Where a provision of this chapter is required by a standard in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117, and where the chapter provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 117 standards in effect on the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter.

3.  United States Geological Survey maps dated "photo revised" 1975. 
B.  District Boundaries. 
1.  The shoreland-wetland zoning district includes all wetlands in the city which are five acres or more and are shown on the final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made a part of this chapter and which are: 
a.  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the city shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter; 
b.  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers or streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. Floodplain zoning maps adopted in Subsection A.2 of this section shall be used to determine the extent of the floodplain areas. 
2.  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark location shall initially be made by the zoning administrator. When questions arise, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
3.  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the zoning administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary is mapped or is in error. If Department staff concur with the zoning administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a zoning permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official shoreland-wetland zoning maps, the zoning administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable time period.

    It is not intended by this title to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However, where this title imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this title shall govern. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-2; Code 1998, § 16.04.020) 
Sec. 16.04.030. - Interpretation of provisions. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this title shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.

Sec. 16.04.040. - Short title. 
    This title shall be known as, referred to, or cited as the "City of Omro Subdivision Ordinance" or "City of Omro Land Division and Subdivision Ordinance." 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-6; Code 1998, § 16.04.040) 
Sec. 16.04.050. - General provisions. 
A.  Compliance. No person shall divide any land located within the jurisdictional limits of these regulations which results in a subdivision, land division, land conveyance, consolidation, or a replat as defined herein; no such subdivision, land division, land conveyance, consolidation, or replat shall be entitled to recording; and no street shall be laid out, nor improvements made to land, nor building permits issued for any land division without compliance with all requirements of this title and the following:

b.  Where a proposed school site or other public ground shown on the master plan or official map of the city is located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision, such proposed public ground or park shall be dedicated to the public when dedication is required by this title or reserved for a period of up to five years from the date of approval of the final plat for acquisition by the city, or any other appropriate agency having the authority to purchase the property. The city, or other agency having the authority to purchase the property, and the subdivider shall enter into an agreement which provides for the purchase of the lands held in reserve prior to the conclusion of the five-year period; 
8.  All applicable rules contained in the Wisconsin Administrative Code not listed in this section;

B.  Extraterritorial Plat Approval Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction of these regulations shall include all lands within the corporate limits of the city as well as the unincorporated area within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, as a fourth class city, has elected to approve plats under its extraterritorial plat approval jurisdiction as provided in Wis. Stats. ch. 236 and Wis. Stats. § 66.0105. 
C.  Jurisdiction. The provisions of this title, as they apply to divisions of tracts of land into less than five parcels, shall not apply to:

2.  Leases for a term not to exceed ten years, mortgages or easements; 
3.  The sale or exchange of parcels of land between owners of adjoining property if additional lots are not thereby created and the lots resulting are not reduced below the minimum sizes required by this title, Wis. Stats. ch. 236 or other applicable laws or ordinances. 
D.  Certified Survey. Any division of land other than a subdivision as defined in Wis. Stats. § 236.02(12) shall be surveyed and a certified survey map prepared as provided in Wis. Stats. § 236.34, subject to approval of the common council. 
E.  Compliance; Issuance of Permits. The city shall not recognize, and no building or other permits shall be issued by the city authorizing the building on, occupancy or improvement of any parcel of land not on record as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this title is derived until the provisions and requirements of this title have been fully complied with and a resolution approving the land division has been adopted by the common council of the city. 
F.  Applicability to Condominiums. This title is expressly applicable to condominium developments within the city's jurisdiction, pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 703.27(1). For purposes of this title, a condominium unit and any associated limited common elements shall be deemed to be equivalent to a lot or parcel created by the act of subdivision. 
G.  Recording of Plats or Certified Surveys. Plats and certified surveys, approved by the common council of the city, must be recorded together with the adopting resolution, with the Winnebago County register of deeds within 30 days of the date of the last resolution of preliminary approval and not later than six months following the date of the first resolution of approval. Land divisions shall not be recognized by the city until recorded with the register of deeds. The volume, page, and document numbers of the recording, shall be filed with the city administrator and building inspector prior to issuance of any permits. The subdivider shall file six certified copies of the approved land division with the city administrator. The plat must have been offered for record within 12 months after the date of the last approval of the plat and within 36 months after the first approval. 
H.  Plat Approval. Plat approval is null and void, if no construction is started within a three-year period of time, after the approval of the final plat. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-20; Code 1998, § 16.04.050) 
Sec. 16.04.060. - Land suitability. 
A.  Suitability. No land shall be subdivided for residential, commercial or industrial use which is held unsuitable for such use by the common council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community. The common council, in applying the provisions of this section, shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for residential use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability if he/she so desires. Thereafter the common council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, may affirm, modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability. 
B.  Existing Flora. The subdivider shall make every effort to protect and retain all existing trees, shrubbery, vines and grasses not actually lying in public roadways, drainageways, building foundation sites, private driveways, soil absorption waste disposal areas, paths and trails. Such trees are to be protected and preserved during construction in accordance with sound conservation practices, possibly including the preservation of trees by well islands or retaining walls whenever abutting grades are altered, pursuant to a landscaping plan filed by the subdivider. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-21; Code 1998, § 16.04.060) 
Sec. 16.04.070. - Condominium developments. 
A.  Purpose. 
1.  The common council finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this title to condominium developments. The State Legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium. 
2.  The factor that makes this title applicable to a condominium development is the creation of multiple, distinct property entities at or near the ground surface, subject to property taxation as separate parcels, with each property entity having different ownership and management. The city determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar, both physically and in ownership, from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership, management and control. 
3.  Thus, the common council finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which are characterized by division of land into lots. These impacts include: 
a.  Additional population density; 
b.  Possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the land's characteristics; 
c.  Additional demands upon city area parks, recreation areas, utility facilities and schools; 
d.  Additional traffic and street use. 
B.  Portions of Title Applicable to Condominium Developments. The following sections shall apply to condominium developments: 
1.  Section 16.04.060 relating to land suitability and construction practices; 
2.  Sections 16.12.010 through 16.12.030 relating to preliminary plat approval. This stage of approval shall be the only approval required for a condominium development. The technical requirements for preliminary plats set forth in Section 16.16.010 shall not apply, since condominiums have separate technical standards set forth in Wis. Stats. ch. 703; 
3.  Chapter 16.32 relating to fees for review; 
4.  Chapter 16.20 relating to required improvements; 
5.  Chapter 16.24 relating to design standards for improvements; 
6.  Chapter 16.28 relating to dedication requirements. 
C.  Exceptions. This section shall not apply to the following condominiums: 
1.  Any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this title is derived; 
2.  Any conversion of a structure or structures in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this title is derived to a condominium after the effective date of the ordinance from which this title is derived.

Devices for the implementation of these plans, such as ordinances pertaining to zoning, official map, land division, and building development and capital improvement plans shall be considered as planning documents within this definition. 
35.  Minor street means a street used, or intended to be used, primarily for access to abutting properties; also referred to as a "local street." 
36.  Minor subdivision (certified survey) means the division of land by the owner or subdivider resulting in the creation of not more than four parcels or building sites, any one of which is 35 acres in size or less, or the division of a block, lot or outlot within a recorded subdivision plat into not more than four parcels or building sites without changing the exterior boundaries of the block, lot or outlot.

The concept usually involves clustering of buildings, providing common open space, and mixing different types of housing (single-family, duplexes and multifamily). Ordinances permitting planned unit developments permit planning a project and calculating densities for the entire development rather than on an individual lot by lot basis. It is declared that regulating planned unit developments require greater involvement of public officials in site plan review and development aspects of both zoning and land division regulation since such developments require exceptions from both types of regulation. 
45.  Plat means the map, drawing or chart on which the subdivider's plat of subdivision is presented to the city for approval.

b.  Five or more parcels, lots or building sites of 35 acres each or less in area are created by successive divisions within a period of five years. 
56.  Subdivision does not include a division of land into five or more parcels or building sites by a certified survey map in accordance with an ordinance enacted or a resolution adopted under Wis. Stats. § 236.34(1)(ar)1. 
57.  Urban service area means that portion of the city and the area within its extraterritorial jurisdiction which has been designated by the common council as the area to which services required in urban areas shall be provided in a planned and orderly process, particularly those facilities which are placed on or in the land as part of the urban development process. Such services include, but are not limited to, public sanitary and storm sewers, water supply and distribution system, streets and highways. 
58.  Wetlands means an area where water is at, near or above the land surface long enough to be capable of supporting aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which has soils indicative of wet conditions. (Wis. Stats. § 23.32(1).)

CHAPTER 16.12. - PLAT REVIEW AND APPROVAL[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
State Law reference- Plat approval, Wis. Stats. § 236.10 et seq. 

Sec. 16.12.010. - Preliminary consultation. 
    Before filing of an application for the approval of a preliminary plat or certified survey map, the subdivider is encouraged to submit a conceptual plan and to consult with city staff and the planning commission for advice regarding general subdivision requirements. Information on meeting dates, agenda deadlines and filing requirements may be obtained from the city administrator. The conceptual plan would show the relationship of the proposed subdivision or certified survey to traffic arteries and existing community facilities. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, the master plan, comprehensive plan components and plan implementation devices of the city and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning his/her development. The subdivider will gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-30; Code 1998, § 16.12.010) 
Sec. 16.12.020. - Submission of preliminary plat. 
A.  Submission. Before submitting a final plat for approval, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat and a letter of application. The subdivider shall submit ten copies of the preliminary plat. The preliminary plat shall be prepared in accordance with the standards of this title, particularly Section 16.16.010, and the subdivider shall file copies of the plat and the application as required by this section with the city administrator at least 25 days prior to the meeting of the planning commission at which action is desired. The city administrator shall submit copies of the preliminary plat to the planning commission, and to the city engineer and city attorney for review and written report of their recommendations and reactions to the proposed plat. An abstract of title or registered property report shall be referred to the city attorney at this time for examination and report. 
B.  Public Improvements; Plans and Specifications. Simultaneously, with the filing of the preliminary plat map, the owner shall file with the city administrator ten complete sets of preliminary plans and specifications for the construction of any public improvements required by this title, specifically addressing sewer and water service feasibility, drainage facilities, traffic patterns, typical street cross-sections, erosion control plans, pavement design and other improvements necessary in the subdivision. 
C.  Property Owners Association; Restrictive Covenants. A draft of the legal instruments and rules for proposed property owners associations, when the subdivider proposes that common property within a subdivision would be either owned or maintained by such an organization of property owners or a subunit of the city pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 236.293 and proposed deed restrictions or restrictive covenants, shall be submitted at the time of filing the preliminary plat with the city administrator. 
D.  Environmental Assessment. 
1.  Filing Requirement. An environmental assessment checklist shall be completed by the subdivider for review by the planning commission with the preliminary plat, or preferably as part of the preliminary consultation, for any subdivision or land division by certified survey which the city has authority to approve. 
2.  Purpose. The purpose of this environmental assessment checklist is to provide the basis for an orderly, systematic review of the effects of all new subdivisions upon the community environment in accordance with the principles and procedures of Wisconsin Statutes set for local subdivision regulation. The planning commission will use these procedures in determining land suitability. The goals of the community in requiring this checklist are to eliminate or reduce pollution and siltation to an acceptable standard, assume ample living space per capita, preserve open space and parks for recreation, provide adequately for stormwater control, maintain scenic beauty and aesthetic surroundings, administer to the economic and cultural needs of the citizens and provide for the effective and efficient flow of goods and services. 
3.  Coverage. The environmental assessment checklist shall apply to all reviewable subdivisions, and land divisions by certified survey. The planning commission may waive the requirement for the filing of an environmental assessment checklist for land divisions by certified survey of less than five acres total area. 
4.  Preliminary Checklist for Environmental Assessment of Plats, Land Divisions and Community Development Plans. An environmental assessment checklist form as required under this Subsection D is available from the city administrator. 
E.  Affidavit. The surveyor preparing the preliminary plat shall certify on the face of the plat that it is a correct representation of all existing land divisions and features and that he/she has fully complied with the provisions of this title. 
F.  Supplementary Data to be Filed with Preliminary Plat. The following shall also be filed with the preliminary plat: 
1.  Use statement. A statement of the proposed use of lots stating type of residential buildings with number of proposed dwelling units; and types of business or industry so as to reveal the effect of the development on traffic, fire hazards and congestion of population; 
2.  Zoning changes. If any zoning changes are contemplated, the proposed zoning plan for the areas, including dimensions; and 
3.  Area plan. Where the subdivider owns property adjacent to that which is being proposed for the subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the requirements of Section 16.16.010A.5 for the remainder of the property so as to show the possible relationships between the proposed subdivision and future subdivision. In any event, all subdivisions must be shown to relate well with existing or potential adjacent subdivisions. 
G.  Street Plans and Profiles. The subdivider shall provide street plans and profiles showing existing ground surface, and proposed and established street grades, including extensions for a reasonable distance beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision when requested. 
H.  Soil Testing. Upon the request of the planning commission or city engineer, the subdivider shall provide a preliminary soils report, listing the types of soil in the proposed subdivision, their effect on the subdivision and a proposed soil testing and investigation program. Pursuant to the public policy concerns prescribed in Section 16.04.060, the city engineer may require that borings and soundings be made in specified areas to ascertain subsurface soil, rock and water conditions, including depth to bedrock and depth to groundwater table. 
I.  Referral to Other Agencies and Utilities. 
1.  Utilities. The subdivider shall also forward a copy to the local electric, gas and telephone utilities. When the subdivider expects the city to act as the transmitting authority in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 236.12, the application shall state that the transmittal responsibility lies with the city, shall contain a list of the other authorities to which the plat must be submitted, and shall be accompanied by such additional fees and copies of the plat as are necessary to be transmitted to such authorities. 
2.  County and State Agencies. The city administrator shall, within two days after the filing of the preliminary plat, transmit copies to the state department of administration. The city administrator shall also transmit a copy of the preliminary plat to other affected city boards, commissions or departments for their review and recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-31; Code 1998, § 16.12.020) 
Sec. 16.12.030. - Preliminary plat review and approval. 
A.  Planning commission Review. After review of the preliminary plat and negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of public improvements which will be required, the planning commission shall, within 60 days, or within such time as extended by agreement with the subdivider of its submission, approve, approve conditionally, or reject the plat. The subdivider shall be notified in writing of any conditions for approval or the reasons for rejection. Such action of the planning commission shall be submitted to the common council for approval and the subdivider shall be notified in writing of any changes or modifications in the action of the planning commission and the reasons therefor. 
B.  Public Hearing. The administrator shall schedule a public hearing on the preliminary plat before the planning commission. The administrator shall give notice of the planning commission's review and public hearing on the preliminary plat or certified survey by listing it as an agenda item in the commission's meeting notice published in the official city newspaper. The notice shall include the name of the applicant, the address of the property in question and the requested action. Property owners within 200 feet of the proposed land division shall receive written notice of the public hearing. 
C.  Council Action. After receipt of the planning commission's recommendation, the common council shall within 90 days of the date the plat was filed with the city administrator, approve, conditionally or reject such plat and shall state, in writing, any conditions of approval or reasons for rejection, unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. Failure of the common council to act within 90 days or extension thereof shall constitute an approval of the preliminary plat, unless other authorized agencies object to the plat. The city administrator shall communicate to the subdivider the action of the common council. If the preliminary plat is approved, the city administrator shall endorse it for the common council. 
D.  Effect of Preliminary Plat Approval. Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the final plat, except that if the final plat is submitted within six months of preliminary plat approval and conforms substantially to the preliminary plat layout, the final plat shall be entitled to approval. Conditional approval may be granted subject to satisfactory compliance with pertinent provisions of this title and Wis. Stats. ch. 236. The preliminary plat shall be deemed an expression of approval or conditional approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of the final plat, which will be subject to further consideration by the planning commission and common council at the time of its submission. 
E.  Preliminary Plat Amendment. Should the subdivider desire to amend the preliminary plat as approved, he/she may resubmit the amended plat which shall follow the same procedure outlined herein, unless the amendment is, in the opinion of the common council, of such scope as to constitute a new plat, in which case it shall be refiled.

Stats. §§ 236.40-236.44. The applicant or person wishing to replat shall then proceed, using the approval procedures for preliminary and final plats prescribed in this title. 
B.  Whenever a preliminary plat for a replat is filed, the planning commission shall schedule and hold a public hearing before it acts on the plat. Notices of the proposed replat and public hearing shall be published and mailed to adjacent property owners following the same procedures as found in Section 16.12.030B. 
C.  Whenever an approved final plat is submitted for reapproval within six months of the initial resolution approving the plat, and which is substantially in conformance with the approved plat, and which has not been recorded with the register of deeds, the plat shall be reapproved by the common council. No final plats shall be reapproved by the common council following the expiration of the six-month period. Such plats shall be submitted as a new plat. All previous approvals shall be null and void and shall have no further hearing on the subsequent review and approval of the plat by the city. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-35; Code 1998, § 16.12.060) 
Sec. 16.12.070. - Determination of adequacy of public facilities and services. 
A.  A preliminary plat, final plat or certified survey shall not be approved unless the planning commission and the common council determine that adequate public facilities and public services will be available to meet the needs of the proposed land division and that no public funds other than those already provided in an adopted capital or operating budget are required; the common council, at its discretion, may waive this provision if the council agrees to use bonding for the project. 
B.  The applicant shall furnish any data requested by the city administrator who shall transmit this information to the appropriate commission, committee and staff for review; the city administrator shall act as coordinator of the reports from staff to the planning commission and common council on the adequacy of water, sanitary and storm sewers, fire service, police, parks and open space and recreation facilities, transportation facilities and schools. 
C.  Public facilities and public services for a proposed land division may be found to be adequate when the following conditions exist: 
1.  The proposed land division is located in an urban service area where adequate sewer service is presently available for extension, under construction or designated by the common council for extension of sewer service within the current capital budget year and funds are specifically provided for such extension either from public or private financing. The planning commission and the common council shall consider the recommendations of the city engineer and the appropriate committee on the capacity of trunk lines and of sewerage treatment facilities and any other information presented. 
2.  The proposed land division is located within an urban service area contiguous to an arterial transmission water main of adequate capacity for the proposed development or if the water distribution system that is needed is under construction or scheduled for construction within the current budget year, and funds, either public or private, are available for the program. The planning commission and the common council shall consider the recommendations from the city's utilities and the city engineer and the appropriate committee on line capacities, water sources and storage facilities, as well as any other information presented. 
3.  The city administrator verifies to the planning commission and the common council that adequate funds, either public or private, are available to ensure the installation of all necessary stormwater management facilities. 
4.  The director of public works can demonstrate to the planning commission and the common council that street maintenance and refuse collection services, either public or private, are so situated that adequate and timely service can be provided so as not to involve danger or injury to the health, safety or general welfare to the future residents of the proposed land division or existing city residents. 
5.  The planning commission verifies that the future residents of the proposed land division can be assured park, recreation and open space facilities and services which meet the standards of the city's master plan. 
6.  The police department, E.M.S. and fire department verify that timely and adequate service can be provided to the residents. 
7.  The proposed land division is accessible by existing or officially mapped, publicly maintained, all-weather roadway system, adequate to accommodate both existing traffic and that traffic to be generated by the proposed land division in accordance with the official map and city standards. 
D.  Where the planning commission and the common council determine that one or more public facilities or services are not adequate for the proposed development, but that a portion of the area could be served adequately, or that careful phasing of the development could result in all public facilities and public services being adequate, conditional approval may include only such portions or may specify phasing of the development. 
E.  No land shall be divided which has been officially mapped as public lands for a stormwater management facility or is determined by the common council to be unsuitable for use by reason of flooding, bad drainage, soil or rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential or unfavorable topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to health, safety or welfare of future residents or landowners in the proposed land division or of the community. 
F.  The above requirements shall not apply to those areas outside the corporate limits of the city and within the city's extraterritorial limits. Areas within the city capable of being served by public sewer and water shall be required to connect to the city public water distribution and/or public sewerage system if determined by the city engineer to be feasible. If such connection is not determined feasible, the proposed land division shall provide for adequate on-site systems and such special piping provisions as may be necessary to serve the anticipated development during the interim period until such city public water and/or sewerage systems are determined by the city engineer to be feasibly available for connection. The applicant, and his/her heirs and assigns, shall, by written plat restriction, agree to abandon the interim water and sewerage facilities and connect to the city public water and sewerage facilities upon a determination by the city engineer that such facilities are available for feasible connection.

CHAPTER 16.16. - TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PLATS AND CERTIFIED SURVEYS 

Sec. 16.16.010. - Preliminary plats. 
A.  General. A preliminary plat shall be required for all subdivisions and shall be based upon a survey by a registered land surveyor and the plat prepared on Mylar or paper of good quality at a scale of not more than 100 feet to the inch and shall show correctly on its face the following information: 
1.  Title under which the proposed subdivision is to be recorded, which name shall not duplicate or be alike in pronunciation of the name of any plat heretofore recorded in the city unless considered an addition to the subdivision; 
2.  Legal description/location of the proposed subdivision by government lot, quarter section, township, range, county and state; 
3.  Date, scale and north point; 
4.  Names, telephone numbers and addresses of the owner, and any agent having control of the land, engineer, subdivider, and land surveyor preparing the plat; 
5.  Entire area contiguous to the proposed plat owned or controlled by the subdivider may be required by the planning commission to be included on the preliminary plat even though only a portion of the area is proposed for immediate development. Where a subdivider owns or controls adjacent lands in addition to those proposed for development at that time, he/she shall submit a concept plan for the development of the adjacent lands showing streets, utilities, zoning districts, and other information as may affect the review of the preliminary plat in question. The city engineer may waive these requirements where adjacent development patterns have already been established. 
B.  Plat Data. All preliminary plats shall show the following: 
1.  Exact length and bearing of the exterior boundaries of the proposed subdivision referenced to a corner established in the U.S. Public Land Survey and the total acreage encompassed thereby; 
2.  Locations of all existing property boundary lines, structures, drives, streams and watercourses, marshes, rock outcrops, wooded areas, railroad tracks and other significant features within the tract being subdivided or immediately adjacent thereto; 
3.  Location, right-of-way width and names of all existing streets, alleys or other public ways, easements, railroad and utility rights-of-way and all section and quarter section lines within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto; 
4.  Location and names of any adjacent subdivisions, parks and cemeteries and owners of record of abutting unplatted lands; 
5.  Type, width and elevation of any existing street pavements within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto, together with any legally established centerline elevations; 
6.  Location, size and invert elevation of any existing sanitary or storm sewers, culverts and drain pipes, the location of manholes, catch basins, hydrants, electric and communication facilities, whether overhead or underground and the location and size of any existing water and gas mains within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto. If no sewers or water mains are located on or immediately adjacent to the tract, the nearest such sewers or water mains which might be extended to serve the tract shall be indicated by the direction and distance from the tract, size and invert elevations; 
7.  Corporate limit lines within the exterior boundaries of the plat or immediately adjacent thereto; 
8.  Existing zoning on and adjacent to the proposed subdivision; 
9.  Contours within the exterior boundaries of the plat and extending to the centerline of adjacent public streets to National Map Accuracy Standards based upon mean sea level datum at vertical intervals of not more than two feet. At least two permanent bench marks shall be located in the immediate vicinity of the plat; the location of the bench marks shall be indicated on the plat, together with their elevations referenced to mean sea level datum and the monumentation of the bench marks clearly and completely described.

11.  A numbered identification system for all lots and blocks. 
C.  Deed Restrictions. Restrictive covenants and deed registrations for the proposed subdivision shall be filed with the final plat. 
D.  Property Owner's Association. The legal instruments creating a property owner's association for the ownership and/or maintenance of common lands in the subdivision shall be filed with the final plat. 
E.  Street Dedication. Public rights-of-way for streets and other public areas shall be dedicated to the city with final plat approval. Such dedications shall require the owner's certificate and the mortgagee's certificate in substantially the same form as required by Wis. Stats. § 236.21(2)(a). 
F.  Survey Accuracy. 
1.  Examination. The common council and planning commission, or their designees, shall examine all final plats within the city and may check for the accuracy and closure of the survey, the proper kind and location of monuments, and legibility and completeness of the drawing. 
2.  Maximum Error of Closure. Maximum error of closure before adjustment of the survey of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision shall not exceed, in horizontal distance or position, the ratio of one part in 5,000, nor in azimuth, four seconds of arc per interior angle. If field measurements exceed this maximum, new field measurements shall be made until a satisfactory closure of the field measurements has been obtained; the survey of the exterior boundary shall be adjusted to form a closed geometric figure. 
3.  Street, Block and Lot Dimensions. All street, block and lot dimensions shall be computed as closed geometric figures based upon the control provided by the closed exterior boundary survey. If checks disclose an error for any interior line of the plat greater than the ratio of one part in 3,000, or an error in measured angle greater than one minute of arc for any angle where the shorter side forming the angle is 300 feet or longer, necessary corrections shall be made. Where the shorter side of a measured angle is less than 300 feet in length, the error shall not exceed the value of one minute multiplied by the quotient of 300 divided by the length of the shorter side; however, such error shall not in any case exceed five minutes of arc. 
4.  Plat Location. Where the plat is located within a quarter section, the corners of which have been relocated, monumented and coordinated by the city, the tie required by Wis. Stats. § 236.20(3)(b) may be expressed in terms of grid bearing and distance; and the material and Wisconsin state plane coordinates of the monument marking the relocated section or quarter corner to which the plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. The grid bearing and distance of the tie shall be determined by a closed survey meeting the error of closure herein specified for the survey of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. 
G.  Surveying and Monumenting . All final plats shall meet all the surveying and monumenting requirements of Wis. Stats. § 236.15. 
H.  State Plane Coordinate System. Where the plat is located within a quarter section, the corners of which have been relocated, monumented and coordinated by the city, the plat shall be tied directly to one of the section or quarter corners so relocated, monumented and coordinated. The exact grid bearing and distance of such tie shall be determined by field measurements, and the material and Wisconsin state plane coordinates of the monument marking the relocated section or quarter corner to which the plat is tied shall be indicated on the plat. All distances and bearings shall be referenced to the Wisconsin Coordinate System, South Zone, and adjusted to the city's control survey. 
I.  Certificates. All final plats shall provide all the certificates required by Wis. Stats. § 236.21; in addition, the surveyor shall certify that he/she has fully complied with all the provisions of this title. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-41; Code 1998, § 16.16.020)

(Prior Code, § 14-1-42; Code 1998, § 16.16.030) 
CHAPTER 16.20. - IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 16.20.010. - Improvements required. 
A.  General Requirement. 
1.  In accordance with the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 236.13, the city requires that, as a condition of final plat or certified survey approval, the subdivider agrees to make and install all public improvements required by this title and that the subdivider shall provide the city with security to ensure that the subdivider will make the required improvements. As a further condition of approval, the common council requires that the subdivider be responsible for the cost of any necessary alterations of any existing utilities which, by virtue of the platting or certified survey map, fall within the public right-of-way. 
2.  As a condition for the acceptance of dedication of public rights-of-way, the city requires that the public ways have been previously provided with all necessary facilities constructed to city specifications, including, but not limited to, sewerage, storm drainage, water mains and services, grading and improvement of the streets and other public ways, sidewalks, street signing, street lighting and such other facilities required by the common council or that a specific portion of the costs be paid in advance as provided in Wis. Stats. § 66.0709(2). 
B.  Options. The common council shall determine that one of the following options shall be utilized (the developers shall utilize Subsection B.1 of this section if the council does not designate another option): 
1.  The required public improvements shall be installed by the subdivider at his/her cost; 
2.  The subdivider may petition the city for the installation of the required improvements by city contract. The petition must be received by the city prior to August 15 of the year preceding the required installation so that the petition may be considered for inclusion in the city budget. If the common council elects to install the petitioned improvements, it shall establish special assessments for the recovery of the costs. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the common council to make an affirmative election to install required improvements. The special assessments due from the subdivider for the portion of the petitioned improvements necessary to serve the proposed land division shall be due to the city, together with interest, within six months of the date of city acceptance of the improvements; 
3.  a. The subdivider may petition the city for the installation of the required public improvements through the special assessment B bond process as provided for in Wis. Stats. § 66.0713 or another acceptable special assessment process with the special assessments being payable at the time of lot sale, payable in a maximum of seven annual installments together with interest; 
b.  The city may enter into a recapture agreement with the subdivider agreeing to require payment of recapture costs of public improvements from those properties benefitting from the improvements. The city shall prohibit development on those properties until payment has been made. The subdivider may contract directly with adjacent property owners and/or subdividers of adjacent land for reimbursement of the oversize and/or off-site improvements constructed; 
c.  In addition to the above, the city may enter into an agreement to reimburse the subdivider, at the end of the seven-year period, for his/her cost (at the time of construction) of those oversized improvements constructed within the proposed land division, but which are oversized to serve lands beyond the boundaries of the land division or other lands within the subdivider's control, and which have not, during the seven-year period, been reimbursed to the subdivider. Such payment shall be only for the actual additional cost of constructing the oversized improvements within the boundaries of the land division and shall not provide for payment of any interest. The city shall then establish special assessments against those benefitting properties outside the proposed land division boundaries or the subdivider's control for those costs. To be eligible to proceed under this provision, the land division must occur within areas identified in the city's master plan or other adopted comprehensive development or public facilities plan; 
4.  Any workable combination of the above determined by the common council as acceptable; or 
5.  If the city finds that city construction of such public improvements would not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties, or as a governmental expense until some future time, the developer shall be required, if he/she wishes to proceed with the development, to obtain necessary easements or right-of-way and construct and pay for such public improvement extensions as provided under Subsection B.1 or 2 of this section. 
C.  General Standards. The required public improvements shall be installed in accordance with the engineering standards and specifications which have been adopted by the common council. Where standards and specifications have not been adopted, the improvements shall be made in accordance with established engineering practices, approved prior to the start of construction by the city engineer. When new or revised standards and/or specifications have been adopted by the city, work on public improvements not begun within 18 months of the date of final plat adoption shall be made to the new or revised standards and/or specifications. The city engineer shall review and approve the construction plans, specifications and calculations for the construction of the required public improvements. 
D.  Project Manager. The subdivider shall designate a project manager who shall be readily available on the project site during the construction of the required public improvements. The project manager shall be granted authority on behalf of the subdivider to make decisions related to the construction of the required public improvements as they may arise during the course of the construction. The project manager shall also be responsible for the scheduling and coordination of the required work to construct the required improvements. Correspondence with or verbal orders to the designated project manager shall have the same authority as with the subdivider directly. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-50; Code 1998, § 16.20.010) 
Sec. 16.20.020. - Required agreement providing for proper installation of improvements; surety. 
A.  Contract. The subdivider shall be required to enter into a contract with the city for land division improvements agreeing to install improvements as herein provided before final approval of any plat, certified survey or land division. The contract form shall be provided by the city and may provide for a phasing of public improvements construction, providing such phasing is approved by the common council. The city reserves the right to control the phasing through limits, sequence and/or additional surety so as to provide for continuity of streets, sewers, water mains, and other necessary public improvements within and between the phases. 
B.  Financial Guarantees. 
1.  The subdivider shall file with the contract, subject to the approval of the city attorney, a bond, a certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or certified check in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimate of the cost of improvements, as determined by the city engineer; the filing of surety shall guarantee that such improvements will be completed by the subdivider or his/her contractors not later than 18 months from the date of recording the final plat or certified survey map. When a certificate of deposit or certified check is posted as security, the instrument must be negotiable by the city. When a letter of credit is posted as security, the city must be the beneficiary. When the security is furnished to insure the construction of required improvements within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, it may name the town and Winnebago County, or either of them, as additional obligees, payees or beneficiaries. 
2.  When the land is situated within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, the subdivider shall, at the time the contract is entered, furnish a bond, certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or certified check to the city in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated cost of all required improvements as determined by the city engineer, excepting the costs to be paid through special assessments or by the city. 
3.  However, the subdivider may elect, with the approval of the city, to install the improvements in construction phases, provided that: 
a.  The phases are specified in the contract for land division improvements; 
b.  The developer submits surety in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated costs of improvements next required by the installation and construction schedules as determined by the city engineer. Improvements constructed during the first stage and each successive stage of construction shall not be accepted nor shall any building permit be issued for construction within the completed area of the subdivision or comprehensive development until the security required for the next stage of construction has been posted with the city; 
c.  The developer records deed restrictions approved by the city attorney which specify that the lots which are included in future construction phases of the land division will not be transferred or sold unless the city's approval is obtained; 
d.  The subdivider minimizes grading and other disturbances to lands included in future construction phases in order to prevent erosion; and 
e.  Erosion control plans and measures submitted and approved herein shall address the individual phases of construction. 
4.  The time limit for completion of a phased improvement program shall take into account the needs and desires of the city and adjacent property owners for street and other improvements to serve lands adjacent to and within the land division. 
5.  As work progresses on installation of improvements constructed as part of the contract, the city engineer, upon written request from the subdivider, from time to time, is authorized to recommend to the city a reduction in the amount of surety as hereinafter provided. When portions of construction (water, sanitary sewer, street, sidewalk, greenway or other improvements) are completed by the subdivider and determined acceptable by the city engineer, the city administrator is authorized, in his/her sole discretion, upon submission of lien waivers by the subdivider's contractors, to reduce the amount of surety. The amount of surety remaining shall be equal to 125 percent of the estimate of the city engineer of costs of work remaining to be completed and accepted and to insure performance of the one-year guarantee as specified in Subsection D of this section against defects in workmanship and materials on work accepted. When the work on the major components of construction has been substantially completed, except for work which cannot be completed because of weather conditions or other reasons which, in the judgment of the city engineer are valid for noncompletion, the city administrator is authorized, in his/her sole discretion, to accept a reduction in the amount of surety to an amount in the estimate of the city engineer, sufficient to cover the work remaining to be completed, including performance of the one-year guarantee period against defects in workmanship and materials. As a further guarantee that all obligations under contract for work on the development are satisfied, the contractor and subcontractors who are to be engaged in the construction of utilities or street improvements on the street right-of-way to be dedicated shall be approved for such work by the city engineer prior to commencing construction. The common council, at its option, may extend the bond period for additional periods not to exceed one year each. 
6.  Governmental units to which these bond and guarantee provisions apply may, in lieu of the contract or instrument of guarantee, file a resolution or letter from officers authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this section. 
7.  The subdivider shall agree in the development contract to pay all city legal fees, city engineering fees, city administrative fees, street and sidewalk assessments, specifically all area charges for sanitary sewer mains and all water main assessments, including where the land division abuts existing streets which are not improved within the city standard street improvements (including, but not limited to, curb and gutter, local storm sewer, sidewalks and a bituminous pavement). 
C.  Waiver of Special Assessment Notice and Hearing. The subdivider shall file with the contract, subject to the approval of the city attorney, a waiver of special assessment notices and hearings such that the subdivider, his/her heirs and assigns (including purchasers of property from the subdivider), waive notice and hearing for and authorize the assessment for any and all of the required public improvements in phases of the land division intended for future development in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 66.703(7)(b). 
D.  Improvement Guarantee. The subdivider shall include in the contract an instrument of public improvement guarantee by irrevocable letter of credit, certified check, cash escrow deposit, or performance bond whereby a bonding company (with assets exceeding $10,000,000.00 and authorized to do business in the State of Wisconsin) guarantees maintenance, repair, replacement by the developer of the public improvements which deteriorate or fail to meet performance or operating standards during the bond term, or any penalties which may be incurred as a result thereof, equal to 15 percent of the city engineer's estimate of the cost of the public improvements. If within one year after the date of final acceptance of any public improvement by the common council (or such longer period of time as may be prescribed by laws or regulations or by the terms of any special guarantee required by the terms of the contract as may be necessary due to the phasing of the construction of public improvements), any work on any public improvement is found to be defective, the subdivider shall remove it and replace it with nondefective work in accordance with written instructions given by the city engineer. If the subdivider does not promptly comply with the terms of such instructions, or in an emergency where delay would cause serious risk of loss or damage, the city may cause the removal and replacement of the defective work and charge all direct, indirect and consequential costs of such removal and replacement to the performance bond or improvement guarantee instrument. 
E.  Survey Monumentation. Before final approval of any plat or certified survey within the corporate limits of the city, the subdivider shall install monuments placed in accordance with the requirements of Wis. Stats. ch. 236, or as may be required by the city engineer. All survey monumentation located adjacent to street or public rights-of-way, but not located within street pavement, shall be protected with steel fence posts erected near the survey monumentation. The city engineer may waive the placing of monuments for a reasonable time during public improvement construction on condition that the subdivider executes a surety to insure the placing of such monuments within the time required. On behalf of the city, the city clerk is authorized to accept such surety bonds and contracts for monumentation in an amount approved by the city engineer. Building permits shall not be issued until all survey monumentation for the block of lots in which the lot for which building permits are being applied for within the phase of the land division under development has been installed. When the land division includes an established one-half, one-quarter, one-quarter-one-quarter, or other such section monument, the established monument shall be preserved and/or fully restored by the subdivider at his/her cost.

O.  Visibility. Streets shall afford maximum visibility and safety for motorist, bicycle and pedestrian use and shall intersect at right angles, where practicable. A minimum sight distance with clear visibility, measured along the centerline, shall be provided of at least 500 feet on major thoroughfares, 200 feet on collector-distributor streets, and 120 feet on all other streets. 
P.  Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be required between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
Q.  Street Grades . The grade of major thoroughfares and collector streets shall not exceed six percent unless necessitated by exceptional topography and approved by the city engineer. Grades of local streets shall not exceed ten percent. The minimum grade of all streets shall be five-tenths percent. 
R.  Vertical Curves. All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length, in feet, equivalent to 20 times the algebraic difference in the rate of grade for major thoroughfares, and one-half this minimum length for all other streets. 
S.  Half Streets. Half streets shall not be platted unless necessary to provide the full width of an existing street platted to half width. All newly platted streets shall be platted to the required full width. Where a half street exists adjacent to a proposed land division, the subdivider shall endeavor to acquire and dedicate the remaining half street. 
T.  Intersections. 
1.  Angle of Intersect. Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. The curved street shall intersect another street with not less than 15 feet of tangent right-of-way between the end of curvature and the right-of-way of the street being intersected. 
2.  Number of Streets Converging. The number of streets converging at one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum, preferably not more than two.

5.  Property Lines at Street Intersections. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of 25 feet or of a greater radius when required by the city engineer. 
6.  Local Streets. Local streets shall not necessarily continue across arterial or collector streets, but if the centerlines of such local streets approach the major streets from opposite sides within 300 feet of each other, measured along the centerline of the arterial or collector streets, then the location shall be so adjusted that the adjoinment across the major or collector street is continuous and a jog is avoided. 
7.  Additional Sight Easements. At any intersection determined by the city engineer, restricted development easements or additional street right-of-way shall be platted to provide for adequate sight distances in every direction of travel. At a minimum, the subdivider shall grade, clear or otherwise provide for an unobstructed sight triangle at all intersections incorporating the area within a triangle formed by the intersection of the street right-of-way lines and a point on each right-of-way line being not less than 30 feet from the intersection point.

Long or continuous thoroughfares running north and south shall be named avenues; those running east and west shall be named streets; diagonal thoroughfares shall be named roads; and curving thoroughfares shall be named drives. Short or discontinuous thoroughfares running north and south shall be named courts; those running east and west shall be named places; diagonal thoroughfares shall be named ways; and curving thoroughfares shall be named lanes. 
V.  Limited Access Highway and Railroad Right-of-way Treatment. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway, arterial street or railroad right-of-way, the design shall provide the following treatment: 
1.  Subdivision Lots. When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the right-of-way of an existing or proposed limited access highway or a railroad, a planting strip at least 30 feet in depth shall be provided adjacent to the highway or railroad in addition to the normal lot depth. This strip shall be part of the platted lots but shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs, the building of structures hereon prohibited." 
2.  Commercial and Industrial Districts. Commercial and industrial districts shall have provided, on each side of the limited access highway, arterial street or railroad, streets approximately parallel to and at a suitable distance from such highway or railroad for the appropriate use of the land between such streets and highway or railroad, but not less than 150 feet. 
3.  Streets Parallel to a Limited Access Highway. Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-of-way, when intersecting a major street and highway or collector street which crosses such railroad or highway, shall be located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from such highway or railroad right-of-way. Such distance, where desirable and practicable, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.

i.  The underground utilities were installed in the previous construction season; or 
ii.  The construction of underground utilities included mechanical compaction and compaction tests have been approved by the city engineer. 
c.  Upon obtaining the written approval of the city engineer the subdivider can proceed with the construction of the standard street improvements. Standard street improvements shall be installed to the boundary line of the subdivision unless the street culminates in a cul-de-sac, the topography or other physical conditions make it impossible to do so, or unless this requirement is waived, in writing, by the common council. 
4.  Roadway Base Standards. 
a.  The subdivider must bring all streets and alleys to a grade established by the common council. All site work by city employees in determining grade shall be billed at the city rate and paid by the owner. 
b.  Residential streets shall have a roadway base of six inches compacted in-place crushed aggregate base course of gradation No. 2 in the top layer and gradations No. 1 and No. 2 in the lower level. 
c.  On commercial, arterial or other heavy-use streets, as determined by the city engineer, a base course of eight inches shall be constructed upon an inspected and approved subgrade, either well-graded crushed gravel from a state-approved pit with a maximum stone of 11/2 inches and no greater than ten percent by weight passing a No. 200 sieve or No. 3 crushed rock approximately six inches in depth and one or more layers of fine aggregate, either three-fourths inch crushed gravel, well-graded with no greater than ten percent passing a No. 200 sieve, or three-fourths inch traffic-bound crushed rock. 
d.  In the case of commercial, arterial or other heavy-use roads, the common council may, in the alternative to the above standards, have the city engineer provide specifications for such roads after researching the site and conducting a soil analysis pursuant to Subsection C of this section. 
e.  In any case, the common council shall have the sole discretion in determining the use and construction classification to be adhered to. 
f.  In all cases, the base course shall be compacted to the extent necessary to produce a condition so that there will be no appreciable displacement of material laterally and longitudinally under traffic and shall conform to line, grades and shape shown on the approved plans, profiles and cross-sections.

The subdivider shall furnish drawings which indicate the proposed grades of streets shown on the plat and, after approval of those grades by the city engineer and adoption by the common council, the streets shall be graded to full width of the right-of-way of the proposed street to the subgrade elevations shown on the typical cross-section. The grading is to be completed prior to installation of utilities. All stumps and trees which cannot be saved, boulders and other similar items shall be removed by the subdivider. 
5.  Roadway Subgrade Quality. 
a.  All subgrade material shall have a minimum California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of three. Subgrade material having a CBR less than three shall be removed and replaced with a suitable fill material, or the pavement must be designed to compensate for the soil conditions. The soil support CBR values selected for use by the designer should represent a minimum value for the soil to be used. 
b.  Stable and nonorganic sub-base material is required. All topsoil shall be first removed. In addition, all subsoils which have a high shrink-swell potential, low-bearing capacity when wet, or are highly elastic shall be removed and used outside of the right-of-way. Where both subsoil and substratum have a high shrink-swell potential and low-bearing capacity when wet, an underdrain system shall be installed to keep the water level five feet below the pavement surface. Unstable and organic material must be subcut, removed and replaced with a suitable granular or breaker-run material approved by the city engineer. 
6.  Roadway Grading; Ditches. Roads shall be graded to their full width in accordance with approved plans, plus an additional distance necessary to establish a four-to-one backslope where ditches are allowed. The roadway shall be compacted and graded to a subgrade using, where necessary, approved fill material in accordance with Wisconsin Department of Transportation Standards. Roadside ditches, where allowed by the city, shall be a minimum of 26 inches below the finished roadway centerline elevation, or as approved by the city engineer. Debris may not be buried in the designated road right-of-way.

All roadway culverts shall be provided with concrete or metal apron endwalls. The developer shall provide adequate facilities to provide surface water drainage as well as free flow outlets for subsurface drain tile where they are required. Where drainage facilities will aid in road construction and the stabilization of the road's subgrade, drainage facilities shall be installed before road construction is started. Existing condition status shall be based on a maximum of a Curve 70. 
9.  Driveways. 
a.  Curbs shall not be interrupted by openings for driveways or other accessways to private property unless the number and location of such interruptions have been approved pursuant to Chapter 12.12. 
b.  Driveway specifications shall be as prescribed in Chapter 12.12. 
c.  Driveway culverts shall be sized by the city engineer (if appropriate). The culverts shall be placed in the ditch line at elevations that will ensure proper drainage, and they shall be provided with concrete, metal or landscape timber endwalls. 
10.  Topsoil, Grass, Seed, Fertilizer and Mulch. All disturbed areas (ditches, backslopes) within the road right-of-way not provided with pavement and shouldering material shall be restored utilizing four inches of topsoil and good quality grass, seed, fertilizer and mulch. Ditches along the roadway with greater than a 21/2 percent slope shall be protected by erosion control materials such as hay bales, sod, erosion control mats, etc. 
11.  Drainage Improvements. In the case of all new roads and streets, the city engineer may require that stormwater retention areas and storm sewers be constructed in order to provide for proper drainage. 
12.  Continuity and Transitions. 
a.  All street pavement widths on streets continued from previously developed or platted streets shall, wherever practical, provide for the greater of either the existing or required pavement type, width, grade and cross slope. 
b.  Where it is necessary to provide for a transition of pavement width and/or type between new and existing streets, the transition shall occur in a safe manner at an intersection. In the event a transition in pavement width cannot safely occur at an intersection, it shall not occur closer than 250 feet to the intersection of right-of-way lines. In width transitions, the ratio of the transition length to width shall not be less than 15 to one unless the city engineer determines that special circumstances prevent use of such ratio, in which case the minimum transition ratio shall be ten to one. 
13.  Curb and Gutter. Combination concrete curb and gutter is required on all streets. Refer to Section 16.20.050 describing requirements for curbs and gutters. 
14.  Post-Construction Traffic Limited. No vehicular traffic shall be permitted on the pavement for a minimum period of between 24 and 72 hours following paving, as determined necessary by the city engineer to protect the new pavement. 
C.  Selection of Alternative Design. The city engineer shall select a pavement structure to be used after reviewing equivalent alternative pavement designs with the subdivider. The city engineer shall require one or more of the pavement designs of the subdivider based on the following criteria: 
1.  Life cycle cost; 
2.  History of similar pavements in the area; 
3.  Adjacent existing pavements; 
4.  Staging of construction; 
5.  Construction season;

11.  Construction considerations; 
12.  Recognition of local industry; 
13.  Availability of materials and methods locally. 
D.  Final Inspection. Upon completion of proposed streets, the city engineer will proceed to make a final inspection, accepting or rejecting the street as the case may be. After all of the provisions of this title have been complied with, the street will be inspected by city officials and, at that time, proof will be made by the presenting of waivers of liens or receipted bills that all work that has been done has been paid for, or arrangements have been made for the payment through written instrument by the subdivider. If the street is rejected, corrections shall be made as required by the common council upon the city engineer's recommendation, before final inspection can then be made again. If final acceptance is then made, the owner or owners shall dedicate to the city all land necessary for streets. The subdivider shall warranty the fitness of street improvements for one year after construction. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-71; Code 1998, § 16.24.020) 
Sec. 16.24.030. - Block design standards.

Blocks shall be so designated as to provide two tiers of lots, unless it adjoins a railroad, major thoroughfare, river or park where it may have a single tier of lots. Cul-de-sacs may be used where the interblock spacing of adjacent streets exceeds the appropriate depth of two tiers of lots. 
B.  Pedestrian Pathways. Pedestrian pathway easements not less than ten feet wide, may be required by the common council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, through the center of a block more than 900 feet long, where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities. 
C.  Street Tree Planting Strip Easements. Tree planting strip easements shall be provided for on both sides of all streets when the street terrace is insufficient. The minimum easement width shall be ten feet and shall be adjacent to the front property line. Street trees shall be maintained by the adjacent property owner in accordance with city ordinances. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-72; Code 1998, § 16.24.030) 
Sec. 16.24.040. - Lot design standards. 
A.  Size. 
1.  The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of topography of the land division, and for the type of development contemplated, provided that no lot shall be smaller in area than the minimum lot size for the appropriate zone as established by the Title 17. 
2.  Lot dimensions, shape and size shall provide for conformance to the requirements of the zoning code for the permitted land use without the need for the granting of zoning code variances by the zoning board of appeals. Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. 
B.  Commercial or Industrial Lots. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated, as required by the Title 17. 
C.  Minimum Lot Frontage. All lots shall have a minimum of 80 feet of platted frontage on a public street to allow access by emergency and service motor vehicles unless part of a planned unit development approved by the common council. Alley frontage (public or private) shall not constitute meeting this minimum frontage requirement. 
D.  Lots Where Abutting Arterial Highway. Residential lots adjacent to major and minor arterial streets and highways and/or railroads shall be platted with an extra 15 feet of lot and an extra 15 feet of minimum yard setback and shall otherwise be designed to alleviate the adverse effects on residential adjacent lots platted to the major street, highway, railroad or other such features. 
E.  Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit full building setback from both streets, or as required by applicable zoning regulations. 
F.  Access to Public Streets. Every lot shall front or abut on a public street. 
G.  Side Lots. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to or radial to abutting street lines. Lot lines shall follow city boundary lines. 
H.  Double and Reversed Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
I.  Natural Features. In the dividing of any land, regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic spots or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development. 
J.  Land Remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after dividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, or a plan shown as to future use rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. 
K.  Large Lots. In case a tract is divided and results in parcels of more than twice the minimum lot size provided for by the Title 17 for the zoning district in which the land is located, such parcels shall be so arranged to permit redividing into parcels in accordance with this title and with the zoning code. 
L.  Trunk Highway Proximity. All lots adjacent to state trunk and federal highways shall be platted with additional depth necessary to provide for a building setback line not less than 50 feet from the nearer right-of-way line or 110 feet from the centerline, whichever is more restrictive. The subdivider may appeal this requirement to the city engineer. Upon written request of the city engineer, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is authorized to then determine building setback requirements equal to or less than those required above in all land divisions (including certified surveys) adjacent to state and federal highways in accordance with the authority granted in the Wisconsin Administrative Code. The required building setback line and additional lot depth shall be platted so as to accommodate such required building setbacks. 
M.  Easement Allowance. Lots containing pedestrian or drainage easements shall be platted to include additional width in allowance for the easement. 
N.  Drainageway and Watercourses. Lots abutting upon a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream shall have such additional depth or width as required by the city engineer to obtain building sites that are not subject to flooding from a post development 100-year storm. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-73; Code 1998, § 16.24.040) 
Sec. 16.24.050. - Drainage and stormwater management system. 
A.  Purpose. The provisions in this section are established to preserve and provide properly located public sites and facilities for drainage and stormwater management as the community develops, and to ensure that the costs of providing and developing such public sites are equitably apportioned on the basis of serving the need for the management of increased stormwater quantities resulting from land development. 
B.  Drainage System Required. 
1.  As required by Section 16.20.090, a drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider to provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the land division and the drainage area of which it is a part. A final plat shall not be approved until the subdivider shall submit plans, profiles and specifications as specified in this section, which have been prepared by a registered professional engineer and approved or modified by the common council, upon the recommendations of the planning commission and city engineer. 
2.  Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots. 
3.  The planning commission shall not recommend for approval any subdivision plat which does not provide adequate means for stormwater or floodwater runoff. Any stormwater drainage system will be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where necessary, shall be designed in accordance with all governmental regulations, and a copy of design computations for engineering capacities shall accompany plans submitted by the planning engineer for the final plat. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. 
C.  Drainage System Plans. 
1.  The subdivider shall submit to the city at the time of filing a final plat a drainage plan or engineering report on the ability of existing watercourse channels, storm sewers, culverts and other improvements pertaining to drainage or flood control within the subdivision to handle the additional runoff which would be generated by the development of the land within the subdivision. Additional information shall be submitted to adequately indicate that provision has been made for disposal of surface water without any damage to the developed or undeveloped land downstream or below the proposed subdivision. The report shall also include: 
a.  Estimates of the quantity of stormwater entering the subdivision naturally from areas outside the subdivision; 
b.  Quantities of flow at each inlet or culvert; 
c.  Location, sizes and grades of required culverts, storm drainage sewers and other required appurtenances. 
2.  A grading plan for the streets, blocks and lots shall be submitted by the subdivider for the area within the subdivision. 
3.  The design criteria for storm drainage systems shall be based upon information provided by the city engineer. 
4.  Material and construction specifications for all drainage projects (i.e., pipe, culverts, seed, sod, etc.) shall be in compliance with specifications provided by the city engineer. 
D.  Drainage System Requirements. The subdivider shall install all the storm drainage facilities indicated on the plans required in Subsection C of this section necessary to serve, and resulting from, the phase of the land division under development. 
1.  Street Drainage. All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage system. The street storm system shall serve as the minor drainage system and shall be designed to carry street, adjacent land and building stormwater drainage. Stormwater shall not be permitted to be run into the sanitary sewer system within the proposed subdivision. 
2.  Off-Street Drainage. The design of the off-street major drainage system shall include the entire watershed affecting the land division and shall be extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage. When the drainage system is outside of the street right-of-way, the subdivider shall make provisions set forth in Subsection H of this section to provide for the future maintenance of the system. 
E.  Protection of Drainage Systems . The subdivider shall adequately protect all ditches to the satisfaction of the city engineer. Ditches and open channels shall be seeded, sodded or paved depending upon grades and soil types. (Generally, ditches or channels with grades up to one percent shall be seeded; those with grades up to four percent shall be sodded; and those with grades over four percent shall be paved.) 
F.  Drainage Easements. Where a land division is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream: 
1.  There shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and as may be necessary to comply with this section; 
2.  The watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream may be relocated in such a manner that the maintenance of adequate drainage will be ensured and the same provided with a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming to the lines of the relocated watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and may be necessary to comply with this section; or 
3.  Wherever possible, drainage shall be maintained in an easement by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume flow. In all cases, such easements shall be of a minimum width established at the highwater mark or, in the absence of such specification, not less than 30 feet. 
G.  Dedication of Drainageways. Whenever a parcel is to be subdivided or consolidated and embraces any part of a drainageway identified on a city comprehensive stormwater management plan, master plan and/or official map or any portion thereof, such part of the existing or proposed public drainageway shall be platted and dedicated by the subdivider as an easement or right-of-way in the location and at the size indicated along with all other streets and public ways in the land division. Whenever any parcel is to be subdivided or consolidated and is part of a drainage district established under the authority of Wis. Stats. ch. 88, the subdivider shall petition the circuit court to transfer the jurisdiction of that portion of the drainage district being subdivided or consolidated to the city in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 88.83. 
H.  Dedication/Preservation of Stormwater Management Facilities. The subdivider shall reserve sufficient land area for the storage of stormwater to meet the needs to be created by the proposed land development and in accordance with any legal standards for on-site detention or retention and as determined by the city engineer. If a proposed stormwater management facility (e.g., detention or retention basin) which is not shown on the comprehensive stormwater management plan, master plan and/or official map is located, in whole or in part, within the proposed land division, the developer shall create a separate lot for the stormwater management facility. All of the lots within the proposed land division shall own an equal fractional interest in the stormwater management facility lot. The subdivider shall make a provision for a lot owner's association to maintain the lot according to the construction specifications. The subdivider shall further grant an easement to the city to do any maintenance work that the lot owners and lot owner's association fail to do and to further grant the city the right to assess such costs back to all of the lot owners within the proposed land division. Such requirements shall be noted on the face of the plat. Whenever a proposed stormwater management facility, shown on the comprehensive stormwater management plan, master plan and/or official map, is located, in whole or in part, within the proposed land division, ground areas for providing the required storage capacity in such proposed public facility shall be dedicated to the public to the requirements of the master plan and/or official map. Storage areas necessary to serve areas outside the land division shall be held in reserve for a period of five years from the date of final plat approval for future dedication to the city or other appropriate agency. 
I.  Storm Drainage Facilities. The subdivider, at his/her cost, shall install all drainage facilities identified in the erosion control plan or determined by the city engineer as being necessary for the management of all lands and roadways within the development. In addition, drainage capacity through the development from other areas shall be provided in accordance with a comprehensive surface water management study, if applicable. All required storm drainage facilities shall be constructed and operational prior to acceptance of any dedications and/or public improvements served by the storm drainage facilities. 
J.  Minor Drainage System. The subdivider shall install all minor drainage system components necessary to reduce inconvenience and damages from frequent storms. Minor drainage components shall include all inlets, piping, gutters, channels, ditching, pumping and other facilities designed to accommodate the post-development runoff resulting from a two-year, 24-hour rainfall (ten-year, 24-hour rainfall for commercial zoning district) event as determined in the most current edition of the Soils Conservation Service Technical Release 55 (TR 55). Temporary accumulations of storm runoff from ponding or flowing water, in or near minor system components, shall be permitted providing such accumulations do not encroach on any traffic lane of any collector or arterial street, nor on the center 24 feet of any local street, except on cul-de-sac or permanently dead-end streets serving less than ten dwelling units, where such accumulations may not overtop the curb. In drainageways and drainageway easements, accumulations of water shall not inundate beyond the limits of the drainageway or drainageway easement. Cross-street drainage channels (valley gutters) shall not be permitted except on cul-de-sac or permanent dead-end streets serving less than ten dwelling units and where the minimum grade in the valley gutter and street gutter between the valley gutter and the next downstream drainage inlet is not less than one percent. 
K.  Major Drainage System. The subdivider shall install all major drainage system components necessary to reduce inconvenience and damages from infrequent storms. Major system components shall include large channels and drainageways, streets, easements and other paths and shall be capable of accommodating post-development runoff in excess of that accommodated by minor system components resulting from 24-hour rainfall events for storms with return frequencies greater than two years up to and including the 100-year return event (as identified in TR 55). On local and collector streets and drainageways and drainage easements, accumulations of water shall not inundate any buildings at the ground line, unless such buildings are floodproofed. On arterial streets and in commercial zoning districts, accumulations of water shall not inundate any buildings at the ground line, unless such buildings are floodproofed and the depth of water at the street crown shall not exceed six inches to permit operation of emergency vehicles. 
L.  Drainage Piping Systems. 
1.  Unless otherwise approved by the city engineer, all drainage piping of 12 inches diameter and greater in street rights-of-way shall be constructed of Class Three reinforced concrete pipe. Piping materials outside of rights-of-way shall be subject to approval of the city engineer. Open drainage inlet pipes or culverts with any opening dimension in excess of 18 inches shall be equipped with debris grates having an exposed area at least seven times the pipe opening area to avoid backwater accumulations from trash buildup and unsafe stream velocities and a maximum opening size of six inches. Drainage piping outfalls with any opening dimension in excess of 36 inches shall be protected from unauthorized entry by fencing, partial or total submergence of the outlet, debris grates or other methods approved by the city engineer unless in such a location as to render routine maintenance operations impossible. Outfalls and their channels shall be protected from damages due to scour and erosion to the satisfaction of the city engineer. 
2.  When, on the basis of the soils information, the city engineer determines that the groundwater elevation is less than nine feet below the proposed street centerline elevation and the adjacent lots have access to a storm drainage piping system, the subdivider shall be required to provide approved sump pump laterals from the storm sewer piping system to the property line of each lot for connection to by the property owner. 
3.  Agricultural drain tiles which are disturbed during construction shall be restored, reconnected or connected to public storm drainage facilities. 
M.  Open Channel Systems. 
1.  Where open channels are utilized in either the minor or major drainage system, they shall be designed so as to minimize maintenance requirements and maximize safety. Drainage easements (in lieu of dedications) shall be utilized to accommodate open channels provided adequate access by the city for maintenance of drainage capacity. Side slopes shall not exceed a four-to-one slope. Drainageways with grades of 0.75 percent or less, or where subject to high groundwater, continuous flows, or other conditions, as determined by the city engineer that would hamper maintenance operations due to consistently wet conditions, shall have a paved concrete invert of not less than eight feet wide and side slopes to a point one foot above the channel invert. 
2.  In areas where invert paving is not required, the drainageway bottom shall be grass. If the drainageway has a bare soil bottom or the natural grasses in the drainageway are disturbed due to development operations, the drainageway bottom shall be sodded and securely staked to one foot above the elevation of inundation resulting from a predevelopment five-year, 24-hour storm event. Other disturbed areas shall be seeded and prepared in accordance with the city's erosion control requirements. Velocities for grass-lined channels shall not exceed those presented in the city's surface water management study, if one is adopted. 
N.  Standards for On-Site Detention Storage. The subdivider may employ on-site detention to control erosion and sedimentation, reduce the post-development peak runoff rate or temporarily store stormwater runoff due to inadequate downstream drainage facilities. The detention (storage) facilities shall be subject to regulation in accordance with the following standards: 
1.  Where on-site detention is temporarily employed for erosion and sedimentation control, the detention facilities shall safely contain the predevelopment runoff from a 25-year storm event of 24-hour duration within the limits of the facility. 
2.  Where on-site detention is permanently employed to reduce the post-development peak runoff, the detention facility shall safely contain the post-development runoff from a 25-year storm event of 24-hour duration within the limits of the facility. 
3.  Detention facility peak discharge rates for the maximum storm required to be contained shall not exceed the predevelopment peak discharge rate from a five-year storm event of 24-hour duration or the capacity of the downstream drainage facilities, whichever is less. 
4.  All temporary detention facilities shall safely contain or pass the runoff from any storm of any duration which exceeds the maximum storm required to be contained up to the 100-year storm event of 24-hour duration. 
5.  All permanent detention facilities shall safely contain the runoff from the 100-year storm event of 24-hour duration on both public and, if necessary, private properties without inundating any building at the ground elevation, the travel lanes of any arterial street, the center ten feet of any collector street or the top of the curb on any local street. 
6.  Determination of on-site detention volumes shall be computed by procedures established by the United States Soil Conservation Service in the most current edition of its technical publication entitled "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, TR-55," and as accepted and approved by the city engineer. 
7.  The storage of stormwater runoff shall not encroach on any public park (except parks designed with detention facilities) or any private lands outside the land division unless an easement providing for such storage has been approved and recorded for such lands. 
8.  All detention facilities shall be designed with the safety of the general public and any considerations for ease of maintenance as top proprieties. 
9.  Any wet detention facilities shall include riprap to not less than two feet above the normal pool elevation for protection from wave action. 
10.  The sides of all detention facilities shall have a maximum slope ratio of four to one (horizontal to vertical), with flatter slopes being required where determined practical by the city engineer. 
11.  The common council, upon recommendation by the city engineer, may require the installation of fencing or other such security measures in detention facilities with excessively long down times or permanent water features, or other features requiring additional security for safety reasons. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-74; Code 1998, § 16.24.050; Ord. No. 416(part), 2005)

A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of this title, as well as such additional standards required by the city and shall conform to the proposed land use standards established by any city comprehensive plan or official map and Title 17. 
B.  Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in this title, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the common council that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed: 
1.  Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated. 
2.  Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon. 
3.  Special requirements may be imposed by the common council, upon the recommendation of the city engineer, with respect to street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction. 
4.  Special requirements may be imposed by the common council, upon the recommendation of the city engineer, with respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and stormwater drainage. 
5.  Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision, including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or potential residential development and provisions for permanently landscaped buffer strips when necessary. 
6.  Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or potential residential areas. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-75; Code 1998, § 16.24.060) 
Sec. 16.24.070. - Grading. 
    The subdivider shall grade each land division in order to establish street, block and lot grades in proper relation to each other and to topography as follows: 
A.  Master Site-Grading Plan. 
1.  A master site-grading plan shall be prepared by the subdivider for all new subdivisions. This plan shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements and standards of the city. 
2.  The master site-grading plan shall show existing and proposed elevation of all lot corners, control points and building locations. The plan shall also indicate all overland storm drainage in and adjacent to the subdivision. The cost of the preparation of such a plan shall be paid for by the subdivider. 
3.  After approval or modification of these plans by the city engineer, the full width of the right-of-way of the proposed streets within the subdivision and the entire subdivision lot area shall be graded in accordance with the master site-grade plan. The owners of the subdivision lots shall adhere to those plans. 
4.  Upon completion of all street and subdivision grading, the grades shall be checked and certified by the city engineer to determine that the completed grading work is in accordance with the master site-grading plan. 
5.  The cost of all required grading work, supervision, certification, inspection and engineering fees shall be paid for by the subdivider. 
B.  Right-of-Way Grading. The subdivider shall grade the full width of the right-of-way of all proposed streets in accordance with the approved plans, including the grading of site triangles at each intersection. 
C.  Block Grading. Block grading shall be completed by one or more of the following methods: 
1.  Regrading along the side lot or rear lot lines which provides for drainage to the public drainage facilities. 
2.  Parts of all lots may be graded to provide for drainage to a ditch or to a swale, provided any ditches or swales are in public drainage easements. 
3.  Drainage across rear or side lot lines may be permitted provided that the course of drainage is within a public drainage easement and is toward public drainage facilities. 
D.  Miscellaneous Grading Requirements. 
1.  Lot grading shall be completed so that water drains away from each building site toward public drainage facilities at a minimum grade of two percent and provisions shall be made to prevent drainage onto properties adjacent to the land division unless to a public drainage facility. 
2.  Grading activities shall not result in slopes greater than three to one on public lands or lands subject to public access. 
3.  The topsoil stripped for grading shall not be removed from the site unless identified in the erosion control plan approved by the city engineer as not being necessary for erosion control or site landscaping purposes. Topsoil shall be uniformly returned to the lots when rough grading is finished. Topsoil piles shall be leveled and seeded for erosion control prior to the city releasing the one-year guarantee provision on public improvements in the streets adjacent to the lots on which the topsoil is stockpiled. 
4.  Such grading shall not result in detriment to any existing developed lands, either within or outside of the corporate limits. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-76; Code 1998, § 16.24.070) 
Sec. 16.24.080. - Erosion control. 
    The city finds that urbanizing land uses have accelerated the process of soil erosion, runoff and sediment deposition in the waters of the city. Therefore, it is declared to be the purpose of this section to control and prevent soil erosion and minimize stormwater runoff increases and thereby to preserve the natural resources, control floods and prevent impairment of dams and reservoirs, protect the quality of public waters, protect wildlife, protect the tax base, and protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the city. All land disturbing activities shall be subject to the provisions of the city's construction site erosion control ordinance (Title 15).

(Code 1998, § 16.26.010; Ord. No. 402(part), 2004; Ord. No. 427(part), 2007) 
Sec. 16.26.020. - Library facilities. 
    The City of Omro shall impose an impact fee upon any land development or developer creating or constructing residential dwelling units within the corporate city limits, city service area, or upon property legally annexed to the city. Such impact fees shall provide for the capital costs necessary to accommodate the construction or improvements to the city's library facilities. 
A.  Amount of Impact Fee. The impact fee imposed shall be in accordance with the city's schedule of fees, a copy of which is available for public inspection and kept on file in the office of the city clerk, and may be subject to adjustment by the common council from time to time, per individual residential dwelling unit and an additional fee, per the schedule of fees, for each additional unit within the same structure. 
B.  Collection Period. Wis. Stats. § 66.0617(6) provides that impact fees may be collected from the developer or property owner within 14 days of issuance of a building or occupancy permit by the municipality. The impact fee shall be paid in full as a condition of approval of any building or occupancy permit for the subject land development. 
C.  Property under Construction. With respect to any development affected by any impact fee imposed under this chapter which is under construction at the time the ordinance imposing such impact fee becomes effective, or which has received a building permit at such time, all required impact fees shall be paid in full within a 14-day time period prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit. Impact fee payments shall be assumed to be the responsibility of the owner of record at the time the building or occupancy permit is requested. 
D.  Impact Fee Accounting. Wis.

CHAPTER 16.28. - PARK AND PUBLIC LAND DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 16.28.010. - Generally. 
A.  Dedication Requirement. In order that adequate open spaces and sites for public uses may be properly located and reserved and in order that the cost of providing public areas, such as but not limited to, parks, recreation areas and public schools may be equitably apportioned on the basis of additional need created by a certified survey or subdivision development, each subdivider shall be required to dedicate land or fees in lieu of land for park or other public uses. 
B.  General Design. In the design of a subdivision, land division, planned unit development or certified survey, provision shall be made for suitable sites of adequate area for schools, parks, playgrounds, open spaces, drainageways and other public purposes. Such sites are to be shown on the preliminary plat and final plat, and shall comply with the city comprehensive plan or component of the plan. Consideration shall be given to the preservation of scenic and historic sites, stands of trees, marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, watersheds, ravines and woodlands, prairie and wetlands, and plant and animal communities. 
C.  Sites Reservations Required. 
1.  Where the area proposed to be divided contains a park, playground or other public area which is shown upon the comprehensive plan of the city, at the common councils determination, such area shall either be dedicated to the proper public agency, or it shall be reserved for acquisition thereby within a three-year period by purchase or other means. If the land is not acquired during this period, it shall be released to the subdivider. 
2.  Whenever any river, stream or important surface-drainage course is located in the area being divided, the subdivider of land shall provide an easement along each side of the river, stream or drainage course for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating or protecting the river, stream or drainage course for drainage or recreational use. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-80; Code 1998, § 16.28.010; Ord. No. 409(part), 2004) 
Sec. 16.28.020. - Land dedication. 
A.  Dedication of Sites. Where consistent with the comprehensive plan, the city may require dedication of land to provide for park, recreation, school and open space needs of existing and future residents within the city. The location of such land to be dedicated shall be recommended by the planning commission and park committee, and determined by the common council. Where the dedication is not consistent with the comprehensive or comprehensive plan, or for other reasons is not feasible as recommended by the planning commission, and as approved by the common council, the subdivider shall, in lieu thereof, pay to the city a fee as established by this chapter, or a combination thereof. 
B.  Dedication of Parks, Playgrounds, Recreation and Open Spaces. 
1.  When dedication is required, the developer shall dedicate an amount of land to assist the city with providing adequate park, playground, recreation and open space to meet the needs created by new residents in a subdivision. Any parkland dedication shall be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan. The minimum dedication shall be: 
a.  Ten percent of the net subdivision acreage intended to be used for single-family dwelling units; 
b.  15 percent of the net subdivision acreage intended to be used for duplexes; 
c.  20 percent of the net subdivision acreage intended to be used for multifamily dwellings. 
2.  "Net subdivision acreage" shall be the total acreage excluding land in existing and proposed streets and street rights-of-way. 
3.  Up to 40 percent of the land required to be dedicated may, if approved by the city, be in lakes, floodplains, wetlands, conservancy lands or watercourses. At least 60 percent of land required to be dedicated shall be on reasonably dry, level land suitable for active recreational use. Yards required by the zoning code shall not be included as part of the requirements. The land dedicated shall be accessible for use by the residents of the subdivision for which the requirements are made. 
4.  If land being dedicated by a developer is less than five acres, the City of Omro shall commit to either purchasing an additional amount of land to equal a minimum of five acres within one year of city acceptance of the final plat, or commit to purchasing adjoining lands that will create a neighborhood park of five acres. 
5.  Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of a character and location suitable for use as a playfield, playground or for other recreation purposes, and shall be relatively level and dry. A recreation site shall have a total frontage on one or more publicly dedicated streets of at least 100 feet, and no other dimension of the site shall be less than 100 feet. 
C.  Combination of Residential Uses. Where a combination of residential uses is intended, the minimum dedication shall be the sum obtained by adding ten percent of the acreage intended for single-family dwellings, 15 percent of the acreage intended for duplex dwellings, and 20 percent of the acreage intended for multifamily dwellings. Where an indefinite commitment is made to the city by the developer with respect to those portions of the total acreage intended for single-family, duplex and multifamily dwellings, the dedication shall be based upon the maximum dedications which the zoning classification of the parcel will permit. 
D.  Fees in Lieu of Land. 
1.  Where in the sole discretion of the common council, there is no land suitable for parks within the proposed land division or the dedication of land would not be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan, the minimum size under Subsections B and C of this section cannot be met, or city officials determine that a cash contribution would better serve the public interest, the common council shall require the subdivider to contribute a park and recreation development fee in lieu of land. The fees collected shall be held in a nonlapsing fund to be used for purchase, development, improvement and maintenance of playgrounds, open spaces, parks and other recreational sites and facilities. The total fee shall be computed on the basis of the maximum residential use of each parcel permitted in the particular zoning district under the zoning code. 
2.  In lieu of land, corresponding fees for each residential dwelling unit shall be paid to the city at the time of building permit issuance. For the purpose of this fee, each individual unit in a duplex or multifamily residential dwelling structure is considered a separate residential dwelling unit. The base fee established with this chapter for each residential dwelling unit shall be $310.00. This fee shall be reviewed by the common council on an annual basis and adjusted by a percentage of increase in correlation with the Midwest Regional Consumer Price Index. The annual fee schedule, as approved by the common council, shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk. 
3.  The common council may, in its sole discretion, permit the subdivider to satisfy the requirements of this chapter by combining a land dedication with a fee payment. If a land dedication of 25 percent of the required dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to 75 percent of the required per unit fee in lieu of land. If a land dedication of 50 percent of the required dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to 50 percent of the required per unit fee in lieu of land. If a land dedication of 75 percent of the required dedication is made, the subdivider shall also contribute an amount equal to 25 percent of the required per unit fee in lieu of land. 
4.  The city shall place any fee collected pursuant to the provisions of this section in a separate account to be used at the discretion of the common council in any community park, for developing adequate parks, playgrounds, recreation and open spaces. 
5.  Lots created by a certified survey map must pay the fee in lieu of land at the time of building permit. 
E.  Extraterritorial Areas. Where the land division, subdivision or comprehensive development is situated within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and the township operates and maintains a park system, the park land area dedicated to the township or fees paid to the town in lieu of such dedication shall be credited against any dedication required by or fee imposed pursuant to this section. 
F.  Limitations. A subdivider shall not be required to dedicate more than one-third of the total area of the plat to meet the objectives of this section. 
G.  Suitability of Lands. The common council shall have sole authority to determine the suitability and adequacy of parklands proposed for dedication. Drainageways, wetlands or areas reserved for streets shall not be considered as satisfying land dedication requirements. 
H.  Access to Dedicated Land. All dedicated land shall have frontage on a public street and shall have unrestricted public access. 
I.  Utility Extensions. The subdivider shall install or provide for installation of water and sanitary sewer lines to the property line of all dedicated land, where such services are to be provided to the adjacent properties. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-81; Code 1998, § 16.28.020; Ord. No. 409(part), 2004) 
Sec. 16.28.030. - Reservation of additional land. 
    When public parks and sites for other public areas, as shown on the Future Land Use Map of Omro's Comprehensive Plan, are within the proposed area for development, and are greater in area than required by Section 16.28.020, the owner shall reserve for acquisition by the city, through agreement, purchase or condemnation, the remaining greater public area for a period of one year after final plat approval, unless extended by mutual agreement. 
(Prior Code, § 14-1-82; Code 1998, § 16.28.030; Ord. No. 409(part), 2004) 
Sec. 16.28.040. - Development of park area. 
A.  When parklands are dedicated to the city, the subdivider is required to: 
1.  Properly grade and contour for proper drainage, subject to city review of a grading plan; 
2.  Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of area as approved by the city engineer; and 
3.  Cover areas to be seeded with a minimum of four inches of quality topsoil, seed as specified by the city engineer, fertilized with "16-6-6" at rate of seven pounds per 1,000 square feet, and mulched, as specified in the standard specifications for road and bridge construction, Sections 627 and 629. The topsoil furnished for park site shall consist of the natural loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam humus-bearing soils adapted to the sustenance of plant life, and such topsoil shall be neither excessively acid nor excessively alkaline. Fine grading and seeding must occur within one year following issuance of the first building permit within that land division unless otherwise authorized by the common council. The improved area shall not be deemed officially accepted until a uniform grass cover to a two-inch height has been established. It is the responsibility of the subdivider to maintain the area until the city accepts the dedication.

Sec. 16.32.020. - Variations and exceptions. 
A.  Where the subdivider alleges that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, he/she may request variations or exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this title. Application for any such variance shall be made in writing by the subdivider to the city administrator at the time when the preliminary plat or certified survey is filed for consideration, stating fully all facts relied upon by the petitioner, and shall be supplemented with maps, plans, or other additional data which may aid city officials in the analysis of the proposed project. The plans for such development shall include such covenants, restrictions or other legal provisions necessary to guarantee the full achievement of the plan. The city administrator may request that the city engineer, city attorney or other officials review each situation to ensure that the request is consistent with the requirements and standards of this title. The city administrator shall refer the matter to the planning commission with a written report and recommendation from city staff. The planning commission shall make a recommendation to the common council. The previous granting of variances or exceptions in the same or similar circumstances shall not of itself constitute grounds for the granting of a variance or exception, nor shall strictly financial rationale. 
B.  The planning commission shall not recommend nor shall the common council shall not grant variations or exceptions to the regulations of this title unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
1.  Failure to grant the variation may be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; 
2.  The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not applicable generally to other property; 
3.  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, financial hardship or self-imposed hardship, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out; 
4.  There would be no costs (present or future) to the city resulting from the granting of the variance or exception. 
C.  Any recommendations for variances or exceptions by the planning commission must be approved by a three-fourths majority vote of the planning commission and shall be so endorsed by the secretary and transmitted to the common council. The common council, if it approves, shall do so by resolution adopted by three-fourths vote and shall instruct the city administrator to notify the planning commission and the subdivider. 
D.  Variances from the strict application of this title may also be granted in accordance with this title in the case of planned unit developments, provided the common council, upon review and recommendations from the planning commission, shall find that the proposed development is fully consistent with the purpose and intent of this title, city zoning ordinances and any city comprehensive plan.

D.  After the notice is served upon the persons as aforesaid and posted, it is unlawful for any person to proceed thereafter with any construction operation whatsoever on the premises, and the permit which has been so revoked shall be null and void, and before any construction or operation is again resumed, a new permit, as required by this title, shall be procured and fees paid therefor, and thereafter the resumption of any construction or operation shall be in compliance with the regulation of this title. However, such work as the city engineer, director of public works or building inspector may order as a condition precedent to the reissuance of the building permit may be performed, or such work as he/she may require for the preservation of life and safety. 
E.  Any appeals of such revocations or suspensions must be made in writing and within seven calendar days to the city administrator for consideration by the common council at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the appeal is filed not less than seven days prior to the meeting date.

F.  Site Suitability. No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is held unsuitable for such use or structure by the council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, by reason of flooding, concentrated runoff, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, and unfavorable topography. 
G.  Preservation of Topography. In order to protect the property owner from possible damage due to change in the existing grade of adjoining lands and to aid in preserving and protecting the natural beauty and character of the landscape, no change in the existing topography of any land shall be made which would result in increasing any portion of the slope to a ratio greater than 11/2 horizontal to one vertical, within a distance of 20 feet from the property line, except with the written consent of the owner of the abutting property and with the approval of the common council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, or which would alter the existing drainage or topography in any way as to adversely affect the adjoining property. In no case shall any slope exceed the normal angle of slippage of the material involved, and all slopes shall be protected against erosion. 
H.  Decks. For purposes of this title, decks, porches and fireplace chases shall be considered a part of a building or structure. 
I.  Vacated Streets. Whenever any street, alley, easement or public way is vacated by official action, the zoning district abutting the centerline of the vacated area shall not be affected by such proceeding.

A.  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a method which will facilitate a more flexible mixture and pattern of development, the grouping of open spaces and arrangement of living patterns in accordance with good planning principles while providing adequate safeguards to protect the community. 
B.  Exceptions. The city may permit in any planned district (PD) even greater flexibility in the type of uses, the area and yard requirements, the off-street parking and other regulations set forth in this chapter, subject to demonstration of appropriateness for area under construction. 
C.  Zoning Classification. The district would be an overlay of the zone most appropriate to the predominant use proposed for the area under consideration, all regulations of the zone must be met except as varied under the planned district (PD) standards. The planned district (PD) designation is to be applied for as a conditional use within the appropriate zone. If the current zoning of area differs from the predominant use proposed, a developer must apply for the proper zoning simultaneously with the conditional use permit for the planned district (PD) overlay. 
D.  Benefit. The overlay district allows the developer a mixture of uses and a slightly higher density than would normally be allowed in a given zone, and may allow a land use in an area which would otherwise be deemed unsuitable. In exchange for this opportunity, the city retains right of site plan review and refusal based upon: adequacy and placement of open spaces, landscaping, buffering, transportation, lighting, noise and similar considerations.

CHAPTER 17.56. - CONDITIONAL USES 

Sec. 17.56.010. - Purpose. 
    The development and execution of this chapter is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public need for the particular use of a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district provided that due consideration is given to location, development and operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses, and are those uses specifically designated as conditional uses by the zoning district or which are classified as a conditional use under the review procedures in this chapter. 
(Prior Code, § 13-1-80; Code 1998, § 17.56.010; Ord. No. 346, § 1(part), 1997) 
Sec. 17.56.020. - Planning commission authority; requirements. 
A.  The planning commission may authorize the zoning official to issue a conditional use permit for either regular or limited conditional use after review and a public hearing, provided that such conditional use and involved structure are found to be in accordance with the purpose and intent of this zoning code and are further found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment, or the value of the neighborhood, or the community. Such a planning commission resolution, and the resulting conditional use permit, when, for limited conditional use, shall specify the period of time for which effective, if specified, the name of the permittee, the location and legal description of the affected premises. 
B.  Prior to the granting of a conditional use, the planning commission shall make findings based upon the evidence presented that the standards herein prescribed are being complied with. 
C.  Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing, planting screens, operation control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, increased yards or parking requirements may be required by the planning commission upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this title. 
D.  Compliance with all other provisions of this title, such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking, loading, traffic, highway access, and performance standards shall be required of all conditional uses.

Sec. 17.56.120. - Complaints regarding conditional uses. 
A.  The planning commission shall retain continuing jurisdiction over all conditional uses for the purpose of resolving complaints against all previously approved conditional uses. Such authority shall be in addition to the enforcement authority of the zoning official to order the removal or discontinuance of any unauthorized alterations of an approved conditional use, and the elimination, removal or discontinuance of any violation of a condition imposed prior to, or after approval, or violation of any other provision of this zoning code. Upon written complaint by any citizen or official, the planning commission shall initially determine whether the complaint indicates a reasonable probability that the subject conditional use is in violation of either one or more of the standards set forth in Section 17.56.070, a condition of approval or other requirement imposed hereunder. Upon reaching a positive initial determination, a hearing shall be held upon notice as provided in Section 17.56.060. Any person may appear at such hearing and testify in person, or be represented by an agent, or attorney. The planning commission may, in order to bring the subject conditional use into compliance with the standards set forth in Section 17.56.070 or conditions previously imposed by the planning commission, modify existing conditions upon such use and impose additional reasonable conditions upon the subject conditional use as provided in Section 17.56.100. 
B.  Additionally, the offending party may be subjected to a forfeiture as set forth in this title and Section 1.24.010. In the event that no reasonable modification of such conditional use can be made in order to ensure that the standards in Section 17.56.070 A. and B. will be met, the planning commission may revoke the subject conditional approval and direct the zoning official and the city attorney to seek elimination of the subject use. Following any such hearing, the decision of the planning commission shall be furnished to the current owner of the conditional use in writing stating the reasons therefor. An appeal from a decision of the planning commission under this section may be taken to the zoning board of appeals.

Sec. 17.56.140. - Home occupations. 
A.  Intent. The intent of this section is to provide a means to accommodate a small home-based family or professional business without the necessity of a rezoning from a residential district to a commercial district. Approval of an expansion of a home occupation at a future time beyond the limitations of this section is not to be anticipated; relocation of the business to an area that is appropriately zoned may be necessary.

Examples of service-oriented businesses are, but are not limited to, computer programming, accounting, insurance agency, and computer-based consulting and clerical services. 
8.  A permitted home occupation shall not occupy more than 35 percent of the gross floor area of the dwelling. 
9.  Persons employed by a permitted home occupation shall be limited to resident family members and no more than two nonresident employees.

CHAPTER 17.60. - NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS 

Sec. 17.60.010. - Existing nonconforming uses and structures. 
A.  The lawful nonconforming use of a structure or land, including, but not limited to, fences, parking and zoning setbacks existing at the time of the adoption, or amendment of this title may be continued although the use does not conform with the provisions of this title. However, only that portion of the land in actual use may be so continued and the structure may not be extended, enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, moved or structurally altered except when required to do so by law or order or so as to comply with the provisions of this title. 
B.  If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to any use permitted in the same use district as that in which the use existing is permitted according to the provisions of this title; provided when a use district is changed, any existing, nonconforming use in such changed district may be continued or changed to a use permitted in the same use district as that in which the existing use is permitted; provided all other regulations governing the new use are complied with. 
C.  Substitution of new equipment may be permitted by the zoning board of appeals if such equipment will reduce the incompatibility of the nonconforming use with the neighboring uses. 
(Prior Code, § 13-1-100; Code 1998, § 17.60.010; Ord. No. 346, § 1(part), 1997) 
Sec. 17.60.020. - Abolishment or replacement. 
A.  Discontinuance. If the nonconforming use of a building or premises is discontinued for 12 months, any future use of the building or premises shall conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located. 
B.  Extensive Repair Must Be in Conformance. At such time as structural repairs, reconstruction or alterations are made to nonconforming structures or premises, which repairs or alterations exceed 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of such structures or premises as established by the city assessor, such structures or premises will be required to conform to the use restrictions of this title. 
C.  On repairs, reconstruction or alterations of less than 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of such structures or premises as established by the city assessor, the successive percentages shall accumulate and when 50 percent is reached, Subsection B of this section applies.

Sec. 17.60.030. - Changes and substitutions. 
    Once a nonconforming use or structure has been changed to conform, it shall not revert back to a nonconforming use or structure. Once the zoning board of appeals has permitted the substitution of a more restrictive nonconforming use for an existing nonconforming use, the substituted use shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming use and become subject to all the conditions required by the zoning board of appeals.

CHAPTER 17.64. - TRAFFIC VISIBILITY, PARKING AND ACCESS 

Sec. 17.64.010. - Traffic visibility triangle. 
A.  Visual Clearance at Intersections of Public Streets (Vision Triangle). 
1.  In each quadrant of every street intersection there shall be designated a vision clearance triangle space, bounded on the inner street lines and a line connecting them 35 feet from their intersection. Within this triangle no object shall be allowed above the height of two feet above the street elevation and below a height of 12 feet above the street elevation, if it obstructs the view across the triangle. Posts or open fences are excluded from this provision. Tree trunks shall be excepted where they are unbranched to a height of ten feet and located a minimum of 20 feet apart. This does not apply in the C-1, central commercial district (downtown area). 
2.  In situations where there are trees of large diameter, large numbers of trees, or some combination of these are present, this provision shall be construed to mean that a sufficient number of trees shall be removed so as to render an object, such as a motor vehicle, clearly visible across the vision clearance triangle from one street or road to another, the intent being to provide for the public safety; but it shall not necessarily be construed to mean that every tree in the vision clearance triangle space must be removed. 
B.  Exception. In the case of arterial streets intersecting with other arterial streets, the corner cutoff distances establishing the triangular vision clearance space shall be increased from 35 feet to 50 feet. 
(Prior Code, § 13-1-120; Code 1998, § 17.64.010; Ord. No. 346, § 1(part), 1997)

M.  Changes in Buildings or Use. Whenever a building or use is changed, structurally altered or enlarged to create a need for an increase of 25 percent or more in the number of existing parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change. Whenever a building or use is enlarged to the extent of 50 percent or more in the floor area, the building or use shall then comply with the parking requirements set forth in the district in which it is located. 
N.  Off-Lot Parking. No unattached trailers or cabs (toppers) can be parked overnight on public street and parking lots.

CHAPTER 17.68. - SIGNS, CANOPIES, AWNINGS AND BILLBOARDS 

Sec. 17.68.010. - Intent and purpose. 
A.  The purposes of this chapter include the following: 
(1)  The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property and public welfare, as well as enhance historic and aesthetic values by the regulation, administration and enforcement of outdoor sign advertising and display within the city. Such standards are meant to regulate and control the design, number, size, quality of materials, construction, locations, electrification, installation and maintenance of all signs as compatible with zoning regulations. This chapter recognizes the need to carefully balance the safety and welfare of the public with the need for well maintained and attractive sign displays that provide adequate business identification, advertising and communication in order to protect and enhance the community. 
(2)  This chapter further intends to protect and enhance the historical and cultural role of the city. Given the unique attributes of the city, including the Fox River and the downtown historic district, and the investment made in revitalizing the downtown district through participation in the Main Street Program, a significant degree of regulation over the aesthetic nature of signs in these district overlays is considered an important public interest. The downtown district philosophy combines historic preservation with development to establish a thriving and aesthetically pleasing business center that strengthens the economic vitality and values of the community. 
(3)  It is further the intent that only aesthetically pleasing and functionally purposeful signs are displayed in the city in a way that the signs shall encourage effective communication or information and orientation for both citizens and visitors, and promote visual harmony with respect for the environmental character of the community. To further enhance the importance of preserving the historical and architectural heritage of the city, short- and long-term goals should include eventual implementation for uniformity of future signs to encourage and promote an expanding, attractive commercial climate within the city. 
(4)  To carry out these general purposes, these regulations are intended to: 
1.  Permit the effective use of signs as a means of commercial and non-commercial communication; 
2.  Maintain and enhance the ability of the city to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
3.  Maintain pedestrian and traffic safety and minimize the distractions, hazards and obstructions caused by signs; 
4.  Minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; 
5.  Preserve property values within the city and allow signs appropriate to the character of each zoning district; 
6.  Enable fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations. 
B.  This chapter recognizes the need for well-maintained and attractive sign displays within the community and the need for adequate business identification, advertising and communication. Because of the unique historic qualities of the City of Omro which need to be protected and enhanced, a high degree of control over the aesthetic nature and placement of signs is deemed to be an important public purpose. It is recognized that while personal preference may be expressed in selecting the size, shape, colors, type style, placement, method of mounting and other components in the design of signs, the planning commission is responsible for ensuring that only aesthetically pleasing and functionally purposeful signs are displayed in the City of Omro. Therefore, although a proposed sign may meet the basic requirements of this chapter, the ultimate decision concerning its final appearance shall rest with the planning commission (subject to the appeal procedure set forth in Chapter 17.80 of the Omro Municipal Code). 
C.  This chapter authorizes the use of signs visible from the public right-of-way, provided the signs are: 
1.  Compatible with the zoning district regulations; 
2.  Designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner that they do not endanger public safety or traffic safety; 
3.  Legible, readable, visible and well-designed for the circumstances in which they are used; 
4.  Respectful of the reasonable rights of other advertisers; 
5.  Not covering any major architectural detail, authorized art/public art or murals; 
6.  A new sign shall not interfere with the view of an existing sign. 
D.  This revision of the previous ordinance demonstrates the need for a uniform program of properly displayed and properly maintained good quality signage relevant to the city. 
E.  It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to locate, erect, move, reconstruct, extend, enlarge, convert or structurally alter any sign without first complying with the requirements of this chapter. 
(Prior Code, § 13-1-140(a); Code 1998, § 17.68.010; Ord. No. 346, § 1(part), 1997; Ord. No. 388, § 1(part), 2003; Ord. No. 403(part), 2005) 
Sec. 17.68.015. - Scope. 
    This chapter shall be binding upon the owner of any property upon which a sign is placed, upon any lessee of such property, and upon any person who constructs or maintains signs within the city. This chapter shall govern all signs currently in use and those hereinafter installed in the city. 
(Code 1998, § 17.68.015) 
Sec. 17.68.020. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this chapter, signs, sign structures and forms relating to signs, shall be classified and defined as follows: 
1.  Abandoned sign means a sign which no longer correctly advertises a bona fide business, lessor, owner, product, activity conducted or product available on the premises where the sign is displayed or elsewhere. 
2.  Advertising vehicle means signs placed on or affixed to vehicles and/or trailers which are parked on a public right-of-way, public property, or private property so as to be visible from the public right-of-way where the apparent purpose is to advertise a product or direct people to a business or activity. However, this is not in any way intended to prohibit signs placed on or affixed to vehicles and trailers, such as lettering on motor vehicles, where the sign is incidental to the primary use of the vehicle or trailer. 
3.  Area of copy means the entire area within a single, continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles which encloses the extreme limits of advertising message, announcement or decoration of a wall sign. 
4.  Area of sign means the area of the largest single face of the sign within a perimeter which forms the outside shape, but excluding the necessary supports or uprights on which the signs may be placed. If the sign consists of more than one section or module, all areas will be totaled. Any irregular shaped sign area shall be computed using the actual sign face surface.

C.  Factors Considered in Granting Permits. The governing authority shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a permit, although the governing authority may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the governing authority concludes that the intent of this chapter are better served thereby: 
1.  Height of the propose tower; 
2.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
3.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
4.  Surrounding topography; 
5.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
6.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of accommodating other users and reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
7.  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
8.  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in Subsection D of this section. 
D.  Availability of Suitable Existing Towers or Other Structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
1.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
2.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
3.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; 
4.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing tower or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
5.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable; 
6.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
E.  Accommodation of Other Users (Collocation). 
1.  Any proposed telecommunication tower and tower site shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects to accommodate collocation of both the applicant's antenna and comparable antenna for at least two additional users. Towers and tower sites shall be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the tower, to accept antennas mounted at varying heights, and to accommodate supporting buildings and equipment. 
2.  The holder of a permit for a tower shall allow collocation for at least two additional users and shall not make access to the tower and tower site for the additional users economically unfeasible. If an additional user demonstrates (through an independent arbitrator or other pertinent means) that the holder of a tower permit has made access to such tower and tower site economically unfeasible, then the permit shall become null and void. 
F.  Setbacks and Separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special permit is required; provided, however, that the governing authority may reduce the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the intent of this chapter would be better served thereby: 
1.  Towers shall be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any residential structure. 
2.  Towers, guy wires, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
3.  Districts other than industrial and agricultural towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing tower that is over 90 feet in height. 
G.  Security Fencing. Towers sites shall be enclosed by security fencing and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device sufficient to deter the general public from obtaining access to the site. 
H.  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers, however, the governing authority may waive such requirements if the intent of this chapter would be better served thereby. Tower sites located in the industrial and agricultural zoning districts shall meet the requirements detailed in those sections. 
1.  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower site from adjacent property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the security fencing. 
2.  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. 
3.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer. 
(Code 1998, § 17.70.070; Ord. No. 389(part), 2004) 
Sec. 17.70.070. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. 
    Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. In such circumstances, the following shall apply: 
A.  The owner of such antenna or tower or owner or the property where the tower site is located shall remove such antenna and/or tower including all supporting equipment and building within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. If removal to the satisfaction of the governing authority does not occur within the 90 days, the governing authority may remove and salvage the antenna or tower and all supporting equipment and building at the property owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. 
B.  The applicant for a permit under this chapter shall submit a copy of a signed agreement between the property owner and owner of the tower, antenna and supporting equipment and building detailing requirements for abandonment and subsequent removal based on the provisions of Subsection A of this section. The agreement shall also identify that such agreement shall be binding on the future property owner and future owner of a tower, antenna, and all supporting equipment and building.
