PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Delafield, Wisconsin. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the 1997 Code, as supplemented through November 20, 2017, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1997 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Jeanne O'Brien, Deputy Clerk/Treasurer, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

Annually, on or before October 1, each officer or department shall file with the finance officer/budget analyst an itemized statement of disbursements made to carry out the powers and duties of the officer or department during the preceding fiscal year, a detailed statement of the receipts and disbursements on account of any special fund under the supervision of the officer or department during the year and of the condition and management of the fund and detailed estimates of the same matters for the current fiscal year and for the ensuing fiscal year.

(b)  Budget preparation. 
(1)  Finance officer/budget analyst to submit estimates. The finance officer/budget analyst shall submit all departmental estimates to the city administrator who shall be responsible for the preparation of the annual budget, per section 2-70(c)(4).

(Code 1997, § 3.04)  
Sec. 2-237. - City funds to be spent in accordance with appropriations. 
No money shall be drawn from the city treasury, nor shall any obligation for the expenditure of money be incurred, except in pursuance of the annual appropriation in the adopted budget or when changed as authorized by section 2-236. At the close of each fiscal year, any unencumbered balance of an appropriation shall revert to the general fund and shall be subject to reappropriation; but appropriations may be made by the council, to be paid out of the income of the current year, in furtherance of improvements or other objects or works which will not be completed within such year, and any such appropriation shall continue in force until the purpose for which it was made has been accomplished or abandoned.

(Code 1997, § 3.06; am. #373; Rep. & Recr. #696 )  
Sec. 2-239. - Public records. 
(a)  Declaration of policy. A representative government is dependent upon an informed electorate and therefore it is declared to be the public policy of the City of Delafield that all persons are entitled to the greatest possible information regarding the affairs of their government and the official acts of those officers and employees who represent them. Further, providing persons with such information is an essential function of a representative government and an integral part of the routine duties of officers and employees whose responsibility it is to provide such information. To that end, this article shall be construed in every instance with a presumption of complete public access, consistent with the conduct of governmental business. The denial of public access generally is contrary to the public interest and only in an exceptional case may access be denied. Therefore, the City of Delafield does hereby adopt and incorporate, as though fully set forth herein, the provisions of Wisconsin's public records laws, Wis. Stats. §§ 19.3119.39, inclusive of all future amendments and revisions to such sections of the Wisconsin Statutes. The following provisions are intended to supplement, not to replace or to supplant, the Wisconsin public records laws. 
(b)  Records custodians. 
(1)  Designation of records custodians and alternate custodians. "Custodian" means that officer, department head of the City of Delafield who is designated by the mayor or by the terms of this article, to keep and preserve public records, or whom is required by law to file, deposit, or keep such public record in his/her office, or is lawfully in possession or lawfully entitled to possession of public records. The city clerk-treasurer is the legal custodian of the records of the common council as a body politic and for all common council boards, committees, and commissions. Each alderperson shall be the custodian of their individual official records, such as their correspondence, memorandums, and e-mail. Any alderperson may designate, in writing, the city clerk-treasurer to act as the official custodian of the alderperson's individual official records. For every department, the department head is the custodian of records for their agency. Every custodian of records shall designate in writing one or more employees to act in his or her absence as an alternate custodian of such records. 
(2)  Duties. Custodians are vested with full legal power to render decisions and carry out the duties of the city under this article. Each custodian shall establish a procedure for handling records and shall see that all of their employees entrusted with records are informed of these procedures. If a custodian has any question about granting or denying a request to inspect or copy any record, he or she may consult with the city attorney. 
(3)  Public records training. Each custodian and alternate custodian shall receive training regarding public records laws as soon as practicable upon receiving these duties. Custodians and alternate custodians are personally responsible for keeping current with any developments or advancements in records keeping and the Wisconsin public records laws. 
(c)  Procedural information. 
(1)  Form of request. The Wisconsin public records law dictates that certain actions must be taken with regards to oral requests for records and that certain more formal actions are taken in response to written requests for records. However, the state law does not expressly state how to respond to the following methods of communication. Therefore, requests made by the following means shall be responded to as follows: 
a.  E-mail. A request made by e-mail may be responded to via e-mail or in writing and shall have all of the formalities as though the request was made in writing. 
b.  Voice-mail. A request made by voice-mail shall be responded to as though it were made orally. 
c.  Instant messaging/text messaging. A request made in either such manner shall be treated as an oral request. 
(2)  Treatment of certain data as records. The Wisconsin public records law provides little or no guidance as to whether the raw and perishable data of the following technologies qualify as records that must be maintained. Therefore, the common council determines the following status of these technologies: 
a.  E-mail. The data in an e-mail message may constitute a public record and is subject to maintenance as a public record. The data in an e-mail is subject to the same analysis under the public records statutes as an equivalent paper or hard copy record. The city administrator is responsible for ensuring that all e-mails are properly preserved for such analysis. 
b.  Voice-mail. A voice-mail message is not a public record and voice-mail messages do not have to be maintained as public records. These messages are the functional equivalent of phone conversations. Phone conversations clearly are not public records. Additionally, these messages also share many of the attributes of "personal notes" which are not public records either. Finally, these messages cannot be indexed or maintained in any manner that would allow for their easy classification, searching or retrieval. 
c.  Instant messaging (IM)/text messaging (TM). Except as set forth in this subsection and in subsection (c)(2)i and j of this section, the data involved in IM/TM communications is not subject to maintenance as a public record. IM/TM has all of the attributes of instantaneous exchange of ideas, as does a regular telephone conversation. Furthermore, the data exchange has the same technological issues as to capturing and storage of data that is present with regards to voice-mail with an additional concern - the raw data is often only briefly stored or not stored at all by the third party vendors or hosts that provide these services. Thus, this technology is even closer to a true telephone conversation than are voice-mails. Therefore, city employees and officials shall refrain from using such services for official communications purposes or for matters that would result in a public record if another format such as email or written communications were employed, unless the employee or official preserves a copy of such communications by either copying them to their email account, downloading the communications to their city computer, making a computer file of the communications or by printing and retaining a copy of such communications. 
d.  Voice over the internet protocol (VOIP). The city does not monitor nor record the data associated with the conversations that occur over VOIP. Such conversations are the very same real time voice communications as standard telephone conversations that are not public records. The only difference between these communications is the medium employed in transmitting the voice communications from one participant in the conversation to all others involved in the conversation. 
e.  Audio, video, data transmissions and communications. Although audio, video, data and radio transmissions and communications may be processed through city computers, the city does not routinely copy the data nor maintain records of such communications. Whenever the city copies, records or maintains copies or recordings of such communications or transmissions, those copies may constitute public records that are subject to records requests and which must be maintained according to the appropriate records retention schedule. The Waukesha County consolidation dispatch center is the custodian for police and fire radio communications. 
f.  Audio/video recordings. Unless otherwise provided herein, are public records subject to requests and must be maintained according to the retention schedules published herein. 
1.  Rewritable recording systems. Those systems where the recordings are routinely overwritten by newer recordings, such as in continuous loop videotape or digital video written to a camera's hard drive or memory, such data does not constitute a record unless it is further downloaded, printed or separately preserved to memorialize some event or proceeding. Until such time as these recordings are downloaded, printed or separately preserved, these recordings do not have to be preserved and, as the recording equipment programs/protocols may dictate, can be overwritten, erased or otherwise destroyed. However, if such data is downloaded, printed, or separately preserved it shall be treated as a record and shall be retained in accordance with the retention schedules. 
2.  Recordings made for the purpose of preparing minutes of meetings. In accordance with Wis. Stats. § 19.21(7); any tape or digital recording of a meeting, as defined in Wis. Stats. § 19.82(2); by any city body as defined by Wis. Stats. § 19.82(1); to include each city board, commission and committee, may be destroyed, overwritten, or recorded over no sooner than 90 days after the minutes have been approved and published if the purpose of the recording was to take minutes of the meeting. 
g.  Electronic document files. Where records, as that term is defined in Wis. Stats. § 19.32(2); exist in an electronic format only, such electronic records shall be maintained according to the appropriate retention schedule. Where both hard copy (i.e., paper) and electronic copies of a record exist they shall each be subject to public records requests. However, when the custodian has designated, pursuant to subsection (c)(2)i of this section, electronic records as the official records, only the electronic copy shall be retained and made available for inspection under the public records laws. Where the custodian has not made such a designation, only the hard copy shall be subject to inspection as a public record and the electronic copies shall be treated and disposed of as draft documents that do not need to be maintained beyond creation of the final hard copy. 
h.  Electronic logs/temporary data files. These logs and temporary data files provide detailed information about the design and functionality of the city's computer network. These logs are routinely overwritten on a daily basis due to the high volume of traffic that is being logged. Unrestricted access to these logs and files would constitute a breach of system security and leave the system vulnerable to exploitation and hacking. In order to ensure network security, these logs are available to city administrator's authorized staff only. These determinations apply to the following types of logs and data files: 
1.  Syslogs for network electronic devices. All logs created by network devices such as firewalls, routers, switches, etc., which are used for monitoring and trending computer network traffic patterns and/or detecting unauthorized network traffic. 
2.  Network server security, application and event logs. These logs are used to monitor activity on city network servers including successful/unsuccessful login attempts, file system access, hardware performance, etc. These logs provide detailed information about city network account IDs, file system structure, and hardware profiles. 
3.  Network security appliance logs. All logs created by network security devices such as the anti-virus appliance, anti-spam appliance, content filtering appliance, etc., which are used to monitor specific types of unauthorized or malicious traffic on the city network. These logs identify specific network traffic patterns and/or protocols that are allowed or disallowed on the city network. 
4.  Application logs. These logs are used to monitor activity on various database applications, but do not contain specific audits of database transactions. These logs can contain version information, program variables, and programming logic. 
i.  Emerging technologies and records retention. As new information technologies emerge the city administrator shall evaluate these technologies and their benefit to city operations. The city administrator shall consider whether any of these technologies provide the capacity to archive public records created by these technologies. Whenever it is economically and practically feasible to archive records created by such technologies that archiving shall be incorporated into any deployment of said technologies. Whenever the technologies do not provide for such archiving capabilities the city administrator shall consider whether the benefits of employing such technologies outweigh the risks that some public records may not be retained by deployment of such technologies. Where such benefits outweigh these risks city employees shall refrain from using such technologies for official communications purposes or for matters that would result in a public record if another format such as email or written communications were employed. In the event that such technologies are used for such communications purposes the employee shall preserve a copy of such communications by either copying them to their email account, downloading the communications to their city computer, making a computer file of the communications or by printing and retaining a copy of such communications. The city administrator shall also ensure that, as soon as practical and economically feasible, archiving systems are obtained for any information technology that is deployed without an archiving system. 
j.  Use of technologies to avoid duty to preserve public records prohibited. No employee shall use or employ any form of communications or information technology with the intent or design to circumvent the records retention requirements of this article. For example, text messaging shall not be used in lieu of email to share or create a public record unless the employee complies with the provisions of subsection (c)(2)i of this section. 
(d)  Access to records; fees. 
(1)  Format for delivery of records. 
a.  Same format as record exists and redacted records. Except as otherwise provided by law, any requester may receive or inspect a record in the very same format in which the city maintains the record. However, whenever it is necessary to redact or excise portions of a record in order to comply with the Wisconsin public records laws, the redactions shall be made with the assistance of the city clerk-treasurer. Whenever electronic redaction or excisions cannot be done in a secure manner that preserves such redactions and prevents the viewing of the redacted information then such redactions should be made by hand, not electronically, and the requestor shall only receive a hard copy, not an electronic copy, of the redacted record. A requestor may not be charged for the time necessary to review a record and to redact or excise non-releasable materials. 
b.  E-mailing records. When practicable, records may be e-mailed to the requestor. In order to ensure the integrity of city records, any e-mailed document shall be converted to a secure format, so that the document cannot readily be edited, changed or modified by the recipient, prior to sending the document to anyone outside of the city government. There shall not be any reproduction charge for e-mailing records, however, such records may still be subject to payment of a location fee as established in Wis. Stats. § 19.35(3)(c). 
(2)  Reproduction fees. To the extent possible, the city administrator and the city clerk shall develop a uniform fee schedule for the reproduction of records that shall be used by every department. Such schedule shall include the following provisions and considerations: 
a.  Fees imposed upon a records requestor may not exceed the actual, necessary and direct costs of reproducing and/or transcribing of the record, unless a fee is otherwise specifically established or authorized by state or federal law. 
b.  If the record exists in such a format that it cannot be easily reproduced, such as a mock-up of a building, then the custodian may photograph the record and may charge the requestor for the actual, necessary and direct costs of such photographing and photographic processing. 
c.  The fee schedule for photocopying records shall be: 
1.  A fee established, from time to time, by resolution adopted by the common council. 
2.  Full cost of reproduction for materials such as microfilms, tapes, computer printouts, etc., not otherwise identified in the schedule developed under this subsection. In such cases, the department head who is the records custodian, in consultation with the city clerk-treasurer, must determine the costs for reproduction of such records. The determination of these costs shall be made by utilizing a practice or factors that are as uniform as practicable across city departments/divisions. 
3.  Other fees. 
(i)  Location fee. If the cost of locating a requested record is $50.00 or more, the requester shall pay the full cost, as determined by the department or division head. Such cost shall not exceed the actual, necessary and direct cost of locating such record. Whenever it is determined that such location costs will exceed $50.00, the requestor shall be required to post a deposit with the custodian that is equal to the reasonable good faith estimate of such costs. 
(ii)  Mailing fee. Custodians shall impose a fee upon a requester for the actual, necessary and direct cost of mailing or shipping of any copy or record that is mailed or shipped to the requester. 
4.  Fee waivers. A custodian may provide copies of a record without charge or at a reduced charge where the department head determines in writing that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest. 
5.  Prepayment of fees. Custodians may require prepayment by a requester of any fee or fees imposed under this subsection if the total amount exceeds $5.00 and a custodian shall require prepayment by a requester of any fee or fees imposed under this subdivision if the total amount exceeds $50.00. If prepayment is required, the custodian shall not process the request until such prepayment has been posted with the custodian. 
(e)  Special rules regarding reproduction of e-mail records. 
(1)  Reproducing e-mails dated earlier than October 1, 2003. E-mails dated October 1, 2003, or before were not stored in an archive. The restoration and location of these e-mails is difficult and labor intensive. Such requests often take more than 30 days to comply with due to labor and technical issues. Custodians who receive requests for these records should inform the requestor of these issues. Such requests must be immediately forwarded to the city administrator who may prepare an estimate of the actual, necessary and direct cost of locating such records and whom shall provide technical assistance to the custodian. 
(2)  Reproducing e-mails dated October 1, 2003, or later. All City of Delafield e-mail transactions dated October 1, 2003, or later have been preserved in a searchable data archive. When requests are made for such records, custodians should clarify with the requestor, the various search terms, and e-mail boxes that the requestor would have the city clerk-treasurer search for. Once the requestor has specified search terms, the custodian should contact the city administrator for technical assistance in fulfilling the request. E-mails are archived and retained for seven years and shall be purged in the eighth year of retention. 
(3)  E-mail chains. E-mails are often sent to multiple recipients. A requestor will be provided with one copy of such an e-mail and all responses to that e-mail. Unless a requestor specifically requests otherwise, they will not be provided with multiple copies of such an e-mail showing receipt by each of the designated e-mail recipients. 
(f)  Time for compliance and procedures. 
(1)  Time. The fulfillment of public records requests is a high priority for the city. Therefore, each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either, fill the request or notify the requester of her/his determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefore. If a request may take more than ten business days to process, then the custodian must respond to the requestor within those ten days with an estimate of when such processing shall be completed and an explanation of the reasons supporting that estimate. 
(2)  City attorney consultation required. Before any custodian may deny access to any records or portion thereof, the custodian must consult with the city attorney. Such consultation shall occur as soon as practicable after the custodian has assembled and reviewed the requested record. In any response to a requestor, the custodian shall include a statement that he or she consulted the city attorney regarding the denial of access to any records. Any denial of access made by a custodian without such consultation and statement is not considered a response from the City of Delafield. 
(g)  No destruction of records while a request is pending or while a denial of a request is being appealed. No custodian may destroy any record at any time after the receipt of a request for inspection or copying of the record until after the request is granted or until at least 60 days after the date that the request is denied. If any legal action is pending regarding or related to the record, the record may not be destroyed without the express authorization of the city attorney. No record that is the object of or which has been produced pursuant to a discovery order or a subpoena may be destroyed without the express consent of the city attorney. 
(h)  Retention schedules. The city, in accordance with Wis. Stats. §§ 19.21(4)(b) and 16.61(3)(e), adopts the following records retention schedules: 
(1)  Retention schedule for all records. For all records the city administrator, in consultation with the city attorney and city clerk-treasurer, shall develop the City of Delafield's records retention schedule and such records shall be maintained in accordance with the provisions of that schedule. Such schedule must be approved by the Wisconsin public records board and approved by the common council. In the event that such a records retention schedule is not adopted by the common council or approved by the Wisconsin public records board, all previously adopted city records retention schedules shall remain in full force and effect until such time as a records retention schedule is adopted in accordance with this subsection. 
(2)  Records that are evidence. No record may be destroyed that has been identified as, or that may have value as, evidence in any civil or criminal legal proceeding, labor arbitration or disciplinary action. No record may be destroyed at any time within 60 days of the denial of a request to review the record or any part thereof. 
(3)  Compliance with federal or other retention requirements. Notwithstanding the City of Delafield records retention schedule set forth in subsection (h)(1) of this section, custodians may not destroy any record where any contract, grant, funding conditions, state or federal statute require that such records be maintained for a longer period of time. 
(4)  Offer of records to state historical society before destruction. The city is required to offer all obsolete records to the state historical society in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 19.21(4)(a) prior to destruction of those records. The city clerk-treasurer may apply to the state historical society for a waiver of this requirement as to certain categories of records under such person's authority that they reasonably believe have little or no significant historical value. 
(i)  Electronic formatting or other reproduction of records. The custodian or any department head, may, with the approval of the city clerk-treasurer, retain and preserve public records in his/her possession by means of microfilm, or another reproduction method, optical imaging or electronic formatting. Such records shall meet the standards for photographic reproduction set forth in Wis. Stats. § 16.61(7)(a) and (b); (2001-2002 Wis. Admin. Code § PR 1 (current through Wis. Admin. Reg. No. 467, Nov. 1994) and Wis. Admin. Code § Adm 12 (current through Wis. Admin. Reg. 554, Feb. 2002). Such records shall be considered original records for all purposes. Such records shall be preserved along with other files of the department or division and shall be open to public inspection and copying according to the provisions of state law and of subsections (a) through (c) of this section. The original hardcopy of any document or record which has been converted to and which is also maintained as a microfilm, optical imaging, electronic formatting, or other reproduction in accordance with this section may be destroyed in compliance with subsection (g) of this section. 
(j)  Severability. The provisions of this section are severable. If any provision of this article is held to be invalid or unconstitutional or if the application of any provision of this section to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such holding shall not affect the other provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional provisions or applications. It is hereby declared the intent of the common council that this section would have been adopted had any invalid or unconstitutional provision or applications not been included herein.

Prior to the start of any physical construction of any municipally financed (in whole or in part) project requiring a city capital expenditure of $1,000,000.00 or more, the common council shall submit to the electorate a binding referendum for approval of the project. Failure of the binding referendum shall preclude the city from proceeding with the project. The wording of any referendum shall provide the specific purpose, location and cost of the project. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to preclude the city from exercising its role in the planning or design of such publicly financed projects. 
(Code 1997, § 3.14; Cr. #546)  
Sec. 2-244. - Employee benefits for private businesses.

(b)  Signed reimbursement notice. Any individual and/or property owner who is subject to charges for fees or other professional services as provided in this section, shall be required to sign a written notice acknowledging the obligation to reimburse the city for professional fees and charges as provided herein. The failure of the applicant and/or property owner to sign the reimbursement notice shall not relieve the individual or property owner of their responsibility for reimbursement to the city for professional fees and expenses incurred as provided in this section. 
(c)  Payment and objections. 
(1)  The city clerk-treasurer shall invoice each individual and/or property owner for professional charges as provided for herein, and the individual and/or property owner shall be responsible for payment of the invoice within 30 days of the date of the invoice, or, in the event of an appeal as provided in this section, within 30 days of the date of the council's decision resolving the appeal.

(Code 1997, § 20.13)  
Sec. 16-22. - Title. 
This article shall be known as the "Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for the City of Delafield, Wisconsin." 
(Code 1997, § 20.14)  
Sec. 16-23. - General provisions. 
(a)  Areas to be regulated. This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A1-30, and AH zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional flood elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(b)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A1-30 on the maps based on the flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see Part 8, Amendments) before it is effective. No changes to RFEs on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the city clerk, City of Delafield. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(1)  Official mapsBased on the FIS. Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel number 55133C0156G, 55133C0157H, 55133C0158H, 55133C0159H, 55133C0166H, 55133C0167H, 55133C0176H, 55133C0178H, and 55133C0186G, dated November 5, 2014; with corresponding profiles that are based on the Flood Insurance Studies (FIS) 55133CV001C, 55133CV002C and 55133CV003C, dated November 5, 2014; approved by: The DNR and FEMA. 
(2)  Official mapsBased on other studies. Flood Storage Map, Panel number 6 of 12, dated November 5, 2014, approved by: The DNR. 
(c)  Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into four districts as follows: 
(1)  The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE zones as shown on the FIRM. 
(2)  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE zones on the FIRM. 
(3)  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
(4)  The Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge. 
(d)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in subsection (d)(1) or (2) of this section. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Part 8, Amendments. The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to section 16-201(3) and the criteria in subsection (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Part 8, Amendments. 
(1)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(2)  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(e)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this article shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Part 8, Amendments. 
(f)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this article shall be in compliance with the terms of this article, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(g)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this article and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13), applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin department of transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022 applies. 
(h)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(1)  This article supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. § 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; Wis. Stats. § 61.35 for villages; or Wis. Stats. § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(2)  This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. 
(i)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin statutes. If a provision of this article, required by Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this article or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this article. 
(j)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this article are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This article does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this article. 
(k)  Severability. Should any portion of this article be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected. 
(l)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Waukesha County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116, and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.

(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
Increase in regional flood height means a calculated upward rise in the regional flood elevation greater than 0.00 foot, based on a comparison of existing conditions and proposed conditions which is directly attributable to development in the floodplain but not attributable to manipulation of mathematical variables such as roughness factors, expansion and contraction coefficients and discharge. 
Land use means any nonstructural use made of unimproved or improved real estate. Also see Development. 
Lowest adjacent grade means elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches any of the exterior walls of a building. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR 60.3. 
Maintenance means the act or process of restoring to original soundness, including redecorating, refinishing, nonstructural repairs, or the replacement of existing fixtures, systems or equipment with equivalent fixtures, systems or structures. 
Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities. The term "manufactured home" includes a mobile home but does not include a "mobile recreational vehicle." 
Mobile/manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land, divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Mobile/manufactured home park or subdivision, existing, means a parcel of land, divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale, on which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots is completed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.

Mobile/manufactured home park, expansion to existing, means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed. This includes installation of utilities, construction of streets and either final site grading, or the pouring if concrete pads. 
Mobile recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled, carried or permanently towable by a licensed, light-duty vehicle, is licensed for highway use if registration is required and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. Manufactured homes that are towed or carried onto a parcel of land, but do not remain capable of being towed or carried, including park model homes, do not fall within the definition of "mobile recreational vehicles." 
Model, corrected effective, means a hydraulic engineering model that corrects any errors that occur in the duplicate effective model, adds any additional cross sections to the duplicate effective model, or incorporates more detailed topographic information than that used in the current effective model.

Model, effective, means the hydraulic engineering model that was used to produce the current effective flood insurance study. 
Model, existing (pre-project), means a modification of the duplicate effective model or corrected effective model to reflect any manmade modifications that have occurred within the floodplain since the date of the effective model but prior to the construction of the project for which the revision is being requested. If no modification has occurred since the date of the effective model, then this model would be identical to the corrected effective model or duplicate effective model. 
Model, revised (post-project), means a modification of the existing or pre-project conditions model, duplicate effective model or corrected effective model to reflect revised or post-project conditions. 
Municipality or municipal means the county, city or village governmental units enacting, administering and enforcing this zoning ordinance.

New construction, for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain zoning regulations adopted by this community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purpose of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
Nonconforming structure means an existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this article for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use. However, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.) 
Nonconforming use means an existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this article for the area of the floodplain which it occupies (such as a residence in the floodway). 
Obstruction to flow means any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development alone or together with any future development will cause an increase in regional flood height. 
Official floodplain zoning map means that map, adopted and made part of this article, as described in section 16-23(b), which has been approved by the department and FEMA. 
Open space use means those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures. 
Ordinary highwater mark means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic. 
Person means an individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, municipality or state agency. 
Private sewage system means a sewage treatment and disposal system serving one structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure. It also means an alternative sewage system approved by the department of safety and professional services, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a system located on a different parcel than the structure. 
Public utilities means those utilities using underground or overhead transmission lines such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and distribution and collection systems such as water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer. 
Reasonably safe from flooding means base floodwaters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the floodplain and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings. 
Regional flood means a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE. 
Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts. 
Subdivision has the meaning given in Wis. Stats. § 236.02(12). 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Unnecessary hardship means where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the article.

a.  Zone A floodplains. 
1.  Hydrology. 
(i)  The appropriate method shall be based on the standards in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116.07(3), Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Discharge. 
2.  Hydraulic modeling. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116.07(4), Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the following: 
(i)  Determination of the required limits of the hydraulic model shall be based on detailed study information for downstream structures (dam, bridge, culvert) to determine adequate starting WSEL for the study. 
(ii)  Channel sections must be surveyed. 
(iii)  Minimum four-foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used for the development of cross section overbank and floodplain mapping. 
(iv)  A maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel at each location. 
(v)  The most current version of HEC_RAS shall be used. 
(vi)  A survey of bridge and culvert openings and the top of road is required at each structure. 
(vii)  Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet. 
(viii)  Standard accepted engineering practices shall be used when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion and contraction coefficients or effective flow limits. The base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high water marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted engineering practices. 
(ix)  The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet. 
3.  Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided, showing all cross section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed development and whether the proposed development is located in the floodway. 
(i)  If the proposed development is located outside of the floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood elevation. 
(ii)  If any part of the proposed development is in the floodway, it must be added to the base model to show the difference between existing and proposed conditions. The study must ensure that all coefficients remain the same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based on standard accepted engineering practices is provided. 
b.  Zone AE floodplains. 
1.  Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the existing study, the appropriate method to be used shall be based on Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116.07(3), Hydrologic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Discharge. 
2.  Hydraulic model. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 116.07(4), Hydraulic Analysis: Determination of Regional Flood Elevation and the following: 
(i)  Duplicate effective model. The effective model shall be reproduced to ensure correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised data to provide a continuous FIS model upstream and downstream of the revised reach. If data from the effective model is available, models shall be generated that duplicate the FIS profiles and the elevations shown in the floodway data table in the FIS report to within 0.1 foot. 
(ii)  Corrected effective model. The corrected effective model shall not include any manmade physical changes since the effective model date, but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for department review. 
(iii)  Existing (pre-project conditions) model. The existing model shall be required to support conclusions about the actual impacts of the project associated with the revised (post-project) model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to base the revised (post-project) model. 
(iv)  Revised (post-project conditions) model. The revised (post-project conditions) model shall incorporate the existing model and any proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This model shall reflect proposed conditions. 
(v)  All changes to the duplicate effective model and subsequent models must be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes. 
(vi)  Changes to the hydraulic models shall be limited to the stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the effective model and result in water surface elevations and top widths computed by the revised models matching those in the effective models upstream and downstream of the revised reach as required. The effective model shall not be truncated. 
3.  Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the department for review which meet the following conditions: 
(i)  Consistency between the revised hydraulic models, the revised floodplain and floodway delineations, the revised flood profiles, topographic work map, annotated FIRMs and/or Flood Boundary Floodway Maps (FBFMs), construction plans, bridge plans. 
(ii)  Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour interval, and a planimetric map showing the applicable items. If a digital version of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the FIRM may be more easily revised. 
(iii)  Annotated FIRM panel showing the revised one percent and 0.2 percent annual chance floodplains and floodway boundaries. 
(iv)  If an annotated FIRM and/or FBFM and digital mapping data (GIS or CADD) are used then all supporting documentation or metadata must be included with the data submission along with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with FEMA mapping specifications. 
(v)  The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the effective floodplain boundaries. 
(vi)  All cross sections from the effective model shall be labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross section lookup table shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme. 
(vii)  Both the current and proposed floodways shall be shown on the map. 
(viii)  The stream centerline, or profile baseline used to measure stream distances in the model shall be visible on the map. 
(4)  Expiration. All permits issued under the authority of this article shall expire no more than 180 days after issuance. The permit may be extended for a maximum of 180 days for good and sufficient cause. 
(c)  Certificate of compliance. No land shall be occupied or used, and no building which is hereafter constructed, altered, added to, modified, repaired, rebuilt or replaced shall be occupied until a certificate of compliance is issued by the zoning administrator, except where no permit is required, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  The certificate of compliance shall show that the building or premises or part thereof, and the proposed use, conform to the provisions of this article; 
(2)  Application for such certificate shall be concurrent with the application for a permit;

ARTICLE III. - CONSTRUCTION AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 16-262. - Authority. 
(a)  The ordinance from which this article is derived is adopted by the City of Delafield under the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 62.234. 
(b)  The provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body. 
(c)  The requirements of this article do not pre-empt more stringent erosion control or stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following: 
(1)  Wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules, permits or approvals, including those authorized under Wis. Stats. §§ 281.16 and 283.33. 
(2)  Targeted non-agricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the Wisconsin department of natural resources under Wis. Admin. Code § NR 151.004. 
(Code 1997, § 23.01; Rep. & Recr. # 730 )  
Sec. 16-263. - Findings of fact. 
The common council finds that uncontrolled construction site erosion and stormwater runoff from land development and land disturbing activities carry a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to the water and rights-of-way of the state and this city. This has a significant detrimental impact upon water resources and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled erosion and stormwater runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows, and increase stream temperatures; 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational, and water supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants; 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads; 
(4)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading; 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes, thereby overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other drainage facilities; 
(6)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding; 
(7)  Generate airborne particulate concentrations that are health threatening or may cause other damage to property or the environment. 
(Code 1997, § 23.02)  
Sec. 16-264. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to set forth requirements for land development and land disturbing activities designed to minimize sedimentation, water pollution, flooding, and related property and environmental damage caused by soil erosion and uncontrolled stormwater runoff during and after construction, in order to diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and the natural resources of the city and the state. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater, prevent and control soil erosion, prevent and control water pollution, protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; 
(3)  Ensure the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; prevent conditions that endanger downstream property; and 
(4)  Establish erosion control and stormwater standards for building sites, placement of structures, and land uses, and preserve ground cover and scenic beauty. 
(b)  Intent. It is the general intent of the common council that this article achieves its purpose through management of the quantity and quality of long-term, post-construction erosion control and stormwater discharges from land development activities. It is not intended to limit activity or land divisions permitted under applicable zoning and land division ordinances. The common council recognizes that the preferred method of addressing erosion control and stormwater management problems and needs is through the preparation of comprehensive erosion control and stormwater management system plans for subwatershed areas which are designed to meet the purpose and intent of this article. Where such system plans have been developed and approved by the planning commission, it is the intent that all land development activities will include stormwater management measures that meet performance standards set forth in those approved plans. Where such stormwater management system plans have not been developed or approved by the commission, it is the intent of the commission that the generic stormwater management standards set forth in section 16-319(a) and (b) be applied unless otherwise excepted by the commission.

Note: Erosion and sediment control for all new construction of one- and two-family dwellings shall be consistent with the standards outlined in Wis. Stats. § 101.653. The city building inspector shall be responsible for review of proposed erosion and sediment control measures and the necessary inspection of the individual home sites. 
(d)  Erosion and sediment control plan requirements and performance standards. An erosion control plan shall describe how the permit holder and other responsible parties will minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, soil erosion and the transport of sediment from land disturbing activities to waters of the state or other property. The following requirements shall be met on all sites that are applicable to this division: 
(1)  All erosion control plans and associated BMPs shall comply with the planning, design, implementation and maintenance requirements of this division. 
(2)  All erosion control plans shall by design, achieve to the maximum extent practicable, a runoff discharge of no more than five tons of sediment per acre per year of the sediment load carried in runoff from initial grading to final stabilization. 
(3)  Erosion and sediment control BMPs may be used alone or in combination to meet the above noted performance standard. Soil loss prediction tools shall be used to estimate the sediment loss using the appropriate rainfall or runoff factor. 
(e)  General principles for preventing erosion and transport of sediment. Plans shall incorporate all of the following to the maximum extent practicable: 
(1)  Maintain existing vegetation, especially adjacent to surface waters whenever possible. 
(2)  Minimize soil compaction and preservation of topsoil. 
(3)  Minimize the time and overall area of disturbed soil surface exposed to erosive forces through project phasing and construction sequencing. 
(4)  Locate BMPs so that treatment occurs before runoff enters waters of the state. 
(f)  Specific erosion control plan requirements. The following applicable minimum requirements shall be addressed in erosion control plans. The city may require more stringent erosion and sediment control requirements set forth in this section if the city determines that additional protection is necessary due to protect environmentally sensitive areas or other property. 
(1)  Access drives and tracking. Provide access drive(s) for construction vehicles that minimize tracking of soil off site using BMPs such as stone tracking pads, tire washing or grates. Minimize runoff from adjacent areas from flowing onto or across the access drive. 
(2)  Diversion of upslope, off-site runoff. Divert off-site runoff from upslope land, if practicable, using BMPs such as earthen diversion berms and swales. Prevent erosion of the flow path and the outlet. Off-site flows that are not diverted need to be accounted for and managed on-site. 
(3)  Inlet protection. Protect inlets to storm drains, culverts and other storm water conveyance systems from sediment until the site is stabilized. 
(4)  Soil stockpiles. Locate soil stockpiles away from channelized flow and no closer than 25 feet from roads, ditches, lakes, streams, ponds, wetlands or environmental corridors, unless otherwise approved by the city. Soil stockpiles that remain in-place for more than seven days need to be protected. If a soil stockpile is inactive for more than 14 days needs to be stabilized. 
(5)  Cut and fill slopes. Minimize the length and steepness of proposed cut and fill slopes. Proper stabilization is required as soon as practicable. All slopes built to 4:1 slope or steeper require appropriate slope stabilization erosion mat. 
(6)  Channel flow. During construction, the discharge of sediment from drainage ways shall be prevented or minimized using appropriate best management practices. Ditch checks shall be placed within drainage ways and appropriately sized sediment traps or basins installed to capture sediment prior to leaving the site. All BMPs shall be designed and installed per WDNR technical standards. Stabilize drainage ways as soon as practicable and utilize appropriate channel erosion mat for all permanent drainage ways. Temporary swales may require channel erosion mat for stabilization based on duration of use and areas served, as directed by the city. 
(7)  Outlet protection. Protect outlets from erosion during site dewatering and storm water conveyance. Velocity dissipation measures may be required at discharge locations or along outfall channels to provide non-erosive flow from the structure in order to maintain and protect downstream watercourses' physical and biological characteristics and functions. 
(8)  Overland flow. Prevent or minimize sediment from leaving site overland using appropriate BMPs such as silt fence and vegetative buffers. 
(9)  Site dewatering. Treat pumped water to prevent or minimize sediment discharge. The discharge from the dewatering activities shall not cause erosion downstream. Appropriate BMPs shall be used to reduce sediment from the pumped water. 
(10)  Dust control. Minimize dust to the maximum extent practicable through proper construction phasing and timely stabilization. Use of BMPs such as site watering or mulch may be necessary if phasing and stabilization do not effectively control dust. 
(11)  Building and waste material. Properly dispose of all building and waste material in a timely manner. Prevent runoff from mingling with waste material. 
(12)  Sediment clean up. Clean up all sediment deposits that leave the site by the end of each work day, including tracked soil that originates from the permitted site. Flushing shall not be allowed unless runoff from the flushing is treated prior to discharge from the site. 
(13)  Final site stabilization. Establish vegetation with at least a density of 70 percent coverage for all areas that are not paved, not covered by a permanent structure or that employ an equivalent permanent stabilization measure. Stabilization shall be established as final grades are established. Minimize the areas of exposed soil to the maximum extent practicable. This typically requires restoration to be done in stages, especially for sites with larger areas of disturbance. 
(14)  Temporary site stabilization. Temporary stabilization measures shall be commenced for any disturbed construction site that temporarily ceases land disturbing construction activities for a period exceeding 14 calendar days. Frozen soil conditions do not exclude the site from this requirement. 
(15)  Removal of practices. Temporary BMPs that are no longer necessary for erosion and sediment control shall be removed by the permit holder. 
(g)  Maintenance of construction site erosion control measures. All best management practices necessary to meet the requirements of this article shall be maintained consistent with the maintenance standards contained in the department of natural resources' stormwater construction and post-construction technical standards. The permit holder shall be responsible for maintaining the best management practices during the period of land disturbance and land development activity on the site until the site is stabilized and the permit is closed. Implementation of maintenance standards for best management practices that are not included in the stormwater construction and post-construction technical standards shall not be permitted unless prior approval is granted by the city.

(Code 1997, § 23.10)  
Sec. 16-319. - Stormwater management standards. 
(a)  Stormwater discharge quantity. Unless otherwise provided for in this article, all land development activities subject to this article shall establish on-site management measures to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharged from the site. Infiltration of stormwater runoff shall be incorporated to the maximum extent technically and financially practical to provide volume control in addition to control of peak flows. On-site management measures shall be used to meet the following minimum performance standards: 
(1)  All stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to restrict post-development flow rates to meet the following multiple storm conditions: 
a.  One-year post-developed conditions flow rate to discharge at no more than a one-year pre-developed flow, occurring under pre-development conditions specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section. 
b.  A ten-year post-developed conditions flow rate to discharge at no more than a two-year pre-developed flow, occurring under pre-development conditions specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section. 
c.  A 100-year post-developed conditions flow rate to discharge at no more than a ten-year pre-developed flow rate, occurring under pre-development conditions specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section. 
(2)  Detention basin designs. 
a.  Dry detention basins. All dry detention basins shall be designed with maximum 4:1 sideslopes. All basins require emergency overflow spillways that can safely pass without overtopping the top of basin the 100-year developed conditions storm. The top of embankment shall be set at an elevation that provides a minimum of one foot of freeboard above the peak stage elevation of the 100-year post-developed conditions storm. 
b.  Wet detention basins. All wet detention basins shall be designed with maximum 3:1 side slope leading to the water's edge. The wet basin shall then include a safety shelf at a maximum 10:1 slope, with a maximum depth of 1.5 feet below permanent water surface and minimum of eight feet in width. The wet basin may then drop at a maximum 2:1 side slope below the safety shelf. The normal water depth should be no more than eight feet, unless otherwise approved by the plan commission. All wet detention basins must include an emergency spillway as outlined above. All wet detention basins shall be designed with a minimum surface area of a permanent pool, based on the particle size and the peak outflow during the one-year, 24-hour storm. Please reference Technical Standard 1001 for sizing criteria. 
(3)  Stormwater detention basins may be required to serve as temporary sedimentation facilities during the construction phase of the development. The sediment basin shall be designed per the department of natural resources' construction and post-construction technical standards, to include a minimum of three feet of sediment storage below the dewatering hole(s) and riser pipe(s) with trash guard(s). All temporary riser pipes and initial stone layer shall be wrapped with filter fabric and protected with six inches of clean stone riprap. At the end of construction when the area has been fully restored, the temporary riser pipe(s) shall be removed and permanent outlet structures established. Excess sediment needs to be removed to reestablish sediment storage prior to transferring maintenance responsibility to the maintenance agreement. 
(b)  Pre-development conditions for land developing activities shall assume a "good" level of land management. When the natural resource conservation service TR-55 method is used to calculate peak flow discharge rates and runoff values for the pre-development condition, NRCS curve numbers shall not exceed the following for the given soil hydrologic groups. When other methods for computing runoff are used, they shall assume a comparable pre-development condition. All non-developed, non-croplands should be represented as meadow/grassland or woodland, as appropriate. 
Soil Hydrologic Group: 	A 	B 	C 	D 
NRCS Curve Number for Meadow/Grassland 	39 	61 	71 	78 
NRCS Curve Number for Woodland 	30 	55 	70 	77 
NRCS Curve Number for Cropland 	55 	69 	78 	83 
 
(c)  Protective areas. 
(1)  Definition. The term "protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes, streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of the following widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetland boundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this section, the term "protective area" does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert, such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location. 
a.  For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, 75 feet. 
b.  For perennial and intermittent streams identified on the Waukesha County GIS system, 50 feet. If there is a discrepancy between the Waukesha County GIS system and the applicable United States Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographic map, the more stringent stream identification shall apply. 
c.  For lakes, 50 feet. 
d.  For wetlands not subject to subsection (1)e or f of this section, 50 feet. 
e.  For highly susceptible wetlands, 75 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include the following types: calcareous fens, sedge meadows, open and coniferous bogs, low prairies, coniferous swamps, lowland hardwood swamps, and ephemeral ponds. 
f.  For less susceptible wetlands, ten percent of the average wetland width, but no less than ten feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlands dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass, cultivated hydric soils: and any gravel pits, or dredged material or fill material disposal sites that take on the attributes of a wetland. 
g.  In subsection (1)d to f of this section, determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with the standards and criteria in Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 103.03. 
h.  Wetland boundary delineation shall be made in accordance with Wis. Admin. Code § NR 103.08(1m). This subsection does not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed. Where there is a legally authorized wetland fill, the protective area standard need not be met in that location. 
i.  For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas greater than 130 acres, ten feet. 
(d)  Infiltration performance standard BMPs shall be designed, installed, and maintained to infiltrate runoff in accordance with Table 1 below.

(5)  Minor and collector streets used or intended to be used primarily for access to abutting properties: a ten-year recurrence interval flood discharge. 
(6)  Arterial streets and highways, other than freeways and expressways, used or intended to be used primarily to carry heavy volumes of traffic: a 50-year recurrence interval flood discharge. The depth of flow over the top of minor, collector, arterial streets and highways shall not exceed six inches above the centerline during the 100-year recurrence interval flood discharge. Bridges and culverts over waterways shall be designed to facilitate fish passage through elimination of hydraulic drops, maintenance of low flow channels, and minimization of excess stream enclosures. 
(7)  Street drainage. All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage system. The street storm drainage system shall serve as the minor drainage system and shall be designed to carry street, adjacent land, and building stormwater drainage. Stormwater shall not be directed into the sanitary sewer system within the proposed subdivision development. In order to provide an acceptable level of access to property and traffic service, the drainage system shall be designed to provide two clear lanes of moving traffic on arterial streets and one ten-foot lane for moving traffic on collector and land access streets during the ten-year critical duration storm. Temporary accumulations of storm runoff from ponding or flowing water, in or near minor system components, shall be permitted during events greater than the ten-year storm, provided such accumulations do not encroach on any traffic lane of any collector or arterial street, nor be more than six inches deep as measured at the center line of any local street. 
(8)  Off-street drainage. The design of the off-street drainage system shall include the entire watershed affecting the land division and shall be extended to a watercourse, storm sewer, or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage. When the drainage system is outside of the street right-of-way, the developer shall provide an easement for the maintenance of said system, as described in subsection (j)(13) of this section. 
(9)  Downstream drainage responsibility. In situations where the city determines that a development's stormwater contributions cause the existing downstream facilities to be exceeded for the design storm, the city reserves the right, where legally possible, to enter into a cost-sharing agreement with the owner or permittee for improvements to said downstream facilities. 
(10)  Drainage piping systems. Unless otherwise approved by the director of public works, or designee, all drainage piping of 12-inch diameter and greater size in street rights-of-way shall be constructed of reinforced concrete pipe, as follows: 
Pipe Size 	Required Class

Side slopes shall not be steeper than a three-to-one slope unless approved by the director of public works, or designee. 
(14)  Protection of drainage systems. The developer shall adequately protect all ditches to the satisfaction of the director of public works, or designee. Open channels shall be restored with appropriate materials (matting, rip-rap, etc.), as determined by director of public works, or designee, based on calculated flows and velocities. 
(15)  Drainage easements. Where a land division, development, or redevelopment is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, storm sewer, channel, or stream: 
a.  The developer or landowner shall provide a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse or storm sewer, and such further width for construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and as may be necessary to comply with this section; or 
b.  The watercourse, drainageway, storm sewer, channel, or stream may be relocated in such a manner that the maintenance of adequate drainage will be assured. When channels are relocated, the developer or owner shall provide a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming to the lines of the relocated watercourse, and such further width for construction, or both. 
c.  Whenever possible, drainage shall be maintained in an easement by an open channel with vegetated banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume flow. In all cases, such easements shall be wide enough to convey the ten-year critical duration storm for the minor drainage system. The drainage easement shall not be less than 20 feet in width and should be 30 feet in width when site conditions allow. 
(16)  Structure protection and safety. Flows generated by the 100-year critical duration storm under planned land use conditions may exceed the design capacity of conveyance systems, but shall not come in contact with any buildings. For buildings designed for human occupation on a regular basis, the following additional requirements shall apply: 
a.  The lowest elevation of the structure that is exposed to the ground surface shall be a minimum of two feet above the maximum water elevation produced by the 100-year critical duration storm, including flows through any storm water BMP that is designed to store water at a depth of three feet or greater.

1.  Residential structures 25 feet. 
2.  Commercial and industrial structures ten feet. 
(k)  Exceptions. The requirements for on-site stormwater management measures established in subsections (a) through (c) of this section are not applicable in areas which are determined by the plan commission to be covered by an approved stormwater management system plan which was developed and approved as an alternative stormwater management planning approach to carrying out on-site measures consistent with the purpose and intent of this article. In such cases, the recommendations of the approved stormwater management system plan shall be applied either through the installation of stormwater management provisions recommended to be included on the development site being considered and/or through the payment of a fee as set forth in section 16-324. These minimum requirements may also be waived in whole or in part by the plan commission, in cooperation with the director of public works, or designee, upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies: 
(1)  Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. This requires meeting all the following conditions: the off-site facility is in place; is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices meeting the requirements of this division; and the facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term operation and maintenance. 
(2)  Director of public works, or designee, finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is infeasible due to space or site restrictions. 
(l)  Fee in lieu of on-site stormwater management practices. Where the plan commission, in cooperation with the director of public works, or designee, waives all or part of the minimum on-site stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided by a responsible entity downstream, the applicant may be required to pay a fee set by the common council. In setting the fee for land development projects, the city shall consider an equitable distribution of the cost of land, engineering design, construction, and maintenance, as set forth in Wis. Stats. § 66.55. 
(m)  General considerations for on-site and off-site stormwater management measures. The following considerations shall be observed in managing stormwater runoff: 
(1)  Natural topography and land cover features such as natural swales, natural depressions, native soil infiltrating capacity, and natural groundwater recharge areas shall be preserved and used for stormwater infiltration and conveyance, to the extent practical and reasonably feasible, to meet the requirements of this section. 
(2)  Emergency overland flow for all stormwater facilities shall be provided to prevent exceeding the safe capacity of downstream property or public safety. 
(n)  Exemptions. 
(1)  Internally drained sites. The site is internally drained and will not discharge runoff from the site after development occurs. The site must be evaluated using post developed conditions assuming frozen conditions (CN = 98), no infiltration and the 100-year critical duration storm when determining safe structure elevations. 
(2)  Site conditions. It may be impracticable to meet the requirements due to site conditions such as slopes, soils, proximity to structures or desirable trees, limited site dimensions, surrounding land uses, the potential for groundwater contamination, public health or safety problems, or other factors beyond the control of the developer. No site shall be entitled to an exemption under this section due solely to the size of the proposed land development activity in relation to the parcel size. However, the city shall provide special consideration in granting exemptions under this section for the following type of sites: 
a.  Redevelopment sites; 
b.  In-fill development areas less than five acres; 
c.  Highway projects where limited public right-of-way land is available for the installation of storm water BMPs.

A motor vehicle shall not be considered an abandoned motor vehicle when it is out of ordinary public view. 
(2)  Removal and impoundment of abandoned vehicles. Any vehicle in violation of this subsection (b) shall be impounded until lawfully claimed or disposed of under subsection (b)(3) of this section; except if the chief of police or his authorized representative determines that the cost of towing and storage charges for the impoundment would exceed the value of the vehicle, the vehicle may be junked by the city prior to expiration of the impoundment period upon determination by the chief of police or his authorized representative that the vehicle is stolen or not wanted for evidence or any other reason.

Upon sale of an abandoned vehicle, the city shall supply the purchaser with a completed form designed by the department of transportation enabling the purchaser to obtain a regular certificate of title for the vehicle. The purchaser shall have ten days to remove the vehicle from the storage area, but shall pay a reasonable storage fee established by the city for each day the vehicle remains in storage after the second business day subsequent to the sale date. Ten days after the sale, the purchaser shall forfeit all interest in the vehicle and the vehicle shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be sold again.

No person, after receipt of such notice, shall remove such motor vehicle or parts to any other private property upon which storage is not permitted or onto any public highway or other public property for purposes of storage. Such storage is declared to be a public nuisance and may be abated or removed and penalties imposed as provided in this Code.

Such business enterprises shall include auto junkyards, auto repair and auto body shops but shall not include automobile service stations. 
(3)  Notice of removal. Whenever the chief of police or any member of his department finds or is notified that any such motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts have been stored or permitted to remain on any private property within the city, the chief of police shall send by certified mail a notice to the owner of record of such motor vehicle or parts, if such owner can be ascertained, and also to the owner of the property upon which stored to remove the vehicle or vehicle parts within ten days.

Sec. 34-44. - Sex offender residing within 2,000 feet of schools, day care centers, parks and other specified facilities and uses prohibited; child safety zones. 
(a)  Purpose. This section is a regulatory measure intended to protect the health and safety of children in [the] City of Delafield from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences. The city finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety. When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be re-crested [rearrested] for a new rape or sexual assault. Given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense, there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools, day care centers and other places children frequent. The city finds and declares that in addition to schools and day care centers, children congregate or play at public parks.

Such charge or assessment need not be stated in amount, but shall be sufficient in the aggregate to defray the expenses of such trustee in providing the facilities for safety, congestion control, property protection, health and public welfare. 
(b)  Every such trustee shall provide, upon or closely appurtenant to every such accessway, each of the following facilities: 
(1)  A supply of pure drinking water. 
(2)  Adequate sanitary facilities for each sex. 
(3)  Electric lighting sufficient to provide safe and adequate illumination in darkness until 10:00 p.m. and thereafter so long as any person may pass upon or over such accessway. 
(4)  Direct and adequate access for police and emergency vehicles from a dedicated public highway, road or street to a point on such accessway which is not more than 50 feet from the shoreline, which access shall be surfaced for all weather use by such vehicles. 
(5)  Launching and docking facilities sufficient to provide for the safe launching and docking of not less than one 12-foot outboard or rowboat for each parcel or building lot intended to share in such access or, in the case of a public access, for not less than 100 such boats.

(c)  Wherever any such accessway is dedicated to the use of the public, and the city accepts the same for public use and agrees to operate, police and maintain the same, the provisions for private plat covenant, for operation by trustee, and for safety, health and welfare facilities may be dispensed with. But such dedication and acceptance must, in each such case, precede or be simultaneous with plat approval; and the approving authority of the city must determine, as a condition of such acceptance, that the accessway is reasonably adapted to public use for such purposes and will not disproportionately burden city revenues. 
(d)  At the present time there are sufficient public, private and quasi-public areas, which afford adequate access to the lake and river, so that there is no necessity for any further such access sites. Therefore, no division of land into separate tracts or parcels of land shall be permitted which creates or uses any site, tract, strip or piece of land lying on any lake or stream, any portion of which is within the city corporate limits for the use of, or access to, such lake or stream for the benefit of any tract, lot or parcel of land which is offshore, whether such use or access is by free title, reservation or easement.

Sec. 42-13. - Occupancy of right-of-way. 
(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  Purpose and findings. In the exercise of governmental functions the city has priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way.

The taxpayers of the city bear the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way and a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is the frequent excavation by persons who locate facilities therein. 
a.  The city finds increased use of the public rights-of-way and increased costs to the taxpayers of the city and that these costs are likely to continue into the foreseeable future.

If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the department may revoke the permit pursuant to subsection (l) of this section. 
(j)  Ongoing management fees. The cost of trimming trees around facilities is an ongoing cost to the city. The specific cost will be determined and a fee to offset those costs may be assessed in the future. 
(k)  Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a permit to excavate and/or occupy the right-of-way does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by any other city, county, state, or federal rules, laws or regulations. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work. 
(l)  Revocations, suspensions, refusals to issue or extend permits. 
(1)  The department may refuse to issue a permit or may revoke, suspend or refuse to extend an existing permit if it finds any of the following grounds:

b.  Issuance of a permit for the requested date would interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival or other event; 
c.  Misrepresentation of any fact by the applicant or permittee; 
d.  Failure of the applicant or permittee to maintain required bonds and/or insurance; 
e.  Failure of the applicant or permittee to complete work in a timely manner; 
f.  The proposed activity is contrary to the public health, safety or welfare; 
g.  The extent to which right-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; 
h.  The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way; 
i.  The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other rights-of-way for the facilities of the permittee or applicant; 
j.  The applicability of ordinances or other regulations of the right-of-way that affect location of facilities in the right-of-way. 
(2)  Discretionary issuance. The department may issue a permit where issuance is necessary: 
a.  To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the permittee or applicant; or 
b.  To allow such customer to materially improve its utility service; or 
c.  To allow the permittee or applicant to comply with state or federal law or city ordinance or an order of a court or administrative agency. 
(3)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the department revoking, suspending, refusing to issue or refusing to extend a permit may file a request for review with the city council.

(m)  Work done without a permit. 
(1)  Emergency situations. 
a.  Each registrant shall immediately notify the city by verbal notice on an emergency phone number provided by the city of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency.

Within two business days after the occurrence of the emergency the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and otherwise fully comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
b.  If the city becomes aware of any emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the department may attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary to protect the public safety as a result of the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency. 
(2)  Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and shall in addition to any penalties prescribed by ordinance, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by this chapter or other chapters of the General Ordinances of the City of Delafield, deposit with the department the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter. 
(n)  Location of facilities. 
(1)  Undergrounding. Unless in conflict with state or federal law, except when existing aboveground facilities are used, the installation of new facilities and replacement of old facilities shall be done underground or contained within buildings or other structures in conformity with applicable codes. 
(2)  Limitation of space. The department may prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of persons to occupy and use the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the department shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but may prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities when required to protect the public, health, safety or welfare. 
(o)  Relocation of facilities. A registrant must, promptly and at its own expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the right-of-way whenever the city, acting in its governmental capacity, requests such removal and relocation. If requested, the registrant shall restore the right-of-way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person shall not be required to remove or relocate its facilities from any right-of-way which has been vacated in favor of a non-governmental entity unless and until the reasonable costs thereof are first paid to the person therefor. 
(p)  Interference with other facilities during municipal construction. When the city performs work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, shore, or move a registrant's facilities, the city shall notify the local representative. The registrant shall meet with the city's representative within 24 hours and coordinate the protection, maintenance, supporting and/or shoring of the registrant's facilities. The registrant shall accomplish the needed work within 72 hours, unless the city agrees to a longer period. In the event that the registrant does not proceed to maintain, support, shore or move its facilities, the city may arrange to do the work and bill the registrant, said bill to be paid within 30 days. 
(q)  Abandoned facilities. 
(1)  Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue its operations in the city must either: 
a.  Provide information satisfactory to the department that the registrant's obligations for its facilities under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another registrant; or 
b.  Submit to the department a proposal and instruments for dedication of its facilities to the city. If a registrant proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option: 
1.  Accept the dedication for all or a portion of the facilities; or 
2.  Require the registrant, at its own expense, to remove the facilities in the right-of-way at ground or above ground level; or 
3.  Require the registrant to post a bond or provide payment sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities. 
However, any registrant who has unusable and abandoned facilities in any right-of-way shall remove it from that right-of-way within two years, unless the department waives this requirement. 
(2)  Abandoned facilities. Facilities of a registrant who fails to comply with subsection (q)(1) of this section, and which, for two years, remains unused shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. In addition to any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, the city may, at its option: 
a.  Abate the nuisance; 
b.  Take possession of the facilities; or 
c.  Require removal of the facilities by the registrant, or the registrant's successor in interest. 
(3)  Public utilities. This section shall not apply to a public utility, as defined by Wis. Stats. § 196.01(5), that is required to follow the provisions of Wis. Stats. § 196.81. 
(r)  Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city, by the granting of a permit to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the right-of-way, or by registering a person under this chapter does not surrender or in any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or maybe hereafter granted to the city under the constitution and statutes of the State of Wisconsin to regulate the use of the right-of-way by the permittee; and the permittee by its acceptance of a permit to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the right-of-way or of registration under this chapter agrees that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory powers, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general law, and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. 
(s)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
(t)  Penalty. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than $120.00 nor more than $600.00. Each day such violation or failure to comply continues shall be considered a separate offense.

(1)  Any person arrested for a violation of this chapter may make a deposit of money as directed by the arresting officer at the police station or at the office of the clerk of court or by mailing the deposit to such places. The arresting officer or the person receiving the deposit shall notify the arrested person, orally or in writing, that: 
a.  If the person makes a deposit for a violation of a traffic regulation, he need not appear in court at the time fixed in the citation and will be deemed to have tendered a plea of no contest and submitted to a forfeiture and penalty assessment, if required by Wis. Stats. § 757.07, a jail assessment, if required by Wis. Stats. § 53.46(1), plus any applicable fees prescribed in Wis. Stats. ch. 814, not to exceed the amount of the deposit that the court may accept as provided in Wis. Stats. § 345.37. 
b.  If the person fails to make a deposit for a violation of a traffic regulation or appear in court at the time fixed in the citation, the court may enter a default judgment finding the person guilty of the offense or issue a warrant for his arrest. 
(2)  The amount of the deposit shall be determined in accordance with the deposit schedule established by the Wisconsin Judicial Conference and shall include the penalty assessment established under Wis. Stats. § 757.07, a jail assessment, if required by Wis. Stats. § 53.46(1), and court costs. If a deposit schedule has not been established, the arresting officer shall require the alleged offender to deposit the forfeiture established by the municipal judge, which shall include the penalty assessment established under Wis. Stats. § 757.07. Deposits for nonmoving violations shall not include the penalty assessment. 
(3)  The officer or clerk receiving payment in person shall issue the arrested person a receipt therefor as required by Wis. Stats. § 345.26(3)(b).

Stats. § 345.27(1) and (2), the person may, within 60 days after being notified of the revocation or suspension of the operating privilege, petition the court to reopen the judgment and grant him an opportunity to defend on merits. If the court finds that the petitioner was not informed as required under Wis. Stats. § 345.27(1) and (2), the court shall order the judgment reopened. The court order reopening the judgment automatically reinstates the revoked or suspended operating privilege. 
(d)  Notice of demerit points and receipts. Every officer accepting a forfeited penalty or money deposit under this chapter shall receipt therefor in triplicate as provided in Wis. Stats. § 345.26(3)(b). Every officer accepting a stipulation under the provisions of this chapter shall comply with the provisions of Wis. Stats. §§ 343.28, 345.26(1)(a) and 345.27(2), and shall require the alleged violator to sign a statement of notice in substantially the form contained on the uniform traffic citation and complaint promulgated under Wis. Stats. § 345.11, as amended, revised, renumbered from time to time.

Sec. 50-3. - Delafield-Hartland water pollution control commission. 
(a)  Created. Commission created a joint commission to represent the City of Delafield and Village of Hartland. Such commission shall be known as the "Delafield-Hartland Water Pollution Control Commission" (hereafter called the "commission"), pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.30. The purpose of this commission is to provide sewage collection, treatment and distribution services for the municipalities and such persons, organizations or municipalities as the commission may contract with pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, and all of the actions taken by the commission prior to the effective date hereof, are hereby confirmed and ratified in all respects. It is hereby declared that the commission has not been created for profit and that no part of any net income of the commission shall inure to the benefit of any individual, organization or association created for profit. 
(b)  Membership. 
(1)  Number of members. The commission shall be composed of eight members, four selected by each municipality. 
(2)  Selection. The members selected by each municipality shall be appointed by the mayor or village president, as the case may be, and such appointment shall be confirmed by a majority vote of such municipality's governing body. 
(3)  Term of office. The term of office of all commission members shall be for three years commencing on June 1 and ending on May 31. 
(4)  Removal. Any commission member selected by a municipality may be removed without cause by a four-fifths vote of the governing body of such municipality; provided, however, that such removal shall become effective only upon the appointment of a successor member pursuant to subsection (b)(5) of this section. For purposes of subsection (b)(5) of this section, such a vote to remove a commission member shall be deemed to create a vacancy in such member's office notwithstanding the fact that such member shall continue to hold such office until his or her successor shall be appointed. Upon such removal, the clerk of such municipality shall notify the clerk of the commission in writing of such removal. 
(5)  Vacancies. A vacancy in the office of a commission member created for any reason shall be filled by the municipality from which such member has been previously selected by the appointment of a successor member by the chief executive officer of such municipality, which such appointment shall be confirmed by a majority vote of the governing body of such municipality. Each successor so selected shall serve the remaining term of the member whose office has been vacated. 
(6)  Alternate members of the commission. In recognition that members of the commission may be unable to attend meeting(s) of the commission due to absence, illness or other reason, the presiding officer of the municipality (i.e., the mayor or village president, as the case may be), shall appoint at least two alternate members who can fill in whenever appointed members are unable to attend any meeting of the commission. Alternate members shall serve a term of one year or until their successor(s) shall have been duly appointed. Whenever it shall appear to the chairperson of the commission, or to the chairperson's designee, that one or both of the municipalities will not have all of the members appointed by such municipality present at any meeting of the commission due to illness, absence or otherwise, the chairperson may communicate the need for one or more alternate members to attend such meeting, by contacting the presiding officer of the municipality (the mayor or village president). The mayor or village president, as the case may be, shall designate an alternate member to attend such meeting in place of the member who is not able to attend; and in such event, the alternate member shall have the same power and authority as the member in question. The alternate member may continue to attend all meetings of the commission until such time as the member (in whose stead the alternate member has been so designated) is able to attend meeting of the commission. Alternate members shall be appointed by the mayor or village president in writing, which writing shall be filed with the city or village clerk, as the case may be, and with the clerk of the commission. 
(c)  Officers. 
(1)  Offices designated. The officers of the commission shall be a chairman, vice-chairman, clerk and treasurer.

No disbursements shall be made by the commission for any item included in a budget until such budget shall have been approved by the governing bodies of the municipalities. No disbursements shall be made for any item, which disbursements in the aggregate exceed the total amount budgeted for such item without the consent of the governing bodies of the municipalities. After the commission shall have received the proceeds of such mortgage revenue bonds, each budget adopted by the commission shall be submitted to the municipalities for information purposes only, and neither the nature nor amounts of disbursements made by the commission for items included in such a budget shall be subject to approval by the governing bodies of the municipalities.

1.  All expenses incurred by the commission in connection with the operation and maintenance of its sewer facilities, including the overhead expenses of the commission and its employees. 
2.  All expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds and the principal and interest payments to be made on such bonds; and which will be sufficient to establish any reserve for depreciation with respect to the commission's sewer facilities which the commission shall determine is necessary in order to pay the costs of any replacements or extensions of or any improvements or additions to the commission's sewer facilities. Subject to the requirements of the foregoing sentence, such contracts shall contain such provisions as the commission shall deem appropriate, and the commission shall not be required to contract with any user of the commission's sewer facilities upon the same terms as any or all other users of such facilities. Such contracts may be amended from time to time as the commission deems appropriate. 
(5)  Examination of books and records. The commission shall permit the officers of both municipalities or their duly authorized agents to inspect the books and records of the commission at any time.

(4)  The Delafield-Hartland water pollution control commission shall have the responsibility to operate, manage and control the treatment plant and interceptors on behalf of the city and village. 
(5)  Each municipality shall be solely responsible for construction, maintenance and control of its own sewerage disposal mains, laterals and layout wherever not jointly used by the municipalities. 
(g)  Additional users. The commission may enter into contracts, as provided in subsection (e)(4)d of this section, with any person, organization or municipality other than the municipalities for the purpose of providing to such other contracting party the use of the commission's sewer facilities. As used in this section, the term "municipality" shall include any city, village, town, town sanitary district or school district. Each municipality hereby covenants that it will not enter into a contract with any person, organization or municipality to provide the use of the municipality's sewer utility services unless: 
(1)  Within a reasonable time after learning of such person's, organization's or municipality's interest in obtaining the use of such sewer utility services, such municipality shall inform the commission in writing of such interest; and 
(2)  The commission shall either: 
a.  Waive in a writing delivered to the clerks of both municipalities its right to contract directly with such person, organization or municipality pursuant to this subsection (g); or 
b.  Fail, within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice from such municipality, to execute such a waiver or to deliver to the clerk of such municipality written notice of its intent to enter into such a contract. 
(h)  Termination of the commission. The commission may be terminated at any time upon the majority vote of the governing bodies of both municipalities, provided that the commission shall not be terminated unless all of its outstanding indebtedness shall have been paid in full or funds shall have been irrevocably set aside in an amount sufficient to pay such indebtedness in full along with all interest accruing thereon and any other changes related thereto. Upon such termination: 
(1)  Title to all assets owned by the commission other than cash and marketable securities shall vest in both municipalities as tenants-in-common, each having an undivided one-half interest in such assets; and 
(2)  After all of the commission's liabilities have been satisfied and provision has been made for the satisfaction of any and all of the commission's contingent liabilities, all remaining cash and marketable securities of the commission shall be paid and distributed to the municipalities in equal shares. 
(i)  Amendment. This section shall not be amended except by an ordinance adopted by both the village and the City of Delafield. 
(1)  If the governing bodies of the city and village cannot agree on any decision regarding such jointly owned treatment plant or interceptors, the matter shall be submitted to an arbitration committee consisting of a representative picked by the city, a representative picked by the village and a third member chosen by the two representatives. The arbitration committee shall schedule a date for a hearing. The arbitration committee, before deciding the dispute, shall call for and consider the recommendation of the Delafield-Hartland water pollution control commission. 
(2)  The decision of the arbitration committee shall be binding and the municipalities hereby agree to abide by the decision. There shall be no right of appeal except in the event the decision is arbitrary and capricious or in violation of the law and then the appeal shall be to the circuit court of Waukesha within 30 days of the decision.

(d)  Administrative rules and regulations. The following rules, regulations and ordinances for the regulation of licensed plumbers, sewer users, property owners and others, are hereby adopted and established: 
(1)  General provisions. 
a.  Agreement to rules and regulation. All persons now receiving sewerage service from the municipality or who may hereafter make application for such service or who otherwise receive such service, shall be considered as having agreed to be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this section, as amended from time to time; and such agreement is a condition precedent to the provision of such sewerage service. 
b.  Application for service. Every person desiring to connect property, buildings or structures to public sewers shall make application in writing to the municipality on such forms as are prescribed for that purpose, prior to commencing use of such service. The application must describe fully and truthfully all the wastes which are anticipated to be discharged. If the applicant is not the fee simple owner of the property, the written consent of the owner must accompany the application. Persons connected to the public sewers of the municipality are referred to herein as "users." By submitting such an application, all users are deemed to have agreed to be bound by this section, as amended from time to time. If it appears that the service applied for will not provide adequate service for the contemplated use, the municipality may reject the application. If the municipality approves the application, it shall issue a connection permit as shown on the application. No service shall be provided or application approved without prior payment of all applicable fees. 
c.  Application fee. Where the application for service is for a connection to the municipality's public sewers, the application shall be accompanied by an application fee(s) in an amount to be determined from time to time by the municipality. Such fee shall cover the cost of processing the application and inspection of the connection. Application fees may vary in amount between residential users and commercial/industrial users. The payment of this fee shall be in addition to any connection fees that may be charged to or on account of new users by the municipality and/or by the Del-Hart commission. 
d.  Inspections. Any connection to the public sewers within the municipality shall be subject to the prior inspection and approval of the work by an authorized representative of the municipality. No trench or other excavation shall be filled, or any connection completed, without such prior inspection. The applicant requesting the connection shall reimburse the municipality for all inspection costs incurred, if not previously paid as part of the application fee. 
e.  Disconnection and refusal of service. Sewer service may be disconnected or refused for any of the following reasons: 
1.  Violation of this section, as amended from time to time; 
2.  Violation of the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended from time to time; 
3.  Failure to pay the application fee, any connection fee or delinquent sewer service charges of the user. 
f.  Disconnection for delinquent accounts or where dangerous conditions exist. 
1.  A bill for service is delinquent if unpaid after the due date shown on the bill. The municipality may disconnect service for a delinquent bill by giving the user, at least eight calendar days prior to disconnection, a written disconnect notice which may be included in the bill for service. For purposes of this section, the due date shall not be less than 20 days after issuance of the bill. 
2.  The municipality may disconnect service without notice where a dangerous condition exists for as long as the condition exists. Service may be denied to any user for failure to comply with the applicable requirements of this section and regulations or if a dangerous or unsafe condition exists on the user's property. 
g.  Subsequent amendments. The municipality reserves the right to subsequently amend, modify, repeal and modify, any or all provisions of this section. 
(2)  Plumbers. No plumber, pipe fitter, or other person will be permitted to do any plumbing or pipe fitting work in connection with the sewer system without first receiving a license from the State of Wisconsin and obtaining permission from the municipality in which the work is to be performed. All service connections to the sewer main shall comply with the state plumbing code, as amended. 
(3)  Mandatory connections. 
a.  Within the municipality, the owner of each parcel of land adjacent to a public sewer main on which there exists a building used or usable for human habitation or in a block through which such system is extended, shall connect to the sewer system within 365 days of notice in writing from the municipality. Upon failure to do so, the municipality may cause such connection to be made and bill the property owner for all such costs. If such costs are not paid within 30 days, such costs shall constitute a special tax lien against the property, in the manner provided for by law. However, the owner may within 30 days after the completion of the work file a written election with the municipality stating that the owner cannot pay such amount in one sum and ask that the sum be levied in five or less equal annual installments. The amount shall be so collected with interest at a rate of two percent per annum above the city's current rate of borrowing from the date of completion of the work, all as determined by the municipality. The unpaid balance shall constitute a special tax lien, all pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 281.45, as amended. 
b.  In lieu of the above, the municipality, at its option, may impose a penalty for the period that the violation continues after ten days' written notice to any owner failing to make a connection to the sewer system. The penalty shall be in the amount of $40.00 per day. Upon failure to make such payment, said penalty shall be assessed as a special tax lien against the property, all pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 281.45, as amended. 
c.  Property with private wastewater disposal systems on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be exempt from the requirement of subsection (d)(3)a of this section, provided the Waukesha County department of public health certifies to the city that such private wastewater disposal systems are not polluting groundwater or otherwise creating a health hazard. Upon receipt of a report of inspection and such certification, the property with private wastewater disposal systems shall be deemed exempt from the requirements of subsection (d)(3)a of this section. Such property shall remain exempt from the requirements of subsection (d)(3)a of this section upon submission by the owner of record, at least once every two years, of proof or certification that the private wastewater disposal systems are not polluting groundwater or otherwise creating a health hazard. If the property is transferred or conveyed, or if as a condition of issuing a building permit for the property, the existing septic system must be in any way modified, changed or upgraded so as to increase the capacity of the septic system, the transferee or owner shall be required to comply with subsection (d)(3)a of this section within one year of the date of transfer, conveyance or issuance of the building permit. Except as otherwise provided herein, the duration of any exemption provided under this subsection shall not exceed a period of ten years, and upon expiration of the exemption, mandatory connection shall be required in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d)(3)a of this section. 
(4)  Building sewer connection expense. Persons attaching to a public sewer shall have the building sewer, or lateral, installed at their own cost and expense. 
(5)  Tap permits. After sewer connections have been introduced into any building or upon any premises, no plumber shall make any alterations, extensions, or attachments, unless the party ordering such tapping or other work exhibits the proper permit for the same from the municipality. 
(6)  Obstruction of building sewers in public rights-of-way. In the event of any blockage, damage or break in any building sewer, which occurs within a public street, alley, highway, or other public right-of-way, the municipality shall have the exclusive right and option to repair the building sewer within said street, alley, highway, or right-of-way. In such event, the owner of the building sewer shall promptly reimburse the municipality for all costs so incurred. If not so reimbursed, the same shall be added to the owner's sewer service charges and collected in the same manner as such charges are so collected. 
(7)  User use only. No user shall allow other persons or other services to connect to the sewer system through their lateral or building sewer. 
(8)  Discontinuance of service. Whenever any person desires to discontinue sewer service from the system, the municipality must be notified in writing prior to such disconnection. 
(9)  User to permit inspection. Every user shall permit the municipality or its duly authorized agent, at all reasonable times, to enter their premises or building to examine the pipes and fixtures, and the manner in which the drains, and sewer connections operate; and the user must at all times, frankly and without concealment, answer all questions put to them relative to its use, all in accordance with this section and Wis. Stats. § 196.171, to the extent applicable. 
(10)  Municipal responsibility. It is expressly stipulated that no claim shall be made against the municipality or its officers, commissioners, agents, employees and representatives by reason of the breaking, clogging, stoppage, or freezing of any pipes; nor from any damage arising from repairing mains, making connections or extensions or any other work that may be deemed necessary. The right is hereby reserved to cut off sewer service at any time for the purpose of repairs or any other necessary purpose, any permit granted or regulations to the contrary notwithstanding. Whenever it shall become necessary to shut off the sewer within the municipality, the municipality shall, if practicable, give notice to each and every user within the affected area of the time when such service will be shut off. 
(11)  Excavations within public right-of-way. 
a.  In making excavations in public streets or other public highways for laying pipe or making repairs, the pavement and earth removed must be deposited in a manner that will result in the least inconvenience to the public. Prior to commencing any such excavations, a street opening and right-of-way opening permit shall be obtained from the municipality. In connection therewith, the person making application for such permit shall comply with such terms and conditions as the municipality may impose with respect to such excavation. Further, the person obtaining the permit shall guarantee that all excavation and repair of streets and the construction of facilities shall be free from defect in material and installation for a period of 12 months after restoring it to its original condition and official acceptance of the work. No person shall leave any such excavation made in any street or highway open at any time without barricades; and during the night, warning lights must be maintained at such excavations. All excavations shall be completely backfilled with slurry as required by the standard specifications of the street opening and right-of-way opening permit to prevent settling. This work, together with the replacing of sidewalks, ballast and paving, must be done so as to make the street as good, at least, as before it was disturbed, and satisfactory to the municipality. No opening of the streets for tapping the pipes will be permitted when the ground is frozen, except in emergency situations or except as the municipality may otherwise expressly allow in writing. 
b.  Any excavation performed under this subsection (d)(11) shall be subject to the inspection of the municipality, and no work shall be deemed completed unless and until accepted by the municipality. All work performed under this subsection (d)(11) and the inspection thereof shall be at the cost of the person obtaining the street opening and right-of-way opening permit described herein. 
(12)  Tapping the mains. Connections to the sewer system other than building sewer connections, shall be done only in accordance with the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended.

Admin. Code § COMM 82.10, "Basic Plumbing Principles," as amended. As required therein, all laterals shall be inspected. The building sewer and/or private interceptor main sewer shall be inspected upon completion of placement of the pipe and before backfilling and tested before or after backfilling. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the building inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the building inspector or his representative. 
(14)  No unauthorized connections. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the municipality. 
(15)  Classes of permits. 
a.  There shall be two classes of building sewer (plumbing) permits: 
1.  For residential and commercial service. 
2.  For service to establishments producing industrial wastes. 
b.  In either case, the owner or the owner's agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the city building inspector. A permit and inspection fee as established by resolution of the city council shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed. This permit and inspection fee may be from time to time amended by resolution of the city council. 
(16)  Old building sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found on examination and test by the building inspector to be in good condition and meet all requirements of this section. 
(17)  Construction requirements. The size, slope, alignment, materials and construction of a building sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the requirements of chapter 8 and all other applicable rules and regulations. 
(18)  Elevation. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer at the owner's expense. 
(19)  Excavations to be guarded. All excavations for building sewer installations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
(20)  Clear water drains. Roof leaders, swimming pool drains, surface drains, groundwater drains, foundation footing drains and other clear water drains shall be connected wherever possible with a storm sewer, but they shall not be connected to a building sewer which discharges into a sanitary sewer or private wastewater treatment plant. All such connections existing at the time of passage of this section shall thereafter be illegal. If stormwater or clear water is being discharged into a sanitary sewer, the city administrator or his designee shall give the offending person 15 days' notice to disconnect. Failure to disconnect after such notice shall authorize the city to cause disconnection and assessment of the costs of such disconnection against the property involved. The city may, in the alternative, institute action for violation of this paragraph. 
(21)  Connection into public sewers. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of chapter 8 and other applicable rules and regulations of the city, including license bond and street opening permit, where necessary.

(Code 1997, § 13.04)  
Sec. 50-5. - User charges. 
(a)  Sewer user charge system. 
(1)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subsection (a), shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Debt service charges means and includes all costs associated with repayment of debt(s) incurred for the construction and/or rehabilitation of the wastewater collection system and treatment facility. 
Domestic user equivalent (DUE) means a single-family residential dwelling unit that discharges normal domestic strength wastewater and shall be used as an equivalent measure of the average single-family residential flow. For purposes of this chapter, one DUE shall be assumed to equal 75,000 gallons per year (205 gallons per day). 
Normal domestic strength wastewater means wastewater with concentrations of CBOD, suspended solids, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus no greater than 200, 250, 40, and ten milligrams per liter (mg/l), respectively. 
Normal user means a user whose contributions to the sewerage system consist only of normal domestic strength wastewater originating from a house, apartment, flat, or other living quarters occupied by a person or person constituting of distinct household, business or commercial enterprise. 
Operation and maintenance costs means and includes all costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the sewerage system, including, but not limited to, administrative costs and expenses. 
Replacement costs means and includes all costs necessary to replace equipment as required to maintain capacity and performance during the design life of the sewerage facilities. When required by appropriate authority having jurisdiction thereof, a separate, segregated and distinct replacement fund shall be established and used for only replacement of equipment. 
(2)  Measurement. The unit of volume measurement for wastewater or other wastes discharged into the municipality's sewerage system shall be 1,000 gallons, United States liquid measure. The unit for assessing costs with respect to strength wastewater parameters shall be avoirdupois pounds. 
(3)  Fiscal policy. It shall be the policy of the municipality to obtain sufficient revenues to pay the costs of the operation and maintenance of the sewerage system, including debt service and a replacement fund (i.e., a cash account to be used for future expenditures for obtaining or installing replacement equipment, accessories or appurtenances which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance of the sewerage system during the service life for which such facilities were designed and constructed), through a system of sewer service charges as defined in this section. The system shall assure that each user of the sewerage system pays their fair and proportionate share of the cost of such facilities. 
(4)  Sewer service charges generally. Sewer service charges to each user shall be based on wastewater parameters established from time to time by the municipality. The sewer service charges shall consist of the sum of the annual debt service charges, all annual operation and maintenance costs, all replacement costs, and all sewer service charges levied or assessed to the municipality by the Del-Hart commission. 
(5)  Biennial review. The sewer service charges of the municipality shall be reviewed not less than biennially. Sewer service charges shall be adjusted, as required, to reflect actual number and size of users and actual costs. Users will be notified annually of the portion of such sewer service charges attributable to operation and maintenance, debt service, and replacement costs. For purposes hereof, the municipality may satisfy this notice requirement by including in the budget summary required to be published under Wis. Stats. § 65.90, a statement of the aforesaid components of the sewer service charges, based on the results of operations for the preceding fiscal year. 
(6)  Determination of sewer service charges. A sewer service charge is hereby imposed upon each lot, parcel of land, building, or premise served by the public sewer or otherwise discharging sewage, including industrial wastes, into the public sewerage system. Such sewer service charge shall be payable as hereinafter provided and in amount determined as follows: 
a.  Category A service charges shall be imposed on each user whose water use is metered and whose sewer discharges are normal domestic strength wastewater. The Category A service charge is of the following form: 
Service charge = DUE charge. 
DUE charge = The domestic user equivalent multiplied by the domestic user equivalent unit rate (DUE rate). 
DUE rate = The average cost of providing wastewater service to a residential customer for one calendar quarter. 
The number of domestic user equivalents assigned for a Category A sewer user shall be based on metered water usage. 
b.  Category B service charges shall be imposed on each user whose water use is not metered and whose sewage discharges are normal domestic strength wastewater. The Category B sewer service charge shall be of the form as follows: 
Service charge = DUE charge. 
DUE charge = The domestic user equivalent multiplied by the domestic user equivalent unit rate (DUE rate). 
DUE rate = The average cost of providing wastewater service to a residential customer for one calendar quarter. 
The number of domestic user equivalents assigned for a Category B sewer user shall be based on Schedule "A." 
c.  Category C service charges shall be imposed on users whose sewer discharges are high strength wastewater having concentrations of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) greater than 200 milligrams per liter (mg/l), and/or suspended solids greater than 250 milligrams per liter (mg/l) and/or total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) greater than 40 milligrams per liter (mg/l), and/or total phosphorus (TP) greater than ten milligrams per liter (mg/l). The form of the Category C service charge is as follows: 
Service charge = DUE charge + high strength surcharge. 
DUE charge = The domestic user equivalent multiplied by the domestic user equivalent unit rate (DUE rate). 
DUE rate = The average cost of providing wastewater service to a residential customer for one calendar quarter. 
High strength surcharge = The excessive CBOD, suspended solids, KN, and total phosphorus multiplied by the respective CBOD, suspended solids, TKN, and total phosphorus rates. The excessive CBOD, suspended solids, TKN, and total phosphorus are the portions of each of these constituents that are in excess of normal domestic strength wastewater. The excessive amounts of CBOD, suspended solids, TKN, and total phosphorus are expressed in pounds, and their respective rates are expressed in dollars per pound. 
Water usage for all Category C sewer users shall be metered and the number of domestic user equivalents assigned for a Category C sewer user shall be based on metered water usage. 
d.  Reassignment of categories of sewer users. The municipality may reassign sewer users into appropriate sewer service charge categories if wastewater sampling programs and other related information indicate a change of categories is necessary or otherwise required. 
(7)  Sewer rate determinations. The municipality shall determine each year, the sewer rates referred to in subsection (a)(6) of this section; and the municipality shall have the right to amend, modify, adjust, or change the rates at any time and from time to time. The DUE rate schedule is and shall be as follows: 
	2014 	2015 	2016 	2017 	2018 	2019 
Local conveyance (per month) 	$14.45 	$14.74 	$15.03 	$15.33 	$15.64 	$15.95 
Del-Hart Treatment (per month) 	$15.50 	$15.50 	$15.50 	$15.50 	$15.50 	$15.50 
Total per month 	$29.95 	$30.24 	$30.53 	$30.83 	$31.14 	$31.45 
Quarterly DUE rate 	$89.85 	$90.72 	$91.59 	$92.49 	$93.42 	$94.35 
 
The local conveyance (per month) charge shall continue to increase annually, effective January 1, by two percent until such time as the city's sewer fund operates at a profit, as indicated by the city's audited financial statements. 
The high strength surcharges for Category C sewer users shall be at the prevailing rate at the time as established by the city council. The rates shall be based on the Del-Hart commission charges to the city. The Del-Hart commission shall establish the rates by resolution. 
(8)  Domestic user equivalent (DUE) assignments. No user shall be assigned less than one domestic user equivalent. Any single-family residence shall be treated as a single DUE regardless of the metered or estimated wastewater originating from such single-family residence. Multiuse buildings, such as a mixture of a commercial establishment with a residence or apartments, will be charged a minimum of one DUE for each separate commercial user with metering required for each commercial use per subsection (a)(9) of this section and one DUE for each residence/apartment unit. Should there be an incidental commercial use combined with a residence with no significant additional flow being generated by the commercial use, there would not be an additional charge for the commercial use. Should there be multiple offices or shops in one building, a meter shall be installed to serve the building. DUEs shall be established to the nearest 0.25 DUE. The following schedule (Schedule "A"), shall be used to determine the appropriate number of DUEs for non-metered sewer users: 
SCHEDULE A. DOMESTIC USER EQUIVALENTS (DUEs) FOR VARIOUS USERS 
 
Type of User 	Number of DUEs 
Residential 
Single-family residence 	1 
Duplex 	2 
Apartments 	1 per apartment 
Condominiums 	1 per unit 
Institutional 
Community-based residential facility (CBRF) 	0.25 per resident (including support personnel)

Unit determinations for facilities not set forth in Schedule "A" shall be done on a case-by-case basis by the city council and approved by the Del-Hart commission. 
(9)  Water meters. The city council by a majority vote may require that all existing and new institutional, governmental, commercial, industrial users or other users whose flows may vary from permanent calculated estimates shall install a water meter with outside reading for all water usage. The city council by a majority vote may require that in multi-use buildings, such as a mixture of commercial and residential or apartments, a water meter shall be installed for the use where it would otherwise be required due to the commercial nature of the use. Upon majority vote of the council, certain commercial users may be exempt from the requirements to meter by reason of seasonal or periodic use or due to minimum flows. Meters shall be furnished and maintained by the city. Meters shall be replaced or tested by the city in accordance with the Public Service Commission requirements according to meter size. Installation of the meter shall be performed by a licensed plumber. All costs shall be at the expense of the user requiring the meter, including installation and any piping revisions required. The city will provide water usage readings on a quarterly basis within 30 days following the end of each quarter indicating water usage. If water usage of a facility is not in direct relationship to sewage flow, such as cooling water, lawn sprinkling or other process water not discharged into the sewer, then an exemption meter(s) may be installed as per subsection (a)(10) of this section. Water usage shall be the measure for determining both sewer service charges and additional connection fees. If a user's sewer flow based on water usage after a previous assignment of DUEs increases on an average of 1.00 DUE or more for a full year (July 1June 30), then and in that event the proper additional reserve capacity connection fee shall be billed the city by the Del-Hart commission and the city shall pass the cost (plus additional city connection fees) on to the user with the increased flow. Future sewer service charges shall also be based on the increased DUEs from that point on. The city shall order all users covered by this subsection to install and connect a water meter within one year of receipt of written notice from the city. 
DUEs may be established for other than single-family residential, duplex and multifamily units by the property owners by installation of an approved water meter and the supplying of the actual metered flow to the city administrator or his designee. The water meter shall be installed in such a manner to provide accessibility to the city administrator or his designee so actual meter readings can be observed. Once a meter is installed, it shall not be removed (except for exemption meters, which may be removed at the request of the user). If a meter becomes defective or damaged in some way, it shall be replaced at property owner's expense. The city shall not be responsible for damage to property because of a defective meter. All costs shall be at the expense of the person requiring the meter, including any piping revisions required to ensure that only water required to be sewered is metered by the meter. The sewer utility shall collect a meter charge for reading and maintaining meters. The amount of the quarterly meter charge shall be as established by the approving authority from time to time and shall be based on the meter size. This charge shall be in addition to the wastewater service charge. Regardless of the amount of metered water shown, no user shall be charged for less than one DUE. 
If commercial or industrial users obtain all or any part of their water from sources other than a public water utility, all or any part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the user shall be required to have a water meter or meters installed for the purposes of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. Should the city determine that the water usage is too small to justify a meter, the city shall have the authority to waive this requirement and a rate shall be established based on estimated water usage and the provisions in this section. Schedule A shall be used as the basis for such rates. The city shall charge for each meter to compensate for reading and servicing the meter. 
(10)  Exemption meters/credits for water not discharged to public sewers. If a person discharging wastes into the public sewers produces evidence satisfactory to the city that significant amounts of the total annual volume of metered water used for all purposes does not reach the sanitary sewer, the person may be permitted to have an exemption water meter installed. Such meter shall be furnished by the city. All other costs shall be at the expense of the user requiring the meter, including installation and any piping revisions required to ensure that only water not reaching the sanitary sewer is metered by the exemption meter. The city shall charge for each meter at the rate of 50 percent of the minimum service charge set for that size meter to compensate for furnishing, reading and servicing the meter. This charge shall be in addition to the wastewater service charge. The amount of exemption water metered shall be subtracted from the total amount of water used by the person to determine the applicable wastewater service charge. Regardless of the amount of metered exemptions, no user shall be charged for less than 1.00 DUE. 
(b)  Control of industrial wastes. 
(1)  General. 
a.  An "industrial discharge" or "industrial waste" shall have the same meaning as provided for in the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended from time to time. 
b.  Each person discharging industrial waste into the public sewers of the municipality shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Del-Hart Ordinance, in effect from time to time. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any industrial waste that contains substances or possesses characteristics that are detrimental to the municipality's sewerage collection system. In such event, the municipality may impose any of the treatment alternatives provided for in the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended from time to time. 
(2)  Control manholes. 
a.  Each person discharging industrial waste into a public sewer shall construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to facilitate observation, measurement, and sampling their waste, including domestic sewage. 
b.  Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built at such locations and in such manner as may be acceptable to the Del-Hart commission. If measuring devices are to be permanently installed, they shall be of a type acceptable to the Del-Hart commission. 
c.  Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall be installed by the person discharging the industrial waste at its expense, and shall be maintained by the person discharging the waste so as to be in safe condition, accessible, and in proper operating condition at all times. Plans for installation of the control manholes or access facilities and related equipment shall be approved by the Del-Hart commission prior to the beginning of construction. 
(3)  Wastewater measurement, sampling, and reporting. Wastewater flow measurements, sampling, and reporting shall be done in accordance with the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended from time to time. Each user discharging industrial waste into a public sewer shall be charged for all costs associated with sampling and analytical testing. 
(c)  Discharge of holding tank waste. 
(1)  General. For purposes of this section, the terms "holding tank waste" and "licensed disposer" shall have the same meaning as provided for in the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended from time to time. 
(2)  Prohibition of discharge into the municipality's public sewers. No person, including a licensed disposer, shall discharge any holding tank waste, or any other similar waste, into any manhole or other opening in a public sewer owned or maintained by the municipality. Instead, all such discharges of holding tank wastes shall be made pursuant to the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended from time to time. 
(d)  Billing and payment of sewer service charges. 
(1)  Calculation. Sewer service charges that are to be assessed to users shall be computed by the municipality according to the rates and methodology presented in subsection (a) of this section. 
(2)  Billing. Sewer service charges shall be billed to each user on a quarterly basis. Bills for such charges shall be sent out on or about the first business day of the first month of each quarter (April, July, October and January) and shall be due by the 25th day of that month. Every reasonable care will be exercised in the proper delivery of sewer bills. Failure to receive a sewer bill, however, shall not relieve any person of the responsibility for payment of sewer rates within the prescribed period nor exempt any person from any penalty imposed for delinquency in the payment. 
(3)  Penalty for delinquent payments. A penalty equal to one percent per month of the delinquent amount shown on any bill for services shall be added to all bills not paid by the date fixed therein for final payment. An additional penalty of ten percent shall be assessed and delinquent bills placed on the tax roll pursuant to the provisions set forth in Wis. Stats. § 66.0809(3), as amended from time to time. 
(4)  Remedies for failure to make payments. The municipality may direct that unpaid sewer service charges, connection fees, or other charges due from any person or user, shall be collected and taxed and shall be a lien upon the property served in the manner provided for in Wis. Stats. §§ 66.0809 and 66.0821(4)(d), as amended from time to time, or the municipality may utilize any other remedy available to it under Wisconsin law. 
(5)  Obligation for payment. The obligation for payment of sewer service charges, connection fees or other charges due the municipality shall be a joint and several obligation of the user and property owner, where the user and property owner are not the same person. To the end that there may be attempts at avoidance of payment of such charges and fees by nonproperty owner users, and to overcome the same, the municipality may send the bill for such a user, in care of the property owner. 
(6)  Remedies cumulative. All remedies provided for in this section are distinct and cumulative to any other right or remedy under this section or any other ordinance of the municipality or afforded by law or equity; and may be exercised by the municipality concurrently, independently, or successively. 
(7)  Disposition of revenue. The amounts received from the collection of sewer service charges authorized by this section shall be credited to the sanitary sewerage account which shall show all receipts and expenditures of the sewerage system. Charges collected for replacement expenses shall be credited to a segregated, nonlapsing replacement account. These funds are to be used exclusively for replacement. When appropriated by the municipality, the credits to the sanitary sewerage account shall be available for the payment of the requirements for operation, maintenance, repairs, and depreciation of the sewerage system consistent with 40 CFR 35.929. Any surplus outside the purview of 40 CFR 35.929, in said account, shall be available for the payment of principal and interest of obligations issued and outstanding, or which may be issued, to provide funds for said sewerage system, or part thereof, and all or a part of the expenses for additions and improvements and other necessary disbursements or indebtedness, and the municipality may resolve to pledge such surplus or any part thereof for any such purpose. All present outstanding sewer system obligations, including refunding obligations, shall be paid from this fund as to both principal and interest, unless otherwise required by law. 
(8)  Excess revenues. Excess revenues collected from a user class will be applied to operation and maintenance costs attributable to that class for the next year. 
(e)  Audit. Unless otherwise required by applicable statutes, the municipality shall conduct an annual compilation or an independent annual audit, the purpose of which shall be to maintain the proportionality between users and user classes of the user charge system and to ensure that adequate revenues are available relative to increasing operation, maintenance and replacement costs and debt retirement. A summary of the findings and recommendations of this audit shall be published, from time to time, as determined by the municipality. 
(f)  Connection charges. 
(1)  Del-Hart commission connection charge. For each connection of a building sewer to a public sewer within the municipality, there shall be paid to the municipality a connection charge as determined pursuant to the Del-Hart Ordinance, as amended from time to time, together with any other tapping fees, impact fees or similar charges imposed under such ordinance for the privilege of connecting to the public sewers. 
(2)  Municipality connection charges. For each connection of a building sewer to a public sewer within the municipality, there shall be paid to the municipality a connection charge, in the amount as is set forth in the municipality's charge schedule as adopted from time to time by the approving authority. The current (2013) connection charge is $2,637.00 per DUE (domestic user equivalent). Such connection charge shall be assessed to the person seeking the connection and shall be paid at the time a building permit is obtained and payment in full shall be a condition precedent to the actual connection. The amount of the connection charge of the municipality provided for hereunder may be amended as the approving authority may from time to time determine. 
(3)  Connection charges. For purposes of this section, the connection charges described in subsections (f)(1) and (2) of this section are collectively referred to as "connection charge(s)." The failure to pay any connection charge is a violation of this section; and this municipality may pursue all rights and remedies provided for herein. City and Del-Hart connection charges shall be based upon a user's potential needed capacity in the treatment facility in accordance with Schedule "A." Each new user or existing user who changes its use requiring additional capacity in the treatment facility shall be charged connection charges or additional connection charges, payable as provided herein. Such connection charges shall apply to all connections to the city's sewer system resulting from new construction or the change of an existing use whereby additional capacity shall be required from the treatment facility. The minimum connection charges shall never be less than 1.00 DUE regardless of the use of the premises from which connection is made. While it is contemplated herein that connection charges will be based upon the estimated future average flow of each new user or user changing their use, the city will on a periodic basis have the right to reevaluate any user's flow and strength and to charge additional connection charges if additional usage of the system is shown and additional capacity in the facility are utilized. The plumbing inspector shall ascertain the number of fixture units tributary to each building sewer and document that the building sewer meets the requirements as set forth in Wis. Admin. Code ch. Comm 82 and that the connection charges have been appropriately assessed as provided by this section. 
a.  New users. On or before the date of issuance of a building permit or plumbing permit for the construction of a new structure which will be connected to a building sewer that discharges into a public sewer, the city shall advise the commission of: 
1.  The parcel identification information where the connection is to occur; 
2.  The name, address and contact information of the new user; 
3.  Whether or not the new user will also be served by a public water supply system; 
4.  The number of DUEs applicable to the new user, which determination shall be made in accordance with Del-Hart Ordinance section 18.12.4(6); and 
5.  Any additional information the commission or its designee may reasonably require. 
Upon receipt of such information, the commission shall issue an invoice to the new user for the connection charges due the commission and the city. At said time, the commission shall provide the new user with a copy of Del-Hart Ordinance section 18.12.4(4) notifying the user of the user's rights of appeal as it relates to the determination of DUEs applicable to the property. The city shall collect the connection charges as a condition precedent to the issuance of the building or plumbing permit; provided, however, that the city may defer collection of the connection charges until issuance of an occupancy permit for the structure in question. 
b.  Appeal by new user. A new user who disputes: 
1.  The determination of DUEs applicable to such user; or 
2.  The determination of the connection charges; 
may within 60 days following the date of the commission's invoice described in subsection (b) of this section, file a written appeal with the commission specifying the nature of the dispute. No appeal may be considered by the commission unless the appeal is timely filed, as required herein, and the connection charges are paid in accordance with the terms of this chapter and the invoice. If an appeal is timely filed, the commission shall hold a hearing in accordance with Del-Hart Ordinance section 18.12.4(5). Any appeal not timely filed, shall be summarily denied by the commission. 
c.  Existing user's increase in wastewater discharges. Connection charges are also applicable to existing users who substantially increase their wastewater discharges to the wastewater facilities. For existing users, additional connection charges are due when the average daily flow from such User increases by 1.00 DUE or more over an average 24-month period, the first 12 months of which is determined on a July 1 through June 30 time period. Within 60 days following the end of the first 12-month period, the commission shall notify in writing (the "initial notice") the user and the city wherein the user is located that the average daily flow from such existing user exceeds the foregoing baseline. The initial notice shall advise the user and city of the excess wastewater discharge, the potential number of additional DUEs that may be assigned as a result of such excess, and the anticipated amount of the additional connection charges associated therewith and to become due to the commission if the user does not reduce such discharges. The existing User shall then have the succeeding July 1 through June 30 time period of 12 calendar months within which to take action and/or reduce the excess discharges. If the wastewater discharge is not subsequently reduced during the said second 12-month period of time, then the commission shall notify the user and city in writing of the additional DUEs that are due. Such notice (the "final notice") shall advise of the number of additional DUEs that have been assigned; the additional connection charges due to the commission and the city as a result thereof; and that the user has the right to appeal the determination of the additional DUEs that have been so assigned. The final notice shall include a copy of said section; and shall be given within 60 days following the end of the expiration of the second 12-month time period. 
d.  Appeal by existing user. An existing user shall have the right to appeal a determination assessing additional DUEs in accordance with the following procedure: 
1.  Within 60 days after the date of mailing of the final notice by the commission that additional connection charges are due as a result of additional DUEs resulting from increased flows, the said user may file a written appeal with the commission which written appeal shall: 
(i)  Request a reconsideration of the DUE determination; and 
(ii)  Specify the grounds, reasons, and/or facts supporting the request. 
2.  No appeal shall be permitted unless as a condition precedent, the additional connection charges are timely paid within 60 days after the filing of the final notice by the commission. Any appeal not timely filed shall be summarily dismissed. 
3.  If a timely appeal is taken, then the commission shall hold a hearing at which time the user and any interested party may present evidence and reasons in support of or in opposition to the appeal. The commission shall within 60 days after such hearing, render its decision, to the user, unless a longer period of time is granted by the user. If the appeal is based upon the claim that excess wastewater discharges are the result of a water leak or faulty meters, the user shall have the burden of proof to show: 
(i)  Good cause why the leak or faulty meter could not have been remedied within the 24-month period described in subsection (f)(3)c of this section; and 
(ii)  That the water resulting from the leak did not subsequently, either in whole or in part, enter the public sewerage system. 
4.  The decision of the commission shall be in writing and mailed to the user and customer in question. If the commission redetermines the assignment of DUEs to such user and/or the amount of the associated connection charges based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, it shall order the refund of any connection charges previously paid which are found to be unsubstantiated. Such refund shall be without interest thereon. 
5.  The user may appeal from the written decision of the commission by filing a petition for review within 60 days after date of mailing of the decision, with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0821(5), as amended. 
(g)  Violations, abatement procedures and penalties. 
(1)  Violations constituting public nuisance. A violation (other than the failure to pay sewer service charges or other fees or costs due under this section) of any provision of this section or any other rule or order of the municipality is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. 
(2)  Damage to municipality's property. No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure of equipment which is a part of the municipality's sewerage system. Any person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct. 
(3)  Enforcement. The municipality shall have the right to enforce the provisions of this section and shall make periodic inspections and inspections upon complaint to ensure that such provisions are not violated. No action shall be taken under this section to abate a public nuisance unless the municipality shall have inspected or caused to be inspected the premises where the nuisance is alleged to exist and shall have satisfied itself that a nuisance does in fact exist. 
(4)  Summary abatement. If the municipality determines that a public nuisance exists within the municipality and that there is great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the municipality may cause the same to be abated and charge the cost thereof to the owner, occupant, or person causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance, as the case may be. 
(5)  Abatement after notice. If the municipality determines that a public nuisance exists on the private premises but that the nature of such nuisance is not such as to present great and immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the municipality shall serve notice to the person causing or maintaining the nuisance to remove the same within ten days. If such nuisance is not removed within such ten days, the municipality shall cause the nuisances to be removed as provided in subsection (g)(4) of this section. 
(6)  Other methods not excluded. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the abatement of public nuisances by the municipality or its officials in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin. 
(7)  Court order. Except when necessary under section 50-4, the municipality shall not use force to obtain access to private property to abate a public nuisance, but shall request permission to enter upon private property if such premises are occupied, and, if such permission is denied, shall apply to any court having jurisdiction for an order assisting the abatement of public nuisance. 
(8)  Cost of abatement. In addition to any other penalty imposed by this section for the erection, contrivance, creation, continuance or maintenance of a public nuisance, the cost of abating a public nuisance by the municipality shall be collected as a debt from the owner, occupant, or person causing, permitting, or maintaining the nuisance, and such cost shall be assessed against the real estate as a special charge. For purposes hereof, costs shall include, but not be limited to, actual attorneys' fees and court costs. 
(9)  Continued violations. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the aforesaid notice time limit provided shall forfeit not less than $500.00 nor more than $1,000.00 together with the costs of prosecution. In default of payment of such forfeiture and costs, said violator shall be imprisoned in the Waukesha County jail for a period of not to exceed 30 days. Each day in which any violation is continued beyond the aforesaid notice time limit shall be deemed a separate offense. 
(10)  Accidental discharge. Any person found to be responsible for accidentally allowing a deleterious discharge into the sewerage system which causes damage to the sewerage system and/or a receiving body of water (e.g., lake, river, stream, etc.) shall, in addition to a fine, pay the amount to cover all damages, both of which will be determined by the municipality or other governmental authority having appropriate jurisdictions. 
(11)  Accidental discharge reporting. Any person responsible for an accidental discharge that may have a detrimental impact on the sewerage system, shall immediately report the nature and amount of the discharge to the Del-Hart commission. 
(12)  Liability for losses. Any person violating any provision of this section shall become liable to the municipality for any expense, attorneys' fees, costs, engineering fees, loss, or damage occasioned by reason of such violation which the municipality may suffer as a result thereof. Without intent to limit the generality of the foregoing, the municipality shall have the right of recovery from all such persons, any expense incurred by the municipality for the repair or replacement of any part of the public sewerage system damaged in any manner by any person by the performance of any work under its control, or by any negligent acts. 
(h)  Appeals. 
(1)  Review of administrative determinations. Any person having a substantial interest which is adversely affected by an administrative determination of the municipality or any agent thereof, may have such determination reviewed or provided for herein. Only administrative determinations described in Wis. Stats. § 68.02, as amended from time to time, are subject to review under this subsection (h). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any determinations involving sewer service charges (or any component thereof), application fees, connection fees, or any other fees or costs due under this section are not subject to review hereunder. Further, any determinations involving the levying and assessment of special assessments or any of the determinations described in Wis. Stats. § 68.03 are not subject to review hereunder. 
(2)  Procedure for review. A person satisfying the requirements of subsection (h)(1) of this section, shall first make a written request to the municipality for a review of the administrative determination, which request shall be submitted to the approving authority within 15 days following the determination in question. The request shall be in writing, shall state the name and address of the person seeking the review, shall describe the circumstances surrounding the determination and shall state the grounds upon which such person contends that the determination should be modified or reversed. 
(3)  Hearing. Upon receipt of a request for review under subsection (h)(2) of this section, the person seeking the review shall have a hearing before the approving authority, provided the provisions of subsection (h)(4) of this section are satisfied. The hearing shall be held at a time and place determined by the approving authority, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request. The approving authority shall notify such person, by mail or personal service, at least ten days before such hearing of the time and place of the hearing. Except as otherwise provided for herein, the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 68.11(2), as amended from time to time. 
(4)  Costs. Any appeal to the approving authority under subsection (h)(2) of this section shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable review fee of $250.00. In the event the person seeking review desires the hearing proceedings to be taken by stenographer or by a recording device, the expense thereof shall be paid by the person seeking the review. 
(5)  Decision and appeal. Within 30 days of completion of the hearing under subsection (h)(3) of this section and the filing of briefs, if any, the approving authority shall make its written determination on the request for review. Such determination shall be mailed or delivered to such person at the address set forth in the request for review. The decision of the approving authority may be subject to judicial review under Wis. Stats. § 68.13, as amended from time to time, in the manner provided for therein. 
(6)  Application of Wis. Stats. ch. 68. Except as to those specific statutes expressly incorporated herein, the municipality elects not to be governed by any other provision of Wis. Stats. ch. 68, as amended. 
(7)  Costs. In the event the approving authority does not modify or reverse the administrative determination in question following the hearing thereon, or in the event the administrative determination is sustained on appeal under Wis. Stats. § 68.13, then in either of such events, the person who has sought the review shall reimburse the municipality for all hearing and court costs incurred, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees. 
(i)  Septic systems. 
(1)  Septic tanks prohibited. Except as otherwise allowed by the exemptions contained in section 50-4(d)(3)c, the maintenance and use of a septic tank or other private sewerage disposal system by any owner of land located within the municipality, where such land is adjacent to a public sewer main, and who has failed to connect to the municipality's sewerage system once so directed to connect, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and a health hazard. Such nuisance and hazard shall be abated; and damages and costs recovered therefore in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 823.02. 
(2)  Septic systems allowed. In certain isolated locations within the boundaries of the municipality it may be necessary for the owners of certain properties not served by the municipality's sanitary sewer system to continue the maintenance and use of a septic tank or other private sewerage disposal system. Such maintenance and use shall also be allowed according to the exemptions contained in section 50-4(d)(3)c. Such maintenance and use shall be considered as a temporary wastewater disposal system and is subject to the review and approval of the municipality. The review and approval will be on a case-by-case basis, with each case determined upon its particular facts and circumstances. 
(3)  Written permit required. Before commencement of the construction of a private wastewater disposal system or additions to an existing private wastewater disposal system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit from the office of the proper state or county agency. 
(4)  Size of system. The type, capacity, location and layout of a private wastewater disposal system shall comply with all state and county requirements. 
(5)  Maintenance. The owner shall operate and maintain the private wastewater disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times. 
(6)  Health requirements. No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the health officer. 
(7)  Future connection. At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private wastewater disposal system, the property owner shall be required to comply with the connection requirements contained in section 50-4(d)(3). At such time as the connection is made, the private wastewater disposal system shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with sand, gravel or similar material or the system shall be completely removed. 
(Code 1997, § 13.05)  
Sec. 50-6. - Septic waste and sewerage sludge disposal. 
(a)  Septic waste disposal. 
(1)  Definition. As used in this subsection (a), the term "septic waste" means the accumulated residual solids generated by private septic systems, portable toilets, out-door toilets or holding tanks of any type, including sanitary systems incorporated in recreational boats or vehicles. 
(2)  Restrictions. No person shall apply or allow septic waste to be applied to any lands under their ownership, lease or control in the city. 
(3)  Disposal facility. Septic waste may be disposed of at the Del-Hart wastewater treatment plant subject to requirements established by that facility. All costs incurred from such disposal shall be borne by the person disposing of such waste. 
(b)  Sewerage sludge disposal. 
(1)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subsection (b), shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Site orproperty site means the property on which the applicant intends to apply sludge. Each real estate tax parcel as found on the tax rolls of the city shall constitute a separate "site" or "property site." 
Sludge means the accumulated residual solids (usually in aqueous solution) generated through the treatment of municipal or industrial wastewaters. 
(2)  Permit required. No person shall apply or allow sludge to be applied to any lands under their ownership, lease or control in the city without having first obtained a permit from the city council. This shall apply to both existing and proposed sludge disposal operations. 
(3)  Application. Written application for a permit to apply sludge on any lands located within the city shall be made to the city clerk. The application shall state: 
a.  The applicant shall be the owner of the wastewater treatment facility generating the sludge. 
b.  The name and address of the applicants, and if the applicant is a corporation, the name and address of the registered agent of the corporation. 
c.  The post office and legal description of the site to be used. 
d.  The name of the firm, corporation and/or person(s) that has ownership, lease or control of the site to be used. (A copy of any contract in force between the applicant and the firm, corporation or person that has such ownership, lease or control of the site shall be appended to the application.)

(Code 1997, § 13.06)  
Sec. 50-7. - Wellhead Protection Ordinance (WHPO). 
(a)  Purpose and authority. The residents of the city depend exclusively on groundwater for a safe drinking water supply. Certain land use practices and activities can seriously threaten or degrade groundwater quality. The purpose of this Wellhead Protection Ordinance is to institute land use regulations and restrictions to protect the city's municipal water supply and well fields, and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city. Statutory authority of the city to enact these regulations was established by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1983, Wisconsin Act 410 (effective May 11, 1984), which specifically added groundwater protection to the statutory authorization for municipal planning and zoning to protect public health, safety and welfare. 
(b)  Application of regulations. 
(1)  The regulations specified in this Wellhead Protection Ordinance shall apply to all lands that lie within the five-year time of travel (TOT) of each city municipal well or 1,200 feet minimum and are within the city corporate limits. 
(2)  No new use or change in use of any structure, land or water shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered and no development shall commence without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. 
(c)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Agricultural activities means and includes pesticide and/or fertilizer storage and use, septage and/or sludge spreading, animal waste land spreading, animal waste facilities and animal confinement facilities. 
Aquifer means a saturated, permeable geologic formation that contains and will yield significant quantities of water. 
Cone of depression means the area where the water level is lowered by pumping. For City Well No. 1 the cone of depression has been estimated mathematically to be 17,396 feet in radius, assuming 30 days continuous pumping at 500 gallons per minute with no recharging; or 5,501 feet in radius assuming three days continuous pumping at 500 gallons per minute with no recharging. This area is protected by the Maquoketa shale and will require no additional restrictions. For City Well No. 2 the cone of depression or as referenced in the report, the zone of influence has been estimated mathematically to be 234,000 feet in radius, assuming 30 days continuous pumping at 500 gallons per minute with no recharging. 
Five-year time of travel (TOT) means the recharge area upgradient of the cone of depression, the outer boundary of which it is determined or estimated that groundwater and potential contaminants will take five years to reach a pumping well(s). The five-year TOT for the City Well No. 1 is estimated as a distance of 477 feet upgradient of the well. This area is also protected by the Maquoketa shale. The minimum required wellhead protection radius of 1,200 feet will be used as the five-year total area for Well No. 1. The five-year TOT for the City Well No. 2 extends approximately 900 feet downgradient (south-southeast) and approximately 1,950 feet upgradient (north-northwest). A combination of the 1,950 feet and the minimum required wellhead protection radius of 1200 feet will be used as the five-year total area for Well No. 2. 
Groundwater divide means a ridge in the water table, or potentiometric surface, from which groundwater moves away at right angles in both directions; line of highest hydraulic head in the water table or potentiometric surface. 
Groundwater protection district means and includes the following areas: 
(1)  Minimum separation distances specified in NR 811.12(4)(d). 
(2)  Recharge area for five-year total upgradient. 
Natural vegetation means and includes native trees, shrubs and prairie species and nonnative plants, excluding lawns. 
Net lot area is determined by subtracting the area of the building footprint, driveways and other impervious surfaces from the total lot area. 
Nonconforming use means an existing lawful use of land, structure, building or accessory use which is not in conformity with the provisions of this section. 
Recharge area mean an area in which water reaches the zone of saturation by surface infiltration and encompasses all areas or features that supply groundwater recharge to a well. 
Well field means a piece of land used primarily for the purpose of locating wells to supply a municipal water system. 
(d)  Groundwater protection district (hereafter district). The district consists of two separate areas:

No division of a water supply service shall be made at the curb or lot line for separate supplies therefrom for two or more separate premises having frontage on any street or public service strip whether owned by the same or different parties. The water service shall be of undiminished size from the lot line into the building. 
(5)  Approval may be withheld. The city council is hereby empowered to withhold approval of any application wherein full information of the purpose of such supply is not clearly indicated and set forth by the applicant property owner. 
(b)  Service contract. 
(1)  The minimum service contract period shall be one year unless otherwise specified by special contract or in the applicable rate schedule. Where a customer at his/her request, has been disconnected prior to expiration of the customer's minimum contract period and the customer's account is not delinquent and where thereafter the customer requests the reconnection of service, a reconnection charge of $100.00, payable in advance, shall be collected. The minimum contract period is renewed with each reconnection. 
(2)  A reconnection charge of $100.00 shall also be required from consumers whose services are disconnected because of nonpayment of bills when due, including disconnection for failure to comply with deposit or guarantee rules. 
(3)  A person shall be considered as the same consumer provided the reconnection is required for the same premises by any member of the same family, or if a place of business, by any partner or employee of the same business. 
(c)  Turning on water. No water shall be turned on for a consumer except by a duly authorized employee of the water utility. When a plumber has completed his work he shall leave the water turned off. Said plumber will be permitted to test his work, however, but when said testing is completed the plumber shall leave the water service shut off. 
(d)  Stop boxes. The consumer shall protect the stop box on his property and shall keep the same free from dirt and other obstructions. The water utility shall not be liable for failure to locate the stop box and shut off water in case of a leak on the consumer's premises. The consumer shall allow access to the stop box by, and not interfere with, water utility personnel at all times. 
(e)  Thawing frozen services. 
(1)  Frozen services shall be thawed out by and at the expense of the water utility unless freezing was caused by contributory fault or negligence by the consumer such as reduction of grade, improperly installed consumer service pipe, etc. 
(2)  Following the freezing of a service the water utility shall take such steps and issue such instructions as may be necessary to allow the water to flow to prevent refreezing. No charge will be made for rethawing if instructions are followed. In case it is necessary to allow the water to flow to prevent refreezing, the consumer must make provision for proper disposal of the wastewater. The charge for water will be adjusted to allow a credit for water permitted to run as a result of water utility instructions. Credit will not be allowed if ordered to run due to negligence or fault as stated in subsection (e)(1) of this section. 
(f)  Installation of meters. Meters will be furnished and placed by the water utility and are not to be disconnected or tampered with by the consumer. All meters shall be so located that they shall be protected from obstructions and permit ready access thereto for reading, inspection and servicing, such location to be designated and approved by the city administrator or his designee. In industrial, commercial or any other building where the meter setting is not adjacent to an outside wall, it shall be the owner's responsibility to provide a conduit (minimum one-half inch) from the meter to the outside wall for the purpose of installing the low voltage wire from the water meter to the outside reader. Location and routing of conduit will be at the discretion of the city administrator or his designee. All piping within the building must be supplied by the consumer. Where additional meters are desired by the consumer, the consumer shall pay for all piping and an additional amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance and depreciation, but not less than $0.25 per month. The meters furnished and installed by the water utility shall at all times remain the property of the water utility. 
(g)  Service piping for meter settings. 
(1)  In cases where a new customer whose service is to be metered installs the original service piping or where an existing metered customer changes his service piping for his own convenience, or where an existing flat rate customer requests to be metered, the customer shall, at the customers expense, provide a suitable location and the proper connections for the meter. 
(2)  The city administrator or his designee should be consulted as to the type and size of meter setting. Where it is possible to set meters in the basement, or other suitable place within the building, a short nipple shall be inserted after the stop and waste cock, then a union, and then another nipple and coupling of the proper length. The nipple attached to the union and coupling shall be cut to a standard length provided by the plans of the city administrator or his designee, who may require a horizontal run of 18 inches in such pipe line, which may later be removed for the insertion of the meter into the supply line. 
(h)  Repairs to meters. 
(1)  Meters will be repaired by the water utility and the cost of such repairs caused by ordinary wear and tear will be borne by the water utility. 
(2)  Repair of any damage caused by the carelessness of the owner of the premises, the owner's agents or tenants, or from the negligence of any of the same to properly secure and protect same, including any damage that may result from allowing a water meter to become frozen or to be injured from the presence of hot water or steam in the meter, shall be paid for by the consumer or the owner of the premises should the consumer fail to pay. 
(i)  Charges for water wasted due to leaks. When the meter registers losses due to pipe leaks, the water utility shall determine whether or not the defect in the piping or equipment was known to the customer or, being known, had the customer used his/her best efforts to correct the conditions. If the water utility determines that the loss occurred without the consumer's knowledge, or having known about it the consumer had tried to correct the condition, the water utility may determine as nearly as possible what is the amount of loss by comparison with the use of the water during a like period, and the excess may be billed at the lowest step in the rates. However, if consumer knew of the leak and failed to give proper attention to it, the water utility will bill for the total consumption shown by the meter at regular rates. 
(j)  Failure to read meters. 
(1)  Where the water utility is unable to read a meter after two successive attempts, that fact shall be indicated on the bill, the minimum charge applied and the difference adjusted when the meter is read again, that is, the bill for the succeeding quarter will be computed with the gallons in each block of the rate schedule doubled and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the minimum bill paid the preceding month. 
(2)  Only in unusual cases or when approval is obtained from the consumer shall more than two consecutive estimated bills be rendered where the billing period is two months or more. 
(3)  If the meter fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the corresponding quarter of the past year unless there is some reason why the use was not normal. If the average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be estimated by some equitable method. 
(k)  Temporary supply. 
(1)  An applicant for temporary water supply on a metered basis shall make and maintain a monetary deposit of not less than $25.00 for each meter installed. The charge for setting the valve and furnishing and setting the meter will be $15.00 so that $10.00 of the $25.00 deposit will be available to pay for the water used at the scheduled rates. 
(2)  When no other supply is available, permission may be granted by the water utility to use a hydrant after such hydrant is equipped with a meter. A charge of $15.00 will be made for setting the meter or moving it. A deposit of $15.00 (each piece) shall be required for the hydrant meter and related fittings. In no case shall a meter be placed, removed or moved except by an employee of the water utility unless permission has been granted by the water utility. Hydrant fittings and wrench will be supplied by the water utility upon payment of deposit. The balance of deposited funds will be refunded to the depositor on the termination of the use of the water, the payment of all charges levied against the depositor and the undamaged return of hydrant wrench and fittings. 
(l)  Repairs to mains. The water utility reserves the right to shut off the water in the mains temporarily to make repairs, alterations or additions to the plant or system. When the circumstances will permit sufficient delay, the water utility will give notification by newspaper publication or otherwise, of the discontinuance of the supply. No rebate or damages will be allowed to consumers for such temporary suspension of supply. 
(m)  Handling water mains and service pipes in trenches. 
(1)  Where excavating machines are used in digging, all water mains shall be maintained at the expense of the contractor. 
(2)  Contractors must ascertain for themselves the existence and location of all service pipes. Where they are removed, cut or damaged in the construction, the contractor shall, at his own expense, cause them to be replaced or repaired at once. Said repair shall not cause water service to any consumer to be shut off for a period exceeding six hours. 
(n)  Settling of main or service trenches. Trenches in streets shall be refilled with approved backfill in accordance with State of Wisconsin highway specifications, or City of Delafield specifications where more restrictive. The contractor shall be responsible for the repair of all settled trenches for one year from the date of final payment of the project. 
(o)  Relief valves. On all "closed systems" (i.e., systems having a check valve, pressure regulator, or reducing valve, water filter or softener) an effective pressure relief valve shall be installed either in the top tapping or the upper side tapping of the hot water tank, or on the hot water distributing pipe connection at the tank. A one-half-inch drain pipe shall be connected to the relief valve for discharge on the floor or into a sink or open drain through an air gap. No stop valve shall be placed between the hot water tank and the relief valve or on the drain pipe. 
(p)  No claims for damages. No person shall enter a claim for damage against the City of Delafield or water utility as a utility, or any officer thereof, for damage to any pipe, fixture or appurtenances by reason of interrupted service, variation of pressure, or for damage of any nature whatsoever caused by the turning off or turning on, whether wholly or partially, of the water supply for the extension, alteration or repair of any water main or premises supply, or for the discontinuance of the premises water supply for the violation of any rule or regulation of the water utility. No claims will be allowed against the water utility on account of the interruption of the water supply caused by the breaking of pipes or machinery, or by stoppage for repairs, on account of fire or other emergency, and no claims shall be allowed for any damage caused by the breakage of any pipe or machinery. 
(q)  Purity of supply not to be impaired by cross connections. Every person owning or occupying a premises receiving water utility water supply shall maintain such water supply free from any connection, either of a direct or indirect nature, with a water supply from a foreign source, or of any manner of connection with any fixture or appliance, whereby water from a foreign supply or the waste from any fixture, appliance, waste or soil pipe may flow, be siphoned or pumped into the piping of the water utility system. Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 811.09, Cross Connections and Interconnection, and Wis. Admin. Code ch. Comm 82.41, Cross Connection Control, shall apply to all applicable situations. 
(r)  Operation of valves and hydrants. Any person who shall without authority of the water utility operate any valve connected with the street or supply mains, or open any fire hydrant connected with the distribution system, except for the purpose of extinguishing fire, or who shall damage or impair the same shall be subject to a forfeiture as hereinafter provided. Permits for the use of hydrants for filling sprinkling carts or water trucks apply only to such hydrants as are designated for such use. 
(s)  Inspection of premises. Any officer or authorized employee of the water utility shall have the right of access during reasonable hours to any premises supplied with service, for the purpose of inspection or enforcement of the water utility's rules and regulations. The water utility will make a systematic inspection of all metered and unmetered water service at least once every three years for the purpose of checking waste and unnecessary use of water. 
(t)  Vacation of premises. Before premises are to be vacated, the water utility shall be notified in writing, so that it may remove the meter and shut off the water at the curb valve. The owner of the premises shall be liable for any damage to water utility property by reason of failure to notify the water utility of vacancy. 
(u)  Tap permits. After water connections have been introduced into any building or upon any premises, no plumber shall tap into or connect with the pipes upon such premises, for alterations, extensions or attachments, unless the party ordering such tapping or other work shall exhibit the proper permits for the same from the water utility. No person, corporation or entity shall perform any work on the premises water system unless said person, corporation or entity is a licensed plumber except that the owner of a residential dwelling may perform his/her own plumbing provided that said owner complies with the plumbing code of the State of Wisconsin, local municipal codes and obtains all required permits. 
(v)  Consumers to conserve water. All consumers shall keep the hydrants, taps, hose, water closets, urinals, baths or other fixtures allotted to their use closed, except when obtaining water for use, and shall be responsible for any damage or injury that may result to others from the improper use of said water. 
(w)  Surreptitious use of water. When the water utility has reasonable evidence that a consumer is obtaining the consumer's supply of water, in whole or in part, by means of devices or methods used to stop or interfere with the proper metering of the utility service being delivered to the consumer's equipment, the water utility reserves the right to estimate and present immediately a bill for service unmetered as a result of such interference. Such bill shall be payable subject to a 24-hour disconnection of service. When the water utility shall have disconnected the consumer for any such reason, the water utility will reconnect the consumer upon the following conditions: 
(1)  The consumer will be required to deposit with the water utility an amount sufficient to guarantee the payment of the consumer's bills for water service to the water utility. 
(2)  The consumer will be required to pay the water utility for any and all damages to its equipment on the consumer's premises due to such stoppage or interference with its metering. 
(3)  The consumer shall agree to comply with reasonable requirements to protect the water utility against further losses. 
Wis. Stats. §§ 98.26 and 943.20, as relating to water service, are hereby adopted and made a part of these rules. 
(x)  Consumer to keep in repair. All consumers shall keep their own service pipes, stopcock and apparatus in good repair and protected from frost, at their own risk and expense and shall prevent any unnecessary waste of water and overburdening of the system. All expenses relating to the introduction of water into buildings or private premises, and connections with the system, shall be paid by the applicant. No charge, however, shall be made for the services of the water utility employee in directing where and in what manner the mains shall be tapped and excavations made in the street for laying pipe. The city reserves the right to inspect such connections and charge the costs of such inspections to the applicant. 
(y)  Consumer's use only. No consumer shall supply water to others for resale nor charge others to take it off the consumer's premises nor shall the consumer allow others or other services to connect to the system. 
(z)  Consumer to permit inspection. Every consumer shall permit the city, or its duly authorized agent, at all reasonable hours of the day, to enter their premises or building to examine the pipes and fixtures, and the manner in which the water is used and drains operate. Such consumers will at all times, frankly and without concealment, answer all questions put to them relative to water consumption. 
(aa)  Excavations. 
(1)  In making excavations in streets or highways for laying service pipes or making repairs, the planks, paving and earth removed must be deposited in a manner that will cause the least inconvenience to the public, and provide for the passage of water along gutters or ditches. 
(2)  No person shall leave any such excavation made in any street or highway open at any time without barricades; and during the night, warning lights must be maintained at such excavations. 
(3)  In backfilling the opening after the service pipes are laid, the earth must be laid in layers of not more than 12 inches in depth, and each layer thoroughly rammed or puddled to prevent settling. Backfill shall be as specified by the water utility or its agent and may, include but is not limited to, spoil material, crushed road gravel or slurry material. This work, together with replacing sidewalks, ballast and paving, shall be done in accordance with water utility specifications and to a condition equal to or better than that which existed prior to excavation. No excavations shall be made without first obtaining a permit from the superintendent or his designated representative. All trenches and excavations in sidewalks or pavements shall be sawcut to provide a neat edge. 
(bb)  Tapping mains. 
(1)  No person, except those having special permission from the city council, or persons in its service and approved by it, will be permitted, under any circumstances, to tap into mains or distribution pipes, or to insert stopcock, corporation stops, valves or service piping therein. The type and size of the connection with the mains shall be those specified by the superintendent or his designated representative and as may be specified in permits to permit such work. 
(2)  Mains shall be tapped on the side and not within 24 inches of any pipe joint or 12 inches from another tap. Taps less than three feet apart shall be staggered from each other with a minimum angle of 30 degrees. 
(cc)  Emergency restrictions. 
(1)  In the event there exists an emergency or water shortage and in the judgment of the mayor, president of council, or city administrator, it is necessary to declare an emergency, said mayor or authorized person as listed above, will have the power to declare said emergency and direct the superintendent or his designated agents to restrict the usage of water for any use other than personal bathing, food preparation and other domestic use as necessary. The restrictions may apply to lawn sprinkling, car washing, swimming pool filling, construction use or other uses deemed appropriate by the mayor. 
(2)  Notice of the restriction shall be published as soon as possible in the official newspaper of the city. Failure of the consumer to read such notice shall not allow for the consumer to circumvent the restrictions. The notice shall describe the general area and type of prohibited usage. Any person violating this section shall be subject to those penalties contained in section 50-50. 
(dd)  Obstruction of hydrants. No person shall obstruct a hydrant such that it becomes inaccessible for normal maintenance or emergency use. Obstructions that are not allowed include, but are not limited to, fencing, retaining walls, landscaping, bushes, trees and ditches. A clear space of five-inch radius from the center of the hydrant shall be maintained at all times. The water utility shall have the right to remove or cause the removal of any obstructions to maintain the operation of the system.

(Code 1997, § 13.26)  
Sec. 50-42. - Water capacity assessments. 
(a)  There is hereby levied against each parcel of land serviceable by said water system (vacant, unimproved parcels and established lots all included), a reserve capacity assessment which is an area assessment in the area being served by the reserve capacity of the system. Said water capacity assessment is hereby established at $500.00 per domestic user equivalent. 
(b)  Water capacity assessments (WCA) are assessments payable at the time of connection to the system to reflect the costs of oversizing wells, reservoirs, pump stations and tanks of the water utility. All properties connecting to the initial system and future extensions of the initial system shall pay a WCA whether or not they have paid other assessments. The WCA is based upon a domestic user equivalent connection with a five-eighths-inch water meter considered as one WCA. Connections to the municipal system with meters larger than five-eighths inch will be assigned WCAs according to the following schedule which is based upon the safe maximum operating capacity for various size water meters as determined in AWWA Standards C700C710: 
Meter Size 
(inches) 	Meter 
Type 	Safe Maximum
Operating Capacity
(GPM) 	DUEs 
Assigned 
? 	Displacement-Plastic or Bronze 	20 	1.0 
? x ¾ 	Displacement-Plastic or Bronze 	20 	1.0 
¾ 	Displacement-Plastic or Bronze 	30 	1.5 
1 	Displacement-Plastic or Bronze 	50 	2.5 
1½ 	Displacement-Plastic or Bronze 	100 	5.0 
2 	Displacement-Plastic or Bronze 	160 	8.0 
2 	Turbine Class II 	160 	8.0 
3 	Turbine Class II 	350 	17.5 
4 	Turbine Class II 	630 	31.5

10 	Turbine Class II 	3800 	190.0 
12 	Turbine Class II 	5000 	250.0 
 
(c)  Meters other than listed may be approved by the utility on a case-by-case basis. WCA charges will be based upon the AWWA safe maximum operating capacity for the meter adjusted for equivalent DUEs based upon one DUE equaling a 20 GPM safe maximum operating capacity. 
(d)  WCA assessments may be increased annually as determined by the city council to pay for the costs of additional waterworks facilities that are constructed or placed in service. 
(e)  Water capacity assessments may, in hardship cases, be payable in installments of equal principal plus interest as determined by the city council. 
(f)  There is capacity in the initial system to service an area considerably beyond the properties fronting the proposed mains. The city council directs that additional oversizing costs in future extensions may also be paid from WCAs. 
(Code 1997, § 13.27)  
Sec. 50-43. - Maintenance of services. 
(a)  All building water services from the point of connection of curb stop to the house or to the premises served must be maintained free of defective conditions, by and at the expense of the owner or occupant of the property served. 
(b)  The service pipe from the main, to and through the curb stop, will be maintained and kept in repair and when worn out, replaced at the expense of the utility. The property owner shall maintain the service pipe from the curb stop to the point of use. All adjustments to stop boxes due to landscaping or other changes in grade level, except those performed by public contract, will be the responsibility of the property owner. 
(c)  If the property owner does not repair an existing leak between the curb stop and the building within 24 hours, the water will be shut off and remain off until the repair is made. 
(Code 1997, § 13.28)  
Sec. 50-44. - Severance of private wells. 
(a)  Severance from municipal system. Upon connection to the water utility's municipal water system, the owner of any private well shall sever completely from the municipal system the operation of his private water supply. Once the private water supply has been severed from the municipal water system, there shall be no reconnection of said private supply to the municipal system. 
(b)  Method of severance. Severance of a private well consists of disconnection and removal of the well lateral at the well casing, and thereafter any use of the private well shall be by separate water piping. 
(c)  Private wells to be tested and those testing unsafe abandoned and sealed. 
(1)  Private wells where a municipal connection exists. Private wells, after complete separation from the municipal system, shall be allowed to be maintained by the owner, if said owner complies with the following procedure and receives a permit therefor. 
(2)  Safe well test. The city council, or its agents, will, annually, at its discretion, test all private wells on those premises served by municipal water. Owner will permit the water utility or its agents to collect a sample from said private well following correct sampling procedures. Said water sample collected by the water utility will then be provided to a certified testing laboratory for analysis. The property owner will be charged the actual cost of such analysis, plus $25.00 administrative charge, including, but not limited to, cost of collection, postage and handling. If the water sample tests bacteriologically safe, owner will receive from the water utility a permit for private well usage for ensuing year. If the owner of a private well disputes the test performed by the water utility, said owner will have the right to provide to the water utility the results of its own water test performed by a certified water testing laboratory under the terms of this section or the well will be permanently abandoned as hereinafter provided. 
(d)  Abandonment of private wells when determined by the water utility, as needed. 
(1)  In order to prevent contamination of groundwater and to protect public health, safety and welfare by assuring that unused, unsafe or noncomplying well or wells which may serve as conduits for contamination or wells which may be illegally cross connected to the municipal water system, the water utility will review such wells to determine that the wells are properly abandoned. 
(2)  All wells located on premises served by the municipal water system shall be abandoned in accordance with the terms of this section and Wis. Admin. Code chs. NR 811.10 and 812.26, by no later than one year from the date of connection to the municipal water system, unless a well operation permit has been obtained by the well owner from the water utility. 
(3)  The water utility may grant a permit to a private well owner to operate a well as outlined in this section providing the conditions of said section are met. An owner may be required to renew a well operation permit by submitting information verifying that the conditions of this section are met. The water utility, or its agent, may conduct inspections or have water quality tests conducted at the applicant's expense to obtain or verify information necessary for consideration of a permit application or renewal. Permit applications and renewals shall be made on forms provided by the city clerk. The following conditions must be met for issuance or renewal of a well operation permit: 
a.  The well and pump installation meet or are upgraded to meet the requirements of Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 812. 
b.  The well construction and pump installation have a history of producing bacteriologically safe water as evidenced by at least two samplings taken a minimum of two weeks apart. No exception to this condition may be made for unsafe wells, unless the DNR approves, in writing, the continued use of the well. 
c.  There are no cross connections between the well and pump installation and the municipal water system. 
d.  The proposed use of the well and pump installation can be justified as being necessary in addition to water provided by the municipal water system. 
e.  All wells abandoned under the jurisdiction of this section or rule shall be abandoned according to the procedures and methods of Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 812.26. All debris, pump, piping, unsealed liners and any other obstructions which may interfere with sealing operations shall be removed prior to abandonment. 
f.  The owner of the well, or the owner's agent, shall notify the city clerk at least 48 hours prior to commencement of any well abandonment activities. The abandonment of the well shall be observed by the city administrator or his designee. 
g.  An abandonment report form, supplied by the DNR, shall be submitted by the well owner to the city clerk and the DNR within ten days of the completion of the well abandonment. 
(4)  Any well owner violating any provision of this section shall upon conviction be punished by forfeiture of not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00 and the cost of prosecution. Each day of violation is a separate offense. If any person fails to comply with this section for more than ten days after receiving written notice of the violation, the municipality may impose a penalty and cause the well abandonment to be performed and the expense to be assessed as a special tax against the property. 
(Code 1997, § 13.29)  
Sec. 50-45. - Continuation of private wells permitted. 
(a)  Use of private wells upon connection to municipal water service. 
(1)  Intent. Since it is recognized that the entire private water supply in the water utility has the potential for pollution, the building's distribution system upon connection to the municipal water system shall be completely severed from the private well. If such private well does not test "safe" according to standards of the state DNR and Waukesha County health department, such well shall be permanently sealed and abandoned in accordance with Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 112.21. 
(2)  Test results to be filed. The owners of those wells testing "safe" and being utilized for outside chores not involving human consumption of water shall on or before June 1, commencing the first year following the year of severance, file with the water utility test results performed by the Waukesha County health department, or recognized private testing laboratory, showing that the water from such well is bacteriologically safe. Testing such well shall be performed by a person working for the testing laboratory from a sample obtained from the well and that person shall certify the test results. 
(3)  Test required. Such well tests shall be required every five years before the renewal well permit is issued. 
(4)  Severance from private well supply. 
a.  Once the private water supply has been severed from the municipal system, there shall be no reconnection of said private supply to the municipal system. After severance of the private well, no cross connection between the public and private system will be allowed. Those owners that desire to keep the private well in service shall install a backflow preventer approved by the water utility. The backflow preventer shall be installed in the outlet piping from the water meter and no outlets shall be permitted between the water meter and the backflow preventer. All municipal water entering the building must pass through the reduced pressure backflow preventer before being distributed for other use. 
b.  Backflow preventers shall be installed and maintained in compliance with Wis. Admin. Code § ILHR 82.41. 
(5)  Permanent abandonment procedure. 
a.  Owners intending to permanently abandon a well will notify the water utility of the date of the intended abandonment. The water utility will be permitted to fully inspect the entire process of abandonment. Owner will comply with Wis. Admin. Code § NR 112.21(1) and (3). In the event the owner of a private well that has tested unsafe or has failed to obtain a well permit refuses or neglects to permanently abandon said well on or before September 1 of each year, the water utility, or its agents or contractors may, without notice, enter upon owner's property and permanently seal said well in accordance with Wis. Admin. Code § NR 112.21(1) and (3) and the cost thereof shall be presented to the city treasurer who shall place said amount on the tax roll as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.60(16). 
b.  Any person who shall attempt to abandon said well without having first notified the water utility shall be subject to the requirements of furnishing the water utility proof of proper compliance with Wis. Adm. Code § NR 112.21(1) and (3). In the event owner is unable to furnish satisfactory proof to the water utility that said well was properly abandoned under said Administrative Code provision, the water utility shall have the right to enter upon the property and perform all necessary tasks to verify that the abandonment of said well was done under the Administrative Code procedure and specifications. Any and all costs incurred by the water utility in permanently sealing said well shall be presented to the city treasurer who shall place said amount on the tax roll as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.60(16). 
(6)  Wells testing unsafe or wells not having a permit. All private wells in the water utility that test unsafe or have not received a permit as provided for herein shall be immediately removed from use and shall on or before September 1 of each year be permanently sealed and abandoned as provided below. 
(7)  Temporary sealing not permitted. Because of the clear and present danger from the water supply serving private wells in the water district, private wells, whether within or without the municipal water service area, will not be permitted to be temporarily sealed. 
(8)  Permit procedure for new wells. New wells will be permitted to be constructed only under the following conditions: 
a.  Said new well must be located in an area where municipal water service is not available and cannot readily be made available by the water utility. 
b.  Owner or applicant applies to Waukesha County health department and the city and receives a permit for the construction of the new well. 
c.  The new well is constructed in complete conformity with state and local regulations and codes. The owner of the new well, before it will be permitted to be put into use, will furnish to the water utility test results verified by a certified testing laboratory that said well water is bacteriologically safe. 
d.  All new wells constructed within the water utility limits will be permitted on the condition that the owner agrees that once municipal water is available to the property, said private well owner will immediately connect to municipal water and sever the private well. 
e.  Whenever municipal water service is available or can readily be made available by the water utility, no new wells for potable or nonpotable water will be permitted to be constructed and the owner of the property will be required to connect to the municipal service. 
(Code 1997, § 13.30)  
Sec. 50-46. - Connection of malfunctioning wells. 
In the event that the water utility undertakes a project and the project adversely affects the local well water supply of local residents, or if the water utility anticipates that a project may adversely affect the local well water supply, then the water utility at its option may undertake the following steps: 
(1)  The water utility shall request that the residents or property owners allow the water utility to test and inspect individual wells. Such testing and inspection may include but is not limited to: 
a.  Testing for potability of water supply. 
b.  Removal of pump for water level inspection. 
c.  General inspection of well pump facilities. 
(2)  If during the inspection of the well, either the well or appurtenant facilities are damaged through no fault of the property owner, the water utility may have the damages repaired at no cost to the owner, or, if public water is available the owner may connect to the public water supply and the water utility will credit the owner for the cost of the damages against any outstanding assessments or water connection fees. The water utility reserves the right to prorate the cost of repairs if it is determined that the age or existing condition of the owner's facilities were at or near the point of failure at the time of damage. Determination will be made by the water utility or its authorized representatives. 
(3)  If the owner cooperates with the water utility and allows inspection of the owner's well, and if the well is determined to be operating within normal standards as defined in Wis. Admin. Code § 112, and it is determined that the water utility's operations have adversely affected the owner's well, then the following shall apply: 
a.  The water utility reserves the right to determine if the well will return to its normal functioning capacity. This includes waiting for 14 days after termination of water utility activities to determine if the adverse effect on the private well was minor in nature. The water utility shall provide interim relief. 
b.  If the well is determined to be permanently damaged then the property owner shall connect to the public water supply. The water utility shall waive the water capacity assessment fee and shall pay all costs related to the connection of the residence to the public water supply. The resident will still be responsible for the payment of all frontage and right-of-way lateral costs and pay those costs in accordance with the final resolution for the respective water main project. The water utility shall be allowed to approve or deny the plumbing contractor that will be making the residential connection. The water utility will only pay for those costs associated with the connection of the public water supply to the point of the meter horn and the abandonment of the owner's well, or at the water utility's option, improve or upgrade the existing private well. 
(4)  Documentation necessary in lieu of testing. 
a.  If the owner fails to cooperate with the water utility and does not allow for testing and inspection of the owner's well, the owner shall provide documentation that the water utility's activities caused the owner's well to malfunction.

(2)  The provisions of this section shall apply to all outdoor luminaries used, installed, replaced, altered, moved or repaired in all zoning districts after the effective date of this section, except as this applicability is specifically expanded or reduced herein. 
(3)  The goal of this section is to have all outdoor luminaries in all zoning districts to be located, sized and/or downward directed unless upward illumination is allowed by this section so that the light emitted from the luminaries does not constitute light trespass as defined herein. Downward directed shall mean that the luminaire is shielded in such a manner that light rays emitted by the luminaire, whether directly from the lamp or indirectly from the fixture, are restricted to regions below an angle 15 degrees beneath the horizontal plane running through the lowest point on the fixture where light is emitted. Light rays shall be shielded so as not to be visible from beyond the boundaries of the property. 
(b)  Effect on other codes. The provisions of this section are intended to supplement other applicable codes and requirements. Compliance with all applicable provisions of building, zoning, electrical and other codes must be observed. In the event of a conflict between the requirements of this Code and other requirements, the more stringent requirement shall apply. 
(c)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Footcandle means a standard unit of illumination. 
Light shield means any attachment which interrupts and blocks the path of light emitted from a luminaire or fixture. 
Light trespass means light emitted by a luminaire that shines beyond the boundaries of the property on which the luminaire is located with an intensity greater than one half foot candle at a point four feet above the ground at the property's boundary line and/or at a point four feet above the surface of the water and 150 feet from that property's shoreline when measured on the water. 
Luminaire means the complete lighting system, including lamp and the fixture. 
Private driveway means any way: 
(1)  Serving not more than three lots; 
(2)  Used primarily for ingress and egress to and from said lots by motor vehicles; and 
(3)  For which ingress and egress right is established by private easement and/or private ownership. 
Private road means any street, highway, road or other way that is privately owned, that is used primarily for ingress and egress to and from lots by motor vehicles, and that is not a private driveway as defined herein. 
Public street means any street, highway, road or other way owned by or dedicated to the City of Delafield or governmental entity and used primarily for public travel in motor vehicles. 
Residentially-zoned neighborhood means any area in the City of Delafield zoned R-1, R-1A, R-L1, R-L2, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, or R-7. 
(d)  Requirements. 
(1)  Light trespass. All outdoor luminaires shall be located, sized, shielded and/or directed in such a manner that they do not constitute light trespass as defined herein. 
(2)  Safety. No outdoor luminaire may be operated in such manner as to constitute a hazard or danger to persons, or to safe vehicular or boating operation. 
(3)  Illuminating elevated objects. In the case of state and national flags, statues, entrance way markers, or other top-of-pole mounted objects which cannot be illuminated with downward directed lighting, upward directed lighting may be used only in the form of one or two narrow-cone spotlights which confines the illumination to the object of interest, and provided that the lighting is restricted to an angle of not less than 75 degrees up from horizontal. 
(4)  Pole fixtures. Outdoor light pole fixtures shall not exceed a maximum height of 30 feet. 
(e)  Special exemptions. The following are exempt from the requirements of this section, to the extent described as follows: 
(1)  Temporary exemption. Request for temporary exemption from the provisions of this section may be submitted to the city administrator in written form describing the reason for the request and the nature of the request. If approved and granted in writing by the city administrator, such exemption shall be in force for not more than 30 days. Request for a maximum of a 30-day renewal may be made in a similar manner. The city administrator may terminate any temporary exemption for any reasonable cause, including, but not limited to, concerns about safety or light trespass. 
(2)  Low voltage. All low-voltage landscape or accent lighting and holiday lighting are exempt from the requirements of this section, except for the requirements of subsections (d)(1) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  Security. Motion detector security lights, which are normally off and which are activated on for less than four minutes occasionally when motion is detected, are exempt from the requirements of this section.

Sec. 52-62. - Criteria for site plan and appearance review. 
The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those items that affect the physical aspect of the city's environment that the plan commission will use in reviewing site plan and appearance permit applications. These criteria are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation, or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles that can result in creative solutions that will develop satisfactory visual appearance within the city, preserve taxable values, and promote the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(1)  Landscape and site treatment. 
a.  Where natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to beauty and do not detract from the utility of a development, they shall be preserved and developed. 
b.  Landscape treatment shall be provided to enhance architectural features, improve appearance, screen parking areas and miscellaneous structures, provide wildlife habitat, provide shade, and enhance the streetscape. 
c.  Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of certain plant varieties and other materials and by coordination with landscaping on adjacent developments. 
d.  Plant materials shall be selected on the basis of size at maturity, hardiness, tolerance for site-specific environmental conditions, screening value, wildlife habitat values, and all season appearance. 
e.  Use of plants that are indigenous to the area shall be encouraged. 
f.  Nonnative plants that are considered a nuisance or "invader" species, such as purple loosestrife, honeysuckle, and buckthorn shall not be used as plant materials. 
g.  Plant specimens shall be of sufficient size and quality to provide screening and landscape benefits within three growing seasons from the time of planting. Trees planted in traffic islands and in other areas where they could be subject to disturbance or other factors that could affect growth, should be at least two inches in diameter and eight feet high at the time of planting. Evergreens should be a minimum of six feet high at the time of planting. Shrubs should be balled and burlapped and a minimum of 18 inches high at the time of planting. 
h.  Irregular clusters of vegetation are generally preferable to isolated specimens or regularly spaced rows of plantings. 
i.  In locations where they will be susceptible to injury by pedestrian or motor traffic, plants shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree guards, or other devices. 
j.  Planting in parking lot islands is required to break up large expanses of parking stalls. Parking lots of over 24 vehicles shall have a minimum of one tree island not less than 180 square feet for each 24 parking stalls or an equivalent number of perimeter plantings or tree rows that are designed as part of an overall landscape plan acceptable to the plan commission. 
k.  Large parking areas shall be treated with decorative screens consisting of building wall extensions, plantings, berms, or other innovative means so as to screen parking areas. 
l.  Screening of service yards and other places that tend to be unsightly shall be accomplished by use of walls, fencing, planting, or combinations of these. Screening shall be equally effective in winter and summer. Screens shall be compatible and harmonious with the landscaping and site treatments on neighboring properties. 
m.  In areas where general planting will not prosper, other materials such as fences, walls, and paving of wood, brick, stone, gravel, and cobbles shall be used. Carefully selected plants shall be combined with such materials where possible. 
n.  Prohibition of disturbing steep slopes. Steeply sloped terrain with a natural grade of 25 percent or more may not be regraded, built upon or otherwise disturbed. The plan commission may grant an exception to this requirement where the area proposed for disturbance is an isolated area and providing such disturbance is necessary for the development to occur and does not alter the overall topographic character of the site. The total area granted such an exception may not exceed 20,000 square feet for the entire site. 
o.  Compliance with chapter 16, article III. All site plans must comply with the requirements of chapter 16, article III, pertaining to construction site erosion control and stormwater management. All site plans approved by the plan commission shall be subject to compliance with chapter 16, article III. 
(2)  Building design. 
a.  Architectural style is not restricted. Evaluation of appearance of a project shall be based on quality of its design and relationship to surroundings; however, architects and builders are encouraged to consider architectural styles and traditions appropriate to the area of the city. 
b.  Buildings shall be compatible with neighboring properties with respect to size, scale, proportion, and materials. 
c.  Buildings shall not be so out of character or incompatible with respect to neighboring properties that they would adversely affect the market values of property in the city. 
d.  Materials shall be selected for suitability to the type of buildings and the design in which they are used. In developments with multiple structures, all structures shall be constructed with the same materials or those that are architecturally harmonious. 
e.  Materials shall be of durable quality. 
f.  In any design in which the structural frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be compatible with each other and harmonious to their surroundings. 
g.  Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets shall be proportionally related to one another. 
h.  Principal building colors and color accents used on trims, fascia, and signage shall be coordinated and harmonious. 
i.  Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware shall be fully screened with materials that are coordinated with the colors of the principal building. 
j.  Refuse and waste removal areas, service yards, storage yards, and exterior work areas shall be screened on all sides. Screening materials shall be coordinated with and harmonious with the overall architectural character of the principal building. 
k.  Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide for visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting of individual buildings may be used to prevent monotonous appearance. 
(3)  Signs. 
a.  Signs shall be compatible with respect to size, proportions, materials and color with nearby buildings and surroundings. 
b.  A sign shall be designed as an integral architectural element of the building and site to which it principally relates. 
c.  The colors, materials, and lighting of every sign shall be restrained and harmonious with the building and site to which it principally relates. 
d.  The number of graphic elements on a sign shall be held to the minimum needed to convey the sign's major message and shall be composed in proportion to the area of the sign face. 
e.  Each sign shall be compatible with signs on adjoining premises and shall not compete for attention. 
f.  Developers of projects, such as shopping centers or business buildings, in which individual signs for separate occupancies are permitted by ordinance, shall submit a comprehensive set or list of specifications that shall provide design review guidelines that would be administered for future signs in the project. 
g.  Identification signs of a prototype design and corporation "logos" shall conform to the criteria for all other signs. 
(4)  Miscellaneous structures, lighting, street furniture, and utility service. 
a.  Miscellaneous structures, street furniture, and lighting shall be designed to be part of the architectural character, concept, and style of the primary structure. Materials shall be compatible with respect to size, proportion, materials, and colors of the primary structure. 
b.  Lighting in connection with parking areas and miscellaneous structures shall be part of the architectural concept. Fixtures, standards, and all exposed accessories shall be harmonious with building design. 
c.  Exterior lighting shall be designed and located to minimize its illumination and glare as seen from neighboring properties and public rights-of-way. 
d.  Where feasible, utility service and associated hardware shall be installed underground. Where placement underground is not feasible, utility service and hardware shall be located and designed to be as unobtrusive as is feasible. 
e.  Exterior lighting shall be designed and directed so that existing and proposed residential areas will not be affected by the illumination. Illumination shall not exceed 0.5 footcandle measured at the lot line. 
(5)  Tree preservation. The purpose of this section is to provide standards to preserve the city's character as a natural, wooded community by maintaining property values through the improvement and preservation of the natural environment of the city through tree preservation and site plan regulation. It is the intent of the city to preserve and protect the natural resources of the city by reducing the amount of soil erosion in the city that is the result of tree removal; to protect the quality of the waters of the state and the city; to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the city through the preservation of trees and promote aesthetically attractive development. 
a.  Tree inventory required. Applicants for site plan review shall be required to provide a plan map and inventory showing existing trees on those portions of the site that will be disturbed. The inventory shall include identification of all trees over four inches in diameter, measured at a height of 4.5 feet from the ground (referred to as "diameter at breast height" or "dbh"), from the following list of tree species, (hereinafter referred to as "protected tree species.") The inventory shall include reference to any listed tree that applicants believe to be damaged, diseased or dying.

b.  Sampling method. If existing tree cover is determined by the city arborist to be too dense, too extensive, or impractical for a conventional inventory, mitigation requirements may be derived from scientific sampling. Sampling quadrates shall be measured and inventoried per the direction of the city arborist for each unique community or microclimate exhibited in the subject property. Data derived from sampling shall replicate the requirements described in subsection (5)a of this section. 
c.  Tree protection. In developing a site plan and locating buildings, driveways and parking areas, applicants for site plan reviews shall be required to preserve, to the greatest extent feasible, all protected tree species. The plan commission shall consider the tree inventory and the applicant's efforts to protect and preserve existing trees, and the feasibility of preserving all protected tree species in their review of the site plan. 
d.  Clear cutting prohibition. "Clear cutting" is herein defined as the act of complete removal of all vegetation, including, but not limited to, trees, from a lot or parcel, whether developed or undeveloped, as those terms are defined in section 52-11. The clear cutting of any lot or parcel within the municipal boundaries shall be prohibited except as provided for in this section. Clear cutting does not include the removal of exotic invasive plant species as those species are determined and defined by the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Manual of Control Recommendations for Ecologically Invasive Plants, as amended. 
e.  Tree removal limitations. Subject to the provisions of this section, removal of trees four inches dbh or greater shall be permitted as follows: 
1.  On proposed lots less than 20,000 square feet, up to 80 percent of said trees per lot may be removed, except in the C-1 and SW-1 zoning districts; 
2.  On proposed lots 20,000 square feet to 39,999 square feet, up to 60 percent of said trees per lot may be removed, except in the C-1 and SW-1 zoning districts; 
3.  On proposed lots 40,000 square feet to 87,119 square feet, up to 40 percent of said trees per lot may be removed except in the C-1 and SW-1 zoning districts; 
4.  On proposed lots 87,120 square feet or greater, up to 20 percent of said trees per lot may be removed, except in the C-1 and SW-1 zoning districts; 
5.  In the C-1 and SW-1 zoning districts, up to ten percent of said trees per proposed lot may be removed. 
Issuance of a building permit/erosion control permit shall constitute an approval of the land disturbance subject to any terms and conditions contained therein and placed on the applicant by the commission as well as the applicant's strict conformance with the regulations of this chapter. 
f.  Tree/vegetation removal. 
1.  Removal outside the approved area of disturbance. No trees or vegetation shall be removed outside the approved area of disturbance except as specifically exempted in this section. 
2.  Removal inside the approved area of disturbance. Except as exempted in this section, to the maximum extent feasible, significant trees and vegetation inside the limits of disturbance shall be maintained. Significant trees removed from within the area of disturbance shall be replaced as set forth in subsection (5)h of this section. 
3.  Removal within the shoreland areas. Within a strip paralleling any navigable body of water and extending 50 feet inland from all points along the ordinary high water mark of the shoreline, tree cutting and removal of existing vegetation shall be limited in accordance with the following provisions: 
(i)  No more than 30 percent of the length of a strip (measured along the ordinary high water mark as that term is defined in section 52-11) shall be clear-cut to the depth of the strip. 
(ii)  Cutting of this 30 percent pursuant to subsection (5)f.3(i) of this section, shall not create a clear-cut opening in the strip greater than 30 feet wide (as measured along and parallel to the ordinary high water mark as that term is defined in section 52-11). 
(iii)  Any paths, roads, or passages within the strip shall be so constructed and surfaced so as to control erosion in compliance with the terms and conditions of chapter 16, article III, pertaining to construction site erosion control and site stormwater management. 
(iv)  The plan commission may allow exceptions for the accommodation and/or provision of essential fire and police services. 
g.  Special cutting plans. As an alternative to subsection (5)f.3 of this section, a special cutting plan allowing for greater cutting than that allowed under this chapter may be permitted by the plan commission by issuance of and compliance with a conditional use permit issued under article V of this chapter. 
1.  Plan requirements. An application for a conditional use permit under this section shall include a site plan, including the following information: 
(i)  Location of all structures; 
(ii)  Location of parking and driveway; 
(iii)  Existing and proposed topography; 
(iv)  Existing tree inventory; 
(v)  Identification of proposed tree replacement. 
2.  Approval criteria. The plan commission may grant a conditional use permit only upon a finding that such special cutting plans will not cause undue erosion or destruction of the scenic beauty, and will not substantially reduce shielding from the water, structures and/or parking areas impacted or immediately adjacent to the special cutting plan area. The plan commission may condition granting such a permit upon a guarantee by the applicant of tree planting by the lot owner per an approved planting plan. 
h.  Tree replacement. Where an existing tree over four inches in diameter of a species identified as a protected tree species is to be removed, tree mitigation shall occur, and a replacement of an equivalent amount of tree caliper inches, as measured by tree diameter or size at the time of planting, shall be required. In those instances, mitigation may be satisfied, but may not be limited, by: 
1.  On-site replacement, documented in a landscape plan submitted to and approved by the city arborist or the plan commission; 
2.  Off-site replacement, to be determined by the city arborist in accordance with this subsection (5)h, when site conditions are determined by the city arborist to be inappropriate for required mitigation quantities or plans; 
3.  Fees in lieu of tree mitigation or replacement as provided by subsection (5)i of this section; or 
4.  A combination of mitigation alternatives as determined and prescribed by the city arborist and approved by the plan commission. 
Replacement trees shall be clearly identified on the landscaping and site plans and shall be of a type and species suitable for the site as determined by the city arborist or plan commission. All new replacement canopy trees shall be a minimum of 2.5-inch caliper, as measured six inches from the top of the nursery-stock root ball. Conifers, ornamental trees and shrubs over six feet in height, as measured from the top of the root ball, at the time of planting shall be credited as 2.5-inch caliper trees. 
i.  Fees in lieu of tree replacement. 
1.  Where, in the opinion of the plan commission, replacement plantings or other mitigation efforts that are required by this section, would not be feasible, the plan commission may require the applicant to pay a fee equal to $150.00 per caliper inch of the tree that is removed or proposed to be removed. Valuation of trees removed or proposed to be removed may be reduced per the city forester, based on analysis of health and condition of trees to be replaced. In determining valuations and fees in lieu of replacement the plan commission shall take into consideration nursery stock prices in effect at the time of valuation. In the discretion of the plan commission the valuation per caliper inch may be modified to account for fluctuating commodity prices. 
2.  All fees collected as fees in lieu of replacement shall be deposited in the City of Delafield Tree and Brush Removal Fund and earmarked for landscaping and tree planting in public street rights-of-way and on other city-owned property. 
j.  Penalty for unauthorized tree removal. If it is determined by the city building inspector, city arborist, or city administrator that a violation of this section has occurred, or there has been unauthorized tree removal, with the exception of the removal of dead or diseased trees as determined by the city arborist, the forfeiture for said unauthorized removal shall be three times the amount determined pursuant to subsection (5)i of this section. The value of each and every unauthorized removed tree shall be determined by the city arborist. Each and every act of unauthorized tree removal shall be deemed a separate offense for which a forfeiture may be assessed.

Concrete block, artificial stone and artificial brick veneers shall be prohibited. 
g.  No new backlit signs or awnings shall be permitted. If sign lighting is needed, the preferred lighting is either ground lighting or mounted arm lighting. Existing legal nonconforming backlit signs and backlit awnings shall be considered grandfathered. 
h.  Preferred signage areas include traditional sign panels above storefront windows, signage painted or applied to windows, small unlit projecting signs, and signage placed on traditional canvas awnings. 
i.  Signage shall be oriented to the pedestrian versus the automobile. 
j.  Maximum size for a flush wall mounted sign shall be 25 square feet. 
k.  The preferred form of parking in the downtown area is the "parking courtyard," which places the parking areas on the interior or rear of the blocks rather than along the street frontage. 
l.  Parking lots fronting on public streets or on residential zoned areas shall be screened from the streets and sidewalk or adjoining residential property either by walls or plantings or both. If walls are used, then the material shall be compatible with the walls of the existing adjacent buildings. Walls shall be at least 24 inches high.

a.  Buildings and appurtenances, including signs, shall be cleaned and painted in a color harmonious with the original design or repaired as required to present a neat appearance. 
b.  Deteriorated, worn, or damaged structures or portions of structures shall be rebuilt or replaced. 
c.  Illumination elements of buildings and signs shall be kept in good repair so as to maintain the effect for which they were designed. 
(Code 1997, § 17.31; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-65. - Site plan and appearance review administration. 
(a)  Regulatory powers of the commission over new construction and remodeling. No permit required by applicable ordinances of the city for the erection, construction, alteration or repair of any building or structure on public lands or within any zoning district, excluding single-family and two-family residences and which involves new construction or major exterior alterations, shall be issued by city officials except upon the granting of a site plan and appearance certificate of approval by the plan commission. If the building inspector determines that only a minor exterior alteration is involved in the work for which the permit is sought, no certificate of approval is required hereunder. 
(b)  Procedure for site plan and appearance certificate of approval application review and approval. 
(1)  Application. An applicant for any construction permit that requires a site plan and appearance certificate of approval shall apply to the plan commission for such certificate on forms provided by the administrator and shall provide two full, complete signed copies of all items required on application and as specified in section 52-61, as well as property owner and applicant signatures. Additionally the all of the same shall be submitted to the city clerk-treasurer in digital (i.e., PDF) format. 
(2)  Schedule plan commission meeting. Upon receipt of such application, the administrator shall schedule a meeting of the plan commission to be held within 45 days of the date of application, at which the applicant shall be given an opportunity to make a presentation and any interested party shall be given the opportunity to comment. 
(3)  Staff application review conference. Any applicant or prospective applicant for any permit that requires a site plan and appearance certificate of approval shall have a preliminary review conference with the administrator and city planning staff. At such conference, the staff shall review the preliminary exterior drawings, sketches or photographic examples, landscape and site plans and materials on a specific project and provide the applicant with guidance in the development of a plan which would be consistent with requirements and purposes of this section. 
(4)  Preliminary plan commission conference. Any applicant or prospective applicant for any permit that requires a site plan and appearance certificate of approval may file a written request for a preliminary conference with the plan commission. Such conference with the commission shall be held at the next scheduled commission meeting. At such conference, the commission shall give consideration to preliminary exterior drawings, sketches or photographic examples, landscape and site plans and materials on a specific project and provide the applicant with guidance in the development of a plan which would be consistent with requirements and purposes of this section. 
(5)  Plan commission meeting. The plan commission may approve, deny or make recommendations as to changes in the site plan and exterior design features, which in the judgment of the commission would tend to achieve the general purpose of this section. If approval is granted contingent upon plan changes, revised documentation must be submitted in digital (i.e., PDF) format to both the city clerk and city engineer within 30 days of the approval. 
a.  The plan commission shall issue a certificate of approval if it finds that: 
1.  The applicant's plans are substantially consistent with this section; 
2.  The proposed exterior design features of the development are suitable and compatible with the character of neighboring buildings and structures and the character of the neighborhood; 
3.  The exterior design features of the development will not be detrimental to the harmonious and orderly growth of the city; and 
4.  The exterior design features of the development will not cause a substantial depreciation in the property values or taxable values in the neighborhood. 
b.  The plan commission shall render its decision at the meeting and shall notify the administrator and the applicant thereof. If the commission denies the issuance of a certificate of approval to the applicant, no permit shall be issued on the application, except by express direction of the common council, upon appeal as provided below. 
(6)  Follow-up by the building inspector. 
a.  Upon the granting of a certificate of approval, one copy of the exterior drawings, sketches, landscape and site plans, renderings and materials upon which the certificate was granted shall be retained by the city clerk and a second copy shall be retained by the building inspector, whose responsibility it shall be to determine, as the project is in progress and finally upon its completion, that there have been no deviations therefrom. Such deviations shall constitute a violation of this section, in which event the building inspector may stop work on the project in the same manner as for a violation of a chapter of this Code. Work may not be resumed until such deviations are corrected. 
b.  The person to whom a certificate of approval has been granted shall comply with the requirements of the certificate and obtain such inspections as may be necessary in order to assure compliance. The building inspector shall give notice of any deficiencies found to exist. Failure to correct any deficiencies within ten days after notification of such deficiency shall constitute a violation of this section. 
c.  When, by reason of nonavailability of planting materials or other valid circumstances, it becomes necessary to vary any of the provisions under which a certificate has been granted and, in the opinion of the building inspector, such variation shall be aesthetically equal to or better than the original provisions and will not conflict with the intent of this section, the building inspector shall have the power to grant such variation. To the extent that the building inspector exercises the above power, he shall submit a written report of the circumstances to the commission. 
d.  Before any occupancy permit may be issued authorizing the use of any improvements constructed under the provisions of this section, a final inspection of the premises must be obtained. An occupancy permit will not be issued unless the completed work is found to be in compliance with plans approved by the commission and under which the certificate of approval was issued, except as provided in subsection (b)(6)f of this section. 
e.  If it should become impossible by reason of weather, strike or any other circumstance beyond the control of the person, firm or corporation to whom the certificate has been granted to complete all work required before occupancy or start of use, a temporary occupancy permit may be granted upon either depositing with the city a cash escrow sufficient to guarantee completion of the work, or upon the execution of an agreement in a form satisfactory to the city attorney which shall bind the applicant to comply with the terms, provisions and conditions of the certificate as soon as circumstances permit. Refunds of any cash escrow may be made only in a lump sum upon final inspection and approval by the building inspector. 
f.  If the person to whom the certificate of approval has been granted fails to complete the improvements above and a cash escrow amount has been deposited for more than 12 months from the date of deposit, the city shall be authorized to use all or such part of such deposit as may be required to complete the work in accordance with drawings submitted and approved by the plan commission and under which a certificate and other permits have been granted. The above time limit may be extended by the building inspector if it is in the public interest to do so. In such event, the party to whom the certificate was issued shall only be entitled to the refund of that portion, if any, of the cash deposit that remains in escrow after completion of the work entailed. The party to whom the certificate was issued, and the successors and assigns thereof, shall have a continuing obligation to maintain the exterior design features as approved, and failure to do so, within ten days after notification by the building inspector of such failure to maintain, shall constitute a violation of this section. 
g.  Improvements in existence as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be in compliance with this section, but such improvements shall be continuously maintained in a state of good repair. The building inspector shall have the same powers and authority to effectuate the proper maintenance of preexisting improvements as that person has with regard to improvements for which a certificate has been issued. 
(7)  Appeal to the council. If the plan commission denies a certificate of approval or amendment thereto or fails to timely act as provided above, the applicant shall have the right to appeal directly to the common council. Such appeal shall be made in writing and filed within 30 days of the failure of the commission to act. The common council shall consider and decide such appeal within 30 days after the filing thereof. Upon such appeal, all records and findings concerning the applications shall be submitted to the common council by the building inspector. Thereupon, the common council may: 
a.  Adopt the decision of the plan commission. 
b.  Overrule or modify the decision of the plan commission and direct the issuance of a certificate. 
c.  Or, if the plan commission has failed to timely act as provided above, direct or deny issuance of a certificate. 
d.  Amendments to a certificate of approval may be obtained by application in the same manner as provided for an original certificate. 
(8)  Performance bond or letter of credit. The city may require a performance bond, letter of credit, or other assurance from the developer guaranteeing that all grading, erosion control, stormwater facilities, landscaping and restoration, and other site improvements required as a condition of site plan and appearance approval will be installed. Said bond or letter of credit shall be for 110 percent of the estimated cost of installation based on cost estimates approved by the city engineer. Such performance bond or letter of credit shall be retained by the city until all improvements are accepted and approved by the city engineer. 
(9)  Erosion control. Erosion controls approved by the city engineer must be in place, inspected, and approved prior to issuance of any building permits or granting a permit for preliminary grading or site preparation. Erosion controls must meet the guidelines of the "Wisconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook." 
(10)  As-built plans. Following completion of construction of required site improvements, developers shall provide the city with as-built plans for stormwater improvements, grading, and landscaping. As-built plans shall be submitted on Mylar, signed and sealed by a professional engineer and/or land surveyor of the state. Additionally, as-built plans shall be submitted to the city engineer in digital format (i.e., PDF) and in AutoCAD dwg format. 
(11)  Penalty. Except as otherwise provided herein, any person found in violation of any provision of this section or any other rule or regulation made hereunder shall be subject to a penalty as provided in section 1-4.

ARTICLE III. - PLANS OF OPERATION 
 
Sec. 52-89. - Plans of operation. 
(a)  Plan of operation review and approval requirements. 
(1)  No person shall operate a commercial enterprise, industry, home business, church, school, nonprofit organization, or other nonresidential use without first obtaining the approval of a plan of operation from the plan commission as set forth in this section, and no nonresidential activity shall be engaged in or carried on, except as approved in the plan of operation permit. 
(2)  As businesses or institutions requiring a plan of operation add additional employees, change the nature of the product or service, or extend the hours of operation beyond those shown on the plan of operation approval an amended plan of operation shall be required. 
(b)  Temporary plan of operation permits. That the city administrator may have the authority to issue a temporary permit until the next official plan commission meeting is held. 
(c)  Plan of operation permit exemptions. The following public uses are exempt from plans of operation permit requirements: 
(1)  Municipal offices. 
(2)  Public schools. 
(d)  Required information for a plan of operation permit. All plans of operation shall be submitted to the administrator on forms supplied by the city. The applications for plan of operation permits shall show the following information:

(e)  Criteria for plan of operation approval. The following criteria will be used by the plan commission in reviewing applications for plan of operation permits: 
(1)  Proximity to residential neighborhoods and the potential for disturbing and disrupting residential uses. 
(2)  Adequacy of the principal building and other structures on the site for the proposed activity. Plan of operation permits will only be issued to businesses to be conducted in permanent structures. Temporary plan of operation permits may be issued, at the discretion of the plan commission, for temporary structures or facilities not on a permanent foundation, such as wheeled trailers, vendor carts, and season stands. 
(3)  Availability of adequate parking to meet the needs of employees and customers. 
(4)  Adequacy of street access. 
(f)  Hours of operation.

Secs. 52-9052-106. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE IV. - ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
Sec. 52-107. - Establishment. 
For the purpose of this chapter, the city is divided into the zoning districts described in this article. 
(1)  District boundaries. Boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on a map entitled "Official Zoning Map, City of Delafield, Wisconsin." Such boundaries shall be construed to follow corporate limits; U.S. public survey lines; and centerlines of streets, highways, alleys, easements and railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended, unless otherwise noted on the zoning map. 
(2)  Boundaries of conservancy districts. Boundaries of conservancy districts as drawn on the official zoning map are intended to represent the edge of wetlands, swamps, marshes and floodlands or the high water line along a stream or watercourse and the boundaries of public parklands. Modification of the conservancy district boundaries to exempt lands from this classification may be permitted if a property owner presents documentation that the land or a portion of it does not contain soil types which are poorly drained, very poorly drained or wet alluvial land according to the Soil Survey for Waukesha County prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service. 
(3)  Boundaries of shoreland-wetland districts. 
a.  The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the city which are five acres or more in size and are shown on the final wetland inventory map that has been adopted and made a part of this chapter in section 52-111(ac)(9) and which are: 
1.  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Ponds or flowages in the city shall be presumed to be navigable if they are listed in the department of natural resources' publication "Surface Water Resources of Waukesha County" or are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been made a part of this chapter in section 52-111(ac)(9). 
2.  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable rivers or streams or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter in section 52-111(ac)(9). Floodplain zoning maps adopted in section 52-111(ac)(9) shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas. 
b.  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high water mark location shall initially be made by the administrator. When questions arise, the administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high water mark. 
c.  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the shoreland-wetland district boundary shown on the official zoning maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the department to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped is in error. If department staff concur with the administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the official zoning maps, the administrator shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period. See sections 52-292 to 52-296. 
d.  Under Wis. Stats. § 144.26(2m), notwithstanding any other provision of law or administrative rule, wetland zoning ordinances required under Wis. Stats. § 62.231, and ch. NR 117, Wis. Admin. Code, do not apply to lands adjacent to farm drainage ditches if: 
1.  Such lands are not adjacent to a natural navigable stream or river. 
2.  Those parts of the drainage ditches adjacent to such lands were not navigable streams before ditching. 
3.  Such lands are maintained in nonstructural agricultural use. 
e.  Wetlands lying between bulkhead lines and the ordinary high water mark or which have been filled prior to adoption of the shoreland-wetland provisions of this chapter and the final wetland maps are not regulated by the shoreland-wetland provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  Boundaries of residential lake districts. Boundaries of residential lake districts as drawn are intended to include subdivisions which immediately abut a lake or stream. A lot in a residential lake district subdivision shall not be subdivided so as to create an additional lot or lots which do not abut the lake or stream without prior permission of the plan commission. 
(5)  Vacation. Vacation of public streets and alleys shall cause the land vacated to be automatically placed in the same district as the abutting side to which the vacated land reverts. 
(6)  Zoning of annexed land. 
a.  Temporary zoning. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.021(7), the common council shall refer to the plan commission for recommendation as to temporary zoning classification any land being considered for annexation and shall include in the annexation ordinance a provision designating a temporary zoning district classification for such area. 
b.  Permanent zoning. As soon as practical after the annexation is final, the zoning classification for such annexed area shall be established by zoning amendment. 
(7)  Environmental corridor boundary. 
a.  Purpose and intent. Environmental corridor boundary, as mapped or intended to be mapped, includes primary or secondary environmental corridors as defined in the comprehensive plan, and is intended to be used to preserve, protect, enhance, and restore significant woodlands, upland wildlife habitat areas, scenic overlooks, slopes exceeding 12 percent, and upland wooded areas. Areas designated as being within the environmental corridor may be used for limited residential purposes; provided, however, that residential densities in such areas may not exceed one unit per five acres for all parcels or portions of parcels that lie within the environmental corridor boundary, exclusive of the C-1 conservancy areas. Where questions arise as to the exact location or boundary of an environmental corridor boundary, the extent and location of such corridors shall be field delineated in conjunction with SEWPRC standards for PEC and finally approved by the zoning administrator or his/her designee. 
b.  Density and lot size. 
1.  In determining the density allowed for any proposed development which includes lands within the environmental corridor boundary one dwelling unit may be permitted for each five acres of land, in either private or common ownership, located entirely within the environmental corridor boundary area; provided, however, that the minimum residential lot size shall be determined in accordance with the underlying zoning district. 
2.  Lots or parcels may be created which include lands located partially within the environmental corridor boundary, provided that the building envelope is located outside the environmental corridor boundary, and provided further that no earth altering activity shall be allowed within the environmental corridor boundary. These restrictions shall be noted on the face of any certified survey map or subdivision plat which create lots which include lands located partially within the environmental corridor boundary. 
c.  Preservation of open space. 
1.  For parcels lying entirely within an environmental corridor boundary, no open space requirement shall apply. However, all area of disturbance, earth altering activity and vegetative removal, including building sites patio space, lawn area and driveways, shall not exceed 15 percent of five acres (32,600 square feet). 
2.  For parcels that lie partially within the environmental corridor boundary, the allowable area of disturbance shall be limited to that portion of the lot outside of the environmental corridor unless otherwise permitted by a building envelope on the certified survey map, subdivision plat or other document. The maximum allowable land disturbance within the environmental corridor boundary shall be proportional to the area of lot that falls within the defined boundary. Only 15 percent of the area within the environmental corridor boundary unique to each lot may be disturbed. 
(8)  Wetland setback. In all districts, a minimum setback shall be employed to protect and prevent deterioration of existing wetland assets. The wetland setback shall conform to the minimum interior side yard identified in the district bulk regulations.

(1)  Railroad rights-of-way and passenger depots, not including switching, storage, freight yards or siding. 
(2)  Churches, rectories, parsonages, parish houses and synagogues as conditional uses, subject to the provisions of article V of this chapter. 
(Code 1997, § 17.37; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-110. - Permitted accessory uses in all residential districts. 
Accessory uses shall be on the same lot as the principal use. The following accessory uses are permitted: 
(1)  Private garages, one attached and/or one detached private garage per dwelling unit, no larger than 1,200 square feet in area. 
(2)  Utility buildings and accessory buildings, no larger than 240 square feet in area. No more than one permitted per lot. 
(3)  Lodging or boarding for not more than two lodgers or more than two boarders per dwelling unit who are not members of the family. 
(4)  Model homes. 
(5)  Home occupations, provided that such occupation is incidental to the use of the premises for residential purposes and does not affect any substantial change in the character of the premises or of the neighborhood, that no article is sold or offered for sale on the premises, except such as is produced by such occupation, and that no person is employed other than a member of the immediate family living on the premises. Not more than 25 percent of the total floor area of a dwelling unit shall be occupied by a home occupation. 
(6)  Signs as indicated in section 52-230. 
(7)  Boathouses; one per residential lake lot. 
(8)  Private piers complying with Wis. Stats. § 30.12, pertaining to structures and deposits in navigable waters. 
(9)  This section is intended to address the matter of buildings larger than utility buildings and accessory to the use of lots for residential purposes, for storage of noncommercial personal property or for housing livestock. Such structures are permitted only if the use thereof is customarily incidental to the permitted use of the premises. 
a.  Stables, barns, coops or sheds greater than 1,200 square feet meeting the above requirements shall be permitted in residential and agricultural districts, subject to the following limitations and requirements: 
1.  Site plan approval is required pursuant to sections 52-58, 52-59, and 52-61 through 52-65. 
b.  No stable, barn, or shed falling within the requirements of this section and on a lot of less than three acres in size shall be used for housing livestock other than chickens as described herein. 
c.  Appropriate deed restrictions may be required by the plan commission in order to preclude the further land division of parcels of land upon which accessory structures meeting the above requirements have been constructed in order to preclude land division which would create a parcel with such a building located thereon and which would be of an overall area that would violate the provisions of subsection (9)a of this section. 
(10)  The keeping of chickens is permitted in all single-family residential districts provided that the lot area exceeds one acre. 
a.  A maximum of five adult chickens per acre, not to exceed 20 adult chickens, may be kept for non-commercial use. 
b.  All chickens must be provided adequate shelter with appropriate ventilation. 
c.  Chickens must be allowed to roam in a confined pen outside of the shelter.

(1)  Definitions. The following terms have the meanings indicated: 
Entire property holding means all contiguous holdings in common ownership. Properties divided by a public street right-of-way are considered contiguous. 
General development plan (PD-GDP) means the first phase of approval in the planned development process which shows the entire property holding. The PD-GDP must show the general location of buildings or building envelopes, common spaces, parking and drive areas, conceptual stormwater drainage plan and principal landscape features. If the development is proposed to occur in phases, the sequence of development should be indicated. It is recognized that PD-GDPs are often submitted prior to the identification of the ultimate land user or the specific land use. The intent of the GDP is to be conceptual. A public hearing is required for a GDP. 
Specific implementation plan (PD-SIP) means the second phase of approval is a detailed plan, also referred to as a PD-SIP, which must show detailed information for that portion or phase of the project proposed for approval. Frequently PD-SIPs are submitted for only those portions of the total project shown in the PD-GDP which are planned for immediate development. Subsequent phases of development are shown in separate detailed plans prepared at the time of development. If as a result of more detailed planning or engineering at the PD-SIP stage changes need to be made in the PD-GDP, applicants can submit PD-GDP amendments. The submittal and review requirements of PD-GDP amendments are the same as those for the initial PD-GDP. 
(2)  Intent. Any development other than the identified permitted uses of this district must occur as a planned development - conditional use under the terms and conditions of this chapter or successor provisions. The intent of this zoning is to create a district which will enable flexibility in terms of the specific types of land uses, but will assure that any development occurring in this area will be planned and designed within the context of a business district or integrated planned development. 
(3)  Permitted uses. All uses permitted in the B-2 and B-3 districts are permitted in the B-6 district and in addition to uses indicated in section 52-109, provided they conform to the geometric standard as set forth in subsections (x)(6) through (14) of this section and as described in subsection (aa)(5)b of this section, and the following:

Sec. 52-136. - Conditional use approval and permit required. 
No use of buildings or premises classified as a conditional use in this chapter shall be undertaken, extended, changed or continued, except upon recommendation by the plan commission and approval by the common council. The plan commission may authorize the administrator to issue a conditional use permit for conditional uses after review and a public hearing, provided that such conditional uses and structures are in accordance with the purpose and intent of this chapter and are found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment or the value of the neighborhood or the community. 
(Code 1997, § 17.40; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-137. - Conditional use permit application procedure. 
(a)  Preliminary staff consultation. A petitioner shall have a preliminary consultation with the administrator and such other city staff and consultants that the administrator deems needed and appropriate to conduct a preliminary review of the application. 
(b)  Preliminary plan commission consultation. A petitioner may meet with the plan commission for a preliminary consultation prior to submitting a conditional use application. The purpose of this preliminary consultation is to review and discuss the proposed request. 
(c)  Application. A request for conditional use shall be made on special forms available in the city clerk's office and submitted in writing to the administrator at least 28 days before the regularly scheduled plan commission meeting. The administrator shall promptly refer such petition to the plan commission for determination. The application shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee as noted in section 52-296(a). 
(d)  Supplemental data and site plan. The conditional use applications shall include and be accompanied by the following information: 
(1)  Names and addresses of the applicant, owner of the site, architect, professional engineer, contractor and all opposite and abutting property owners of record. 
(2)  Description of the subject site by lot, block and recorded subdivision or by metes and bounds; address of the subject site; type of structure; proposed operation or use of the structure or site; number of employees; hours of operation; and the zoning district within which the subject site lies. 
(3)  A site plan showing all of the relevant information required in article II of this chapter under the site plan requirements. 
(4)  Additional information as may be required by the city plan commission or administrator. 
(e)  Hearing. After receipt of the application form and all additional information, the city clerk shall advertise a public hearing on the request as soon as practical; provided, however, that no such hearing shall be scheduled, advertised or held until the administrator certifies that the application is complete and all data and information is on file with the plan commission and available for public inspection.

Sec. 52-138. - Conditional use review, determination, approval, and amendment.

(b)  Determination. After study and review of the necessary data, the plan commission shall hold a public hearing. The plan commission shall render its decision in writing no later than 90 days from the date of the public hearing. Any further consideration of the petition beyond the 90-day period shall be preceded by another public hearing on the petition. 
(c)  Factors to be considered. 
(1)  The plan commission shall base its determination on the effect of such grant on the health, safety and welfare of the community and of the immediate neighborhood in which such use would be located, including such considerations as compatibility with existing uses, problems of fire and police protection, traffic movement and control, water, sanitation and utilities, impact (aesthetically or otherwise) on surrounding property values, noise, dust, smoke, odor and such other factors appropriate to the granting of a conditional use. 
(2)  The plan commission's decision shall include an accurate description of the use permitted, the property on which permitted and any and all conditions made applicable thereof or if disapproved, shall indicate the reasons for disapproval. All papers in the matter shall become permanent commission records. 
(d)  Approval of the common council. Every conditional use decision rendered by the plan commission, whether granting the conditional use or denying it, shall be placed upon an agenda of a common council meeting within 45 days of the plan commission determination. The common council shall approve, reject or refer back to the plan commission with appropriate instructions. This procedure is not an appeal, and the common council's approval shall be on the record. However, the common council may allow time for parties to present oral or written arguments. The decision of the common council shall be final, and the applicant will be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedy upon such decision. 
(e)  Conditional use review, determination, approval and amendment. 
(1)  All proposed changes, revisions or additions to the terms or conditions of any existing conditional use shall be submitted to the plan commission in accordance with the procedure set forth in section 52-137. Upon receipt of such an application seeking a change, revision, or addition to any term or condition of a conditional use permit, the plan commission shall schedule a public hearing, and shall provide written notice of the public hearing to the owners of any lands lying within 300 feet of the lands described in the conditional use permit. Following the conclusion of the public hearing, the plan commission shall make such recommendations as the plan commission deems appropriate, and shall forward those recommendations to the common council. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the common council may approve in part or deny the requested change, revision or addition to the terms and conditions of the conditional use permit.

(c)  Modification of regulations. Requirements applicable to uses permitted by right or as accessory uses in any district by the regulations of this chapter may be modified or waived by the plan commission in their application to a conditional use if in the commission's opinion they are not appropriate or necessary to the proper regulation of the conditional use and where such modification or waiver would not in the commission's opinion have an adverse effect upon the surrounding properties. 
(d)  Accessory uses and structures. Uses and structures accessory to a principal conditional use shall be subject to appropriate regulation in the same manner as set forth for the principal conditional use. 
(Code 1997, § 17.43; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-140. - Conditional use permit termination. 
(a)  Where a permitted conditional use is abandoned or does not continue in conformity with the conditions of the original approval; where a change in the character of the surrounding area or of the use itself causes it to be no longer compatible with surrounding areas; or for similar cause based upon considerations of public health, safety or welfare, the conditional grant may be terminated by action of the common council following referral to the plan commission for recommendation and public hearing thereon. 
(b)  The council or plan commission with council approval may establish a termination date for any approval under this section. Such date shall be effective 24 months after the date of such approval, unless otherwise established by the council or plan commission and shall be set forth in the minutes of the council or plan commission. A certified excerpt thereof shall be recorded with the register of deeds where the council or plan commission considers it appropriate. No further notice or hearing shall be required for such revocation to occur. It is the intent of the council that where proposed projects are not substantially underway by such date, the approval shall terminate; however, where substantial progress has been made by such date, the council may extend it. Substantial progress shall be evidenced by the petitioner securing valid building permits for the project. Where appropriate, substantial progress can be defined in a development agreement outlining a percentage of completed construction or project phasing which shall be considered substantial progress for purposes of this section.

Sec. 52-236. - Bonds. 
Every applicant for a building permit for a sign to be located completely or partially within a public right-of-way shall, before the permit is granted, execute a surety bond in a sum to be fixed by the administrator, but not to exceed $25,000.00, and it shall be of a form and type approved by the city attorney, indemnifying the city against all loss, costs, damages or expenses incurred or sustained by or recovered against the city by reason of erection, construction or maintenance of such sign. 
(Code 1997, § 17.71; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-237. - Signs within a public right-of-way. 
Prior to the issuance of a building permit for any sign located completely or partially within a public right-of-way, a liability insurance policy is required. The city attorney shall determine the nature and amount of the liability policy to indemnify the city against all liabilities. The required bond and insurance policy shall be renewed annually for the life of the sign. Should the liability policy lapse, the sign shall be removed by the city with the city's expenses covered by the bond and/or assessed to the owner.

Sec. 52-242. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Directional sign means a sign which guides or directs pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
Eave means, for the purpose of sign regulation, the lower edge of an angled roof or the top edge of the wall in the case of flat-roofed buildings. Surfaces at an angle of 20 degrees or less from vertical are to be considered as wall rather than roof. 
Ground sign means a sign which is attached to the ground independent of any building. 
Harmonious means having component elements that are compatible with building aesthetics. 
Identification signs means signs that identify large developments or groupings for any multi-tenant establishment. 
Projecting sign means a sign other than a wall sign which is attached to or supported by a building or structure and projecting more than eight inches from the face of the building or structure. The surface of a projecting sign may be parallel to or at an angle to the outside wall surface of a building or structure, but does not project above the eave. 
Roof sign means a sign mounted on a building, situated in total or in part above the eave of that part of the building to which it is mounted. 
Sign means a name, identification, image, description, display or illustration, which is affixed to, painted or represented directly or indirectly upon a building, structure or piece of land, which directs attention to an object, project, place, activity, facility, service, event, attraction, person, institution, organization or business and which is visible from any street, right-of-way, sidewalk, alley, park or other public property. Customary displays of merchandise or objects and material without lettering placed behind a store window are not signs or parts of signs. 
Sign area means the entire area within a circle, triangle or parallelogram enclosing the extreme limits of writing, representation, emblem or any figure of similar character, together with any frame or other material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the background against which it is placed, excluding the necessary supports or uprights on which such sign is placed. Where a sign has two or more faces, the area of all faces shall be included in determining the area of the sign, except that where two such faces are placed back to back and are at no point more than two feet from one another, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of one face if the two faces are of equal area or as the area of the larger face if the two faces are of unequal area. 
Sign, on-premises, means a sign which advertises only goods, services, facilities, events or attractions available on the premises where located, identifies the owner or occupant or directs traffic on the premises. All other signs are off-premises signs. 
Temporary sign means a sign with a commercial message permitted for a limited period of time. 
Wall sign means a sign which is in any manner affixed to any exterior wall of a building structure and which projects not more than 12 inches from the building or structure wall or a sign which is painted on any exterior wall, but does not project above the eave. 
Window sign means a sign which is on the inside of a window, including those painted on the glass and neon or backlit signs oriented toward the building exterior.

Secs. 52-24352-262. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE IX. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT AS A CONDITIONAL USE 
 
Sec. 52-263. - Intent. 
(a)  Standards and exceptions established. Planned development projects are substantially different in character from other conditional uses and for this reason, specific and additional standards and exceptions are hereby established to regulate planned development projects. 
(b)  Compliance. The planned development process provides a flexible regulatory framework designed to allow developers greater freedom, imagination and flexibility in the development of land while ensuring substantial compliance with the basic intent of the zoning code and comprehensive plan. At the same time the PD process ensures the city that key development parcels and large land holdings will be developed with a comprehensive and cohesive unified development plan. 
(c)  As conditional uses. A planned development may be permitted as a conditional use in any district. No planned development is permitted in any lake district, unless the parcel to be developed has a minimum of 200 feet of lake frontage. A planned development project may also contain mixed dwelling types and mixed compatible uses. Unless modified by specific provisions of this section, the provisions and requirements of article V of this chapter shall apply. 
(d)  Stages. All PDs are submitted and approved in two stages: 
(1)  The first stage is a general development plan which shows the entire property holding. The general development plan shows the general locations of buildings or building envelopes, common open spaces, parking and drive areas and principal landscape features. If the development is proposed to occur in phases, sequence of development should be indicated. It is recognized that general development plans are often submitted prior to the identification of the ultimate land user or the specific land uses. 
(2)  The second stage is a detailed plan which shows detailed plans and information for that portion of a project which is intended for construction in the near future. Frequently detailed plans are submitted for only those portions of the total project area shown in the general development plan which are planned for immediate development. Subsequent phases of development are shown in separate detailed plans prepared at the time of development. 
(e)  Densities. Development densities in conditional use - planned development shall not exceed the densities permitted by the underlying zoning district. Where a proposed planned development project encompasses more than one underlying zoning district, the densities of the various zoning districts may be averaged or densities may be calculated separately for each of the different zoning districts. Density averaging may not be employed where any zoning district is A-1 agricultural or A-1E exclusive agricultural. 
(f)  Residential clustering. A planned development may permit condensed building sites in nearer proximity than permitted in the underlying zoning district regulations in order to maximize common open space, enhance preservation of natural features, or minimize infrastructure improvements. Residential clustering may be accomplished by reduced fee simple lot sizes or by condominium. Building setbacks, building to building separation, lot size and the quality of the resulting common area may be considered when evaluating a residential clustering plan. No planned development shall be permitted with residential lots less than one-half acre in size. 
(g)  Submittal requirements. 
(1)  General development. 
a.  A site map drawn to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet or greater, showing existing topography and vegetation. 
b.  A site plan drawn to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet or greater, showing proposed public streets, access points for private drives and driveways, proposed building envelopes and the location of common open space or preserved green areas. 
c.  Conceptual landscape plan showing the general location of new plant materials, landscaped features and screens and berms. Areas where mature vegetation is to be removed must be shown on the conceptual landscape plan. 
d.  Conceptual grading plan showing general site drainage, the location of on-site stormwater management facilities, and any modification of the existing topography. 
e.  Photographs of the site and the adjoining properties. 
f.  If available, building elevations or photographs of other comparable buildings constructed on other sites. 
(2)  Detailed plan submittal requirements. 
a.  Detail site plan based on a certified survey, condominium plat or subdivision plat, showing precise locations and size of all elements shown on the general development plan. 
b.  Building plan showing exterior elevations and floor plans of each building proposed for construction. The plans shall include descriptions of materials and colors. The plan commission may request material and color samples. Include finished ground and basement floor grades. 
c.  Engineering plan showing existing and proposed topography with contours at intervals not exceeding two feet, proposed drainage patterns, site grading plan, sanitary sewer system, storm sewer system and water supply system, all subject to approval by the city engineer. 
d.  Landscape planting plan showing the type, size, and location of plantings, retaining walls and other landscape features. 
e.  Erosion control plan as required by this Code. 
f.  Other special documents showing such other design components and related information as may be required by the plan commission or common council. These may include, but are not limited to, maintenance agreements, development agreements, plans of operation, property owners' association documentation, and deed restrictions. 
(h)  Criteria for approval. The intent of the PD procedures is to enable the developer to have greater flexibility in planning for land uses and site design than would be permitted under standard zoning provisions. However, there are some general criteria that the plan commission will follow in reviewing and approving PDs. Criteria for approval include: 
(1)  A planned development may be allowed by the plan commission where natural features are determined to warrant preservation. 
(2)  Existing mature vegetation and natural topography will be preserved to the greatest extent feasible. 
(3)  The character and intensity of the proposed development must be compatible with existing and planned land uses on nearby and adjoining properties. 
(4)  Reduction in lot area, lot width and building setbacks may be considered by the plan commission if the resulting configuration creates greater open space, produces appreciable areas that enhance preservation or expansion of natural features, or provides tangible community benefits associated with public use and enjoyment. 
(5)  The proposed development must not result in diminishment of property values of adjoining or nearby properties. 
(6)  Existing and planned street and highway improvements are adequate to handle the projected volumes of traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(7)  There is adequate capacity in the public sanitary sewer and stormwater sewer system to handle projected demand. 
(8)  The proposed circulation system and the design and layout of utilities has taken into account existing and potential streets and utility systems on adjoining parcels. 
(Code 1997, § 17.75; Rep. and Recr. #411; Rep. & Recr. #623; Am. #646; Cr. # 729 ; Am. # 729 )  
Sec. 52-264. - Application procedure and required information. 
(a)  Preliminary staff consultation. A petitioner shall have a preliminary consultation with the administrator and such other city staff and consultants that the city administrator deems needed and appropriate to conduct a preliminary review of the application. 
(b)  Preliminary plan commission consultation. An applicant may meet with the plan commission for a preliminary consultation prior to formally submitting a conditional use application. The purpose of the preliminary consultation is to discuss the proposed request, review the local regulations and policies applicable to the project, and discuss the land use implications of the proposal. 
(c)  Application and general development plan. 
(1)  The applicant shall submit a conditional use application in accordance with the application procedure described in section 52-137. In addition to the required information noted in section 52-137, a general development plan shall be submitted to the plan commission and common council for review 60 days prior to the rezoning hearing and/or detailed design work. The general development plan shall include data required under section 52-263(7) and (8). 
(2)  In addition, other documents or related information may be required by the plan commission and common council, which may include, but is not limited to, economic impact and market feasibility studies. 
(3)  The general development plan and related information shall be available for public inspection prior to any public hearing for conditional use zoning on the proposed project. 
(Code 1997, § 17.76; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-265. - Resolution on conditions and restrictions. 
(a)  As noted in section 52-263, planned developments may be regulated by specific and additional standards and exceptions different from conventional zoning regulations. To accomplish this, the plan commission may recommend and the common council may adopt by resolution specific conditions and restrictions for each planned development project. The specific conditions and restrictions may specify permitted uses, density standards, including lot area, yard setbacks, open space, dwelling unit size and distribution, and other appropriate regulations. When lands border a lake or other public body of water, pyramiding as defined and prohibited in this Code may be allowed under this article only if the minimum lake frontage and width of the parcel fronting on the lake at the ordinary high water mark is 100 feet for the first dwelling unit and 50 percent of the lake frontage requirement of the underlying zoning district for each additional dwelling unit; provided, however, that the number of dwelling units per parcel shall not exceed 25 percent additional units than would have been permissible under the restrictions of the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  The resolution containing the conditions and restrictions may also include other nonstandard or non-uniform requirements, regulations and provisions as recommended by the plan commission and approved by the common council. Such nonstandard requirements, regulations and provisions shall be designed to ensure proper development and appropriate operation and maintenance of each specific planned development project. 
(c)  Owners, their heirs, successors, and assigns shall agree by contract with the city to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the specific conditions and restrictions adopted to regulate a specific planned development project. 
(Code 1997, § 17.77; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-266. - Detailed plans and information. 
(a)  After conditional use zoning has been granted based upon the information shown in the general development plan, detailed plans and information covering that portion of the total project which is intended for construction shall be submitted for approval prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(b)  The detailed plans and information described in this section shall be submitted to the plan commission for its review and approval at least 30 days prior to the expected date of approval by the plan commission. After approval by the plan commission, all detailed plans and information shall be submitted to the common council along with any written statement of the plan commission findings and recommendations within 45 days. The common council shall approve all detailed plans and information prior to the issuance of a building permit or any other permits. 
(c)  The detailed plans and information shall cover that portion of the project which is intended for construction and shall include data required in section 52-263. 
(Code 1997, § 17.78; Rep. and Recr. #411; Am. #517)  
Sec. 52-267. - Common open space. 
All residential planned developments shall provide permanent common open space. The open space may be in public ownership or in private ownership with an open space easement to assure that the open space will be permanent. The common open space area shall be conveniently accessible to all residential dwelling units within a planned development and is further defined as follows: 
(1)  Common open space includes: 
a.  Land area of the site not covered by buildings, parking structures or accessory structures, except recreational structures. Underground parking decks may be counted as open space. 
b.  Land which is accessible and available to all occupants of dwelling units for whose use the space is intended. 
(2)  Common open space does not include: 
a.  Land area covered by buildings. 
b.  Proposed street rights-of-way, public or private.

The aggregate open space of the planned development, including any proposed roads, shall be no less than would have resulted from the application of the existing open space requirements of the district. Up to 20 percent of the land currently zoned C-1 or wetlands may be used in this open space computation. 
(Code 1997, § 17.79; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-268. - Maintenance of project. 
(a)  Should the owner of a planned development fail to properly operate or maintain the project or premises to the extent that a nuisance is caused to occupants or neighbors or constitutes a nuisance to nearby properties, the city may refuse to approve subsequent stages of development until the situation and/or method of operation has been corrected. 
(b)  Should the owner of a planned development fail to adequately perform maintenance functions, such as snow and ice removal, weed cutting or trash disposal, the city shall have the right to perform such functions or to contract for their accomplishment at the expense of the owner of the planned development. 
(c)  The care and maintenance of common open space shall be insured either by establishment of appropriate management organization for the project or by an agreement with the city for establishment of a special district for the project area on the basis of which the city shall provide the necessary maintenance service and levy the costs thereof as a special assessment on the tax bills of the properties within the project area. In any case, the city shall have the right to carry out and levy an assessment for the cost of any maintenance which it feels necessary if it is not otherwise taken care of to the satisfaction of the city. 
(Code 1997, § 17.80; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-269. - Changes or revisions. 
(a)  All changes, revisions or additions to any aspect of an approved planned development project shall be submitted to the plan commission for their review.

(Code 1997, § 17.81; Rep. and Recr. #411; Rep. & Recr. #646)  
Sec. 52-270. - Relationship to subdivision control chapter. 
(a)  Any planned development which initially involves a division of land or any successive division of land shall be subject to the regulations of chapter 44, pertaining to subdivisions. 
(b)  However, the design standards and required improvements in chapter 44 may be modified or waived upon recommendation by the plan commission and approval by the common council where strict compliance may result in not achieving the design flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of the planned development. 
(Code 1997, § 17.82; Rep. and Recr. #411)  
Sec. 52-271. - Failure to comply. 
Failure to comply with the conditions and restrictions as herein established and specifically made applicable to a specific planned development shall be cause for termination of the approval for such project. At least 15 days' notice shall be given to the developer to appear before the plan commission and answer any such charges of noncompliance. If the plan commission finds the charges substantiated, they may recommend such termination of the project approval if the situation is not satisfactorily adjusted within a specified period.

Such board shall adopt rules, meet, hear and determine appeals as prescribed by law and shall have all of the powers conferred thereon by the provisions of any statute, law, rule or ordinance now existing or hereafter created including, but not limited to, the power in appropriate cases of appeal and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, to make special exceptions to the terms of this section or of any such ordinance hereafter adopted in harmony with the general purposes and intent of such ordinance and in accordance with general or specific rules therein contained. Such exceptions or variances may be granted upon the determination by such board that the same will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the terms of the ordinance will result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
(2)  General. All members of the board shall reside within the city. The actual and necessary expense incurred by the board in performance of its duties shall be paid and allowed as in cases of other claims against the city. 
(b)  Rules. 
(1)  Cooperation with plan commission. The board shall keep the plan commission informed as to any matters brought before it and shall call upon the plan commission for such information as is pertinent to the matter under consideration. 
(2)  Rules and procedures. The board shall adopt such rules governing its procedure as it may deem appropriate and consistent with this chapter, but such rules shall provide: 
a.  All meetings of such board shall be open to the public. 
b.  Proper minutes of the proceedings of the board shall be regularly kept, indicating members present, members voting, ayes and nays individually and a synopsis of testimony, appearances and interlocutory rulings made in the course of its proceedings. Final orders shall be set forth at length. 
c.  Before any appeal shall be scheduled or advertised for public hearing, complete data and information respecting the proposed structure, alteration, use or other variance, including detailed plot plans demonstrating the relation of the proposal to surrounding lands within 100 feet of the site, shall be filed in writing with the board and shall be available for public inspection. If amendment of such specifications is thereafter submitted or if the variance to be granted differs materially from such specifications, any objector shall be entitled upon demand in writing within ten days of the filing of any order granting a variance to have the matter readvertised and reheard. 
d.  If the variance sought differs in any material respect from the proposal presented to the original officer, commission or board whose decision is appealed from, no variance shall be granted unless the proposal has been resubmitted to such original authority. 
e.  Orders reversing in any degree or respect the prior determination of an original administrative authority shall not of themselves constitute an authorization to proceed with any construction, use or occupancy, but such orders shall be remanded to the appropriate original authority for action consistent with their expressed terms. No reversal shall arise from any such orders by implication. 
(c)  Appeal. 
(1)  Appeal rights. Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officers, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of any administrative official, provided such appeal be initiated by written notice filed with such officer or board within not to exceed 20 days of such decision. Such notice of appeal shall specify the particular grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board of appeals all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(2)  Stay. An appeal shall stay all rights, privileges or proceedings pursuant to the action appealed from, unless the officer from whose decision the appeal is taken certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and in due cause shown. 
(3)  Hearing. Each appeal shall be heard within 40 days from the time the appeal was filed with the board. Notice of hearing shall be given by publishing in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the appeal at least two times within 30 days and not less than ten days before the date of hearing. In addition, written notice shall be given to the plan commission, any other administrative officer appealed from, the petitioner, city clerk, owners of each parcel of land adjoining the land in question, and any other specifically interested parties who have filed as such in the matter. If the appeal involves a lot or parcel of land, any part of which is in a designated floodplain area (see floodplain zoning regulations in chapter 16, article II) or is zoned RL-1, RL-1A or RL-2 or a text or map interpretation affecting the same, the southeast district office of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources shall be given ten days' prior written notification. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. 
(4)  Decision. The decision on any appeal shall be made within 15 days after completion of the hearing thereon. If the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources was notified of the hearing in accordance with the above provisions, it shall be notified of the decision. Copies of the decision shall be sent to the department within ten days after the appeal was granted or denied. If no decision is filed in the records of the board within such time, the order appealed shall stand affirmed. 
(5)  Certiorari. After determination of an appeal relative to a given application, recourse may be had to certiorari as provided by law. But no right of appeal shall lie upon any subsequent application, which is substantially similar, to object to any matter determined upon a prior appeal, unless there shall have intervened a substantial change of material circumstances affecting the determination. 
(6)  Concurrence for reversal. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative official or board or to effect any exception or variation in such ordinance. The grounds of every such determination shall be stated herein. 
(d)  Yard and open space variance. Variances granted by the board of appeals may not exceed 40 percent of any one or more of the above requirements which are not met. The following conditions must be met in order for a variance to be granted: 
(1)  On or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the owner of the lot in question did not own lands contiguous to the lot in question, which have since been divided into separate ownership. 
(2)  The applicant for the variance has offered in good faith to purchase at a fair price adjacent lands to minimize the degree of variance, unless such offer, if made, would obviously be useless or unavailing. 
(3)  It is impractical from an engineering standpoint, as distinguished from a financial standpoint, to reduce or eliminate the degree of nonconformity by eliminating or relocating the proposed building, use, or occupancy. 
(Code 1997, § 17.84; Rep. and Recr. #411; Am. #719 )  
Sec. 52-292. - Administration of building permits and occupancy permits. 
(a)  Building permit. 
(1)  Required. No building, structure, or part thereof shall hereafter be built, enlarged, altered or demolished within the city or moved into, within or out of the city nor shall any work be commenced on any such project until a building permit has been issued by the building inspector pursuant to application as prescribed herein, certifying that such building or structure as proposed would be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and with chapter 8, article II. See article II of this chapter for site plan requirements, if applicable. 
(2)  Procedure. An application for a building permit shall be made in conformity with requirements of chapter 8, article II. 
(3)  Exception. No building permit shall be required for public utility transmission or distribution facilities. 
(4)  Building previously unoccupied, bond required. No building permit shall be issued to erect, structurally alter or relocate any building which is unoccupied at the time that application is made unless the applicant tenders a cash bond as established in section 8-22, which such cash bond shall be immediately forfeited to the city in the event that such building is occupied prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit as is further provided in this section. This requirement applies only to buildings which exceed 750 square feet in size, whether intended for human occupancy or not. 
(b)  Certificate of occupancy permit. 
(1)  Required. No building previously unoccupied shall be used or occupied until a certificate of occupancy permit has been issued certifying that any such building, use, or occupancy complies with the provisions of this chapter. A like permit shall be obtained before any change is made in the use relevant to zoning classification or before any legal nonconforming use is resumed, changed, extended or granted conditional use status. 
(2)  Procedure. 
a.  Application for a certificate of occupancy permit shall be made to the building inspector prior to occupancy or prior to the commencement of any use not involving a building permit. Such application shall be made on a checklist form provided by the building inspector. 
b.  After the issuance of a building permit and within ten days after notification of the completion of the erection, alteration or relocation of the building or structure or of intent to commence a use, the building inspector shall make an inspection of the premises and of any building thereon. If the building and the existing and proposed uses of the premises comply with the requirements of this chapter, a certificate of occupancy permit shall be issued. No permit shall be issued until exterior work, plumbing, heating, electrical, sanitary installations are complete and until interior surfaces are structurally complete. Exterior work shall include erosion control conditions or measures that have been determined to be necessary by the city. If, after inspection, there are erosion control concerns, these must be addressed by the lot owner within seven calendar days after written notice is issued by the city. In the instances where damage or harm to adjacent public or private property could occur due to improper or lack of adequate erosion control, the time frame for correction after written notice shall be reduced to 24 hours. If the situation is not corrected within said time frames, the city has the authority and right to correct the situation, and deduct all costs and expenses from the cash bond that has been deposited per section 8-22. If adequate funds are not available, then the costs and expenses shall be entered on the tax roll as a special assessment against the property and collected in conjunction with any and all other taxes levied on said property. 
(3)  Water supply for occupied buildings. Prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for all buildings intended for human occupancy and constructed after the date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, satisfactory evidence of a safe and adequate supply of pure water must be furnished to the building inspector, unless connection is to be made to a city water system. The evidence submitted to the building inspector shall include, in addition to the water quality information, the location of the proposed well and the distance from the proposed well to any septic system, building or other well located or proposed to be located within 100 feet. 
(4)  Expiration. If within six months of the date of application no certificate of occupancy permit has been issued, any building permit related thereto shall lapse and the building inspector shall make immediate investigation to ascertain that no use of occupancy has in fact commenced without proper authority. Upon determining that interruption of construction, if any, is temporary and will probably not extend beyond 60 additional days, the building inspector may grant successive extensions of such permit for successive periods not to exceed three months each. 
(c)  Temporary occupancy permit. 
(1)  Pending the issuance of a regular certificate of occupancy permit, a temporary permit may be issued for a period not exceeding six months during the completion of alterations or during partial occupancy of a building pending its permanent occupation. Such temporary permit shall not be issued, except under such restrictions and provisions as will adequately insure the safety of the occupants, and in any event will not be issued until the complete plumbing and electrical wiring and outlets are installed and approved and the plastering, if any, and outside wall insulation are complete. A temporary permit shall be voided if the building fails to conform to the provisions of this chapter to such a degree as to render it unsafe for the occupancy proposed. No premises shall be rented out to tenants under a temporary occupancy permit. If a site plan is required, the regulations of section 52-59 regarding temporary occupancy permits are applicable. 
(2)  No temporary occupancy permit shall be issued unless a cash bond in the sum of $250.00 for any existing building and $500.00 for any new building has been tendered to the city by the applicant. In the event that an applicant shall have already tendered a $500.00 cash bond with subsection (a) of this section, then, in that event, an additional $500.00 cash bond shall be required if such applicant applies for a temporary occupancy permit pursuant to this subsection (c). Any cash bonds required by this subsection shall be immediately forfeited to the city if any such new building or additions or alterations to any existing building fail to conform to the provisions of this chapter or chapter 8, article II, within six months of the time that a temporary occupancy permit is issued. 
(d)  Building permit fees. Fees as from time to time set by the common council by resolution shall be paid to the building inspector before any building permit is issued. Whenever any work is commenced prior to obtaining a permit from the building inspector, the person on whose property such work has been commenced shall be liable for double the fees.
