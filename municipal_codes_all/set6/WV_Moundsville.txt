EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

the Adopting Ordinance.  Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any
history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance.  In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the  Moundsville Codified Ordinances is indicated.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The revised Employee Policy Regulations were adopted by an
ordinance passed March 6, 2012.
This Employee Handbook is designed to provide you with information about
working conditions, employee benefits, and some of the policies affecting your
employment.  You should read, understand and comply with all provisions of this
handbook.  It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and
outlines programs developed by the City of Moundsville to benefit employees.
THIS HANDBOOK IS NOT INTENDED TO BE OR TO CREATE A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT.  THE
EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP OF EACH EMPLOYEE IS "AT-WILL."  "AT-WILL"  MEANS THAT
EMPLOYMENT IS FOR NO DEFINITE PERIOD AND IS TERMINABLE AT ANY TIME AT THE WILL
OF THE CITY OF MOUNDSVILLE OR THE EMPLOYEE WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE, CAUSE OR
COMPENSATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EMPLOYEES COVERED BY WV CIVIL SERVICE LAWS.
No handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about policy.  As the
City of  Moundsville continues to grow, the need may arise and the City of 
Moundsville reserves the right to revise, supplement or rescind any policies or
portion of this handbook from time to time as it deems appropriate, at its sole
and absolute discretion.  The only exception to any changes is our employment-
at-will policy permitting you or the City of Moundsville to end our
relationship for any reason at any time.  Employees will, of course, be
notified of any changes to this handbook as they occur.
This handbook includes general information about certain employee benefit plans
that is based upon official texts, which are controlling in case of question or
inconsistency.
This handbook will now be the formal guideline for all employment related
matters and supersedes all previous employee handbooks, guidelines or practices
used by the leadership of the City of Moundsville.  In the future, the only
recognized deviations from the policies stated in this handbook are those
authorized and signed by the Governing Body of the City of Moundsville.  We
hope you will feel free to pose any questions as well as to bring to us any
suggestions that might be beneficial in making your years of employment with
the City of  Moundsville rewarding.

EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM
155.01  PURPOSE; RESPONSIBILITIES; FORMAT; EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (a)   Introduction and General Information. This is an article to provide
for personnel policies, procedures, and programs in the City of Moundsville. Be
it ordained by the Council of the City of Moundsville, West Virginia, that an
article providing for Personnel Policies, Procedures, and Programs in the City
Government be enacted to read as follows.
   (b)   Purpose of The Personnel Policies Manual. The purpose of this article
is to provide basic personnel policies and establish responsibility for the
implementation and administration of a well balanced personnel management
program designed to ensure to the City a stable, productive and economical
workforce essential to the effective delivery of public services. The City's
philosophy as an employer encompasses a wide range of objectives. Of particular
importance is the City's desire to provide a stimulating, productive work
environment which encourages each employee to reach his or her full potential
within the organization. Additionally, the City must continually monitor and
search for ways in which to control costs while effectively fulfilling the
mission with which it is charged. The City recognizes that this can be
accomplished only through the dedication and perseverance of its employees. It
is the City's intent to protect the investment made in its employees by
providing challenging work, involving employees in the decision-making process,
promoting from within when possible, training employees to enhance work skills,
and maintaining a safe work environment. The City is committed to accomplishing
these objectives without regard to race, color, sex, religion, national origin,
or handicap.
   (c)   Applicability. The personnel policies set forth shall apply to all
positions and employees (General Fund and Grant Funded) of the City of
Moundsville, West Virginia, except:  members of Council; the City Manager, and
other special or unusual situations where, in the opinion of the City Manager
and Council, applicability of this article would not be in the best interest of
the City.
   (d)   Responsibilities.
      (1)   City Manager. The City Manager shall have final authority for
administration of this article.
         A.    Recommending and selecting applicants for employment and
assigning duties and responsibilities to employees.
         B.    Approving promotions, demotions, reassignments, and separations,
when recommended by department heads.
         C.    Establishing job requirements, evaluating conduct and
performance, and maintaining discipline.
         D.    Identifying training and development needs and conducting on-the
job training (OJT) whenever necessary and appropriate.
      (2)    Department heads.
         A.    Department heads will process all new employees on their first
day of duty, assuring that all necessary information is obtained from the
employee and that all required employment forms are completed.
   (e)   Format and Maintenance of The Personnel Policies Manual. This article
and its accompanying administrative instructions will be maintained and issued
by the City Manager. The Personnel Policies Manual shall contain the policies
adopted by the City Council together with any administrative instructions
necessary for their implementation. Administrative instructions will follow and
be referenced to applicable sections of the article. Administrative
instructions which address situations unique to only one or several departments
or groups of employees (e.g., uniformed Police and Fire employees), will be
maintained by the City Manager and distributed to only those departments
concerned. Department heads may issue departmental rules and regulations
necessary for the efficient functioning of their departments; however, such
rules and regulations shall not be in conflict with any portion of this
article. Department heads shall submit new or revised departmental rules and
regulations to the City Manager for review prior to issuance.
   (f)   Effective Date. This article shall take effect immediately and shall
supersede all ordinances, previous personnel policies, procedures, and programs
for the City of Moundsville, West Virginia. Further, this article shall
supersede any Council Resolution or City administrative and/or procedural
instruction or ruling in conflict with any of its provisions. 
155.02  AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT.
   This manual does not represent an employment contract between the City of
Moundsville and its employees.  The policies contained herein are for
information purposes only and may be changed by the City at its sole
discretion.  The City is not bound by any oral promises concerning employee's
length of employment or conditions of employment.  The policies and procedures
set forth in this manual, then, are for the purposes of providing employees
general information and guidelines about the City's operating policies
concerning employment matters.
   Employees are "at-will" employees.
   Definition of "at-will":  Employee may resign at any time and the Employer
may discharge employee at any time with or without cause. (Ord.3/6/12)
155.03  EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER.
   In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all
individuals, employment decisions at the City of Moundsville will be based on
merit, qualifications, and abilities.  The City of Moundsville does not
discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, citizenship,
marital status, sexual orientation, political affiliation or belief, familial
status, genetic information, or any another other classification protected by
local, state, or federal law.
   The City of Moundsville is committed to a continuing program of assuring
that unlawful discrimination does not occur in any program or activity funded
in whole or in part with funds made available by local, state, or federal
government.
155.04  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT POLICY STATEMENT.
   The City of Moundsville will make reasonable accommodations for qualified
individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue
hardship.  This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection,
job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination and access to benefits
and training.  Pre-employment inquiries are made only regarding an applicant's
ability to perform the duties of the position.
   Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other
forms of compensation (or changes in compensation) as well as in job
assignments, classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions,
lines of progression, and seniority lists.  Leave of all types will be
available to all employees on an equal basis.
   The City of Moundsville is also committed to not discriminating against any
qualified employees or applicants because they are related to or associated
with a person with disability.
   Any employees with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in
the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of
management.  Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of
reprisal.  Anyone found to be engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination
will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
employment.
   This policy is neither exhaustive nor inclusive.  The City of Moundsville is
committed to taking any and all available options to ensure equal opportunity
for all persons in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local
laws. (Ord.3/6/12)
155.05  EMPLOYEE RELATIONS; CONDUCT; POLITICAL ACTIVITY; DISCIPLINE.
   (a)   Employee Relations Philosophy. The City Manager and his/her
subordinate managers and supervisors at all levels (hereinafter referred to as
"management") are responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an
effective, efficient, and productive working relationship with City employees.
As a matter of policy, management shall expect a high level of production;
shall ensure that employees are aware of, and meet, their obligations; and
shall respect the rights and dignity of individuals. Managers shall maintain a
work environment which is conducive to a motivated and cooperative workforce.
The mutually free exchange of information and ideas between management and
employees is essential to the development and maintenance of a cooperative and
productive workforce. Management is responsible for furnishing, through
appropriate supervisory channels and appropriate communication media, all
information needed by employees to do their work and to understand their rights
and obligations. Management shall solicit and consider the opinions, ideas, and
attitudes of employees in formulating and changing employment practices which
affect their interest.
   Management shall carefully evaluate and give prompt consideration to
employee proposals, suggestions, and complaints. The informal daily on-the-job
contact between supervisors and employees is the basic level of communication
and shall be used to the maximum by management to develop the free exchange of
information, ideas, and opinions. More formal methods such as bulletin boards,
employee newsletters, employee handbooks, group meetings, etc., shall be
developed by the City Manager based on the need of such methods to further the
objective of open communication.
   The City of Moundsville believes that the work conditions, wages, and
benefits it offers to its employees are competitive with those offered by other
employers in this area and in the industry.  If employees have concerns about
work conditions or compensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice these
concerns openly and directly to management. (Ord. 3/6/12)
   (b)   Standards of Conduct.  Standards of conduct are designed to protect
the well-being and rights of all employees; to ensure a safe, efficient
government; to ensure compliance with the law; and to better ensure
accomplishment of the City's personnel management program objectives. While it
is impractical to list every aspect of behavior which is or is not appropriate,
City employees are expected to be guided by standards typical of those that
guide people anywhere in a business relationship. The following general rules
of conduct shall apply:
      (1)    No employee shall engage in any outside employment or other
activity (paid or otherwise) which interferes in any way with the full
performance of his/her official duties and responsibilities with the city.
      (2)    No employee shall use or allow the use of City property of any
kind (including motor vehicles) for other than official City business.
      (3)    No employee shall use or allow the use of official information
gained through his/her employment for furthering his/her private interest.
      (4)    No employee shall participate in any gambling activity of any kind
while on duty or while on City owned or leased property.
      (5)    No employee shall engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, or
other conduct prejudicial to the interests of the City of Moundsville
(including but not limited to fighting, sleeping on job, etc.)
      (6)    No employee shall accept any gift, favor, service, or other thing
of substantial value under circumstances from which it might be reasonably
inferred that such gift, favor, service, or thing of value was given or offered
for the purpose of influencing him/her in the discharge of his/her official
duties. Refer to WV Ethics Commission Laws for explanation of acceptable gifts
and guidelines.
      (7)    No employee or applicant shall make any false statements or
perform any other fraudulent act in connection with any examination,
certification, or appointment under the provisions of this article or any
administrative instructions issued for its implementation.
      (8)    No employee or applicant shall give, render, pay, offer, solicit,
or accept any money, service, or other valuable consideration for or on account
of any appointment, promotion or proposed promotion or any advantage in
employment with the City of Moundsville.
      (9)    All employees shall be present for duty and perform effectively
during all of their regularly scheduled tours of duty, except when excused for
reasons acceptable to their supervisor.
      (10)    All employees shall observe and comply with all safety rules (to
include the use of required safety clothing, shoes, and equipment) prescribed
by management for their job and/or work areas.
      (11)    All employees shall support their supervisors, and conduct
themselves in a courteous and polite manner in all dealings with their fellow
employees, their supervisors, and the general public.
      (12)    All employees shall observe and comply with any special rules
established by their department head for their particular work situation.
      (13)    No employee shall report to work while under the influence of
illegal controlled substances or alcohol. No employee may use, conceal or carry
any illegal controlled substance or any type of alcohol while on duty for the
City of Moundsville or while on City property.
      (14)    No employee shall engage in "horseplay" or practical jokes that
may be considered harmful to other employees.
      (15)   No employee of the City shall demonstrate or engage in any act
that may be considered, under normal standards, as an act of insubordination.
      (16)    No employee of the City shall engage in any act of sexual
harassment toward any other employee or person.
      (17)    No employee shall engage in any type of sexual activity while on
duty for the City of Moundsville or while on City property.
      (18)    No employee of the City may use, conceal, or carry upon their
person any illegal or deadly weapon unless they are duly authorized by the City
of Moundsville and by general law.
      (19)    Any employee that violates or breaches any "Standard of Conduct"
of the City of Moundsville may be discharged immediately or otherwise
disciplined appropriately by his/her immediate supervisor or by the City
Manager without recourse. This list is provided merely as an example of types
of behavior which violate appropriate standards of conduct. It is not
exhaustive. Conduct not listed, but which the City finds violates appropriate
business or governmental standards, may result in discipline or discharge
without recourse.
   (c)   Political Activity. An employee shall not directly or indirectly use
or seek to use his/her authority or the influence of his/her position to
control or modify the political action of another person. An employee shall not
engage in political activity during hours of duty.
   (d)   Public Statements. All employees may speak and/or write on issues of
public importance. However, false statements knowingly or recklessly made,
statements which impede the employee's proper performance of his/her assigned
duties, and statements which interfere with the operation of the City
generally, are prohibited.
   (e)   Maintaining Discipline.  Discipline shall be constructive in nature,
having the basic objective of correcting and rehabilitating rather than
punishing and penalizing. Management at all levels shall maintain a positive
environment through good leadership and direction, consistent practices, and
recognition of the rights and dignity of employees. Managers and supervisors
shall inform employees of established standards of conduct and of their
obligation to observe them. Employees shall observe such standards and at all
times conduct themselves in a manner as to reflect credit upon themselves and
the City of Moundsville. Penalties for breach of standards shall be promptly
and fairly administered without discrimination after full consideration of all
available facts. With due regard to all surrounding circumstances, like
penalties shall be imposed for like offenses. Authority to initiate
disciplinary actions shall be delegated to first line supervisors subject to
review and approval by the department head. Notices proposing the penalties of
suspension or dismissal, as well as notices of final decision regarding such
penalties, shall be coordinated with the City Manager prior to issuance, and
shall be signed by the appropriate department head.
   Incidents sometimes occur which are of such a dangerous or serious nature
that immediate corrective action must be taken by management. Such cases
generally involve real or potential hazards to life and/or property or
significant disruption of the City's mission. In these cases an employee may be
excused from duty for the purpose of removing that employee from the work area.
The supervisor must then advise his/her department head or other immediate
superior of the situation as soon as possible after the incident takes place.
At the department head's discretion, the employee's absence may be charged to
sick leave, LWOP, or administrative leave, whichever is appropriate. The
employee must be advised within a reasonable time of any disciplinary action to
be taken against him/her as a result of the incident.
   (f)   Authorized Disciplinary Actions.
      (1)    Verbal warning. A conference between the supervisor and the
employee to discuss the offense committed and the corrective action expected.
No formal procedure shall be required to effect this action, except that the
supervisor shall make an entry of the verbal warning on the Supervisor's Record
of Employee prescribed by the City Manager.
      (2)    Reprimand. A letter from the supervisor to the employee
identifying significant misconduct. A copy of such letter of reprimand shall be
made a part of the employee's official personnel folder maintained by the City
Manager.
      (3)    Suspension. Places the employee in a non-pay non-duty status.
Since management is penalized by losing the employee's service during the
period of suspension, it should only be imposed when a lesser penalty clearly
would not prove sufficient and when dismissal is obviously too stringent.
         A.    Suspension of Employees Subject to Normal Overtime Provisions.
Suspension shall be expressed in working days, and the maximum suspension shall
be thirty (30) work days.
         B.    Suspension of Employees Exempt From Overtime Under FLSA.
Employees classified as exempt from overtime may be suspended only in full
workweek increments, up to a maximum suspension of six work weeks. Such
employees may not be suspended for part of a week or for part of a day for any
reason. In addition, such employees must serve their suspensions on consecutive
days, and the suspensions must commence at the beginning of the work week.
(Examples: Such employees cannot serve one work week suspension every Tuesday
for five consecutive weeks nor can they commence service of the suspension on a
Thursday and end the following Wednesday.)
   (g)   Table of Disciplinary Infractions and Penalties.
      (1)   Establishing the penalty. When establishing a disciplinary penalty,
the supervisor and/or department head should take into consideration a number
of different factors. First, the character, seriousness, and consequences of
the infraction must be considered. Next, such issues as mitigating
circumstances and the possibility of genuine misunderstanding on the employee's
part should be examined. The employee's past record and length of service play
a role in assessing the penalty. Considerations which tend to show a need for
more severe actions are previous offenses, their character and recency being
prime considerations. Cumulative unrelated offenses may tend to indicate a need
for serious corrective action by management. This list of factors is not
exhaustive and other relevant factors may figure into the penalty determination
as well.
      (2)   Requests for removal of disciplinary actions from personnel files.
Department heads may, upon making written request to the City Manager and
receiving approval by the City Manager, remove written records of disciplinary
actions from the personnel files of employees under their supervision after
three years from the date of discipline.
155.06  ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY.
   State and federal laws protect employees from discrimination and harassment
based on certain characteristics, such as color, religion/creed, sex, national
origin, age, disability, citizenship, marital status, sexual orientation,
political affiliation or belief, familial status, genetic information, or
disability. In its Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission states that sexual harassment is an unlawful
employment practice. The purpose of this policy is to unequivocally set forth
the City's position regarding sexual and any other form of illegal harassment
and procedures to be implemented in order to carry out this policy. The City
requires all employees to refrain from conduct that subjects other employees to
any form of illegal harassment, including sexual harassment.
   The City is committed to providing a work environment free of any form of
illegal harassment including sexual harassment.  Illegal harassment consists of
comments or behavior, including but not limited to actions, words, jokes, or
comments, that are based on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, citizenship, marital status, sexual orientation, political
affiliation or belief, familial status, genetic information, or disability or
any other classification protected by local, state, or federal law.
   As an example, sexual harassment (both overt and subtle) is a form of
employee misconduct that is demeaning to another person, undermines the
integrity of the employment relationship, and is strictly prohibited.  Sexual
harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors,
and/or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. The City of
Moundsville employees are prohibited from engaging in any such conduct.
   While the City of Moundsville encourages individuals who believe they are
being unlawfully harassed to notify the offender firmly and promptly that his
or her behavior is unwelcome, we also recognize that power and status
disparities between an alleged harasser and a target of harassment may make
such a confrontation impossible.  In the event that such informal, direct
communication between individuals is either ineffective or impossible, then any
such conduct should be reported immediately to the employee's department head. 
If the department head is unavailable or the employee believes it would be
inappropriate to contact that person, the employee should immediately contact
the City Manager or the Mayor.
   Any department head or other supervisory employee who receives notice of a
complaint or who learns of an incident of alleged harassment, sexual or
otherwise, is required to promptly report the incident to the City Manager or
the Mayor to allow the complaint to be properly and promptly investigated.
   Investigations of complaints of sexual or other unlawful harassment and/or
discrimination shall promptly be conducted by a person designated by the City
Manager or Mayor.  All employees are expected to cooperate and provide truthful
information in the context of such an investigation. Investigations are kept
confidential to the extent possible under the circumstances.  When an
appropriate investigation is completed, the City Manager or Mayor shall
evaluate the situation and direct what responsive action, if any, shall be
taken.
   Under no circumstances shall an employee's job security or promotional
opportunities be jeopardized because of making a complaint under this section
or because of his or her willingness otherwise to assist in the identification
of employees in violation of this section.  The City shall not tolerate
retaliation or reprisal against an employee based upon the employee making a
good faith complaint of conduct in violation of this section or based upon the
employee cooperating in an investigation of any such complaint.
   Anyone found to be engaging in or to have engaged in sexual or other
unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
immediate termination of employment.
   Grievances related to sexual harassment. In addition, employees may use the
City's Grievance Procedure for relief from acts of sexual or other forms of
harassment. Grievances will be forwarded to the City Manager by the individual
receiving the grievance in accordance with Section
155.07. The department head or other appropriate official shall perform an
investigation prior to the third step grievance meeting.
   Responsibility for policy administration. The City Manager and Department
Heads are responsible for the administration of this policy. Employees or
applicants for employment who have questions regarding this policy should
contact their Department Head or the City Manager. Department Heads  shall
ensure that copies of this policy are posted throughout the workplace. (Ord.8/
19/03)
155.07  GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES.
   (a)   General Policies. Prompt and objective review of employee
dissatisfactions and sincere attempts to resolve them in an equitable manner
are essential to productive and mutually beneficial employee-management
relationships. Employees shall have an opportunity to express their
dissatisfactions and to have their views on matters related to employment and
working conditions promptly and fully considered. Every reasonable effort shall
be made to resolve employee complaints and grievances on an informal basis at
the lowest level of management possible. Therefore, both supervisors and
employees are expected to work together for the achievement of this objective.
Professional members of the City Manager's staff shall be available to provide
advice and assistance to both management and employees at any stage of these
procedures in their efforts to resolve their differences on the issues under
consideration. The procedures contained herein provide the principles and
instructions for presenting, considering, and resolving grievances. The
presentation of a grievance shall not, in itself, be considered as reflecting
unfavorably on the employee's good standing, loyalty, or his/her value to the
City of Moundsville. Therefore, an employee shall be free to pursue the
procedures without fear of restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination,
or reprisal on the part of management at any level.
   All stages of the grievance shall be in writing on forms supplied by the
City Manager. At the first and second steps, the only persons who may be
present at the grievance  meetings are the grievant, the appropriate manager at
the level at which the grievance is being heard, and appropriate witnesses for
each side. At the third step, the grievant, at his or her option, may have
present a representative of his or her choice. Personal face-to-face meetings
are required at all steps of the Grievance Procedure. Beyond the second step
both the grievant and the respondent may call upon appropriate witnesses and
may be represented by counsel. The grievant's representative, if one is chosen,
shall be designated by the employee in writing at the time he/she presents the
grievance in writing under appropriate procedures. If the employee is
represented by an attorney, it shall be at his/her own expense. This
designation shall be changed only by written notification to the official
considering the grievance, signed by the employee concerned. As the grievance
moves through the levels of appeal, an employee may not materially change the
basic nature or content of his/her grievance after it is reduced to writing,
nor may he/she change the relief sought.
   (b)   Definition of a Grievance. A grievance shall be a complaint or dispute
by a permanent employee relating to his or her employment regarding the
following issues:
      (1)    Working conditions that affect the safety of an employee; and
      (2)    The interpretation, application, or meaning of these personnel
policy regulations.
   No other issues shall be grievable, including but not limited to the
discipline, hiring, and dismissal of employees.
   (c)   Grievability.  The issue of grievability may occur at any step of the
procedure prior to the Council hearing, but once raised the issue must be
formally resolved as provided herein before further processing of the
grievance. In all cases, the issue of grievability must be resolved prior to
the Council hearing or it shall be deemed to have been waived by management and
the grievance shall be processed to conclusion. The grievant shall have fifteen
(15) calendar days to appeal a decision of non-grievability prior to the
Council hearing step of the procedure. Such appeal must be in writing and
directed to the City Manager.
   Decisions of the City Manager may be appealed by the grievant to the City
Council for a hearing de novo on the issue of grievability. Proceedings for
review of the decision of the City Manager shall be instituted by filing a
notice of appeal with the City Manager within fifteen (15) calendar days from
the date of receipt of the decision and giving a copy thereof to all other
parties. Within fifteen (15) calendar days thereafter, the City Manager shall
transmit to the City Council to which the appeal is taken: a copy of the
decision of the City Manager, a copy of the notice of appeal, and the exhibits.
A list of the evidence furnished to the Council shall also be furnished to the
grievant.
   Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such records by the Clerk, the Council
shall hear the appeal on the record transmitted by the agency head and such
additional evidence as may be necessary to resolve any controversy as to the
correctness of the record. The Council may affirm the decision of the City
Manager or may reverse or modify the decision. The decision of the Council
shall be rendered no later than the fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of
the conclusion of the hearing. The decision of the Council is final and is not
appealable. The classification of a complaint as non-grievable shall not be
construed to restrict any employee's right to seek or management's right to
provide customary administrative review of complaints outside of the scope of
the grievance procedure.
   (d)   Management Rights. Nothing in this procedure is intended to
circumscribe or modify the existing management right of the City of Moundsville
to do the following:
      (1)    Direct the work of its employees, as well as establish and revise
wages, salaries, position classifications, and general benefits;
      (2)   Hire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain employees within the
City organization;
      (3)   Maintain the efficiency of City governmental operations;
      (4)   Relieve employees from duties with the City in emergencies;
      (5)   Determine the methods, means, and personnel by which operations are
to be carried out.
   (e)   Coverage of Personnel.  All permanent employees who have completed the
City's prescribed introductory period are eligible to file grievances except
the City Manager, department heads, the City Attorney, and any other employees
who may be excluded. The City Manager shall maintain an up-to-date list of the
employees excluded from the grievance procedure.
   (f)   Relief Sought. Once an employee reduces his/her grievance to writing
he/she must specify on the appropriate form the specific relief he/she expects
to obtain through use of this procedure and the relief sought shall be personal
to the grievant (i.e., the relief sought may not be the dismissal or
disciplining of another employee). The relief sought must be consistent with
those issues determined to be grievable under this procedure and may not be in
conflict with the management rights contained in this article.
   The employee may accept the relief granted at any step of the procedure and
his/her grievance shall be considered resolved. However, prior to reaching the
grievance panel, if the employee finds any part of the relief granted
unacceptable, he/she must advance the entire grievance and remedy sought to the
next step of the procedure. The decision of the grievance panel shall be final
and binding.
   (g)   Failure to Comply With Procedural Requirements. After the initial
filing of a written grievance, failure by either party to comply with all
substantial requirements of the grievance procedure, including the City Council
hearing, without just cause will result in a decision in favor of the other
party on any grievable issue, provided the party not in compliance fails to
correct the non-compliance within five (5) working days of receipt of written
notification by the other party of the compliance violation. Such written
notification by the grievant shall be made to the City Manager. The City
Manager, or his/her designee, may require a clear written explanation of the
basis for just cause extensions or exceptions. The City Manager, or his/her
designee, shall determine compliance issues. Compliance determinations made by
the City Manager shall be subject to judicial review by filing petition with
the City Council within thirty days of the compliance determination.
   (h)   Remedial Action. When a grievance is resolved in favor of the
employee, appropriate remedial action shall be taken promptly to the degree
permitted by law and regulation as interpreted by the City Manager.
   (i)   Cancellation of a Grievance. A grievance under investigation or review
shall be canceled by the official considering it upon receipt of an employee's
written request, upon notification that the remedy sought has been granted,
when the employee does not furnish required information according to the
compliance requirements in subsection (f) hereof and duly proceeds with the
advancement of his/her case, upon death of the employee, or his/her separation
from employment for reasons not connected with the grievance. The canceling
official shall promptly notify all parties, including the City Manager, in
writing of his/her action to include the reasons for the cancellation.
   (j)   Extension of Prescribed Time Limits. The parties to the grievance, by
mutual agreement, may extend any or all of the time periods established in this
procedure up to and through the third (3rd) step. The City Council, on their
own recognizance, or at the request of either party to the grievance, may
extend any or all of the prescribed time periods applicable after the grievance
is received by the City Council from the City Manager.
   (k)   Steps in The Grievance Procedure.
      (1)    First Step - Supervisor level. An employee who has a grievance
shall discuss the problem directly with his/her immediate supervisor where
applicable and the grievance need not be reduced to writing until this step has
been completed. It is incumbent upon the employee at Step 1 of the procedure to
inform the supervisor of his/her intention to formally grieve. An employee's
problem does not become an official grievance for the purpose of this procedure
until the employee identifies it as such to the supervisor. The supervisor
shall give the employee his/her verbal response with respect to the grievance
within fifteen (15) calendar days after its presentation. A grievance must be
initiated within seven (7) calendar days of the occurrence or condition giving
rise to the alleged problem.
      (2)    Second Step - Department head level. If the grievance is not
resolved at the first step, the employee shall have fifteen (15) calendar days
to reduce his/her grievance to writing on a Second Step Grievance Form obtained
from the City Manager. The fully completed grievance form shall be delivered by
the grievant to his/her immediate supervisor or department head.  The immediate
supervisor and/or the department head shall meet with the grievant within
fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the grievance form. A written reply to
the grievance signed by the department head shall be provided to the employee
within fifteen (15) calendar days after the second step meeting.
      (3)   Third Step - City Manager level. If the department head's reply
from the second step meeting is not acceptable to the grievant, he/she shall
have fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the department head's reply to
complete, in writing, a Third Step Grievance Form obtained from the City
Manager. The fully completed grievance form shall be submitted to the City
Clerk who shall record its submission and forward the grievance and any related
documents to the City Manager who may designate someone to administer the third
step grievance. The designated individual and such other individuals as he/she
deems appropriate, under this procedure, shall meet with the grievant within
fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the grievant's request and shall reply
in writing to the grievance within fifteen (15) calendar days following the
third step meeting.
      (4)   Fourth Step - Council Grievance Panel. If the City Manager's reply
from the third step meeting is not acceptable to the grievant, he/she may
submit the grievance to a fourth step Council hearing. The request for a fourth
step Council hearing shall be indicated by the employee on an additional form
obtained at the City Manager's Office. Requests for City Council hearings must
be submitted to the City Manager within fifteen (15) calendar days after
receipt of the third step reply. The Council's decision shall be final.
   (l)   Make-up of The Grievance Council. An impartial City Council shall
consist of a legal quorum of Council.
   (m)   Council Rules and Procedures. The City Council shall be notified by
the City Manager within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of an employee
request for a Fourth Step Council hearing. At that time, the Council shall
select a chairman, set the time for the hearing, which shall be held as soon as
practicable, but no more than fifteen (15) calendar days after the Council has
been initially notified by the City Manager, and shall notify the employee or
his/her representative of the date and time of the hearing. A copy of the
grievance file shall be provided to the Council members by the City Manager.
The City Manager shall provide the grievant with a list of the documents
furnished to the Council. The grievant and his/her attorney, if represented, at
least ten days prior to the scheduled Council hearing, shall be allowed access
to, and copies of, all relevant files intended to be used in the grievance
proceedings.
   (n)   Conduct of the Council Hearing.  Council hearings are not intended to
be conducted like court proceedings, and the rules of evidence are not required
to be followed. The conduct of the hearing shall be as follows:
      (1)    The presence of four Council members shall constitute a quorum.
The Council has the specific and final authority to determine the propriety of
attendance at the hearing of all persons not having a direct involvement in the
hearing, provided that at the request of the grievant, the hearing shall be
private.
      (2)    The Council may at the beginning of the hearing ask for statements
clarifying the issues involved.
      (3)    Exhibits, when offered by the grievant or the City of Moundsville,
may be received in evidence by the panel, and when so received, shall be marked
and made part of the record.
      (4)    The grievant and management, or their representatives, shall then
present their claims, proofs and witnesses, who shall testify under oath or
affirmation and who shall submit to questions or other examinations. The
Council shall have authority to determine the admissibility of evidence without
regard to the burden of proof or the order of presentation of evidence, so long
as a full and equal opportunity is afforded to all parties for the presentation
of their evidence.
      (5)    Documents, exhibits, and lists of witnesses shall be exchanged
between the parties in advance of the hearing.
      (6)    The parties may offer evidence and shall produce such additional
evidence as the Council may deem necessary to an understanding and
determination of the dispute. The Council shall be the judge of relevancy and
materiality of the evidence offered. All evidence shall be taken in the
presence of the Council and of the parties.
      (7)    The Council has no subpoena power to compel the attendance of
witnesses. The Council may, however, at the request of either party, or its own
discretion, request the voluntary appearance of witnesses or the submission of
documents.
      (8)   The Council chairman shall specifically inquire of all parties
whether they have any further proof to offer or witnesses to be heard. Upon
receiving negative replies, the chairman shall declare the hearing closed.
      (9)   The hearing may be reopened by the Council on its own motion or
upon application of a party for good cause shown at any time before the award
is made.
   (o)   Council Decision. The Council shall have the responsibility to
interpret the application of appropriate City of Moundsville policies and
procedures in the case. It shall not have the prerogative to formulate or to
change policies or procedures. The majority decision of the Council shall be
final and binding and consistent with law and written policies as determined by
the City Manager. The City Manager shall review the Council's decision before
it is issued and shall return it to the Council for their revision if it is
determined to be inconsistent with law and/or written policies.
   The decision shall be filed in writing by the Council chairman with the City
Manager not later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the completion of the
hearing. Copies of the decision shall be transmitted by the City Manager to the
employee, his/her representative, and the employee's department head. The
Council shall use the following guidelines during the decision making process.
      (1)    The Council may consider mitigating circumstances and modify
management's action consistent with written policy.
      (2)    The Council is to decide cases on the merits, not on compliance
matters occurring prior to or during the Council hearing. All compliance
questions should be referred to the City Manager, and the Council may consult
with the Manager on procedural questions arising during the hearing.
      (3)    The Council, in rendering its decision, shall be guided by, but
not necessarily bound by, the relief specified by the employee. However, the
relief granted must be consistent with written policy.
      (4)    The Council by majority vote may uphold or reverse the action of
management or, in appropriate circumstances, may choose a modified remedy.
   (p)   Maintenance of Grievance Records. When a grievance is reduced to
writing, a grievance case file shall be initiated by the department head
handling such grievance. This file shall contain copies of all forms,
memoranda, letters, and/or summaries of all meetings and decisions rendered
concerning the case. As the case progresses through the various steps of the
grievance procedure, copies of all additional data shall be added to the file
until the grievance is resolved. When the grievance is resolved, this grievance
case file shall constitute the official record of the case and shall be
forwarded to the City Manager for appropriate maintenance and disposition.
155.08  TRAVEL EXPENSES.
   (a)   The cost of travel incurred in the reasonable performance of official
duties that has been directed and approved by proper authority shall be
reimbursed by the City. The basic principle shall be that the employee shall
not make or lose money as the result of official travel. Allowable travel
expenses shall include: transportation, lodging, meals, tips, and other
incidental expenses, tuition and registration fees, and promotional and/or
other exceptional expenses. The exact amounts to be reimbursed, the
documentation required to support such reimbursement, and the rules and
procedures for obtaining approval for official travel shall be determined by
the City Manager or his designee in conjunction with the City Manager. (Ord.3/
6/12)
   (b)   The City shall reimburse employees and Council members for travel
expenses, at a rate equal to the rate the United States government reimburses
federal employees, at the time the expense is incurred, when it is necessary to

actual expenditures of meals with receipts provided, up to thirty dollars
($30.00) per day, for pre-approved City business, and shall reimburse hotel-

Manager from attending meetings deemed necessary in the performance of his/her
job or restrict his/her options within the scope of his/her budget provisions.
   (h)   The purpose of this article is to establish accountability for travel
expenses by all employees.  (Passed 9-1-98)
155.09  COMPENSATION.
   (a)   City of Moundsville Compensation Program. The City's Compensation
Program consists of several elements as follows:
      (1)    Compensation philosophy. It is the City's philosophy to encourage
and support organizational excellence through a combination of base pay and
productivity incentives which will attract, retain, and motivate high
performing employees and allow them to earn a better than competitive wage.
      (2)    Compensation plan. The City's compensation plan shall be
administered by the City Manager, who shall develop pay ranges for each City
position which take into account competitive market data and the strategic
impact of jobs on the organization's mission and success. The City Manager,
with Council's approval, shall have final responsibility for compensation
decisions.  However, the program may be managed with input and participation
from managers and employees at various levels of the organization.

authority for, setting rates of pay for the following categories of jobs and
employees: General Fund and Grant-funded positions of the City of Moundsville,
WV, except: members of Council; elected officials and their employees; the City
Manager; Department Heads and those employees who have like status; the City
Attorney and the attorneys reporting to him; employees or persons whose rates
of pay are otherwise determined by general State law; employees or persons
providing a specialized service under the supervision of a City of Moundsville
activity who are paid from other than Federal, State, or General Funds (i.e.
Security Guards provided to local businesses and producers, sponsors, or
promoters, as well as "event personnel" provided producers, sponsors, or
promoters, etc.); and other individuals who are exempt from the City pay system
as defined in Section
155.01(c), its application to any of these activities, or any non-City agency
shall be by mutual agreement between the City of Moundsville City Manager and
the head of the agency/activity concerned.
      (4)   Additional responsibilities - City Manager,

         B.   The City Manager shall provide technical advice and assistance in
the areas of organizational structure, position management, writing of position
descriptions, and pay administration.

within their management area and shall ensure that the duties are necessary to
the accomplishment of their mission.
   (b)   Categories of Positions.
      (1)   Permanent.
         A.    Permanent Full-Time (PFT). Positions needed on a continuing

employees who work in the Parks Division on self-directed teams shall be
classified as Ten Month Employees. Such employees will be paid at an hourly
rate of pay to be determined by the Director of Parks and Recreation and the
City Manager.
      (3)    Introductory employees. All new employees, except civil service
employees, must successfully complete an introductory period of one hundred
(180) calendar days before being classified as a full-time or part-time
employee. If, at the close of the introductory term, the conduct or capacity of
the introductory employee has not been satisfactory to the City Manager, the
introductory employee shall be notified, in writing, that he or she will not
receive appointment as such "full-time employee" or "part-time employee", and

such Federal minimum wage shall apply to all individuals employed by the City,
regardless of the source of funding of their position. Subsequent increases in
the Federal Minimum Wage shall be automatically implemented on dates specified
in the enacting legislation. Employees will move through the pay ranges as
prescribed in this article or will have their pay adjusted with the
implementation of another change in the Federal Minimum Wage. At such time that

the Federal Minimum Wage rate, that date will become the effective date for
subsequent pay increases, other than those prescribed under Federal Minimum
Wage legislation.

conduct from one position to another position in a lower salary grade shall
have his/her pay reduced by seven percent (7%) or to the minimum of the new
range, whichever results in the least loss of pay, and shall be given a new
formal performance appraisal date (if applicable) as of the date of the
demotion.
      (2)    Demotion through no fault/title changes. An employee who is
demoted through no fault of his/her own (reorganization, reduction-in-force,
reevaluation, or classification of his/her position, etc.) shall have his/her
pay set at a rate within the range prescribed for the lower position which
results in the least loss of pay but that does not exceed the maximum of the

(10%), whichever results in the least loss of pay. The employee shall retain
his/her existing performance appraisal date.

another position in the same salary range shall remain at the same rate of pay
and retain the same performance appraisal date (if applicable) he/she had in
the old position.
   (f)   Reclassification.   When an encumbered position is assigned to a
higher salary range, without a substantial change in duties and
responsibilities, the employee shall retain his/her existing salary rate or
have his/her pay set at the minimum of the new range, whichever is the greater
amount. An employee affected by these provisions shall retain his/her existing
formal performance appraisal date.

within ninety (90) calendar days to his/her former position at the same pay
range and title shall have his/her pay set at the rate he/she was paid at the

separation.
   (h)   Managerial or Professional Positions. Employees filling positions

hours as may be necessary to accomplish their assigned responsibilities without
additional compensation to that specified as the annual rate for the range of
the position to which they are assigned.

refuse overtime deemed necessary by management.
Refusal to work overtime, without medical authorization, may result in
disciplinary action if such overtime is deemed necessary to the orderly
function of municipal government.

individuals, fraternal organizations, social organizations, school boards, or
other entities, such compensation received from those services shall not be
used to compute pension benefits and no contribution from such compensation

hours worked by their employees and such record shall be posted on a bulletin
board in their department available to all employees.

the purpose of this record keeping and the offering of overtime opportunities.

funeral leave, during an authorized leave of absence, military leave (not
exceeding 15 days), authorized educational training sessions, out-of-town on
official City business, said employees shall be compensated for that holiday at
eight (8) hours of regular pay. Employees recalled to military duty on a full-
time basis, employees on compensation, employees under disciplinary suspension,
and employees incarcerated in any jail or prison will not be eligible for
holiday pay.
      (4)    When a holiday falls during an employee's regularly scheduled
shift, that employee must work the last scheduled day before the holiday and
the first scheduled day after the holiday to be eligible for that holiday pay.
Employees that miss the day before or the day after a holiday must have a
doctor's excuse for those days to get paid for the holiday.
      (5)    Holidays declared by the Governor of West Virginia will not be
observed as holidays by the City of Moundsville, unless it is decreed by the
Governor that municipalities must do so.
      (6)   Pay for work performed on a holiday. Employees eligible for
overtime pay under applicable laws required to perform work on a designated
holiday which has been authorized and directed by an appropriate management
official shall be paid one and one-half (1½) times their normal straight time
rate for all hours worked on such holiday which falls within the employee's
normally-scheduled work shift and eight (8) hours holiday pay at straight time.
Hours worked over and above the employee's normal work shift shall be
compensated as overtime in accordance with the provisions of this section.
The above categories of employees shall be compensated in accordance with the
following provisions:
         A.    An employee shall be paid the premium holiday rate (e.g., one
and one-half times their straight time rate) only if he/she actually works on a
holiday, during his/her regular scheduled shift.
         B.   The majority of employees work a regularly schedule tour of duty
consisting of eight (8) hours per day, Monday through Friday, with Saturday and
Sunday as their normal days off. In their case, if a legal holiday falls on a
Saturday, the preceding Friday is treated as a legal holiday for pay purposes;
if a legal holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday is treated as a
legal holiday for pay purposes.
      (7)   It is the intent of this article that those employees scheduled to
work on the holiday will be paid their regular wage and also be compensated
with an additional time and one-half pay. Those employees not scheduled to work
the holiday will be compensated for eight hours straight time.
   (k)   Work and Pay Status During Inclement Weather. As a general rule all
employees are expected to report for duty at their normal time and perform
their assigned tasks for their entire scheduled tour of duty. Employees shall
be given the option of taking annual leave or leave without pay if hazardous
driving conditions exist and such employees are unable to report for duty:
As exceptions:
      (1)   When severe weather conditions develop during on-duty hours,
employees will be given the option of leaving early without compensation.
   (l)   Longevity.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to deny
present members of the Fire Department any accrued and accumulated longevity
pay as of the effective date of the passage of this article.
   Nothing contained herein shall be construed to deny present members of the
Police Department any accrued and accumulated longevity pay.  (Passed 4-6-99.)
   (m)   Longevity Pay.  The City shall pay all full-time employees longevity
pay as follows:  After two full years of completed service, employees shall
receive seventy five dollars ($75.00) per year longevity pay and an additional
seventy five dollars ($75.00) per year for each successive year.  (Passed 5-15-
18.)
   (n)   Former Employee.
      (1)    Any employee of the City whose job position is eliminated due to
budgetary changes and at a later date is returned to employment shall receive
the same salary, sick leave, vacation, longevity, and any other considerations
given to a like employee not affected. This employee's original hire date,
minus time suspended by budgetary considerations, shall be used in determining
time of completed service.
      (2)    The above shall be in effect from the employee's recall date, not
withstanding any waiting period or delay provided for in any other Policy
Regulation.
      (3)    This shall apply to all present and former employees who qualify.
   (o)   Call Out Time. In the event a full-time employee is called out for
non-scheduled work, the employee shall be paid for a minimum of three (3) hours
at one and one-half times the employee's normal rate of pay. Non-scheduled work
shall not be construed to include prearranged department, holiday, and weekend
call out time.
   Call out pay will not be paid in addition to hours actually worked. An
employee can receive no more than one call out pay in any twenty-four hour
period.
Department Heads shall keep an up-to-date record of all call outs, and as near
as possible, distribute call outs evenly among employees in the same
classification.
   Call out lists will be made available by all department heads to the
dispatcher.
   Call out pay is intended to compensate employees for the inconvenience of
being called out during their normal relaxation time away from work. Therefore,
call out pay is a guaranteed number of hours of work but is not to be
considered a gratuity and is not paid in addition to hours actually worked when
call out results in more than three hours work.
   If the minimum period overlaps into the employee's scheduled hours of work,
he/she will be paid at the applicable rate only for the time actually elapsed
between his/her report for call-out and his/her regular starting time of
scheduled work.
   Scheduled court appearances for police officers during off-duty times are to
be considered as scheduled work, and the minimum three-hour call out time for
non-scheduled work provided for above shall not be applicable thereto. For such
court appearances during off-duty times, a police officer shall be paid a
minimum of one hour compensation at one and one-half times the employee's
normal rate of pay. Should the officer be required to work over an hour, the
time is to be rounded up to the nearest quarter hour.  (Ord. 4-6-99)
   (p)   Nepotism. The purpose of a nepotism policy is to establish a policy
for the employment of immediate relatives in order to assure the reality and
appearance of fairness in the best interest of the City.
   It is the City's policy that immediate relatives will not be employed in
regular full-time or regular part-time positions where:
      (1)   One relative would have the authority to supervise, appoint,
remove, discipline, or evaluate the performance of the other.
      (2)   One relative would be responsible for auditing the work of the
other.
      (3)   Other circumstances exist which would place the relatives in a
situation of actual or reasonably foreseeable conflict between the City's
interest and their own.
   Where business necessity requires the limitation of employment opportunity
of spouses, the means chosen to meet the business necessity shall be those
which have the least adverse impact on spouses or members of either sex. For
example:  The exclusion should be limited to the job, work crew, shop or unit
where the reason for exclusion exists, and should not bar the person from the
whole work force, unless the reason applies to the whole work force. When it is
necessary to exclude a person because of what his or her spouse does, then the
employees will be asked to determine which spouse shall keep the job. The City
may require one spouse to quit 60 days after marriage if they become in
violation of this policy and a mutually-agreeable solution cannot be reached
between the City and the employee.
   Definitions: "Immediate relative" includes spouse, child, parent, brother,
sister, grandparents, parent-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law,
grandchildren, aunts and uncles.
   (q)   Compensatory Time Off.
      (1)   Employees of the City of Moundsville may receive, in accordance
with this subsection and in lieu of overtime compensation, compensatory time
off at a rate not less than one and one-half hours for each hour of employment
for which overtime is required pursuant to this section.
      (2)   The City may provide compensatory time under subdivision (1) of
this subsection only pursuant to a written agreement arrived at between the
City and an employee before the performance of the work and recorded in the
City's record of hours worked and if the employee has not accrued compensatory
time in excess of the limit prescribed in subdivision (3) of this subsection.
Any written agreement may be modified at the request of either the employer or
the employee, but under no circumstances shall changes in the agreement deny an
employee compensatory time heretofore acquired.
      (3)   An employee may accrue up to four hundred eighty (480) hours of
compensatory time if the employee's work is a public safety activity, an
emergency response activity or a seasonal activity. An employee engaged in
other work for the City may accrue up to two hundred forty (240) hours of
compensatory time. Any such employee who has accrued four hundred eighty (480)
or two hundred forty (240) hours of compensatory time, as the case may be,
shall for additional overtime hours of work, be paid overtime compensation. If
compensation is paid to an employee for accrued compensatory time off, such
compensation shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee at the
time the employee receives such payment.
      (4)   An employee who has accrued compensatory time off authorized to be
provided under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall, upon termination of
employment, be paid for the unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation
not less than:
         A.   The average regular rate received by such employee during the
last three years of the employee's employment; or
         B.   The final regular rate received by such employee, whichever is
higher.
      (5)   An employee of the City who has accrued compensatory time off
authorized to be provided under subdivision (1) of this subsection and who has
requested the use of such compensatory time, shall be permitted by the City to
use such time within a reasonable time after making the request if the use of
the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operation of the City. For
example, compensatory time off shall not be approved if the time off would
require another employee to work overtime during such compensatory time-off
period. Compensatory time must be used within one year from the time it was
acquired.
      (6)   For purposes of this subsection the terms "compensatory time" and
"compensatory time off" mean hours during which an employee is not working,
which are not counted as hours worked during the applicable workweek or other
work period for purposes of overtime compensation, and for which the employee
is compensated at the employee's regular rate.
      (7)   The City Manager shall provide agreement forms and request forms to
employees in order to implement the terms of this subsection, and shall have
authority to take other reasonable actions in administering the provisions
hereof.  (Passed 7-22-09)

155.11  LEAVES AND ABSENCES FROM WORK.
   (a)   General Rules Governing Leave and Attendance.  The importance of
regular work attendance cannot be overemphasized in terms of productivity,
efficiency, and the ultimate ability of the City to accomplish its goals.
Employees are expected to maintain regular attendance and report for work on
time except for time off which is approved by management under the following
leave provisions. Abuse of time-off privileges and/or unauthorized absences
will be dealt with in accordance with the City's policy.
   Employees may not leave work during their shift or while on duty for the
City to perform work for another employer or for other employment, except on an
occasional basis as may be approved each time by the City Manager when
arrangements have been made for make-up time equal to the time the employee is
absent.  Employees are not prohibited from performing other employment during
time off so long as it does not substantially interfere with their employment
by the City.
   Paid leave is an employee benefit designed to enhance overall efficiency,
maximum productivity, and high morale. Both annual and sick leave are personal
to the individual employee, and shall not be loaned, donated, or sold to
another employee under any circumstances. Employees and/or managers apprehended
in such practice shall be subject to disciplinary action. Employees shall be
granted authorized leave only for its intended purpose. This section prescribes
the types of leave authorized for City employees. The City Manager, through
appropriate members of his/her staff, shall develop and implement appropriate
administrative instructions and procedures for accurate accountability of all
paid leave.
   Total creditable service for leave accumulation purposes shall be computed
from the date of appointment to, or conversion to, a permanent full-time
position with the City. Employees who formerly occupied permanent full-time
positions, convert to other than full-time permanent status, and later return
to permanent full-time status within ninety (90) calendar days shall have their
former permanent full-time service credited for leave accumulation category
purposes. Permanent full-time employees who are also members of one of the
reserve components of the United States Armed Forces and who are called to
active duty for short periods of training (not to exceed 15 calendar days in
any given 12 month period) or emergency military duty (not to exceed 30
calendar days in any given 12 month period) shall continue to accumulate annual
and sick leave during such periods and shall be credited with such service for
leave accumulation category purposes.
   (b)   Accumulation of Leave During Periods of Absence.  Permanent full-time
employees shall continue to accumulate annual and sick leave and shall be
granted service credit for all periods of absence in any authorized paid leave
status. A permanent full-time employee in a non-pay status while receiving
benefits under the Worker's Compensation Act shall not accumulate sick leave or
annual leave. An employee who enters an extended active duty with a component
of the Armed Forces of the United States shall not accumulate annual or sick
leave, but the period of active duty shall be creditable service for leave
accumulation category purposes, provided the employee applies for reinstatement
to his/her former position with the City within ninety (90) calendar days after
date of discharge from the military service.
   (c)   Vacations.
      (1)    Employees must complete one (1) full year of employment with the

left in that year.
         B.    Employees whose anniversary date falls between January 1 and
June 30 of the first year of eligibility will receive their vacation on a
prorated basis of 6.66 hours for each full month of completed service. Such

leave, and leave without pay shall not be counted as hours worked to determine
vacation (annual leave) eligibility.

and normal military leave (not to exceed 15 days) shall be counted as hours
worked to determine eligibility for vacation (annual leave) time.
      (4)    Any City employee may, with appropriate approval, convert five (5)
vacation days to be used non-consecutively, as personal leave days. Such
converted days must be used in increments of not less than four (4) hours.

scheduled vacation period, said employee shall receive eight (8) hours of
holiday pay at a straight time rate in addition to his/her normal vacation pay
or holiday off at later date with department heads approval.
      (9)    On or before December 1 of the year preceding the calendar year in
which vacations are to be taken, vacation preference forms shall be given to
all eligible employees by their Department Head. Employees must return these
vacation selection forms by January 15 of the calendar year in which the
vacation occurs.
      (10)    Employees will be given vacation preferences by order of
seniority, with the most senior employees being given first choice.
      (11)    First choice vacations shall be limited to a maximum of two (2)
weeks until all department employees have been granted vacations.
      (12)    Third and fourth week vacations shall then be granted by
seniority in those weeks in the calendar year in which no other department
employee has chosen a first choice vacation.
      (13)    Employees not returning their vacation preference form by January
15th of the vacation year shall be assigned vacation weeks at the discretion of
the department head, after all other employee vacations have been scheduled.
      (14)    Vacations will not be scheduled for less than seven (7)
consecutive days and shall be scheduled in one (1) work week increments.

      (19)    A copy of all vacation schedules shall be sent to the City
Manager by each department head or other individual responsible for vacation
posting and such copies shall be given to each Council member.
      (20)   Annual Leave Administration. To ensure that employees do not
forfeit annual leave which they would otherwise accumulate, department heads
should establish a tentative annual leave schedule for their activities each
year. Insofar as workload and other pertinent factors permit, employees shall
be allowed to use their annual leave according to their personal desires;
however, the final decision to approve or disapprove requests for annual leave
shall rest with the department head. Employees shall not be placed on annual
leave as a disciplinary measure. Annual leave shall be requested and approved
in writing on a form prescribed by the Director of Finance. Under no
circumstance shall annual leave be granted in advance of its accrual in
accordance with this article.
      (21)   Lump Sum Payment. Employees shall be paid for all accumulated
annual leave to their credit on the date of their separation from employment
with the City of Moundsville. Payment shall be computed by multiplying the
employee's hourly rate of pay at the time of separation by the number of hours
of accumulated annual leave to their credit.
      (22)   Changing Positions: Payment For Credit. Permanent full-time
employees who convert to other than full-time positions in which they are not
eligible for paid leave shall be paid for any accrued annual leave to their
credit at the time of placement in the new position.
   (d)   Sick Leave.  Sick leave is paid time off from work by reason of:
personal illness or injury (except job incurred injury) sufficient to preclude
performance of official duties; exposure to a contagious disease that could
jeopardize the health of others; illness or incapacity of a dependent member of
the employee's immediate family requiring the presence of the employee (for

daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, father, mother, stepfather, stepmother,
father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother, sister, foster parent, or guardian);

period for employment before being eligible for sick leave. Upon completion of

      (3)    Charge to Sick Leave. Charges to sick leave shall be as follows:
         A.    Employees on a forty (40)-hour workweek shall be charged sick
leave in one (1) hour increments on the basis of one (1) hour of sick leave for
each hour of absence. The minimum charge shall be one (1) hour.
         B.    Substitution of sick leave for annual leave. If illness occurs
during a period of annual leave, approved sick leave may be substituted for
annual leave on the basis of one (1) hour of sick leave for one (1) hour of
annual leave.
      (4)   Negative pool.
         A.    After the first year of employment, an employee may utilize a
negative sick leave pool of twelve (12) days in the event of an extended
illness in which all accumulated sick leave has been exhausted. City Manager
approval must be granted before the negative sick leave pool can be utilized.
         B.    In the event an employee has an extended illness beyond the
twelve (12) day negative pool as granted by the City Manager, requests for
additional negative pool days must be taken before Council for approval.
         C.    In granting negative pool extensions, Council shall consider the
following:
            1.   Years of service;
            2.   Past work performance;
            3.   Past sick leave;
            4.   Department head recommendations.
         D.    Any employee may use unused vacation days, if they desire, to

the sum total of all days owed to the "sick leave" policy negative pool.
      (5)    Call off procedure.
         A.    Any employee reporting in sick shall contact the City Dispatch
Center a minimum of one hour prior to his/her scheduled starting time.
         B.    Dispatchers shall prepare a report to be provided to the
employee's Department Head and the City Manager.
         C.    Violation of this procedure may subject an employee to loss of
pay and/or other disciplinary actions.
      (6)    Medical certification.
         A.    Medical certification may be required when deemed
administratively necessary.  (Passed 9-1-98)
         B.    Medical certification shall be required in all cases after an
employee has utilized sick leave for any occurrence consisting of three (3) or
more consecutive days. Medical certification must be provided prior to payment
of sick leave benefits or wages due. (Passed 5-3-05)
         C.    Any employee failing to provide satisfactory medical
documentation when required shall be in violation of this section, shall not
receive sick leave pay, and may be subject to disciplinary action.
      (7)    Call off on holidays.
         A.    Any scheduled employee calling off sick on a holiday will be
granted holiday pay only. Sick leave will be counted toward sick leave
occurrence but not deducted from accrual.
      (8)    Coordination of benefits.
         A.    Election of Option. An employee absent from work due to a work
related injury or illness may elect to receive accumulated sick leave or
temporary total disability benefits, but not both for the same period of
absence. The employee must complete an "election of option" form designating
his or her election and the form must be filed with the Report of Occupational
Injury. If the employee does not file the "election of option" form, the
default option is accumulated sick leave.
         B.    Interim Payment of Sick Leave. An employee electing to receive
temporary total disability may collect sick leave benefits, and, upon
exhaustion of sick leave benefits, annual leave benefits until he or she
receives temporary total disability benefits. Upon receipt of the initial
temporary total disability payment the employee shall pay or assign to the City
the net value of the sick leave, or sick and annual leave paid, after which his
or her sick leave and annual leave, if used, shall be restored.
         C.    Temporary Total Disability After Exhaustion of Sick Leave. An
employee electing to receive accumulated sick leave may receive temporary total
disability benefits upon exhaustion of his or her accumulated sick leave if he
or she remains eligible for such temporary total disability benefits under the
Workers' Compensation Act.
         D.    Annual Increment Pay. An employee electing to receive
accumulated sick leave continues to accrue annual increment pay and years of
service credit while being paid sick leave. An employee electing to receive
temporary total disability benefits continues to accrue annual increment pay
while receiving temporary total disability benefits but does not accrue credit
for years of service.
         E.    Leave. An employee electing to receive accumulated sick leave
continues to accrue sick and annual leave and service credit. An employee
electing to receive temporary total disability benefits shall apply for a
medical leave of absence without pay, and, for purposes of leave, is treated
the same as any other similarly situated employee granted a medical leave of
absence without pay.
         F.    Police and Fire Department employees receiving temporary
disability pension benefits may elect to receive sick leave pay, provided that
sick pay shall be reduced so that the combination of pension benefits and sick
pay does not exceed an employee's regular rate of pay. Employees shall be
charged only with the amount of sick leave actually used.
         G.    Police and Fire Department employees receiving temporary
disability pensions and Workers' Compensation shall not be eligible for sick
leave pay.
         H.    Employees on sick leave shall continue to be covered by the
City's hospitalization and life insurance on the same basis as other employees
for a period of six months after expiration of all sick leave.
         I.    Employees shall not lose seniority benefits as a result of the
utilization of sick leave.  (Passed 5-20-03)
      (9)    Retirement options.  When an employee reaches retirement age,
defined for the purposes of this section only, as accumulating years of service
with the City plus his or her age equal to 70 or greater, the employee shall
have the following right, and be given the choice, to accept one of the
following:
         A.    A lump sum payment for accumulated sick days equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the monetary value of the accumulated sick days,
based on their hourly wage at the time of their retirement; or
         B.    A retiring employee may receive a paid hospitalization plan,
based on the hourly wage of the employee at the time of retirement and the cost
of such hospitalization insurance in effect at any given time, and as the cost
of the same should change from time to time, e.g.
Employee's accumulated sick days at time of retirement       100 days
            100 x Employee's Hourly wage
                       $80.00 a day ($10.00 an hour) =    $8,000.00
            Cost of insurance per month    $500.00
      Employee's accumulated value @ 100 % of parity =       $8,000.00
            Divided by Insurance cost per month =   ÷$500.00
      Months of paid health insurance received by employee =   16
      Employee would receive 16 months of paid health insurance. (Ord.11-3-10)
         C.    All necessary taxes shall be withheld from the sick leave cash
settlement and the paid hospitalization insurance. This includes state,
federal, FICA, Medicare, and whatever other obligations are imposed by law at
the time of the receipt of the same.
         D.    Further, the benefits provided in subsection "A" above shall be
available upon the death of an employee, regardless of the employee's age or
years of service, to a survivor or survivors that the employee has pre-selected
in writing and provided to the City Manager. If the employee fails to make such
pre-selection, this benefit shall be paid to the employee's spouse if married
at the date of death. If the employee has failed to pre-select and has no
surviving spouse, this benefit shall lapse and not be payable to any person. 
(Passed 7-15-08)
      (10)    Budget preparations. During budget preparations, each Department
Head shall project the accumulated sick time of each employee who will reach
retirement age during that fiscal year.
   This list will be provided to the Finance Director for inclusion into the
budget.
      (11)    Deposits. The City Manager shall cause a sum of money, equal to
the monetary value of all employees' accumulated sick days, to be deposited in
an account of interest bearing nature each year. Such account to be held
exclusively for the purpose of meeting the financial requirements of the sick
pay policy.
      (12)   Presentation of expenses. The City Finance Officer shall present
to the City Manager (who will in turn present to City Council) such expenses of
this sick pay plan. Such expenses are to be included in the budget as
encumbered money.
      (13)    Cessation of funding. In the event the sick pay fund reaches a
funding level sufficient to cover future expenses plus twenty-five percent
(25%) of projected funds needed to keep the fund solvent, payments to the fund
will stop until such need exists again.
      (14)    Abolishment. In the event future Council deems it necessary to
abolish sick days for City employees, employees with sick days accumulated will
be compensated equally from this fund and the fund abolished.
      (15)    Abolishment compensation. Compensation will be determined by the
number of sick days accumulated and the hourly rate of pay of each employee.
Under no circumstances will any employee receive more than one hundred percent
(l00%) of parity of money due them under this program.
      (16)    Employee package.  Since "sick pay" is a gratuitous action of
City Council, it is Council's desire to improve attendance at work of its
employees and to improve relations with the work force of its City. Therefore,
be it understood that this Council considers this action to be an integral part
of the agreement between Council and the City employees and is to be considered
a part of the employee benefit package.
   (e)   Other Authorized Absences With Pay. Employees may request, and under
the conditions and circumstances stated for each category of absence, may be
granted time off from work without loss of pay or charge to leave as follows:
      (1)    Military duty. A military leave of absence will be granted to
employees who are absent from work because of service in the United States
uniformed services in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).  Advance notice of military service is
required unless military necessity prevents such notice or it is otherwise
impossible or unreasonable.
Employees will receive pay for two week training assignments and shorter
absences.  The portion of any military leaves of absence in excess of two weeks
will be unpaid.  However, employees may use any available paid time off for the
absence.
Continuation of health insurance benefits is available as required by USERRA
based on the length of the leave and subject to the terms, conditions, and
limitations of the applicable plans for which the employee is otherwise
eligible.
Employees on military leave in excess of two weeks are required to return to
work for the first regularly scheduled day after the end of service, allowing
reasonable travel time.
Employees returning from military leave will be placed in the position they
would have attained had they remained continuously employed, or a comparable
one depending on the length of military service in accordance with USERRA. 
They will be treated as though they were continuously employed for purposes of
determining benefits based on length of service. Contact the City Manager for
information or questions about military leave. (Ord. 3/6/12)
      (2)   Court duty. An employee who is required to perform jury duty or to
appear in court outside his/her regular prescribed official duties as a witness
on behalf of the City of Moundsville, or the U. S. Government, may upon
presentation of court order, subpoena, summons, or other judicial notification,
be granted sufficient time off to perform such duties. Employees called to jury
duty should be compensated for jury duty by reimbursing an employee the
difference between jury pay and the employee's regular pay.
      (3)   Education. Under circumstances in the opinion of the City Manager
and Council wherein the interests of the City and the community are served by
such action, a permanent full-time employee may be granted paid time off for
education purposes. Such time off may be without loss of pay (either full
salary or any lesser amount to include full or partial payment of benefits
determined to be appropriate) or may be charged to leave, must be recommended
by the employee's department head, and approved by the City Manager and
Council. The recommendation to allow paid time off under the provisions of this
section shall be in writing, shall show specifically how the course of study
relates to the employee's present position or reasonable promotional objectives
within the City, and shall show specifically how the City and/or the
community's interest will be served. Any specific future service obligations
and/or payments shall be supported by a written agreement signed by the
employee, his or her department head, and the City Manager.
      (4)   Emergencies. The City Manager may at his/her discretion close all
or any part of the City governmental structure when, in his/her judgment, a
situation exists which endangers life or City property, which involves the
safety and welfare of employees, or which otherwise warrants such action. In
such cases all employees involved in such cessation of activities may be
excused from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave for a period not to
exceed one (1) workday during each such period of closure. Any further time off
shall be charged to annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay as
appropriate and available to individual employees.
   (f)   Funeral Leave and/or Memorial Service.
      (1)    All full time City employees shall be granted three (3) days of
paid funeral leave in the event of the death of any of the following family
members i.e.; wife, husband, mother, father, sister, brother, son, daughter,
mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandparents, step-child, grandson,
granddaughter, or live-in member of the employee's family that currently
resides with the employee for more than five (5) years.
      (2)    All City employees shall be granted one (1) day of funeral leave
to attend the funeral services of the following: great grandparents, brother-
in-law, sister-in-law, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, son-in-law, and daughter-in-
law.
      (3)    In the event a death occurs in the family of a City employee while
he is on vacation, the three (3) days or one (1) day, whichever is applicable,
will be added to the employee's vacation at the end of the vacation period. In
the event the additional time at the end of the vacation period conflicts with
the normal vacationing schedule and creates an uncompromisable situation in the
department's vacationing schedule, the department head may (with the City
Manager's approval), either reschedule such days at a more convenient time, or
pay the employee for the number of eligible days at a straight time rate of
pay.
      (4)    In the event authorized days of funeral leave are not enough to
complete all arrangements necessary to the employee's situation, additional
days may be applied for, by written request, to the department head and the
City Manager. Such days must come from the employee's annual leave days or from
accumulated sick leave.
      (5)    Funeral leave days are non-accruable, non-earned days and cannot
be carried over, transferred, traded, or applied to any other type of leave
described in this policy regulation.
      (6)    Compensation for funeral leave days shall be paid at the
employee's straight time rate.
      (7)    In the event of the death of more than one member of an employee's
immediate family at the same time or within two (2) calendar days of the first
family member's death, additional days may be granted to the affected employee
at the discretion of the department head and the City Manager. Such additional
time is not to exceed two (2) days. This applies only to subsection (f)(1)
hereof.
   (g)   Family and Medical Leave.  If eligible, employees of the City of
Moundsville, are allowed to take unpaid Family and/or Medical Leave under
federal law, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
      (1)   Eligibility
To be eligible for leave, you must be employed by the City for at least 12
months.  In addition, in the 12 months immediately preceding the beginning of
the leave, you must have worked at least 1,250 hours to qualify for federal
FMLA.
      (2)   Amount of Leave Available
As stated above, eligible employees are generally eligible for up to a total of
12 weeks of protected leave, except for service member family leave, within a
rolling twelve-month period, measured backward from the date an employee uses
any Federal leave for any combination of reasons listed below.  Where leave is
taken to care for a covered service member who is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on
the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or illness, a
spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin may take up to 26 weeks of unpaid
leave during a single 12-month period.
Under the federal FMLA, spouses employed by the City are jointly entitled to a
combined total of 12 weeks of family leave for the birth or placement of a
child for adoption or foster care, to care for a parent who has a serious
health condition, and for any qualifying exigency regarding active duty of a
family member in the military.  (The federal FMLA does not cover care for a
parent-in-law.)  Spouses employed by the City are jointly entitled to a
combined total of 26 weeks of family leave to care for a covered servicemember
with a serious injury or illness.
      (3)   Type of Leave Available
         A.   Birth or Placement for Adoption or Foster Care:  Family leave is
available to eligible male and female employees for the birth of a child or for
placement of a child with the employee for purposes of adoption or foster
care.  Federal leave must be completed within 12 months of the birth or
placement.
Non-continuous leave.  Federal leave may not be taken intermittently.  See
below for more details on intermittent leave.
Certification process.  The need for leave must be documented by your treating
healthcare provider through our medical certification process (see below) or
documented proof of placement of a child.
         B.   Serious Health Condition of Employee:  If, as an eligible
employee, you experience a serious health condition as defined by federal law,
you may take medical leave under this policy (see "Definitions" for the
definition of serious health condition).  A serious health condition generally
occurs when you:
   •   Receive inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or nursing home;
            •   Suffer a period of incapacity accompanied by continuing
outpatient treatment/care by a healthcare provider; or
            •   Have a history of a chronic condition that may cause episodes
of incapacity.
Non-continuous leave.  Medical leave may be taken all at once or, when
medically necessary, intermittently (see below).
Certification process.  The need for leave must be documented by your treating
healthcare provider through our medical certification process (see below).
Fitness-for-duty statement.  A fitness-for-duty statement will be required in
order for you to return from a medical leave.  Failure to provide the statement
will result in a delay in the return to work.
         C.   Serious Health Condition of Immediate Family Member:  If, as an
eligible employee, you need family leave in order to care for your son,
daughter, spouse, or parent who experiences a serious health condition as
defined by federal law (see "Definitions" for definitions of child, spouse,
parent, and serious health condition), you may take medical leave under this
policy.
Non-continuous leave.  Medical leave may be taken all at once or, when
medically necessary, intermittently (see below).
Certification process.  The need for leave must be documented by the family
member's treating healthcare provider through our medical certification process
(see below).
         D.   Active Duty Because of Any Qualifying Exigency:  If, as an
eligible employee, you need family leave because of any qualifying exigency
arising out of the fact that your spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on active
duty, or has been notified that they will be called or ordered to active duty
in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency operation, you may take family
leave under this policy.
Non-continuous leave.  Family leave for any qualifying exigency arising out of
the active duty of a family member may be taken all at once or intermittently
(see below).
Certification process.  The need for leave must be documented by a
certification in a form and in such manner as the U.S. Department of Labor and
the Secretary of Defense prescribe (see below).
         E.   Servicemember Family Leave:  If, as an eligible employee, you
need family leave to care for a covered service member who is your spouse, son,
daughter, parent, or next of kin, and who is undergoing medical treatment,
recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on
the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness incurred
in the line of duty on active duty, you may take up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave
during a single 12-month period under this policy.
Non-continuous leave.  Service member family leave may be taken all at once or,
when medically necessary, intermittently (see below).
Certification process.  The need for leave must be documented by the family
member's treating healthcare provider through our medical certification process
(see below).
      (4)   Notifying the City of the Need for Family or Medical Leave
Generally, an application for leave must be completed for all leave taken under
this policy.  The need to take non-emergency leave should generally be
requested from the Human Resources department at least thirty (30) days, or as
soon as practicable, in advance of the need.  In cases of emergency, verbal
notice should be given as soon as possible (by your representative if you are
incapacitated), and the application form should be completed as soon as
practicable.  Failure to provide adequate notice may, in the case of
foreseeable leave, result in a delay or denial of the leave.  It is your
responsibility to notify your manager and Human Resources of absences that may
be covered by FMLA.
You must provide sufficient information regarding the reason for an absence for
the City to know that protection may exist under this policy.  Failure to
provide this information will result in delay and/or forfeiture of rights under
this policy.  This means the absence may then be counted against your record
for purposes of discipline for attendance, etc.
      (5)   Medical Certification Process
In addition to an application for leave, you will be required to complete a
medical certification form where leave is for a family member's or your own
serious health condition.  The certification form needs to be signed by the
health care provider.  A short-term disability certification may be sufficient
where the information required is duplicative.  These forms are available from
Human Resources.  Second or third certifications from health care providers and
periodic recertification at the City's and/or your expense may be required
under certain circumstances.
We may also require periodic reports during federal FMLA leave regarding your
status and intent to return to work.
      (6)   Certification for Active Duty Because of Any Qualifying Exigency
In addition to an application for leave, you will be required to complete a
Certification of Qualifying Exigency for Military Family Leave form and to
furnish to the City in a timely manner any certification that your family
member is issued regarding their active duty or call to active duty in the
Armed Forces.
      (7)   Substituting Paid Leave for Unpaid Leave
Federal FMLA leave is unpaid.  The City requires you to utilize annual leave
time and sick time while on FMLA leave.  You  may also choose to use banked
sick time that you accrued after you have exhausted your annual leave time. 
Use of annual leave and banked sick time runs concurrently with FMLA leave.
When an employee is absent due to a work related illness or injury that meets
the definition of a serious health condition, the absence will be counted
against the employee's entitlement under this policy.  In other words, the
employee is using FMLA leave concurrently with the workers' compensation
absence.  An employee is not required to substitute paid time off for an
absence covered under workers' compensation.
You may be paid for all or part of a medical leave to the extent you are
eligible for benefits such as short-term disability.
      (8)   Non-Continuous Leave
Intermittent and/or reduced leave will be permitted only when it is medically
necessary or for a qualifying exigency/call to active duty as explained above. 
In all cases, the total amount of leave taken in a calendar year should not
exceed your total allotment as defined earlier in this policy.
Intermittent and reduced schedule leave must be scheduled with minimal
disruption to an employee's job.  To the extent an employee or family member
has control, medical appointments and treatments related to an employee's or
family member's serious health condition should be scheduled outside of working
hours or at such times that allow for a minimal amount of time away from work.
If you request non-continuous federal FMLA leave which is foreseeable based on
planned medical treatment for purposes of providing care to a child, spouse, or
parent with a serious health condition, for your own serious health condition,
or for service member family leave, you may be required to transfer temporarily
to an available alternative position offered by the City for which you are
qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than your
regular employment position.  You will be entitled to equivalent pay and
benefits but will not necessarily be assigned the same duties in the
alternative position.
      (9)   Benefit Continuation During Leave
The City will maintain group health insurance coverage and other employment
benefits (such as group life insurance, AD&D, health, and dependent flexible
spending accounts, etc.) for you while on FMLA leave whenever such insurance
was provided to you before the leave was taken and on the same terms as if you
had continued to work.  You will be required to pay your regular portion of
insurance premiums - contact City Manager for an explanation of your options.
Benefits that are accumulated based upon hours worked shall not accumulate
during the period of FMLA leave.
In some instances, the City may recover premiums it paid to maintain health
insurance coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave.
      (10)   Returning to Work
If the reason for FMLA leave is for your own serious health condition, you will
be required to present a Fitness-For-Duty certification immediately upon return
to work.
If you wish to return to work before the scheduled expiration of an FMLA leave,
you must notify the City of the changing circumstances as soon as possible but
no later than two (2) working days prior to your desired return date.
An employee who fails to return to work immediately after the expiration of the
leave period will be considered to have voluntarily terminated his/her
employment.
      (11)   Rights Upon Return From Leave
Upon return from Family or Medical Leave, you will be returned to the position
you held immediately prior to the leave if the position is vacant.  Certain
exceptions exist for Key Employees as defined by law.  If the position is not
vacant, you will be placed in an equivalent employment position with equivalent
pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.  If you exhaust
all leave under this policy and are still unable to return to work, your
situation will be reviewed to determine what rights and protections might exist
under other City policies.
The law provides that an employee has no greater rights upon a return from
leave than the employee would have if the employee had continued to work. 
Therefore, you may be affected by a layoff, termination, or other job change if
the action would have occurred had you remained actively at work.
If you do not qualify for the types of leave described in this policy, we may
approve a personal leave of absence, depending on your circumstances.  Except
where mandated by law, we cannot guarantee that benefits will continue or that
your position will remain open in your absence.
This policy provides an introduction to the rights and provisions of the
federal FMLA.  Questions you may have about this law should be directed to
Human Resources.  Department of Labor WHD Publication 1420 is attached to this
policy and further explains the FMLA's provisions. See Appendix.
      (12)   Definitions
         A.   "Spouse" - A husband or wife as defined or recognized under state
law for purposes of marriage in the state where the employee resides.
         B.   "Parent" - A biological parent or an individual who provides or
provided day-to-day care and financial support to the employee when the
employee was a child.  This includes foster parent, adoptive parent, step-
parent, and legal guardian.  Parent does not mean a parent-in-law.
         C.   "Child" - A biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild,
legal ward, or under the federal FMLA, the child of a person having day-to-day
care and/or financial responsibility for the child who is under age 18.  Child
includes a person 18 years of age or older who is incapable of self-care
because of a mental or physical disability.  For Qualifying Exigency Leave or
Servicemember Family Leave, the child does not have to be a minor (under the
age of 18) and can be of any age.
         D.   "Incapable of Self Care" - The child requires active assistance
or supervision to provide daily self care in three or more "activities of daily
living" or "instrumental activities of daily living" including adaptive
activities such as caring appropriately for one's grooming and hygiene,
bathing, dressing, eating, or instrumental activities such as shopping, taking
public transportation, maintaining a residence, etc.
         E.   "Physical or Mental Disability" - A physical or mental impairment
that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual.
         F.   "Next of Kin" - Used with respect to an individual, means the
nearest blood relative of that individual, other than spouse, parent, or
child.  See Human Resources for more details.
         G.   "Serious Health Condition" - Illness, injury, impairment, or
physical or mental condition that involves:
            •   Inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical
care facility
            •   A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar
days (including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to
the same condition) that also involves: 1) treatment two or more times within
30 days of the first day of incapacity, unless extenuating circumstances exist,
by or under the orders of a health care provider; or 2) treatment by a health
care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing
treatment under the supervision of a health care provider.  The first (or only)
visit must occur in person within seven days of the first day of incapacity.
            •   Any incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care.
            •   Chronic conditions requiring periodic treatment by or under the
supervision of a health care provider which continue over an extended period of
time and may cause an episodic rather than continuing period of incapacity
(e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.)
            •   Permanent/long-term conditions requiring supervision for which
treatment may not be effective (e.g., Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the
terminal stages of a disease).
            •   Multiple treatments by or under the supervision of a health
care provider either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury
or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more
than three calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment,
such as cancer (chemotherapy), severe arthritis (physical therapy) or kidney
disease (dialysis).
         H.   "Serious Injury or Illness" - In the case of a member of the
Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, an injury
or illness incurred by the member in the line of duty on active duty in the
Armed Forces that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties
of the member's office, grade, rank, or rating. (Ord. 3/6/12)
   (h)   Leave Without Pay (LWOP). Absences may be charged to LWOP only when
the employee has insufficient amounts of appropriate paid leave available to
cover an approved absence, except in the case of employees who are also members
of the organized reserve forces of any of the uniformed services of the United
States when engaged in federally funded military duty, to include training
duty. The granting of LWOP shall be at management's discretion, except in the
case of military duty as specified in subsection (e)(1) hereof. An employee
cannot demand that he/she be granted LWOP. LWOP may be granted when in the
opinion of the department head it will result in increased job ability,
protection or improvement of the employee's health, the retention of a
desirable employee, and would be in the best interests of the City.
   Costs and inconveniences to the City as a result of granting extended LWOP
include encumbrances of a position, loss of services, complication of retention
registers in event of reduction-in-force, and the obligation to provide
employment at the end of the approved leave period. These costs and
inconveniences shall be weighed against the benefits to be gained by granting
LWOP.
   Initial grants of LWOP may not exceed six months without City Manager and
Council approval. If an additional grant is deemed justified, the employee's
request for extension shall be submitted to the City Manager and City Council
for approval.
   (i)   Fitness For Duty.  In cases where an employee's continued and/or
periodic absences severely impact productivity, the supervisor may arrange for
a fitness for duty examination by a physician at the City's expense. The City
Manager will assist supervisors and department heads in making these
arrangements. If, in the opinion of the examining physician, the employee is
unable to perform his/her assigned duties, the employee may be reassigned or
separated from employment. If the examining physician finds the employee able
to perform his/her assigned duties, it is then the Supervisor's responsibility
to deny paid leave and/or leave without pay to such employees, and to take
appropriate disciplinary action for excessive absenteeism. The events
surrounding these actions shall be thoroughly documented and made a part of the
employee's official personnel folder. However, no employee shall be terminated
or disciplined in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
   (j)   Managing Absenteeism. The most important consideration for supervisors
in managing absenteeism problems is that of approval of absences and patterns
of leave usage. Supervisors should exercise careful judgment in deciding
whether or not to approve leave so that employees who have legitimate need or
reason to be absent from work are not penalized. This can be accomplished
through discussion with the employee and thorough review of his/her previous
record, performance appraisal, and medical documentation.
155.12  EMPLOYMENT; APPLICATIONS; VACANCIES; EXAMINATIONS; INTRODUCTORY PERIOD;
DEMOTION; REDUCTION IN FORCE.
   (a)   Employment. Positions shall be filled on the basis of qualifications
and merit without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, age,
marital status, religion, sex, or handicap. Positions shall be filled by
promotions, reassignments, demotions, temporary assignments, re-employment of
former employees, or recruitment from outside sources as determined appropriate
by the City Manager.
   In no event shall the hiring of an employee be considered as creating a
contractual relationship between the employee and the City; and, unless
otherwise provided in writing, such relationship shall be defined as
"employment at will", where either party may dissolve the relationship.
   (b)   Applications.  Applications for employment shall be made on forms
prescribed and provided by the City Manager. Such forms shall require
sufficient information covering the applicant's education, training,
experience, and other characteristics as to permit a sound determination
concerning his/her qualifications for the position being filled. The City
Manager may reject an application which indicates that the applicant is
deficient in any or all of the requirements of the position being filled. An
applicant shall also be rejected when there is evidence of fraud or deception
in the completion of his/her application, or if his/her past record of
employment or conduct is determined to be unsatisfactory by the City Manager.
   (c)   Filling of Vacancies.
      (1)   Referral of qualified applicants. Vacancies may be filled by
qualified applicants from within or from outside the City organization who are
referred by the City Manager to the selecting official. The City encourages
promotion from within when possible and accordingly may confine competition to
members of the City workforce if such is determined to be in the best interest
of the City. Names of candidates from inside and outside the City organization
may be referred simultaneously by the City Manager, however, selecting
officials shall place special emphasis on internal promotion when selecting for
City positions.
The number of candidates referred shall be determined by the City Manager.
However, in no case shall any applicant be referred for a position for which
he/she does not meet the minimum qualifications for the position as determined
by the City Manager.
      (2)    Employment rosters. The City Manager may conduct periodic
competition as needed for high turnover positions in order to establish a
roster of eligible candidates for such position. The ranking and rating of
applicants on such rosters shall be based on merit and shall not include non-
job related criteria. Rosters shall remain in effect until all names are
exhausted or the Personnel Department has determined the need to expand a
particular roster.
   (d)   Examinations.  Examinations shall be for the sole purpose of
identifying and ranking well-qualified and suitable candidates in relation to
the qualification standards established for the position to be filled. All
examinations used by the City to identify and rank candidates for employment,
promotion, or training shall be designed to ensure that they do not
discriminate by race, color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status,
religion, sex, disability, or any other non-merit factor and that they are job
related, reliable, and identify well qualified candidates for the position to
be filled. For the purpose of this article, examinations will be given to all
candidates for a position and may include: performance testing (job sample or
skill testing), written examinations, unassembled examinations (rating of
training, experience, and education), oral examinations (interview, including
panel interviews), assessment centers, polygraph (use is restricted to the
selection process for filling entry level positions in the Police and Fire
Division), medical (physical and/or psychological examinations, only upon
conditional offer of employment), and background checks.
   A background check of criminal history shall be obtained on all applicants
for employment positions where, in the interest of public welfare or safety, it
is necessary to determine if the past criminal conduct of a person with a
conviction record would be compatible with the nature of the employment under
consideration. Use of this criminal history record information shall be limited
to the purpose for which it is obtained and may not be disseminated further.
   (e)   Inspection of Examination Results. Each person taking an examination
shall be entitled to inspect his/her own rating and examination papers;
however, such papers shall not be available to the general public. The City
Manager shall retain examination papers for a period of two (2) years from the
date the examination was administered. Inspections shall be permitted only
during regular business hours and shall be conducted by the City Manager in the
presence of an appropriate staff member designated by the City Manager.
Candidates for examinations may request correction of their rating upon written
presentation to the City Manager of proof that their examinations have been
incorrectly rated.
   (f)   Qualification Standards.  Qualification standards are skills,
abilities, knowledge, and other requirements for each position and shall be
used for screening candidates for employment, promotion, and other placement
actions and shall be clearly job related. Qualification standards may be
lowered when necessary to fill a position essential to the delivery of a vital
public service. However, before doing this, consideration shall be given to
restructuring the vacant position or establishing a lower trainee, apprentice,
or helper position.
   Qualification standards shall be based on: a thorough and realistic
appraisal of job requirements, job related experience, education, knowledge,
and skill, as well as personality, attitude, and judgment when such factors are
necessary for successful job performance. Qualification standards shall be
developed by department heads with assistance from the City Manager and shall
be established in writing for each position. Screening and selecting officials
shall interpret the application of such standard prior to screening and/or
selection.
   (g)   Reinstatement of Former Employees.  A former permanent full-time
employee who had completed the required introductory period and left service in
good standing shall be reinstated if reemployed within ninety (90) calendar
days from date of separation from employment, provided they are appointed to a
position at the same title and grade from which they separated. If reinstated,
such persons shall be considered to have been in a leave without pay status
during the period of separation for the purpose of retaining benefit levels,
including longevity, vacation and sick leave, retirement, insurance, and merit
review date.
   (h)   Introductory Period.
      (1)    Purpose of introductory period. The introductory period shall be
an integral part of the examination process and shall be used for closely
observing permanent employees' work performance, attitude, and conduct; for
securing the most effective adjustment of the new employee to his/her position
and work environment; and for rejecting any employee whose performance,
attitude, and/or conduct is not satisfactory.
      (2)    Extension of introductory period. The City Manager may, upon
receipt of acceptable job related justification from the appropriate department
head, extend the prescribed initial introductory period. Requests for extension
of the introductory period shall be in writing and must be received by the City
Manager no later than ten (10) calendar days before expiration of the initial
introductory period. The employee shall be notified in writing of the specific
reasons for such extension.
      (3)   Separation during introductory period. At any time during the
introductory period, the department head, after coordination with the City
Manager, may separate an employee from employment, if in his/her opinion, the
working examination period indicates that such employee is unable or unwilling
to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position or that his/her attitude,
conduct, and/or dependability do not merit his/her continued employment in the
position in question. An employee separated from employment during the
introductory period shall have no appeal or grievance rights against such
separation.
   (i)   Permanent Promotions.  For the purpose of this article the term
"promotion" shall mean a change in status of an employee from a lower position
in one class to a higher position in another class for which a higher rate and
range of pay is prescribed. Unless an exception to competitive requirements is
provided elsewhere in this article, all promotions shall be made on the basis
of normal competitive procedures.
   Under no circumstances shall an employee be promoted (temporarily or
otherwise) whose performance record is less than satisfactory, or whose
performance appraisal has been deferred because of less than satisfactory
performance, until his/her performance has improved and been officially
appraised as being satisfactory or better.
   (j)   Reassignments.  For the purpose of this article, the term
"reassignment" shall mean the change of an employee from one position to
another for which the same rate and range of pay is prescribed. Reassignments
may be at the employee's request for developmental or other reasons, or for
valid management reasons.
   (k)   Demotions.
      (1)    Definition.  For the purpose of this article, the term "demotion" 
shall mean a change in status of an employee from a higher position in one
class to a lower position in another class or equal class for which a lower
rate and range of pay is prescribed.
      (2)    Demotions for less than satisfactory performance.  When
reassignment is not possible or practicable and dismissal is not appropriate,
demotion may be used to change an employee to a position of lower grade and
rate of pay when it becomes necessary to remove an employee from his/her
assigned position for less than satisfactory performance. Proposed actions
under these circumstances shall be closely coordinated with the City Manager by
the department head prior to initiating formal requests for demotion. Demotions
related to less than satisfactory performance shall be considered to be through
fault of the affected employee for the pay setting provisions of this article.
Employees demoted for less than satisfactory performance rather than punitive
reasons shall be given seven (7) calendar days advance written notice of such
demotion and the notice shall inform the employee of the specific reasons for
such demotion.
   (l)   Reduction-in-Force.  A reduction-in-force occurs when a permanent
full-time position or positions are eliminated due to budgetary restrictions,
lack of work, reorganization within departments, or other similar reason.
During a reduction-in-force, the City Manager shall attempt to relocate
permanent full-time employees affected by the action in a manner which results
in the least possible adverse affect upon the employee. This may occur in
several ways:
      (1)    The employee may be reassigned to another vacant position at the
same grade and title;
      (2)    The employee may be encouraged to compete for vacancies available
at a higher grade;
      (3)    The employee may be placed in another position at a lower grade;
or
      (4)    As a last resort, the employee may be separated from employment.
   In all the above cases involving the movement of employees to different
positions, the employee's pay will be administered in such a way as to have the
least possible adverse effect upon the individual. Eight weeks advance written
notice shall be given to employees scheduled to go into jobs at a lower grade
and pay. An employee's pay may not exceed the maximum of the range for the
position to which assigned. However, employees placed in positions at a lower
grade will be placed in the position at the least possible loss of pay.
Employees reassigned to positions at the same grade and title will continue to
receive the same pay as before reduction-in-force. Employees promoted to
positions at a higher grade will have their pay set in accordance with normal
promotion pay setting policies. Employees demoted through reduction-in-force
will remain on a Re-Employment Roster for one year from date of demotion and
will be offered any vacancy occurring at their former title and grade without
competition providing their performance appraisal of record is satisfactory or
better and no serious disciplinary actions are pending.
   Employees separated from employment due to reduction-in-force will remain on
a Re-Employment Roster for one year from date of separation during which time
they will be offered any vacancy occurring at their former grade and title or
other similar vacant positions, at the same grade or below for which they are
qualified and eligible, provided their performance appraisal of record was at
least satisfactory and no serious disciplinary actions were pending at time of
separation.
155.13  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.
   To the extent permitted by authorized funding levels, the City Manager shall
develop and maintain a City-wide Human Resource Development Program designed
to: increase productivity through development of staff capabilities,
disseminate the team approach to management at all levels of supervision
through comprehensive training, encourage promotion from within the City
workforce, and encourage all employees to participate in accomplishing the
City's goals. The program shall consist of two phases, Skills Training and
Employee Development. For the purpose of this article "Skills Training" is
defined as development of a skill needed by an employee which is directly
related to the employee's current duties and responsibilities. "Employee
Development" may include some skills training but is primarily concerned with
the development of employees over a longer period of time for a career with the
City of Moundsville. Budget dollars spent for training should get a return on
the investment by providing a direct input into the achievement of
organizational objectives.
   (a)    Skills training.  Skills training is that training which is designed
to improve an employee's proficiency in his/her current job classification
which includes improving management skills, training in state-of-the-art
changes in equipment, machines or tools, new procedures or techniques,
certification or recertification. Specific examples of skills training are auto
mechanic training on new type of transmission; clerk typist upgrading writing
skills; supervisor receiving training on how to improve decision-making skills.
In summary, skills training should allow a trainee to know something he/she did
not know before training, or to be able to do something he/she could not do
before the training.
   (b)    Employee development.  Employee development is more concerned with
development of employee capabilities over a longer period of time than skills
training. This program is broader and more general in nature. It allows
employees to keep abreast of progress in their occupational fields and enhances
the career potential of the individual. Examples are new managerial techniques,
academic courses, or periodic reviews in an occupational field.
155.14  SEPARATION FROM EMPLOYMENT.
   Separation from employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity
within any organization and many of the reasons for separation are routine. 
Below are examples and definitions of some of the more common circumstances
under which an employee may be separated from employment:
   (a)   Resignation. Resignation is a separation initiated by an employee.
Resignations shall be submitted on a form or format prescribed by the City
Manager and as a minimum shall include date of notice, effective date of
resignation, and the reason(s) for resigning. In the event of an oral
resignation, the department head shall complete the prescribed form to include
the required information plus a statement that it is an oral resignation and
the names of any witnesses thereto. Once a resignation is tendered by an
employee and accepted by the department head or his/her representative, it may
not be withdrawn unless the department head agrees with such withdrawal in
writing.
Employees who wish to resign shall be required to give at least fifteen (15)
calendar days notice in order to be separated in good standing and accorded the
re-employment benefits accruing therefrom. The fifteen calendar days notice may
be waived upon recommendation of the department head, if in his/her opinion
exceptional circumstances warrant such waiver. Employees may be retained in a
duty and pay status or required to use available accumulated vacation leave
during the notice period at the discretion of the department head. Resignations
shall not be requested or demanded by supervisory personnel, nor attempts made
to coerce an employee into resigning. However, the employee may be informed
that he/she has the option of resigning. An employee who wishes to resign while
a dismissal is pending may do so, provided the department head wishes to accept
the resignation. An employee who resigns pending dismissal shall forfeit his/
her grievance rights.
   (b)   Retirement. Retirement is a separation from employment generally
initiated voluntarily by an eligible employee. In certain limited
circumstances, where necessitated by a bona fide occupational qualification
reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the City of Moundsville's
business, the City of Moundsville may require mandatory retirement.
An employee reaches retirement age when his/her years of service plus his/her
age is equal to 70 or greater.
   (c)   Abandonment of Position.  An employee who, without justification
acceptable to the department head concerned, fails to report to work for three
(3) consecutive work days shall be dismissed by reason of abandonment of
position. An employee separated for this reason shall not be considered to have
been separated in good standing. No specific advance notice shall be required,
but a reasonable effort shall be made by the department head to locate the
employee at his/her address or telephone number of record to ascertain the
reason for such absence and the employee's intentions prior to initiation of
dismissal of the employee.
   (d)   Separation During Introductory Period.  An employee shall be separated
during the introductory period if he/she fails to demonstrate that he/she
possesses the skills or character traits necessary for satisfactory performance
in the position. The employee shall be notified in writing by the department
head of the reasons for and the effective date of the separation as well as
his/her employment status during any notice given. Normally, an employee shall
be given seven (7) calendar days advance written notice of separation during
the introductory period. Except in instances where his/her continued presence
on the job would constitute a hazard to himself/herself or others or would
otherwise reflect adversely on the City, the employee shall be retained in a
duty and pay status during the notice period.
   (e)   Reduction-in-Force.  Normally, and subject only to availability of
funds, employees selected for separation by reason of reduction-in-force shall
be given fifteen (15) calendar days advance written notice of such separation
by the City Manager and, except for leave (vacation, sick, and/or leave without
pay) requested by the employee and granted by the department head, the employee
shall be retained in a duty and pay status for the duration of the notice
period. (See Section
155.12 for reduction-in-force policies and procedures.)
   (f)   Termination. Termination is an involuntary separation initiated by the
City of Moundsville.  All employees, except Civil Service, are employed at will
and may be dismissed with or without cause any time during their employment.
155.15  PERSONNEL RECORDS AND PROCEDURES.
   The City Manager shall be responsible for the development and maintenance of
all forms, records, and procedures required to formalize employment with the
City of Moundsville, and particularly those required to effectively implement
this article. All official personnel records, including individual personnel
folders, training records, applicant supply files, etc., shall be maintained by
and kept in the custody of the City Manager. The only personnel record to be
maintained by department managers shall be a "Supervisor's Record of Employee"
designed by the City Manager. The term "personnel records" as used herein shall
not include time and attendance reports or leave and payroll records, which are
maintained by the Director of Finance.
   (a)   Employee Transaction Form. An Employee Transaction Form properly
authenticated by the City Manager (or his/her designated representative) shall
be the only means by which an employee may be appointed, promoted, demoted,
reassigned, suspended from duty and pay, placed on extended leave without pay
(30 days or more), placed on Workers' Compensation, granted a merit increase,
granted incentive pay, or otherwise have his/her individual rate of pay or
official employment status changed. Annotation of pay vouchers shall not be
used for these purposes and such annotations shall not be effected by the
Director of Finance unless supported by a properly authenticated Employee
Transaction Form.
   (b)   Disclosure of personnel data.  Information and data maintained by the
City Manager concerning employees of the City of Moundsville is intended for
official use by the City Manager or other City departments who have a valid
need for such information and shall be disclosed only as prescribed herein.
      (1)   Information requested by City departments. Routine information such
as verification of employment dates and other such information shall be given
to representatives of departments of the City if:
         A.   It is certain that they have a valid need for such information;
and
         B.   The information supplied is concerning an employee of that
department. Information requested by a department concerning an employee of
another City department shall not be provided unless the requesting department
has valid need for such information. All such requests shall be referred to the
City Manager or his/her designated representative. The City Manager shall
ensure that the individual making the request is indeed a City employee and
that the requested information is necessary in the performance of the
requestor's job.
      (2)   Information requested by employees.  Employees of the City of
Moundsville have the right to review any information maintained on them in
their official personnel folder. Individuals may review information in their
own personnel folder by representing themselves at the Office of the City
Manager between the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
Monday through Friday except on official holidays. Positive proof of
identification shall be shown before an individual's official personnel folder
may be reviewed.
      (3)   Information requested by individuals outside of the City
organization.  Requests for information concerning City employees are often
received from Federal agencies, credit bureaus, individual employers, and
others. The following information may be given in response to these requests:
         A.   Verification of name.
         B.   Verification of employment:
            (1)   Present employees. State that the employee is employed by the
City.
            (2)   Terminated employees. Dates of employment may be given,
however, reason for termination may not be given.
         C.   Salaries of employees who earn in excess of ten thousand dollars
($10,000) are a matter of public record, but will be released only upon
request.
      (4)   Employee releases. All requests for information other than
verification of name and employment except as defined in subsection (3)(C)
hereof, shall be made in writing and shall contain a statement, signed by the
affected person, requesting that information contained in his/her personnel
records be released. Under no other circumstances shall information be released
to individuals outside of the City organization.
155.16  SCHEDULING OF WORK.
   (a)   Department heads shall be responsible for scheduling the work within
their departments to include hours of work, rest and lunch periods, and make
ready and clean-up time. When possible, a minimum of one week's notice shall be
given when employees are to be assigned to a different tour of duty or to
different hours of duty. Department heads should assure that changes in
established work schedules are kept to a minimum and made only when necessary
to resolve operational problems.
      (1)   "Administrative workweek" means that seven (7) consecutive calendar
days constitute an administrative workweek. The City of Moundsville
administrative workweek begins at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and ends at 12:00 p.m. on
the following Saturday. For certain part-time employees who do not participate
in the City's direct deposit pay process, the City Manager has the authority to
establish an alternative administrative workweek. The calendar day on which a
shift begins is considered the day of duty for that day even though the work
schedule may extend into the next calendar day or into the following
administrative workweek.
      (2)   "Regular workday" means the regular workday for most City employees
shall be five, eight (8)-hour days, Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:
00 p.m. Flex time may be used at the discretion of the City Manager when such
use will increase efficiency of operations.
      (3)   "Posting work schedules" means all department heads shall:
         A.   Post copies of work schedules in the work areas and maintain a
copy in the operating office for review.
         B.   Review work requirements periodically for changes which may
affect the payment of premium compensation (overtime and holiday) and revise
work schedules where necessary.
      (4)   "Rest periods" means short rest periods, not exceeding fifteen (15)
minutes during each four (4) hours of continuous work. Rest periods may be
granted when the department head believes they will be of benefit to his/her
operation. Criteria to be followed in determining the justification for
granting rest periods are:
         A.   Protection of employee's health by relief from hazardous work or
work which requires continual or considerable physical exercise.
         B.   Reduction of accident rate by removal of the fatigue potential.
         C.   Work in confined spaces or in areas where normal personal
activities are restricted.
         D.   Possible increase in, or maintenance of, high quality or quantity
production attributable to the rest period.
      (5)   "Lunch periods" means lunch (or other meal) periods, during which
the employee is entirely free of the duties of his/her position and are not
considered as duty time for which compensation is paid. Supervisors generally
schedule time for lunch apart from the hours of duty.  Duty-free lunch periods
during periods of overtime work are not compensable time.
Where the work situation will not permit time off for lunch, an on-the-job
lunch period of thirty (30) minutes or less may be authorized and included in
the regular scheduled tour of duty. Such workers must spend their on-the-job
lunch period at or near their work stations. Under these conditions, the time
covered by the thirty (30) minute on-the-job lunch period is compensable.
      (6)   "Make ready and clean-up time" means incidental duties that are
directly connected with the performance of a job, such as obtaining and
replacing work tools or materials, undergoing inspections, and similar tasks,
which shall be considered part of the job requirements within the established
tours of duty. When work shifts overlap, the shifts will be arranged so that
time required for incidental duties will be part of the eight (8)-hour day.
When incidental duties cannot be made a part of the regularly scheduled
workday, the extra time for which overtime is payable shall not exceed thirty
(30) minutes a day.
155.17  FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS.
   (a)   Fire Department.  Members of the Fire Department shall be compensated
as follows:
      (1)   All new employees will be paid at the normal rate without regard to
an introductory period. (Passed 9-1-98)
      (2)   Each fireman shall receive longevity pay, in addition to the

and an additional seventy five dollars ($75.00) per year for each successive
year.
         (Passed 5-15-18.)
   (b)   Police Department.  Employees of the Police Department shall be
compensated as follows:
      (1)    Upon successfully completing an introductory period a police
officer will be administratively classified as a Patrolman First Class (PFC)
for the purposes of a pay increase only. This classification shall be automatic
and will not constitute a promotion for civil service purposes. The City
Manager shall develop and administer the pay ranges for this classification in
accordance with Section
l55.09(a)(2) of these Employee Policy Regulations. (Passed 8-1-06.)
      (2)   Each policeman shall receive longevity pay, in addition to the
employee’s base pay, as follows:  After two full years of completed service,
employees shall receive seventy five dollars ($75.00) per year longevity pay
and an additional seventy five dollars ($75.00) per year for each successive

         (Passed 5-15-18.)
      (3)    The salaries of the present members of the Police Department are
based upon a base salary, plus the increases set forth in subsection (b)(2)
herein. At the beginning of each fiscal year hereafter, each present member of
the Police Department shall receive any salary increase to which he/she would
be entitled under subsection (b)(2) based upon his/her years of service.
      (4)    Each policeman hired after the effective date of this section
shall receive his/her full clothing allowance per fiscal year (this includes
introductory police officers). Introductory police officers who fail to
complete their introductory period will refund all clothing allowance money.
      (5)   Clothing allowances shall be payable in such amounts and at such
times as the Chief of Police and City Manager may determine. Payment shall be
made only upon the presentation of purchase orders to the Chief of Police and
City Manager for their approval and signatures. (Passed 8-1-06)
      (6)   Each newly hired police officer shall receive a lump sum sign-on
bonus of $2,000.00.  Should the police officer leave employment of the city
within two (2) years of being hired, said officer shall be liable and required
to reimburse and pay the city back the full amount thereof.
         (Passed 5-15-18.)
   (c)   Application.  This policy article shall apply to only those benefits
and regulations not specifically defined for Police Departments and Fire
Departments in WV Code under Chapter 8 and other chapters referring to Civil
Service Employees.
155.18  OCCUPATIONAL INJURY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.
   (a)   Adoption: There is hereby adopted and established an Occupational
Injury Management Program. Said program shall comply with the provisions of the
Return-To-Work Program of any Worker's Compensation provider in its present or
any amended form, or any like program replacing the same or a future program
with similar goals.
   (b)   Policy. The City of Moundsville is committed to providing a safe and
healthy workplace for our employees. Preventing injuries and illnesses is our
primary objective. We recognize our responsibility to our employees who suffer
work-related injury or illness. In order to meet our responsibilities to our
employees, the City of Moundsville establishes this Return-To-Work (RTW)
program. The City of Moundsville desires to return an injured employee to
modified or alternative work as soon as possible after a work-related injury or
illness. When necessary, this will be done by temporarily modifying the
employee's job or providing the employee with an alternative position. The
employee's medical condition, along with any limitations or restrictions given
by the attending physician, will be considered as priorities when identifying
the modified/alternative position.
   (c)   Purpose. The program is intended to provide City of Moundsville
employees with an opportunity to continue as valuable members of our work force
while recovering from a work-related injury or illness. We also want to
minimize any adverse effects of an off-the-job injury or illness to any of our
employees and return the employee to his/her original job. This program is
intended to benefit an injured employee by promoting a speedy recovery while
keeping their work patterns and income consistent. The City of Moundsville
shares in the benefits by having our employees retain their work skills, thus
contributing to our overall productivity.
   (d)   Goals. If an employee is injured, the City of Moundsville will
endeavor to return the injured employee to modified or alternative work as soon
after the injury as possible. This will be done by temporarily modifying the
employee's job or providing the employee with an alternative position. The
employee's medical condition along with any limitations or restrictions given
by the attending physician will be considered as a priority when identifying
the modified/alternative position.
   (e)   Scope. This program applies to all employees of the City of
Moundsville. All employees are required to comply with the program.
   (f)   Authority. The City Manager is hereby authorized to take all necessary
actions to implement and effectively supervise the program, including but not
limited to, providing for or creating alternative productive work for injured

155.20  DRUG FREE WORKPLACE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY.
   (a)   Drug Free Workplace And Substance Abuse Testing.
I.    STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   The City of Moundsville (the City) is committed to protecting the safety,
health, and well being of all employees, citizens, and the public. The City
also recognizes that drug and alcohol abuse can jeopardize City assets and
equipment. We recognize that alcohol and drug abuse can pose a significant
threat to our goals.
We have established a drug free workplace program that balances our respect for
individuals with the need to maintain an alcohol and drug free environment. The
City will neither condone nor tolerate behaviors on the part of employees that
relate to substance use, such as:
   a.   Use of illegal drugs;
   b.   Misuse of alcohol;
   c.   Sale or offer of sale, possession, purchase, transfer, use or
possession of any illegal drugs;
   d.   Arrival or return to work under the influence of any drug (legal or
illegal) to the extent that job performance is affected.
   Management is fully committed to the City's Drug-Free Workplace Program,
which establishes clear guidelines for acceptable and unacceptable employee
behavior for everyone in the workplace. Substance abuse is a violation of this
Policy. Behaviors related to substance use can endanger all employees, not just
substance users. Compliance with this Policy is a condition of employment and
applies whenever anyone is representing or conducting business or work for the
City.
   This section (referred to as "the Policy") describes our City's Drug-Free
Workplace Program, and every employee is expected to read and understand it.
The Policy applies to every City employee and also applies to contractors and
subcontractors who perform work for the City. The consequences stated in this
Drug-Free Workplace Policy will apply to anyone who violates the Policy. It is
the intent of the City and this Policy to comply with all Federal and State
regulations pertaining to a Drug-Free Workplace.
   The City holds all employees accountable in terms of substance abuse. The
City also supports getting help for employees. Employees who come forward
voluntarily to identify they have a substance problem may receive City support
and assistance via the Health Insurance Benefit Program, if applicable.
However, if an employee has a substance problem and does not come forward, and
the employee then tests positive for drug or alcohol use in violation of this
Policy, the City reserves the right to discipline the employee (including
termination of employment) for violation of this work rule.  Employees whose
jobs are subject to any special law or regulation may face additional
requirements in terms of substance use. Other consequences that apply to all
employees who violate this Policy are clearly spelled out within this document.
   The Policy and Substance Abuse Program go into effect upon approval by City
Council. This Policy covers the five key parts of the City's Drug-Free
Workplace Program. The five parts consist of:
   1.   A written policy that clearly spells out the program and how everyone
benefits.
   2.    Annual substance awareness education for all employees.
   3.   Training for supervisors regarding their responsibilities.
   4.   Drug and alcohol testing, the most effective way to change harmful
substance use behaviors.
   5.   Employee assistance.
Employees will have the opportunity to receive information about substance use
as a workplace problem, signs and symptoms, dangers of use, and how and where
to get help for themselves and their families. The City Manager will be our
Drug-Free Workplace Program Administrator so everyone knows who to go to for
information or help. The City Manager will be responsible for arranging drug
and alcohol testing, identifying resources that employees can turn to for help
for themselves and/or their families, and arranging for qualified people to
help with employee awareness education and with supervisor training. The Risk
Manager/Safety Coordinator will be the backup administrator when the City
Manager is unavailable.
A.    Prescription Medication:
   Prescription and over-the-counter medications are not prohibited when taken
in standard dosage and/or according to a physician's prescription. Any employee
taking prescribed or over the counter medications will be responsible for
consulting the prescribing physician and/or pharmacist to ascertain whether the
medication may interfere with the safe performance of his/her job. If the use
of a medication could compromise the safety of the employee, fellow employees
or the public, it is the employee's responsibility to use appropriate personnel
procedures, (e.g., call in sick, use leave, request change of duty, notify
supervisor, notify doctor) to avoid unsafe work practices. The illegal or
unauthorized use of prescription drugs is prohibited. It is a violation of the
Drug-Free Workplace Policy to intentionally misuse and/or abuse prescription
medications at work or in a manner that affects work.
B.    Program Protections:
   This program is designed to protect employees from the behaviors of
substance users. Some of the protections built into the program are:
   •   Employee records such as testing results and referrals for help will be
kept confidential. Information will be on a need-to-know basis. Any violation
of confidentiality rights is subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment.
   •   We are committed to employees who have a substance problem getting help.
Each situation will be reviewed individually. Employee assistance may be
available for employees through the health benefits insurance program.
   •   All supervisors will be trained in their duties related to this policy
before this program begins.
   •   Employees will receive initial and annual substance awareness education
from a qualified person to help identify problems and learn where to turn to
for help.
   Testing will be done through a federally certified laboratory that uses the
highest level of care in ensuring results are accurate. This process is very
accurate in detecting the substances that the City is concerned about as being
present in the employee's "system" in sufficient quantity to lead to behaviors
which may endanger the person or others. The certified lab will ensure fairness
and accuracy, and provide for a Medical Review Officer (MRO), who is a trained
physician. The MRO is responsible for checking whether there is a valid reason
for the presence of the substance in the employee's system. The MRO is an
expert in substance use. When the MRO receives positive test results, the MRO
will contact the employee and any appropriate health care provider to determine
whether there is a valid reason for the presence of the drug in the person's
system.
   •   The drug testing program consists of a split sample which allows for the
employee to request for a second test on the same sample to be completed by an
independent laboratory at the employee's expense.
   •   Cut-off levels for each drug and for alcohol are established based on
federal guidelines. There are many other protections for employees that are
built into the process.
   •   An employee's violation of this policy will not be reported to law
enforcement unless required by a regulatory body or criminal statute, such as,
but not limited to, drug trafficking. However, in protection of the workforce,
law enforcement may be requested to come onto City property in conjunction with
a referral for criminal prosecution.
   •   The Federal Drug-Free Workplace Program requires that any employee who
is convicted of a drug related offense in the workplace must notify the City in
writing within five days of the conviction. Examples of such convictions would
be, but not limited to, possession, use, or distribution of illegal drugs in
the workplace.
C.   Employee Awareness Education:
   Every current employee will be required to attend an educational awareness
session in which this program is discussed. There will be an opportunity to ask
questions. The written Policy will be shared and everyone will be expected to
sign for receipt. A qualified person will explain why and how substance use is
a workplace problem, the effects, signs/symptoms of use, effects of commonly
used drugs in the workplace, and how to get help. Also covered in the training
will be guidelines as to how an employee can get a referral for employee
assistance via the employee's health insurance benefits program, the importance
of determining how much of a substance problem the employee has, and what type
of help is needed. New employees will hear about the program during orientation
and will receive substance education as soon as possible thereafter.
D.   Supervisor Training:
   Supervisors will be trained to recognize substance use problems that may
endanger the employee and others as well as violate this Policy. This training
is in addition to annual employee education. Supervisors will be trained about
testing, responsibilities, how to recognize behaviors that demonstrate an
alcohol/drug problem, and how to recommend an employee referral for help.
E.   Drug and Alcohol Testing:
   Testing will be in compliance with Mandatory Guidelines for Federal
Workplace Drug Testing and is intended to detect problems, deter usage, and
allow appropriate corrective action. In addition to alcohol, the drugs being
tested for are:
   •   Amphetamines (speed, uppers)
   •   Cocaine (including Crack)
   •   Marijuana
   •    Opiates (Codeine, Morphine)
   •    Phencyclidine (PCP, "angel dust")
F.   Employee Assistance:
   The City believes in offering assistance to employees with a substance
problem. Although the City does not have a rehabilitation program and will not
pay for an employee to attend a program, City Management is supportive of
employees taking action on their own behalf to address a substance problem. To
help those who come forward voluntarily, a list of local community resources
will be available. When an employee is determined to have a substance problem,
the City Manager will meet with the person to discuss the problem and any
violation of this Policy. To continue employment, the employee must agree to an
assessment by a Substance Abuse Professional to determine the extent of the
problem. This is required in order to correct the problem and be able to avoid
violating the City Policy in the future. The City reserves the right to
terminate based on a positive test.
II.    FREQUENCY AND SITUATIONS WHEN TESTING OCCURS.
   Individuals or employees will be tested for the presence of drugs in the
urine and/or alcohol on the breath under any and/or all of the conditions
outlined below:
A.   Post-Offer, Pre-Employment Medical Examination and Drug Testing:
   As part of the City's employment procedures, all applicants will be required
to undergo a post-offer, pre-employment medical examination and drug screen/
test that is conducted by a contractor designated by the City. Any offer of
employment is contingent upon, among other things, satisfactory completion of
this examination and/or screening, and the determination by the City and its
examining physician that the applicant is capable of performing the
responsibilities of the position that has been offered. If the applicant is
found to be in violation of the Drug-Free Workplace Policy, the offer of
employment can be withdrawn, and, at the option of management, the applicant
may not be permitted to reapply in the future.
B.   Reasonable Suspicion Testing:
   Reasonable suspicion testing will occur when City management and/or
supervision has reason to suspect that an employee may be in violation of this
Policy. The suspicion must be documented in writing within 24 hours of the
event giving rise to the reasonable suspicion or prior to the release of the
test findings on the "Report of Suspected Job-Related Drug or Alcohol Use"
form.
   Reasonable suspicion testing may be based upon, among other things:
   1.   Observed behavior, such as direct observation of drug/alcohol use or
possession and/or the physical symptoms of drug and/or alcohol use;
   2.   A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior, including but not
limited to, increased absenteeism, exhaustion, withdrawal from others, violent
behavior, difficulty in recalling instructions, and taking needless risks;
   3.   Arrest or conviction for a drug-related offense or the identification
of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into illegal drug
possession, use, or trafficking. The employee is responsible for notification
to the City, within five (5) working days, of any drug-related conviction;
   4.   Information provided either by reliable and credible sources or
independently corroborated regarding an employee's substance use; or
   5.   Newly discovered evidence that the employee has tampered with a
previous drug or alcohol test.
   Reasonable suspicion testing does not require certainty, but mere "hunches"
are not sufficient to justify testing. To prevent this, all supervisors will be
trained in the recognition of drug and alcohol-related signs and symptoms.
Reasonable suspicion testing may be for drugs or alcohol or both.
C.   Post-Accident Testing:
   Post-accident testing will be conducted whenever an accident occurs as
defined below. For purposes of this policy, an accident is considered an
unplanned, unexpected, or unintended event that occurs on City property, during
the conduct of the City's business or during working hours, which involves
City-supplied motor vehicles or motor vehicles that are used in conducting City
business, or is within the scope of employment, and which results in any of the
following:
(I)   A fatality of anyone involved in the accident;
(II)   Bodily injury to the employee and/or another person that requires off-
site medical attention away from the City's place of employment;
(III)   Vehicular damage is rated and recorded by the investigating police
officer. The "Extent of Damage" is estimated and recorded on page 1 of the West
Virginia Uniform Traffic Crash Report (DMV-17-F) by the investigating police
officer. The rating levels are 0-6.  When the extent of damage is rated as
category level 3 or higher, drug and/or alcohol testing shall be performed.
   •   Category level 0 (no damage). No apparent damage to vehicle.
   •   Category level 1 (very minor damage). Damage of a cosmetic nature, e.g.;
paint scratches, tire scuff marks, but no dents or missing trim pieces.
   •    Category level 2 (minor damage). Dented but repairable, e.g.; blown
tires, broken windshield or window, missing trim pieces, small dents but no
creased metal parts.
   •   Category level 3 (moderate damage). Vehicle quarter panels/fenders are
dented or creased. Broken or missing parts can be replaced or repaired. Vehicle
frame or unibody is not damaged. Includes engine compartment fires.
   •   Category level 4 (severe damage). Vehicle not driveable but salvageable.
   •   Category level 5 (very severe damage). Vehicle is not salvageable.
   •   Category level 6 (unknown damage). Extent of vehicle damage is unknown
to the investigating officer, e.g.; unidentified hit and run, vehicle fleeing
crash scene; vehicle repaired prior to investigation.
(IV)   Non-vehicular damage in apparent excess of $1,000.00
(For additional requirements for Commercial Driver Licensed employees regarding
post-accident testing, see Section
155.20(b) below).
When such an accident results in one of the situations above, any employee who
may have contributed to the accident will be tested for drugs or alcohol or
both.
Drug and/or Alcohol Testing after an Accident:
   Urine specimen collection (for a drug test) or breath/saliva (for an alcohol
test) is to occur immediately after a need has been determined. At no time
shall a drug specimen be collected after 32 hours from the time of an
employment-related incident. Breath or saliva alcohol testing will be performed
within two (2) hours of the incident whenever possible, but within eight (8)
hours, or it won't be performed but will be documented. If the employee
responsible for an employment-related accident is injured, it is a condition of
employment that the employee herein expressly grants unto the City, its
officers, and management, the right to request that attending medical personnel
obtain appropriate specimens (breath, blood and/or urine) for the purpose of
conducting alcohol and/or drug testing. Further, all employees herein expressly
grant unto the City, its officers and management, access to any and all other
medical information that may be relevant in conducting a complete and thorough
investigation of the employment-related accident, to include but not be limited
to, a full medical report from the examining physician(s) or other health care
providers.
   (For additional requirements for Commercial Driver Licensed employees
regarding post-accident testing, see Section
155.20(b) below).
D.   Return-to-Duty Testing:
   Every employee who tests positive when tested pursuant to this policy and is
not terminated in accordance with this policy must undergo and pass drug and/or
alcohol tests prior to returning to duty. The City may test for both drugs and
alcohol even though the employee initially tested positive for only one of
those substances. This test does not create any right to return to work, but is
a condition to such return. The City will terminate any employee who fails to
pass his/her return-to-duty drug/alcohol test and may refer the employee to a
substance abuse professional for consultation.
E.   Follow up Testing after Return to Work from Assessment or Treatment:
   Every employee who is given the opportunity to participate in a
rehabilitation program in lieu of termination after a violation of this policy
shall be subjected to at least six (6) periodic, unannounced tests in the first
twelve (12) months following his/her return-to-duty. A substance abuse
professional may suggest additional testing of an employee, not to exceed sixty
(60) months, from the date of the employee's return-to-duty. The City may test
for both drugs and alcohol even though the employee initially tested positive
only to one of those substances. The City may terminate any employee who fails
to pass the drug/alcohol test and may refer the employee to a substance abuse
professional for consultation.
F.   Random Drug Testing:
   Random drug testing will include all Safety-Sensitive employees who have and
use Commercial Drivers Licenses as a part of their job-related activities with
the City and who are required by federal law to have random drug testing.
Further criteria and rules for these employees are set forth hereafter in
Section
155.20(b) relating to Substance Abuse Drug and Alcohol Policy and Procedures
for Department of Transportation (DOT) Commercial Drivers' Licensed (CDL)
Employees of the City of Moundsville.
III.   SUBSTANCES TO BE TESTED FOR AND THE METHODS OF TESTING.
   Systems presence testing is the procedure that is used to identify the
presence of controlled substances or alcohol that may be present. Drug testing
includes a split specimen procedural safeguard. Each urine specimen is
subdivided into two bottles. If the specimen tests positive, an employee may
request (at his/her expense) an analysis of the specimen by another testing
facility. The request for split specimen testing must be made within 72 hours
from the time of notification of the positive result. The request must be made
to the MRO. Detection thresholds (or cut-off levels) are standards that have
been established by the DHHS for each drug after years of research. These
levels will be used to interpret all drug tests, whether for a pre-employment
examination, reasonable suspicion test, random, post-accident test, or follow
up test.
   Breath alcohol testing will be conducted by a testing contractor that uses
only certified equipment and personnel. Breath alcohol concentrations exceeding
.04 percent will be considered a verified positive result. In the event of an
accident where an employee has a "whole blood" alcohol drawn at a medical
treatment facility, a result equal to or greater than .04 percent shall be
considered to be a verified positive result. An Evidentiary Breath Test (EBT)
is used to confirm any initial positive test result. The City also expressly
reserves the right to add or delete substances on the list above, especially if
mandated by changes in existing Federal, State, or local regulations or
legislation.
A.   Refusal to Submit to Drug/Alcohol Testing:
   The City may suspend or terminate an employee, pending a full investigation
of the situation, who refuses to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing. Refusal
to submit to drug/alcohol testing may include failing to sign a Consent and
Release form for drug/alcohol testing, intentionally failing to provide a
sample, or tampering with a sample.
B.   Testing Procedures and Safeguards:
   The testing facility will afford applicants and employees subject to testing
the opportunity, prior to testing, to list all prescription and non-
prescription drugs they have used in the last thirty (30) days and to explain
the circumstances surrounding the use of such drugs. Applicants and employees
subject to testing must sign, prior to testing, any required form(s).
   Drug testing includes a split specimen procedural safeguard. Each urine
specimen is subdivided into two bottles. If the specimen tests positive, an
employee, at his or her own expense, may request an analysis of the other
specimen by another testing facility. (The request for split specimen testing
must be made within 72 hours from the time of notification of the positive
result. The request must be made to the MRO).  Alcohol testing includes a
confirmation breath testing procedural safeguard. The testing facility will
conduct two alcohol breath tests within a 15 to 20 minute interval. The testing
facility will record the lowest reading. Test results and related information
will be treated confidentially and divulged to City management only on a need-
to-know basis.
C.    Result of Positive-Drug or Alcohol Test:
   If an applicant tests positive as determined by the Medical Review Officer
(MRO) for drugs and/or alcohol, the City will terminate the hiring process. The
City will, however, give the applicant an opportunity to explain the positive
test result to a Medical Review Officer who will determine whether or not a
"positive" result should be reported to the employer. An alcohol concentration
of 0.04 constitutes a "positive" result. Although not a "positive" result, any
employee found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less
than 0.04 will be removed from his/her safety-sensitive position until the
start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than
24 hours following administration of the test.
   If a driver tests positive for drugs and/or alcohol and is not terminated
(i.e. tests positive under random testing), he/she will be removed from
commercial motor vehicle operation until he/she (1) tests negative for drug
and/or alcohol use; (2) is re-evaluated by a substance abuse professional; and
(3) is subject to unannounced follow-up testing. Compliance with the prescribed
treatment and passing the test(s) will not, however, guarantee a right of re-
employment.
D.   Referral Education and Treatment:
   To assist employees in understanding and avoiding the perils of drug and
alcohol abuse, employees should contact the City's substance abuse
professional, who can answer questions concerning this substance abuse policy
and procedure, the effects of alcohol and drug abuse, and rehabilitation
opportunities. The City encourages employees who believe they have a drug or
alcohol problem to seek the assistance of the City's substance abuse
professional. The substance abuse professional may refer the employee to a
rehabilitation program at the employee's expense.
   Employees who voluntarily request the substance abuse professional's
assistance in dealing with an alcohol or drug abuse problem prior to having
been caught in violation of this policy may do so without the knowledge of the
City and without suffering any disciplinary action. However, voluntary requests
for assistance will not prevent disciplinary action for subsequent violations
of this policy, as employees who undergo treatment for substance abuse must
meet all established standards of conduct and job performance. While the City
encourages voluntary drug and alcohol abuse treatment, it will take strong
action against employees who do not seek treatment on their own and who violate
this policy.
   In addition to any disciplinary action described in this policy, the City
will refer the employee to a substance abuse professional for assessment and
treatment for alcohol and/or drug abuse.
IV.   SPECIMEN COLLECTION PROCEDURE.
   Testing shall be conducted by trained collection personnel who meet quality
assurance and chain-of-custody requirements for urine collection and breath
alcohol testing. Confidentiality is required from our labs. Any individual
subject to testing under this Policy shall be permitted to provide urine
specimens in private, but subject to strict scrutiny by collection personnel so
as to avoid any alteration or substitution of the specimen to be provided.
Breath alcohol testing will likewise be done in an area that affords the
individual privacy. In all cases, there will only be one individual tested at a
time. Failure to appear for testing when scheduled shall be considered refusal
to participate in testing, and will subject an employee to a range of
disciplinary actions, including dismissal, and an applicant to the cancellation
of an offer of employment.
V.   REVIEW OF TEST RESULTS
   To ensure that every employee who is subjected to drug and alcohol testing
by the City is treated in a fair and impartial manner, the City's contractor
has hired a Medical Review Officer ("MRO"), a medical doctor or doctor of
osteopathic medicine with a specialized knowledge of substance abuse disorders.
The MRO will be able to determine whether there are any valid reasons for the
presence in the employee's system of the substance that was tested positive.
VI.   EMPLOYEES' RIGHTS RELATED TO AN INITIAL POSITIVE TEST RESULT.
   An employee who tests positive under this Policy will be given an
opportunity to explain the findings to the MRO prior to the issuance of a
positive test result to the City. Upon receipt of a confirmed positive finding,
the MRO will attempt to contact the employee by telephone or in person. If
contact is made by the MRO, the employee will be informed of the positive
finding and will be given an opportunity to rebut or explain the findings. The
MRO can request information on recent medical history and on medications taken
within the last thirty days by the employee. If the MRO finds support in the
explanation offered by the employee, the employee may be asked to provide
documentary evidence to support the employee's position (for example, the names
of treating physicians, pharmacies where prescriptions have been filled, etc.)
A failure on the part of the employee to provide such documentary evidence will
result in the issuance of a positive report by the MRO with no attendant
medical explanation. A medical disqualification of the employee will result. If
the employee fails to contact the MRO as instructed, the MRO will issue a
positive report to the City.
VII.   REPORTING OF RESULTS.
   All test results will be reported to the MRO prior to the results being
issued to the City. The MRO will receive a detailed report of the findings of
the specimen from the testing laboratory. Each substance tested for will be
listed, along with the results of the testing. The City will receive a summary
report, and this report will indicate that the employee passed or failed the
test. All of these procedures are intended to be consistent with the most
current guidelines for Medical Review Officers published by the federal DHHS.
VIII.   STORAGE OF TEST RESULTS AND RIGHT TO REVIEW TEST RESULTS.
   All records of drug/alcohol testing will be stored separately and apart from
the employee's general personnel documents. These records shall be maintained
under lock and key at all times, and access is limited to designated City
officials. The information contained in these files shall be utilized only to
properly administer this Policy and to provide to certifying agencies for
review as required by Law. Those designated City officials that shall have
access to these records are charged with the responsibility of maintaining the
confidentiality of these records. Any breach of confidentiality with regard to
these records may be an offense resulting in termination of employment. Any
employees tested under this Policy have the right to review and/or receive a
copy of their respective test results. An employee may request from the City
Manager, in writing, with a duly notarized Employee Request for Release of Drug
Tests Results form, that a copy of the test be provided. The City will use its
best efforts to promptly comply with this request and will issue to the
employee a copy of the results personally or by U.S. Certified Mail, Return
Receipt Requested.
IX.    POSITIVE TEST RESULTS.
   Employees who are found to have a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test
will be immediately taken off safety-sensitive duties and are subject to
discipline up to and including termination.
X.   TERMINATION NOTICES.
   In those cases where substance testing results in the termination of
employment, all termination notices will list "misconduct" as the reason.
Termination shall be deemed "for cause."
   (b)   Substance Abuse Drug And Alcohol Policy And Procedures For Department
Of Transportation (DOT) Commercial Drivers' Licensed (CDL) Employees.
I.   NOTICE OF TESTING.
   In addition to the provisions in Section
155.20(a), those employees who fall within the requirements of "DOT-CDL"
regulations, 49 CFR part 382, "Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and
Testing" and 49 CFR part 383, "Commercial Drivers License Standards:
Requirements and Penalties" shall be subject to the following.
   These policies and procedures will act as notice of Drug and Alcohol Testing
as prescribed by 49 CFR part 40, "Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug
and Alcohol Testing Programs", and is specifically for those employees who fall
within the requirements of "DOT-CDL" regulations, 40 CFR part 382, "Controlled
Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing" and 49 CFR part 383, "Commercial
Drivers License Standards: Requirements and Penalties". Also, "The Drug-Free
Workplace Act of 1983" requires the establishment of a drug-free workplace and
the reporting of certain drug related offenses to the Federal Transit
Administration.
II.   PURPOSE AND GOALS.
   Employees are our most valuable resource and their health and safety is,
therefore, a serious concern. Drug and Alcohol abuse hurts job performance
through increased absenteeism, lower job efficiency, and increased accident
rates. The City will not tolerate the use of drugs or alcohol which could
imperil the health and well-being of its employees, its business, its
reputation, or others. We are committed to maintaining a safe and healthy
workplace, free from the influence of drugs and alcohol.
III.   STANDARDS OF CONDUCT.
   The following actions are prohibited and may result in discipline up to and
including discharge. The reference to employees in a safety-sensitive position
includes employees who hold a commercial driver's license (CDL) and who drive a
DOT rated "CDL" vehicle weighing 26,000 lbs. or over, a vehicle containing
hazardous materials, or a vehicle designed to carry fifteen or more passengers.
These employees will be tested for drugs and alcohol according to a random
selection process as required by law.
1.   Any use, possession, storage, manufacturing, distribution, dispensation,
or selling of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or alcohol during work hours or while

155.21  SAFETY AND HEALTH/LOSS CONTROL HANDBOOK.
   (a)   Safety Program.
      (1)    The City Safety Program is dedicated to providing the safest
working environment possible for all City employees. To this end, each
department head has the full authority to, and total responsibility for,
maintaining safe and healthful working conditions within his/her jurisdiction
whether it be out in the field, in the shop, or in the office. Employees are
also required, as a condition of employment, to exercise due care in the course
of their work to prevent injuries to themselves and to their fellow workers and
to conserve materials. Each employee shall:
         A.    Report all unsafe conditions to his/her supervisor.
         B.    Keep work areas clean and orderly at all times.
         C.    Report all accidents immediately to his/her supervisor.
         D.    Obey all safety rules and follow published work instructions.
         E.    Wear required protective equipment when working in hazardous
operation areas.
         F.    Actively participate and support the safety program.
      (2)    The Department Head has overall responsibility for the development
and administration of the City Safety Program.
         A.    Accident Notification - Reporting and Investigation. Despite the
City's dedication to providing a safe work environment, there will be times
when an accidental injury does occur.
            1.   Notice of accident. Every injured employee or his/her
representative shall immediately on the occurrence of an accident or as soon
thereafter as practicable notify his/her supervisor of the accident. The
supervisor shall ensure that the employee receives prompt medical attention and
that the injured employee is furnished with a "Medical Authorization".
            2.   Reporting. As soon as the injury to the employee is under
control, the supervisor, in cooperation with the injured employee, will arrange
for preparation of the "Employer's First Report of Accident". Copies of the
completed report will be forwarded to the Department Head and City Clerk.
            3.   Investigation. When an accident occurs (even when injury does
not result) the accident must be investigated and findings reported. The
supervisor and other responsible management personnel must ensure that all
facts are obtained relative to the accident. These findings will be the basis
for approving/disapproving compensation claims, implementation of preventive
measures, and/or a basis for disciplinary action. Timely, factual, and complete
reporting are of prime importance for the preceding reasons. One (1) copy of
the investigation report will be forwarded to the City Manager for review and,
when appropriate, necessary action.  (Ord.3/6/12)

public is of primary importance and shall receive first consideration in the
performance of work. Safety is seen as a necessary and integral part of every
job. The Safety and Health Program and specific individual programs, plans, and
procedures have been developed to assure compliance with federal, state, and
local regulations as they apply to City operations.
   In order to maintain the level of safety standards desired by the City, it
is necessary to actively pursue an accident prevention and safe work practices
program throughout all levels of the workforce. Following the Safety and Health
Program is a functional responsibility and expectation of each supervisor and
employee.
   Safety and Health performance is of vital personal and financial interest to

good safety performance. Compliance with this program and safety and health
rules is taken very seriously. Failure to comply is sufficient grounds for
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

damage. The City can realize these objectives through employee compliance with
safety and health procedures as outlined in this manual and through the use of
proper safety equipment.

importance in the accomplishment of every task. Adherence to applicable, sound
safety practices and awareness of changes in the work environment will help
prevent many accidents.
   (d)   Applicability
   Programs and rules cannot be drawn which will exactly meet every condition
which may be encountered. Whenever practical, the person in charge, or the
individual performing the job, will report unusual or exceptional conditions to
his/her immediate supervisor for instructions. The accident prevention
regulations herein set forth are for the purpose of preventing injury to
persons and property. These regulations shall be effective as of the date of

made only with the approval of the City Manager, Risk Management/Safety
Coordinator, and the Staff Safety Committee.
   These regulations shall be strictly interpreted to bring about maximum
compliance. However, if lawful and applicable government regulations are more
applicable or stringent than these regulations, then such governmental
regulations will apply.
   Employees acting in a supervisory capacity, either regularly or temporarily,
shall require all employees working under their jurisdiction to comply with all
applicable safety instructions and safe work practices.

employee may have need to utilize the computer or Internet for brief
communications or for obtaining information of a personal nature. This is
acceptable as normal procedure. However, Department Heads and supervisors are
cautioned against permitting excessive computer or Internet utilization for
personal, social, civic, or other purposes not benefiting the business or
operations of the City. In no case will a City employee use City computers or
Internet access for the purpose of conducting a personal business operation.
Any additional cost that arises from an activity by a City employee that is not
for official City business is the responsibility of the employee.
      (2)   Use of illegal software on City computers is prohibited. Any
software on a city computer for which the user does not have a valid software
registration is illegal. Each installation must have a valid registration. It
is illegal to bring a copy of software installed on a home computer and install
it on a city computer unless the user has a separate office software license,
if so required.
      (3)   Use of computer games is to be monitored. The use of computer games
in City offices creates a poor image when visitors from other departments or
members of the public see City employees using computer equipment to play
games. There are a few computer games that are specifically designed to improve
computer skills for new users. Computer use is to be carefully monitored.
      (4)   Use of data files from home computers is limited. It is permissible
to bring data files from home computers to the office computers, providing the
files are business-related or specific approval for each file is obtained from
the City Manager. It is required that all software or data on copy media or
otherwise, including but not limited to CDs and DVDs, containing files from
outside sources be checked for viruses before being used on city computers.
      (5)   Those found guilty of misusing City computer equipment or Internet
access may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with City policy.
      (6)   Responsibility/Compliance. Department Heads and supervisors within
each department are responsible for ensuring their employees use Internet
resources in an effective, ethical, and lawful manner. Therefore access to the
Internet must be conducted in accordance with the policies and procedures set
forth herein.
      (7)   Non-Employee Access. Access to the City's Internet capability may
be granted to non-employees (i.e., consultants, contract staff, temporary help,
etc.) when there is a clear legitimate need to provide access to these type of
users. Approval must be obtained from the City Manager. All policies and
procedures contained in this directive apply to these type of users, as well as
City employees.
      (8)   Public Records. All internal and internet transactions (i.e. e-
mail, messages, web-pages, files, documents, etc.) carried out while conducting
City business or using City-owned computer resources are considered official
City records and may also be public records as well. Such transactions are not
private when using City equipment, and any such communications may be viewed,
reviewed, intercepted, printed, saved, or deleted by (or at the direction of)
the City Manager. It is the City's policy to prohibit the dissemination of any
confidential information on the Internet that might be harmful to the City's
purposes, its employees, or to public safety.
      (9)   Message Content. All City computer users are responsible for the
content of their messages and files. Fraudulent, harassing, or obscene messages
and/or other materials must not be produced, kept, or transmitted internally or
over the Internet. Messages that harass an individual or group because of sex,
race, religious beliefs, national origin, and/or physical attributes are
prohibited.
      (10)   Internet Network Resource Integrity. City Internet users must not
deliberately attempt to degrade the performance of a computer system or to
deprive authorized personnel of resources or access to any computer system.
Users must not attempt to gain unauthorized entry to resources or attempt to
disrupt the intended use of computers or the Internet. City users must not
destroy the integrity of computer-based information contained on City computers
or on the Internet. It is the City's policy to prohibit the dissemination of
any information that might be harmful to the City's purposes, its employees, or
to public safety. The System Administrator will monitor internal and Internet
performance and may restrict certain activities if they are interfering with
the overall system performance.
      (11)   Bypassing Security Systems. City computer users must not use
loopholes in computer systems or knowledge of a special password to damage
computer systems, obtain extra resources, take resources from another user,
gain access to systems, or use systems for which proper authorization has not
been granted. Messages must not be sent under an assumed name or a modified
address or with the intent to obscure the origin of the message.
      (12)   Use of Disclaimers. It is not acceptable to use the City's
Internet access to express personal views and opinions as if they constitute
official policy of the City of Moundsville. Internet users must clearly
indicate, by disclaimer, that non-official information contained in postings,
e-mail messages, and other information disseminated through the City's Internet
connection does not necessarily represent the views and position of the City of
Moundsville.
      (13)   Personal Gain. City Internet users must not use the Internet to
directly initiate negotiations with others for personal financial gain. City
Internet users must not use a City Internet e-mail account to acquire contacts
for personal financial gain.
      (14)   Illegal Activity. City Internet users must not access the Internet
for purposes that are illegal. Information and resources accessible via the
City Internet access are considered the property of the individuals and
organizations that own the right to those resources and these rights are to be
protected.
      (15)   Access by Dumb Terminals. Access to the Internet is prohibited on
non-intelligent terminals.
      (16)   Approved Internet Providers and Access Methods. Only the methods
and providers of Internet connections approved by management shall be
permitted. Such methods have been determined for both LAN connected personal
computers and stand-alone computers. Only Internet access and search software
approved by the System Administrator shall be used to access the Internet. Such
software is commonly used to find information owned by other Internet users.
The employee shall request the appropriate Internet-related software through
the City's existing technology resource approval process. Using one's personal
account to access the Internet on City equipment is not authorized, unless
approved by the City Manager.
      (17)   Access Request Procedure. The System Administrator is responsible
for providing Internet access and services to employees. If any Department Head
feels that any of his/her employees have abused the Internet privileges, he/she
can deny those privileges to those employees by notifying the System
Administrator in writing. A "Computer Use and Internet Access Request" form is
to be completed for each individual by the employee's supervisor and submitted
to the System Administrator who will keep the completed form on file.
      (18)   Virus Scanning. All personal computers used to access the Internet
shall utilize the virus scanning software approved by the System Administrator
in the start-up process of the computer. All data files and software must be
downloaded onto the user's workstation rather than the server and must be
scanned for viruses immediately upon completion of the transfer to the
workstation. Users will make no attempt to disable current anti-virus software.
      (19)   Web Site Screening. In order to protect the City from liabilities,
the City reserves the right to block access by its employees to web sites that
it considers objectionable, such as those that are fraudulent, harassing, or
obscene.
   (c)   Internet Electronic Mail (e-mail). The intent of this policy is to
identify the City's position concerning the use of electronic mail systems by
employees, managers, and supervisors.  The City's policies and procedures
regarding the proper usage of electronic mail systems shall also apply to
Internet mail (e-mail).
      (1)   Internet e-mail is not a secure medium.
      (2)   Discretion should be used at all times.
      (3)   Write nothing that you would not want to see in public print.
      (4)   E-mail directories fill quickly.
      (5)   E-mail messages should be deleted on a continuous basis.
      (6)   The transmission of chain letters and harassing mail is absolutely
prohibited over the Internet. Any employee receiving such e-mail shall notify
his/her supervisor immediately.
      (7)   The System Administrator has the authority and responsibility for
oversight for the City e-mail communication system.
   Commercial e-mail accounts and instant messaging. The City may employ
commercially available products and practices to protect itself from the
undesirable effects of SPAM e-mail. For security reasons, employees are not
permitted to access their commercial internet e-mail accounts or subscribe to
commercial instant messaging accounts from the City network equipment.
   (d)   Authorized Use. The System Administrator is responsible for placing
authorized employees on the system. The System Administrator will assign a
username and user supplied password, which is to be used confidentially by the
employee, and restrict unauthorized non-City use. Department heads are
responsible for providing the System Administrator with a list of unauthorized
users to be removed from the system.
   (e)   User Responsibilities. The employee is responsible for logging in and
out of the system and for restricting access to the system under his/her
password to City authorized, non-personal use. The employee is responsible for
immediately notifying his/her Department Head and the System Administrator of
the need to change passwords or of any breach of the system. Employees are
responsible for the daily use and content of their messages. Employees should
be reminded that e-mails are not private communication.
   (f)   Monitoring of Use and Violations. The System Administrator, Department
Heads, and their designees are authorized to monitor and record the activities
of users and to review electronic mail (e-mail) to ensure compliance with this
policy. Use of the City's electronic systems implies consent to monitor. If
such monitoring reveals possible criminal activity or policy violation, the
information may be provided to law enforcement officials. Employees found to be
in violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action.
   (g)   Computer Password Policy. Passwords are an important aspect of
computer security. They are the front-line of protection for user accounts. A
poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of the City's entire
computer network. As such, all City of Moundsville employees are responsible
for taking appropriate steps to select and secure their passwords. The System
Administrator is responsible for establishing policy, setting standards, and
enforcement of network computer passwords. Password access to the Internet is
established for the express use of City personnel to enhance their ability to
develop, design, and implement improved methods for delivering City information
and services to the public. It is intended to encourage and promote improved
use of technology and information services for the government. (Passed 3-6-07)
   (h)   Participation in News Groups.  News groups are designed to be a source
of discussion on the Internet. Because what is said in these news groups may be
taken as official City position, approval to participate in a news group and
the clearance of information provided as a participant in a news group must be
given by the employee's supervisor.  If an employee wants to participate in a
news group of a controversial nature, he/she must include a disclaimer that the
author is speaking for himself/herself and not as a representative of the City
of Moundsville.
   (i)   Social Media Policy
   Social networking through the use of Internet-based and other electronic
social media tools has become a part of everyday life; use of Facebook,
LinkedIn, blogging, wikis, and other online social media vehicles is now
commonplace.
   In general, what you do on your own time is a personal decision.  But, often
the lines between work and personal life can become blurred.  Therefore,
activities in or outside of work that affect your job performance, the
performance of others, or City business interests are a proper focus for this
City policy.
   This policy applies to all City of Moundsville personnel who participate in
social media or other internet activity.  The policy applies without regard to
whether the conduct occurs during working or non-working hours.  Similarly, the
policy applies regardless of whether City equipment is used.  This policy
applies to both company sponsored social media and personal use as it relates
to the City.
      (1)   Prohibited Conduct - The City of Moundsville absolutely prohibits
revealing its name on social media or other websites which include sexual,
violent, or illegal content. The City also prohibits language that is
defamatory, harassing, disparaging, or violates obscenity laws.
      (2)   Transparency - If, at any time, you communicate about the City, you
must disclose your affiliation with the City.  And, if you associate yourself
with the City in any way, you must make it clear that you are speaking for
yourself and not on behalf of the City.  In those circumstances, you may want
to include this disclaimer:  "The views and opinions expressed on this [blog;
website] are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer."
      (3)   Quality Matters - Use good judgment and strive for accuracy in your
communications; errors and omissions reflect poorly on the City and may result
in liability for you or the City.
Refrain from any online activity that is inconsistent with, or that reasonably
could be expected to negatively impact, the City's reputation or standing in
the community or with City residents.
Be respectful and professional to everyone, including fellow personnel,
citizens, and visitors.  Do not use profanity.  Do not use language that
violates the City's harassment policy.
      (4)   The Public Nature of Social Media - Information becomes public the
moment it is published on the internet.  City personnel should be mindful of
the public nature of the internet when engaging in conduct online.  Further,
personnel should expect that other employees of the City, including members of
senior management, will see anything that they post online.
      (5)   Protect the Brand - Do not use or incorporate the City's name,
logo, imagery, or derivatives thereof in your address, screen name, home page,
screen imagery, or otherwise without prior written approval from the City.
      (6)   City Policies and Procedures Apply - Your social media activities
are subject to the same policies and procedures as your workplace activities. 
For example, it is inappropriate to engage in sexual harassment while at work;
therefore, it is equally inappropriate to do so through the context of social
media.
This policy is also meant to support and integrate with all other City
personnel policies.  Conduct that violates these policies will be subject to
the same action as set forth in the City's disciplinary policy, up to and
including termination.
      (7)   Confidentiality - Do not discuss or otherwise reveal confidential
matters.  Do not upload, post, or share photographs of City personnel taken at
any City sponsored event, photographs taken inside a City office, or work-
related documents or email exchanges.   
Maintain the confidentiality of City information at all times. 
"Friending" - Exercise discretion in inviting colleagues, and responding to
invitations from colleagues, to join social networks or become "friends."
Between supervisors and subordinates, taking (and reversing) such steps may be
awkward and could even feel coercive.  Among peers, while feelings of inclusion
can have positive effects on working relationships, the corollary feelings of
exclusion can be painful and counterproductive.
      (8)   Watch Any Advice You Give - Do not purport to give advice on legal
matters.  Speak only about issues about which you have knowledge.  Do not
purport to be an expert - even if you believe yourself to be.
      (9)   Don't Waste City Time - Make sure that your online activities do
not interfere with your job performance.  Personal social media use is
restricted to personal time only.  This is no different than it is for phone
calls or e-mails.  You should not use the company's time and/or equipment to
participate in personal use of social media.
      (10)   Duty to Report - Just as you have a duty to report harassment or
other inappropriate workplace conduct, you also have a duty to report any
conduct that violates the rules set forth in this policy.  In the event that
you observe such conduct by any City personnel, you are obligated to comply
with the reporting requirements set forth in the City's other personnel
policies.
If you find a negative, disparaging, or otherwise troublesome post about the
City, let us know.  Please contact the City Manager as soon as possible. 
Please do not respond to it without first receiving instruction, unless you
have specific permission to do so. (Ord. 3/6/12)
   If you have any questions about this policy, please contact the City Manager
for further information or clarification.

significance. No building, structure or site shall be deemed to be an historic
one unless it has been prominently identified with, or best represents, some
major aspect of, or ideals related to, the history of the locality, region,
State or nation. In the case of buildings or structures which are to be so
designated, they shall embody the principal or unique features of an

159.05  CERTIFICATION; AGREEMENT WITH PROPERTY OWNER.
   Whenever the Historic Landmarks Commission with the consent of the property
owner, certifies property as being a registered landmark, it may seek and
obtain from such property owner an agreement as to such restrictions upon the
use of the property as the Historic Landmarks Commission finds are reasonable
and are calculated to perpetuate and preserve the features which led it to
designate such property as an historical landmark. All such agreements between
the Historic Landmarks Commission and the property owner shall be in writing,
and when duly signed  and acknowledged, shall be recorded in the office of the
Clerk of the County Commission, and when so recorded, shall be notification to
the assessor of the restrictions therein set forth.
(Ord. 8-20-13.)
159.06  ASSESSOR NOTIFIED OF DESIGNATION.
   When the Historic Landmarks Commission establishes an historic district, it
shall notify the assessor of the fact of such establishment and the boundaries
of the district, together with the restrictions which are applicable to the
properties located in such district which have been mutually agreed upon by
such Commission and the owners of property within such district. The agreement

and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn.  But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      ((WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:

the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the wait
signal is showing.

subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of  vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising.  This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)

   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses under this
section:
      (1)   Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),

violation occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of
arrest in the current proceeding.

a second or subsequent offense under this section if the person has been
previously arrested for or charged with a violation of this section which is
alleged to have occurred within the applicable time period for prior offenses,
notwithstanding the fact that there has not been a final adjudication of the
charges for the alleged previous offense.  In that case, the warrant or
indictment or information must set forth the date, location and particulars of
the previous offense or offenses.  No person may be convicted of a second or
subsequent offense under this section unless the conviction for the previous
offense has become final, or the person has previously had a period of
conditional probation imposed pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b).
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d) or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection  (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   For purposes of this section, the term “controlled substance” has the
meaning ascribed to it in West Virginia Code Chapter 60A.
   (o)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation: 
provided, that the court may apply the provisions  of West Virginia Code 62-11A
to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for a first
offense under this section:  provided however, that the court may impose a term
of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b) to persons
adjudicated thereunder.  An order for home detention by the court pursuant to
the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B may be used as an alternative
sentence to any period of incarceration required by this section for a first or
subsequent offense:  provided, however, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of second offense under this
section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than five days of
the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave
home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code
62-11B-5:  provided, however, that for any period of home incarceration ordered
for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation  of this section,
electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten days of the total
period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave home for
those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.  (WVaC 17C-5-2)
   (p)   For purposes of this section, the phrase "in this Municipality" means
anywhere within the physical boundaries of this Municipality, including, but
not limited to, publicly maintained streets and highways, and subdivision
streets or other areas not publicly maintained but nonetheless open to the use
of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.
   (q)   When used in this section, the terms or phrases "driving under the
influence of intoxicating liquor," "driving or operating a motor vehicle while
intoxicated," "for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor
to drive any vehicle," or any similar term or phrase shall be construed to mean
and be synonymous with the term or phrase "while under the influence of
alcohol...drives a vehicle" as the latter term or phrase is used in this
section.
   (r)   A warrant or indictment which charges or alleges an offense,
prohibited by the provisions of this section, and which warrant or indictment
uses any of the terms or phrases set forth in subsection (q) hereof, shall not
thereby be fatally defective if such warrant or indictment otherwise informs
the person so accused of the charges against him.  (WVaC 17C-5-2a)
333.011 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (g) hereof, whenever any person who

333.01 or any statute of the United States or of any state relating to driving
under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance or any other drug:
      (1)   Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)   Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under subsection (c) of Section
333.01, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of
the accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding any
provisions of this code to the contrary, place him or her on probation, which
conditions shall include, that he or she successfully completes the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-
3a.  Participation therein shall be for a period of at least 165 days after he
or she has served the fifteen days of license suspension imposed pursuant to
West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2.
   (b)   A defendant’s election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in West Virginia Code 17C- 5A-2.
   (c)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)
(1) hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test
and Lock Program, or if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable
time after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard.  If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Test and Lock
Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statue of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provision, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (d)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges.  This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program.  A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objection on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney.  If there are no
objections filed within the thirty day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant.  If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (c) hereof.
   (e)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1, et seq.  Except as
provided in subsection (j), (k) and (l) of Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial.  No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing or otherwise giving false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as that term is defined in subsection
(l) of Section
333.01.
   (f)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (g)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)   In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision of
Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5 has been charged;
      (2)   If the person holds a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicle(s);
      (3)   The person has previously had his or her driver’s license revoked
under West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(a) or under any statute of the United States
or of any state relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, any
controlled substance or any other drug; or
      (4)   If the person refused the secondary chemical test pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-7.
   (h)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial
and conviction, pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles; provided, that any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard.  If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (i)   Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, any person
prosecuted for a violation of subsection (c) of Section
333.01, whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be liable for any court cost assessable against a person convicted of
subsection (i) of Section
333.01.  Payment of such costs may be made a condition of probation.  The costs
assessed pursuant to this subsection, whether as a term of probation or not,

a physician who shall state the nature of the disability as well as the reason
such restraint is inappropriate.
   (c)   A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages:  provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct
an in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party's failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of.  Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine (1) that the injured party failed to wear
a safety belt, and (2) that the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a
failure to mitigate damages.  The trier of fact may reduce the injured party's
recovery for medical damages by an amount not to exceed five percent (5%)
thereof.  In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of five
percent (5%) of medical damages, the court shall make the calculations and the
issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a safety belt shall not be
presented to the jury.  In all cases, the actual computation of the dollar
amount reduction shall be determined by the court.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, no
points may be entered on any driver's record maintained by the Division of
Motor Vehicles as a result of a violation of this section.

362.03  LIABILITY OF OWNER FOR COSTS.
   The owner or person in charge of any vehicle impounded under the provisions
of this article shall pay the costs of impounding, hauling, driving, towing and
storing such vehicle, in addition to any fine and costs assessed against him
for any violation of the provisions of this Traffic Code or other ordinance of
the City resulting from the parking of such vehicle or otherwise, or arising
out of any act resulting in the impounding of such vehicle.
(Ord. 7-19-94)
362.04  POST-STORAGE HEARINGS FOR IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   (a)   Right to Hearing.  As to any vehicle impounded pursuant to any
ordinance of the City, by its agents or employees, a person who has a legal
entitlement to possession of the vehicle has a right to a post-seizure
administrative hearing to determine whether there was probable cause to impound
the vehicle if such person files a written demand, on forms so provided for
such a hearing, with the City within five days after such person has learned
such vehicle has been impounded or within five days after the mailing of the
date set in the notice of the stored vehicle, whichever occurs first.  The
notice of stored vehicle shall be sent in the mail to the legal and registered
owner or their agent and to the garage where the vehicle is stored within
twenty-four hours, in cases of out-of-state vehicles forty-eight hours,
excluding weekends and holidays, after impounding and storage of the vehicle.
(Ord. 7-19-94)
   (b)   Conduct of Hearing.
      (1)   A hearing shall be conducted before the Municipal Judge within
twenty-four hours of the receipt of a written demand therefor from the person
seeking the hearing unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. 
Saturdays, Sundays and City holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of
the twenty-four hours period.  The sole issue before the Municipal Judge shall
be whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question.
      (2)   "Probable cause to impound" means such a state of facts as would
lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was
sufficient breach of local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for
the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   The Municipal Judge shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner
and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence.  The person demanding
the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the
right to possession of the vehicle.  The Police Department shall carry the
burden of establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in
question.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Municipal Judge shall prepare
a written decision.  A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person
demanding the hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle, if not the
person requesting the hearing.  The Municipal Judge's decision in no way
affects any criminal proceeding in connection with the impound in question and
that criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the
appropriate court.  The decision of the Municipal Judge is final.  Failure of
the registered or legal owner or their agent to request or attend a scheduled
post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing.
   (c)   Decision of the Municipal Judge.  The Municipal Judge shall only
determine that as to the vehicle in issue either there was probable cause to
impound the vehicle or there was no such probable cause, and in the event that
the Municipal Judge determines that there was no probable cause, the Municipal
Judge shall prepare and date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of
which shall be given to the possessor of the vehicle and the Police
Department.  Upon receipt of the possessor's copy of such certificate, the
garage having custody of the vehicle shall release the vehicle to its
possessor.  Upon a finding of no probable cause, towing and storage fees shall
be paid by the City in accordance with arrangements made between the City and
the garage.  If the possessor fails to present such certificate to the garage
having custody of the vehicle within twenty-four hours of its receipt,
excluding such days when the garage is not open for business, the possessor
shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges.  Such certificate
shall advise the possessor of such requirement.
(Ord. 7-19-94)
362.05  CITY NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.
   The City, its agents, officers or employees shall not be liable for any
damages to persons or property resulting directly or indirectly from any act
done or performed under the provisions of this article.
(Ord. 7-19-94)
362.06  AUTHORITY OF CITY MANAGER.
   The City Manager is hereby authorized to rent suitable spaces in garages,
parking lots or elsewhere for the storage and safekeeping of the vehicles
impounded under the provisions of this article.  He is also authorized to enter
into contracts and agreements for the removal, towing and storage of vehicles
coming within the provisions hereof, with persons having equipment suitable for
the hauling away and towing of such vehicles.  The City Manager is also
authorized to issue and promulgate any suitable rules and regulations which he
may deem proper or necessary in order to fulfill, advance and carry into effect
the purposes and provisions of this article.
(Ord. 7-19-94)
362.07  SALE OF UNCLAIMED VEHICLES.
   If any vehicle impounded and stored under the provisions of this article is
not claimed by the owner, operator or other person entitled to the possession
thereof within thirty days from and after the date the same is impounded, such
vehicle may be sold at public auction by the Chief of Police of the City, or by
the persons storing the same under provisions of this article, but before any
such sale shall be made, ten days' notice of the date, place and purpose of
such sale with a description of the vehicle to be sold shall be served upon the
owner of record of such vehicle by registered mail at his last known address
and like notice of such sale shall be published once each week for two
successive weeks prior to the date of such sale in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City.  If the owner of any such vehicle is unknown, then no
notice to such owner shall be necessary but the newspaper publication shall be
made and the facts with regard to the ownership of the vehicle set forth in
such notice.
   In the making of any sale hereunder, the Chief of Police may continue the
same by verbal announcement at the time and place of such sale, and in the
making of any such sale of any such vehicle, he may act by agent or attorney.
   The proceeds from any such sale of any such vehicle shall be applied, first,
to the costs of such sale; second, to the hauling, towing and storage charges
thereof; third, to the payment of any fine and costs incurred by reason of any
violation of the provisions of this Traffic Code or other ordinance of the
City; and fourth, to the payment of any bona fide lien owner who intervenes or
establishes a bona fide claim to such sum.  Any balance remaining shall be paid
to the owner of such vehicle, if he is known, or if unknown, shall be paid to
the general receiver of the Circuit Court of the county, to be disposed of by
him as provided by the statutes of the State.  In the event that no person
shall claim any such funds in the hands of the general receiver for a period of
twenty years, the principal of such fund together with the interest thereon
shall be paid into the General Fund of the City by the general receiver.
(Ord. 7-19-94)
362.08  IMMOBILIZATION OF CERTAIN VEHICLES.
   (a)   Authority of Police.  When any police officer of the City finds on a
City street a vehicle owned by a person who has in the past been cited for a
traffic violation and has failed to respond to such citation as lawfully
required or has failed to pay fines assessed upon such citation, and the police
officer deems it necessary that an immobilizer be used, then such police
officer may immobilize such vehicle by installing or attaching a device thereto
until the owner or driver thereof has satisfied any existing and past
violations in accordance with the ordinances pertaining thereto.
(Ord.  6-21-00)
   (b)   Notice.  Whenever any such vehicle is so immobilized, a notice in
writing, on a form to be prescribed by the Police Chief, shall be conspicuously
affixed to such vehicle advising the owner or driver thereof that such vehicle
has been immobilized for violation of the City ordinances enumerated thereon,
and indicating the procedure to obtain the release of such immobilizer.
   (c)   Moving Vehicle Prior to Obtaining Release Prohibited.  No unauthorized
person shall move any vehicle immobilized pursuant to subsection (a) hereof
prior to obtaining a release thereof from the Judge of the Municipal Court or
from the officer in charge at the City police station.
   (d)   Additional Fine.  The owner or driver of any vehicle which as been
immobilized shall, in addition to the fines and penalties provided for under
the provisions of this Traffic Code, pay a fine of five dollars ($5.00) before
releasing such vehicle.

   (b)    Enforcement.
      (1)    Any Humane Officer, Police Officer, or Animal Warden or their
designee (hereafter "officer") shall have authority for making a preliminary
determination that an animal is dangerous or vicious.
      (2)    If, in the discretion of the officer, such animal determined to be
dangerous or vicious cannot safely be captured and detained, the officer, is
authorized to take immediate and, if necessary, lethal action, against such
animal notwithstanding the fact that no written notice has been communicated to
the owner of the animal and that no hearing into said determination has been
requested or held.
 
   (c)    Notice.  The owner, if able to be identified and located, of any
animal seized pursuant hereto shall be provided written notice, by citation or
otherwise, of the seizure, liability for the cost and care of the animal seized
as provided herein and the right to attend a hearing before the municipal court
judge. Any such notice shall include information that a preliminary
determination has been made that the animal is dangerous or vicious and shall
give a brief narrative providing the owner with the reasons for such
determination. If the owner is unknown or unable to be determined after
diligent inquiry, the notice shall be published one time in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City.
 
   (d)    Temporary Possession of Dangerous or Vicious Animal.  At the time a
preliminary determination is made that an animal is dangerous or vicious, it
shall be seized by an officer who shall impound it in an animal shelter or with
a veterinarian in a humane manner. Such animal may be apprehended and impounded
without court action or warrant until such time as a hearing is held and
decision rendered.
 
   (e)    Hearing Procedure.

order:

         B.    Awarding custody of the animal to any officer, shelter, or
veterinarian for further disposition in accordance with reasonable practices
for the humane treatment of animals; or

statute to the contrary, the detention of any animal found by the court to be

      (1)    Any owner aggrieved by the municipal court's decision may appeal
the same to the circuit court. In addition to other requirements for appeal,
the owner shall post a cash bond with the City Clerk in an amount sufficient to
provide for the reasonable costs of care, medical treatment and provisions for
the animal for at least thirty days, said amount to be determined by the court.
The said cash bond shall be filed within ten days following the court's finding
against the owner.
      (2)    At the end of the time for which expenses are covered by the
original cash bond if the animal remains in the care of the humane officer and
the owner desires to prevent disposition of the animal by the officer, the
owner shall post an additional cash bond with the clerk within five days of the
expiration of the original cash bond in the same amount as the prior bond to
cover a period of thirty more days.
      (3)    During this period the officer shall retain the said animal in an
animal shelter or a veterinary facility. If said appeal is not successful and
the municipal judge's determination is not reversed, the person whose animal is
seized is liable for all costs of the care of the seized animal.
      (4)    If a cash bond has been posted in accordance with this section,
the custodial animal care agency may draw from the bond the actual reasonable
costs incurred by the agency in providing care, medical treatment and
provisions to the impounded animal from the date of the initial impoundment to
the date of the final disposition of the animal.
      (5)    Any person whose animal is seized and against whom the municipal
court enters a finding pursuant to this article shall be liable during any
period it remains in the detention, for the reasonable costs of care, medical
treatment and provisions for the animal, beyond and not covered by the amounts
of the cash bond posted. Any unused portion of a cash bond shall be returned.
      (6)    The City shall have the right to appeal any adverse ruling by the
municipal court without posting bond. Any costs incurred for care, medical
treatment and provisions for the animal during an appeal by the City shall be
borne by the City.
 
   (g)    Disposition.  Any animal finally determined to be dangerous or
vicious and not returned to its owner as provided above herein, may be disposed
of in the same manner as other animals at an animal shelter or veterinary
establishment, including but not limited to the humane destruction of said
animal, except that animals determined vicious or dangerous pursuant to this
article may not be made available to the public.

at the time of the acts complained of shall be found to be a dangerous or
vicious animal.

crime upon premises owned, leased, or occupied by the animal's owner, (ii)
committing, at the time, a willful trespass or other tort upon premises owned,
leased, or occupied by the animal's owner, or (iii) provoking, tormenting, or

dangerous or vicious animal solely because of its breed, nor is a particular
breed of dog prohibited by this article.

except as permitted by this article or by court approval, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.

heat of the dog to be retained in cold weather.

enter and exit; the entry way must have a flap which blocks any inclement
weather from entering (wind, rain, snow, etc.)

ground and be free of cracks, holes or protruding nails or rough edges that
could cause injury.

around the shelter shall be kept clean of accumulated feces, garbage and any
other debris.

from the direct rays of the sun, when sunlight is likely to cause overheating
or discomfort.
 
   (c)    In lieu of tethering, animals may be restrained by pens, fences or
other such enclosures which must:
      (1)    Allow a minimum of 150 square feet of area for each dog.
      (2)    Provide sufficient shade to allow the dog to be out of the direct
rays of the sun when sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort. The

   Nothing described herein shall be interpreted or construed to prevent any
constitutionally protected activity including but not necessarily limited to
exercise of one's constitutionally guaranteed rights of freedom of speech or
assembly.  No person may be convicted under this section when his sole intent
for engaging in the activities for which he was arrested was to exercise one or
more of the rights guaranteed to him under the Constitution of the United
States or the State Constitution or to exercise any other rights guaranteed to
that person by law.
509.02  LOITERING ON SCHOOL PROPERTY.
   No person, not a student in regular attendance, shall loiter in or about any

(WVaC 61-6-14a)
509.03  BEGGING PROHIBITED.
   No person shall beg for money, goods or services within the City.
509.04  LOITERING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   Definitions.  "Loitering" means remaining idle in essentially one
location and includes the concept of spending time idly; to be dilatory; to
linger; to stay; to saunter; to delay; to stand around and also includes the
colloquial expression "hanging around".  "Public place" means any place to
which the general public has access and a right to resort for business,
entertainment, or other lawful purpose, but does not necessarily mean a place
devoted solely to the use of the public.  It includes the front or immediate
area of any store, shop, restaurant, tavern or other place of business and also
public grounds, areas or parks.
   (b)   No person shall loiter, loaf, wander, stand or remain idle either
alone and/or in consort with others in a public place in such manner so as to:
      (1)   Obstruct any public street, public highway, public sidewalk, public
parking lot or any other public place or building by hindering or impeding or
tending to hinder or impede the free and uninterrupted passage of vehicles,
traffic or pedestrians.
      (2)   Commit in or upon any public street, public highway, public
sidewalk, public parking lot or any other public place or building any act or
thing which is an obstruction or interference with the free and uninterrupted
use of property or with any business lawfully conducted by anyone in, upon,
facing or fronting on any such public street, public highway, public sidewalk
or any other public place or building, all of which prevents the free and
uninterrupted ingress, egress and regress, therein, thereon and thereto.
   (c)   When any person causes or commits any of the conditions enumerated in
subsection (b) herein, a law enforcement officer shall order that person to
stop causing or committing such conditions and to move on or disperse.  Any
person who fails or refuses to obey such orders shall be guilty of a violation
of the section.
   (d)   No person shall loiter or prowl in a place, at a time, or in a manner
not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm
for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity, or circumstances which
justify an articulable suspicion that the person may be engaged in or about to
engage in a crime.  Among the circumstances which may be considered in
determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes
flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify
himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object.
   (e)   When any person causes or commits any of the conditions enumerated in
subsection (d) herein, unless flight by the person or other circumstance makes
it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an
offense under subsection (d), afford the person an opportunity to dispel any
alarm by identifying himself and satisfactorily explaining his presence as
being for no illegal purpose.  No person shall be convicted of an offense under
this section if the law enforcement officer did not comply with the preceding
sentence, or if it appears at the trial that the explanation given by the
accused was true and, if believed by the law enforcement officer at the time
would have dispelled the alarm.

upon which to base a violation of this article, he shall so inform the Board
and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the chairman, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this article, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible to conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
article has been committed.
   The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written statement of charges and
a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and
place of the hearing. The respondent or authorized counsel may file and amend

calendar days after service of the statement of charges and summons, except
that such hearings may be continued upon the finding of just cause therefor by
the Board.  The summons so issued shall be signed by two members of the Board
and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons
and the production of relevant documents and records.  The failure to comply
with a summons shall constitute a violation of this article.  The interested
parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or by a duly
authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.  The
parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine
witnesses shall be preserved.  All testimony and evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation.  The secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record for the cost of transcription or
reproduction.
   (g)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this article, the Board shall, after consultation with the City
Attorney in executive session, state its findings to and cause the City
Attorney to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the
person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to
take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this article,
with notice that if the Board, upon investigation by the chairman, determines
that the person complained against has not after fifteen calendar days
following service of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board will
recertify the matter to the City Attorney for enforcement.  The City Attorney
shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the
Fair Housing Board of the City before the Municipal Court of the City.
   (h)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this article, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

525.01  CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section.  A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit.  The court may cause
a citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that
they appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the
issuance of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered
for the penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the
principal and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. 
The money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to
the treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the
offender was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

   No person shall cruelly ill treat, abuse or inflict unnecessary cruel
punishment upon, any infant or minor child, and no person, having the care,
custody or control of any minor child, shall willfully abandon or neglect the
minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment.  The fact that a mercantile establishment

   (a)   "Blackjack" means a short bludgeon consisting, at the striking end, of

object is struck.  "Blackjack" includes, but is not limited to, a billy, billy
club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (b)   "Gravity knife" means any knife that has a blade released from the
handle by the force of gravity or the application of centrifugal force, and
when so released is locked in place by means of a button, spring, lever or
other locking or catching device.
   (c)   "Knife" means an instrument, intended to be used or readily adaptable
to be used as a weapon, consisting of a sharp-edged or sharp-pointed blade,
usually made of steel, attached to a handle, which is capable of inflicting
cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds.  "Knife" includes, but is not limited to,
any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and one-half
inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any other
instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds.  A pocket
knife with a blade three and one-half inches or less in length, a hunting or
fishing knife carried for hunting, fishing, sports or other recreational uses,
or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement shall not be
included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless such knife is
knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury or
death.
   (d)   "Switchblade knife" means any knife having a spring-operated blade
which opens automatically upon pressure being applied to a button, catch or
other releasing device in its handle.
   (e)   "Nunchuka" means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope or other nonrigid, flexible or springy

may be used as the striking end.
   (f)   "Metallic or false knuckles" means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece, to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon,
and constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the
fist or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the

instrument, without reference to the metal or other substance or substances
from which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (g)   "Pistol" means a short firearm having a chamber which is integral with
the barrel, designed to be aimed and fired by the use of a single hand.
   (h)   "Revolver" means a short firearm having a cylinder of several chambers

   (i)   "Deadly weapon" means an instrument which is designed to be used to

disclosure or recognition.  A deadly weapon is concealed when it is carried on
or about the person in such a manner that another person in the ordinary course
of events would not be placed on notice that the deadly weapon was being
carried.  For purposes of concealed handgun licensees, a licensee shall be
deemed to be carrying on or about his or her person while in or on a motor
vehicle if the firearm is located in a storage area in or on the motor vehicle.
   (k)   "Firearm" means any weapon which will expel a projectile by action of
an explosion.

   When proper application has been made, when any required certification has
been filed, when any required bond has been posted and when the City Licensing
Officer has made any required investigation, and the appropriate fees, if any,
are paid, the City Licensing Officer shall issue to the applicant a license or
permit certificate, and shall preserve a record thereof in his files.  The City
Licensing Officer shall then so endorse in the place provided for such stamp,
and the certificate shall then be valid; provided, however, that no such
license or permit certificate shall be issued to any applicant who owes a
delinquent financial debt to the City resulting from the nonpayment of any tax,
fee, lien, service charge or other assessment.  In the event such an applicant

to the City Clerk, except that bonds conditioned on the payment of license or
permit fees shall be filed with the City Treasurer.  Such bond shall be in the
amount specified by this code, or, if no amount is specified, then it shall be
such amount as shall be deemed sufficient by the officer whose certification is
required, or the City Licensing Officer.  Bonds shall be payable to the City
for the use and benefit of persons intended to be protected thereby, and unless
otherwise provided, shall be conditioned on the payment of any damage to public
or private property, and the payment for any personal injuries or damages or
losses resulting from any malfeasance, misfeasance, nonfeasance or negligence
in connection with any of the activities or conditions for which the license or
permit applied for is granted.
   (b)   In lieu of such bond, an applicant may furnish one or more policies of
insurance in the same amount and providing the same protection.  Bonds and
insurance policies shall be approved as to substance by the officer whose

paying the fee or tax required for such activity or privileges, pay a late
filing penalty of ten percent (10%) of the regular fee for each month or
fraction of a month that he has been in default.  Such late filing penalty
shall be deemed a license penalty, and shall be assessed and collected in the
manner provided in the Codified Ordinances, except that the certificate shall
state separately thereon the amount paid as regular fee and the amount paid as
a late filing penalty.
(1977 Code Sec. 31.09.)

such license or permit assigned to another person or transferred to another
premises, for the unexpired term thereof; provided, that no assignment or
transfer shall be made of any license or permit which is personal in its
nature.  No transfer to another premises shall be made without prior
certification by an officer whose certification was required in the first
instance.
   (b)   For each such assignment or transfer a certificate fee shall be
charged, and in addition thereto, a certification fee of one dollar ($1.00)
shall be charged for each new certification required.  No license or permit

required to make any refund.  Licenses and permits revoked, suspended or
altered by the City Manager or City Licensing Officer shall be reviewable by
Council if the person affected thereby applies to the City Clerk in writing for
a hearing within thirty days after notice given of the act complained of, and
the action of Council shall be final.

assisting another to obtain a license or permit, and any person who procures,
or attempts to procure, or who assists, or attempts to assist, another in
procuring a license or permit by means of deceit, wilful misrepresentation or
willful concealment of a material fact, shall be guilty of an offense, and upon
conviction thereof, if any license or permit has been issued, it shall become
null and void, and no refund shall be made.
(1977 Code Sec. 31.13.)
705.14  SEPARATE LICENSES AND PERMITS FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES.
   The granting of a license or permit to any person to carry on an activity or
to exercise a privilege which contains within itself, or is composed of,
activities or privileges which are required to be licensed, shall not relieve
the person to whom such license or permit is granted from the necessity of
procuring separate licenses or permits for each activity or privilege, except
as may otherwise be provided.
(1977 Code Sec. 31.14.)
705.15  EFFECT OF STATE LICENSE.
   Unless otherwise provided by statute, no State license or permit shall

require the City to issue a similar license or permit contrary to the
provisions of the Codified Ordinances.
(1977 Code Sec. 31.15)
705.16  LIMITATIONS OF AUTHORITY GRANTED.
   Any license or permit issued by the City shall be valid only for the

provision of the Codified  Ordinances.
(1977 Code Sec. 31.17.)

issued.

adjust, with fairness to all concerned, all bona fide matters of controversy
between licensees or permittees or applicants for licenses or permits, and the

provided, that such exemption or reduction shall not be granted for a period
longer than the current license year; and provided further, that the licensee
or permittee shall be given a certificate with the exemption or reduction
clearly marked thereon, and the reason therefor.  Each exemption or reduction
granted under the provisions of this section shall be reported to the Council

717.03  INVESTIGATION OF APPLICANT; REJECTION OR ISSUANCE OF LICENSE.
   (a)   Upon receipt of an application for a canvasser's or solicitor's
license the original shall be referred to the Chief of Police, who shall cause
such investigation of the applicant's business and moral character to be made
as he deems necessary for the protection of the public good.
   (b)   If, as a result of such investigation, the applicant's character or
business responsibility is found to be unsatisfactory, the Chief of Police
shall endorse on such application his disapproval and his reasons therefor and
return it to the City Clerk, who shall notify the applicant that his
application is disapproved.
   (c)   If, as a result of such investigation, the character and business

address and photograph of the licensee, the class of license issued and the

for a fiscal year which begins on July 1 and terminates the following June 30.
   (b)   Fee Imposing Burden on Interstate Commerce.  No license fee required
by this article shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon
interstate commerce.  In any case where a license fee is believed by a licensee
or applicant for license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce, he
may apply to the City Manager for an adjustment of the fee so that it shall not
be discriminatory, unreasonable or unfair as a burden upon interstate commerce.
   Such application may be made before, at or within six months after payment
of the prescribed license fee.  The applicant shall, by affidavit and
supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or
estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the City
Manager may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such
undue burden on interstate commerce.  The City Manager shall then conduct an
investigation, comparing applicant's business with other business of like
nature, and shall make findings of fact from which he shall determine whether
the fee fixed by this article is unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory as to
applicant's business, and shall fix as the license fee for the applicant, an
amount that is fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the fee has
already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the fee so
fixed.
   In fixing the fee to be charged, the City Manager shall have the power to
base the fee upon a percentage of gross sales or any other method which will
assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses
of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed ten dollars
($10.00).  Should the City Manager determine the gross sales measure of the fee
to be the fair basis, he may require the applicant to submit, either at the
time of termination of applicant's business in the City or at the end of each
three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales and pay the amount of
fee therefor, provided that no additional fee during any one fiscal year shall
be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual
license fee of ten dollars ($10.00).
(1977 Code Sec. 33.04.)
717.05  BOND.
   Every applicant for a license under this article who is not a resident of
the City or who, being a resident of the City, represents a firm whose
principal place of business is located outside the State, shall file with the
City Clerk a surety bond, running to the City in the amount of one thousand
dollars ($1,000), with surety acceptable to and approved by the City Manager,
conditioned that the applicant shall comply fully with all the provisions of
this article and other ordinances and the statutes of the State regulating and
concerning the business of solicitor and guaranteeing to any resident of the
City that all money paid as a down payment will be accounted for and applied
according to the representations of such solicitor.  Action on such bond may be
brought in the name of the City to the use or benefit of any aggrieved person.
(1977 Code Sec. 33.05.)
717.06  DISPLAY OF LICENSE.
   Solicitors and canvassers are required to exhibit their licenses at the
request of any citizen who may be concerned therewith.
(1977 Code Sec. 33.06.)
717.07  ENFORCEMENT OF ARTICLE.
   Each police officer of the City shall require any person seen soliciting or
canvassing, and who is not known by such officer to be duly licensed, to
produce his solicitor's or canvasser's license and to enforce the provisions of
this article.
(1977 Code Sec. 33.07.)
717.08  REPORTS AND RECORDS OF VIOLATIONS.
   The Clerk of the Police Court shall report to the City Clerk all convictions
for violation of this article; and the City Clerk shall maintain a record for
each license issued and record the reports of violation therein.
(1977 Code Sec. 33.08.)
717.09  REVOCATION OF LICENSES.
   (a)   Licenses issued under this article may be revoked by the City Manager
after notice and hearing, for any of the following causes:
      (1)   Fraud,  misrepresentation of false statement contained in the
application for license;
      (2)   Fraud, misrepresentation or false statement made in the course of
carrying on business as solicitor or as canvasser;
      (3)   Any violation of this article;
      (4)   Conviction of any crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude;
or
      (5)   Conducting the business of soliciting or of canvassing in an
unlawful manner or in such a manner as to constitute a breach of the peace or

   (b)   Notice of the hearing for revocation of a license shall be given in
writing, setting forth specifically the grounds of complaint and the time and
place of hearing.  Such notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the
licensee at his last known address at least five days prior to the date set for
hearing.
(1977 Code Sec. 33.09.)
717.10  APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by the action of the Chief of Police or the City Clerk
in the denial of a license under this article, or the action of the City
Manager in assessing of the fee as provided in Section
717.04 or in revoking a license as provided in Section
717.09 (a) shall have the right to appeal to Council.  Such appeal shall be
taken by filing with Council within fourteen days after notice of the action
appealed from a written statement setting forth fully the grounds for the
appeal.  Council shall set a time and place of a hearing on such appeal, and
notice of such hearing shall be given to the appellant in the same manner as
provided in Section
717.09(b) for notice of hearing on revocation.  The decision and order of
Council on such appeal shall be final.

or based on the size of the contract, in order to insure payment of the taxes
levied hereunder, may also require the following:
      (1)    At the time of registration, application for building permit, or
otherwise as directed by the Director of Finance, require each contractor to

      (2)    In lieu of the six percent deposit, each contractor may request
the approval of the Director of Finance to provide, in the alternative, a
corporate surety bond to be approved by the Director of Finance as to form,
sufficiency, value, amount, stability, and other features necessary to provide
a guarantee of payment of the tax due the City.

or combination acting as a unit, any individual delegated by such firm, group
or unit shall take the oath on behalf of the taxpayer.
   The assessment of taxes herein made and the returns required therefor shall
be for the year ending December 31. If the taxpayer, in exercising a privilege
taxable under this article, keeps the books reflecting the same on the basis
other than the calendar year, he may with the written consent of the Director

accounting period, as shown by the method of keeping his books.

Inspector for the work to be performed by the person or company.
   The tax payment to be made by the person or company shall be made to the

   The Director of Finance, upon approval from City Manager, may extend the
time for payment of an amount determined as a deficiency for a period not to
exceed twelve months from the date designated for payment of the deficiency. An

security, in an amount not exceeding twice the amount for which the extension
of time for payment is granted on such terms and conditions as the Director of

designated by the Director of Finance, any books, papers, records, memorandums
or other documents bearing upon the matter required to be included in the
return and may require the attendance of the person rendering the return or the
attendance of any other person having knowledge of the matters contained
therein. In connection therewith, the Director of Finance may take testimony
and shall have the power to administer an oath to such person.
   The Director of Finance may prescribe rules and regulations as to the
keeping of records, the content and form of returns and the filing of copies of
the City business and occupation tax returns and determinations. The Director

745.22  SECRECY OF RETURNS.
   Except when required in an official investigation or hearing or proceeding
to ascertain or collect the amount of tax due, or pursuant to an exemption

of any single firm or corporation, or disclose the amount of income or any
particulars set forth or disclosed in any report, declaration or return
required to be filed with the Director of Finance by any article of this
chapter imposing any tax administered under this article, or by any rule or
regulation of the Director of Finance issued thereunder.
   Any person protected by the provisions of this article may, in writing,
waive the secrecy provisions of this section for such purpose and such period
as he shall therein state, and the Director of Finance, if he so determines,
may thereupon release to designated recipients such taxpayer's return or other
particulars filed under the provisions of the tax articles administered under
the provisions of this article.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.23  UNLAWFUL RELEASE OF TAX INFORMATION;  PENALTIES.
   It shall be unlawful for any officer or employee of the City to release to
any person any tax information obtained by virtue of a reciprocal exchange of

person receiving the information is an authorized official or counsel for the
said state or City and shall be used only for the purpose of administering
official business of the City, unless the taxpayer has authorized, in writing

(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.25  ERRORS; COLLECTION OF BALANCE DUE ON RETURN WITHOUT REMITTANCE.
   Where a mathematical error appears on a return (including an overstatement
of the credit for the amount paid as a quarterly instalment), the Director of
Finance shall correct such error and notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
mistake and the deficiency in the tax. The taxpayer shall have ten (10) days
after receipt of such notice within which to pay such deficiency. If the
taxpayer fails to pay such deficiency within ten (10) days, the Director of
Finance shall make an assessment of such deficiency in accordance with Section
745.26 and shall give the taxpayer written notice thereof.
   If the taxpayer files a mathematically correct fourth quarter return which
reflects a balance due of the tax administered under this article, and if full
payment thereof has not been made, the Director of Finance shall notify the
taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of tax, penalties, and interest due. The
taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after receipt of such notice within which to
make such payment. If the taxpayer fails to make payment within such ten day
period, the Director of Finance shall proceed to collect the amount due.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.26  ASSESSMENT OF TAX WHEN INSUFFICIENTLY RETURNED.
   If the Director of Finance believes that the tax imposed by this article has
been insufficiently returned by a taxpayer, because the taxpayer has failed to
properly remit the tax, has failed to make a return or has made a return which
is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to investigate
and determine or estimate the tax liability of the taxpayer and make an
assessment therefor. Assessments shall be served upon the taxpayer either
personally or by certified mail. If any certified mail is refused or not
claimed, the Director of Finance may make service by first class mail and
prepaid postage.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
   
745.27  JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   If the Director of Finance believes that the collection of any tax which he
is required to administer will be jeopardized by delay, he shall thereupon make
an assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment. The amount
assessed will be immediately due and payable. Unless the taxpayer against whom
a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment, within twenty (20)
days after service of notice of jeopardy assessment, such assessment becomes
final. Such petition for reassessment must be accompanied by such securities as
the Director of Finance deems necessary.  (Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.28  AMENDED ASSESSMENT.

assessment made pursuant to this article. Unless the taxpayer to whom the

assessment) after service thereof, either personally or by certified mail, file
with the Director of Finance a petition for reassessment in writing verified
under oath by the taxpayer or his duly authorized agent having knowledge of the
facts, setting forth with particularity the items of the assessment objected
to, together with the reasons for the objections; the assessment shall become
final and not subject to administrative or judicial review. The amount of an
assessment shall be due and payable on the day following the date upon which
the assessment becomes final.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.31  HEARING PROCEDURE; ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION.
   When a petition for reassessment or refund or credit as provided for above
is filed within the time prescribed for such filing, the Director of Finance
shall assign a time and a place for a hearing thereon and shall notify the
petitioner of such hearing by written notice at least twenty (20) days in
advance thereof. Such hearing shall be held within ninety (90) days from the
date of filing the petition, unless continued by agreement of the parties or by
the Director of Finance for sufficient cause.
   The hearing shall be informal and shall be conducted in an impartial manner
by the Director of Finance or a hearing examiner designated by the Director of
Finance. The burden of proof shall be upon the taxpayer to show that the
assessment is incorrect and contrary to law, in whole or in part.
   After such hearing, the Director of Finance shall, within a reasonable time,
give notice in writing of his decision.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.32  APPEALS TO CITY COUNCIL.
   If any person, having made the return and paid the tax as provided by this

Director of Finance, he may apply to Council by petition, in writing, within
thirty days after notice is mailed to him by the Director of Finance, for a
hearing and correction of the amount of the tax so assessed upon him by the
Director of Finance, in which petition shall be set forth the reasons why such
hearings should be granted and the amount such tax should be reduced. Council
shall promptly consider such petition, and may grant such hearing or deny it.
If denied, the petitioner shall be forthwith notified thereof; granted, Council
shall notify the petitioner of the time and place fixed for such hearing. After
such hearing, Council may make such order in the matter as may appear to it
just and lawful, and shall furnish a copy of such order to the petitioner. Any
person improperly charged with any tax required to be paid by him may recover
the amount so paid, together with interest, in any proper action or suit
against the City as may by authorized by law.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.33  METHODS OF COLLECTION.

condition precedent to exercising the privilege tax, may exercise the privilege
for the current tax year upon the condition that he shall pay the tax accruing
under this article.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.35  STATE PROCEDURES ADOPTED.
   There is hereby adopted by reference, as if fully set forth herein, the
provisions of West Virginia Code, Chapter 11, Article 10, relating to procedure
and administration, whereby references to the State Tax Commissioner shall be
deemed to be references to the Director of Finance of the City of Moundsville,
and references to the State of West Virginia shall be deemed to be references
to the City of Moundsville. Said provisions may be utilized by the Director of
Finance, at his option, to resolve matters not sufficiently addressed in this
article. This article shall control wherever the adopted state provisions are
in conflict with the provisions set forth in this article. Additionally, the
Finance Director may employ the administrative rules of the State tax
department to assist in resolving issues not covered herein.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.36  REVOCATION OF LICENSES AND PERMITS.
   The Director of Finance has the authority to revoke any and all licenses and
permits issued by the City of Moundsville in the event a licensee/permittee
fails to file any City Tax Return or fails to pay any delinquent taxes, fees or
any interest or penalty thereon due and owing to the City of Moundsville. The
Director of Finance has the authority to deny and prevent any and all licenses
and permit privileges to those persons who are delinquent in paying taxes, fees
or any interest or penalty thereon due and owing the City of Moundsville.
   In the event of revocation, the Director of Finance will provide written
notice to the licensee/permittee at least five (5) days prior to the
contemplated revocation and such notice shall be served by certified mail. The
notice shall indicate the time and the place of the revocation review meeting,
the general grounds of said contemplated revocation, and shall advise the
licensee/permittee of his/her rights to appear at said hearing in person and
represented by legal counsel, and to be heard orally upon the merits of his/her
defense. The Director of Finance may request legal advice from the City
Attorney's Office, and adopt such procedures for its decorum and the dispatch
of business at such hearings as he/she may regard advisable. The revocation
decision of the Director of Finance will be final; provided, that those
licensees/permittees who are subject to Administrative or Judicial appeals,
pursuant to Sections
745.30 to
745.32, may utilize these procedures in accordance with the Code, but will not
be grounds to delay the revocation process.
   Each license or permit that has been revoked pursuant to this section may be
re-issued upon payment of all delinquent B&O taxes, fees or any interest or
penalty thereon due and owing to the City of Moundsville.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.37  REFUNDS AND CREDITS.
   Any taxpayer claiming to have overpaid any tax, interest or penalty imposed
by this article shall file his claim with the Director of Finance within three
years after the due date of the return determined by including any written
authorized extension of time for filing, in respect of which the tax was
imposed or within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever of such
periods expires the later, or if no return was filed by the taxpayer, within
two years from the time the tax was paid, and not thereafter.
   If, on such petition and the proofs filed in support thereof, the Director
of Finance shall be of the opinion that the tax, interest or penalty, or any
part thereof, was overpaid, he shall refund the same to the taxpayer. If the
Director of Finance shall be in doubt as to whether or not there exists an
overpayment, he may institute against the taxpayer a declaratory judgment
proceeding in the circuit court of the county to ascertain whether or not there
exists an overpayment of tax, interest or penalty, or any part thereof. If the
Director of Finance is of the opinion that there exists no overpayment of tax,
interest or penalty, or any part thereof, he shall notify the taxpayer.
Taxpayer's failure to abide by express procedures contained in this section
precludes taxpayer's claim for refund or credit.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.38  LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS.
   The amount of tax, interest and penalties imposed by this article shall be
assessed within three years after the due date of the fourth quarter return for

became final. If an assessment is not issued, every proceeding instituted by
the Director of Finance for the collection of taxes shall be commenced within
ten (10) years after the taxpayer filed the annual return (or the latest
periodical return, if no annual return is required). The limitations of this
section can be extended, by written agreement at two (2) year increments.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.40  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)    The tax imposed by this article, if not paid when due, shall bear
interest at the rate of at ten percent (10%) per annum from the due date of the

the adjusted rate charged by commercial banks to large business, in the manner
described in W. Va. Code §11-10-17a.
   (b)    If any taxpayer fails to make the return or any quarterly installment
required by this article, or make his return but fails to remit, in whole or in
part, the proper amount of tax, there shall be added to the amount of tax
unpaid, from the date such tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount
of five percent (5%) of the tax for the first month, or fraction thereof, of
delinquency, and one percent (1%) of the tax for each succeeding month, or
fraction thereof, of delinquency, provided, that if such failure is due to
reasonable cause, the Director of Finance may waive, with final approval from
the City Manager, in whole or in part, these penalties.
   (c)    If the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to evade any such tax
there shall be
added an additional penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax owed,
exclusive of penalties.
   (d)    Interest and penalties may be collected in the same manner as the tax

SUCCESSOR;  LIENS.

his or its business or stock of goods, or ceases doing business, any tax,
penalties and interest imposed by this article shall become due and payable
immediately, and such person shall, within thirty (30) days after selling out
his or its business or stock of goods or ceasing to do business, make a final
return and pay any tax that may be due. The unpaid amount of any such tax shall
be a lien upon the property of such person.
   The successor of any person selling his/her business or stock of goods shall
withhold so much of the purchase money as will satisfy any tax, penalties and
interest which may be due until the former owner shall produce a certificate
from the Director of Finance evidencing the payment thereof. If the purchaser
of a business or stock of goods shall fail to withhold purchase money as
provided above, and if any such tax, penalties and interest remain unpaid after
the expiration of the thirty (30) day period allowed for payment thereof, the
purchaser shall be personally liable for the payment of any such tax,
penalties; and the same shall be recoverable by the Director of Finance.  (Ord.
1-7-03.)
745.42  SETTLEMENT OF CONTRACTS MADE WITH CITY.
   All officers, employees and agents making contracts on behalf of the City

745.44  LIMITED EFFECT OF DIRECTOR OF FINANCE'S CERTIFICATE.
   The certificates of the Director of Finance provided for in Sections
745.41 to
745.43 inclusive, shall not bar subsequent investigations, examination, audits,
assessments, and refunds with respect to the taxpayer.
(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.45  ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   The administration of this article is vested in, and shall be exercised by
the Director of Finance, who shall prescribe forms and reasonable rules of
procedure in conformity with this article for making of return and for the
ascertainment, assessment and collection of the taxes imposed hereunder; and
the enforcement of any of the provisions of this article in any of the courts
of the State shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Director of

Virginia office is located in Moundsville. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, when a taxpayer has only one (1) office location and this office
is located within the municipal limits of the City of Moundsville and its
activities elsewhere in West Virginia are neither taxed not taxable by another
municipality, the gross income or gross proceeds from those activities are
taxable by the City of Moundsville.

face or as applied, the remaining provisions of this chapter shall remain in

(Ord. 1-7-03.)
745.99  OFFENSES; PENALTIES.
   (a)    No person shall refuse to make any return required to be made by this
article; or  make any false or fraudulent return or false statement in any
return, with intent to defraud the City or to evade the payment of the tax, or
any part thereof, imposed by this article, or aid or abet another in any
attempt to evade the payment of the tax, or any part thereof, imposed by this
article. No president, vice president, secretary or treasurer of any
corporation shall make a permit to be made for any corporation or association
any false return or any false statement in any return required in this article,
with the intent to evade the payment of any tax hereunder.

the offense of false swearing and shall be punished in the manner provided by
law. Any corporation for which a false return, or a return containing false
statement, as aforesaid, shall be made, shall be punished by a fine of not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000).

745.40, the failure of any taxpayer
to make any required return, to pay the tax imposed upon him by this article,
either or both, within five days following the prescribed date for the filing
of such return or the payment of such tax shall constitute good cause for
Council to revoke or to refuse to renew, either or both the City license of
such taxpayer to engage in the business taxed under this article, as well as
any other  City business license held by him.

records shall be open to the City for inspection.

reason to believe that the tax imposed by this section is insufficiently
returned by a taxpayer, either because the taxpayer has failed or refused to

deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to determine the amount of the
tax for which the taxpayer is liable.  The Director of Finance may make such
audits and investigations, and take such evidence and testimony as may be
necessary for the purpose of his investigation.
   As a result of his investigation, the Director of Finance may assess the

Such claims shall be in writing and accompanied by an affidavit of a credible
person verifying the correctness of such claim.
   (g)   Failure to Pay Tax.  If any person fails to pay any tax imposed by
this section when due and payable, the City may collect such tax by any proper
action; and in addition thereto any City license for any show or exhibition
described in Article
741 shall be subject to revocation by Council at any meeting thereof after ten
days written notice of the time, place and purpose of such meeting given to
such person by the City Clerk.  Such persons may attend such meetings and make
any proper defense before Council.
   (h)   Application of Section.  The tax imposed under provisions of this
section shall not apply to any performance or show given for the sole benefit
of any religious, charitable, benevolent, patriotic, welfare or educational

781.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)    The purpose of this Article is to provide a simplified enforcement
mechanism for the City of Moundsville to collect delinquent municipal fees and
taxes, plus interest and penalties so that the City may provide services for
the public good, by providing that liens shall be placed on property for
security of payment due under various ordinances. A person or entity alleged to
owe a delinquent fee or tax will be afforded due process and an opportunity to
be heard, if requested, in the form of a fair and expedient hearing prior to
imposition of a lien herein. A lien for delinquent fees and taxes will have a
secured position and priority should the property be sold at a forced sale and
the City may have the option of initiating a sale to enforce and collect the
lien.
   (b)    The Council of the City of Moundsville finds that it is reasonable
and necessary, through assertion of Home Rule powers, to fully utilize and
expand West Virginia Code §8-13-13 to assist in a legal, equitable, and
simplified form of recapturing monies expended to enhance public health, safety
and welfare so that there will be an incentive for property owners to comply
with and pay the City such fees due for services rendered.
(Passed 6-21-16.)
781.02  CHARGES FOR MUNICIPAL SERVICES.
   Notwithstanding any statutory provision to the contrary, the City of
Moundsville, which furnishes essential or special municipal service, including,
but not limited to, police and fire protection, parking facilities on the
street or otherwise, parks and recreational facilities, street cleaning,
abatement and demolition of uninhabitable, unsafe structures, building code and
property maintenance code enforcement services, vacant structure code
enforcement services, street lighting, street maintenance and improvement,
sewerage and sewage disposal, and the collection and disposal of garbage,
refuse, waste, ashes, trash, the clearing and removal of weeds, grass and
debris, the clearing and removal of any matter or form of personal property
found to be a threat to public health, safety and welfare and any other similar
matter, shall have plenary power and authority to provide by ordinance for the
installation, continuance, maintenance or improvement of such service, to make
reasonable regulations with respect thereto, and to impose by ordinance upon
those subject to such ordinances and the users of such service reasonable
rates, fees and charges to be collected in the manner specified in the
ordinance: Provided, that any sewerage and sewage disposal service and any
service incident to the collection and disposal of garbage, refuse, waste,
ashes, trash and any other similar matter shall be subject to the provisions of
chapter twenty-four of the W.Va. Code.
(Passed 6-21-16.)
781.03 LIENS GENERALLY.
   The City of Moundsville shall be entitled to have and to place a lien upon
property owned by persons and entities owing delinquent fees to the City.
Except as otherwise provided, "lien" or "liens" as used in this section shall
arise whenever the charges corresponding with the services or taxes, as defined
in this code are levied or imposed by the City of Moundsville and such charges
become due and are not paid. Liens placed for delinquent fees or taxes shall
have a secured priority lien interest when any subject property is sold, even
in federal, state, or county delinquent tax sales. Therefore, liens placed
pursuant to this section shall not be dissolved during or due to such tax sale
and shall remain in effect so that any subsequent owner of the property takes
the property subject to all municipal liens, if not paid and released. Liens
that remain unsatisfied by payment in full to the municipality may be subject
to sale by the municipality to satisfy the lien.  Additionally, any filing fees
that a municipality must pay to a court of competent jurisdiction to seek
enforcement shall be charged and assessed to, and reimbursed by the property
owner. Such fees being paid is required prior to any release of the lien by the
municipality.
(Ord. 6-21-16.)
781.04  LIENS LEVIED UPON ALL REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   A lien created by this article is levied or imposed not only upon a parcel
of real property which is the subject of a delinquent fee or tax, but upon all
real and personal properties owned in whole or in part by the person or entity
that owes the fee.
(Passed 6-21-16.)
781.05 LIEN PRIORITY.
   A lien created by this article shall have preference and priority with
respect to all other liens thereafter placed on such real property as of the
time such fees become final and non-appealable.  (Passed 6-21-16.)
781.06 LIEN ATTACHMENT.
   There shall be an attachment of lien to proceeds of any sale of real
property that is subject to a municipal lien. In case any real property upon
which a municipal lien exists is sold by any means, including by an order of
the court of competent jurisdiction directing an executor or administrator to
sell the real estate to pay the debts of a deceased person, or is sold by
virtue of an execution process, or is sold in any fashion, such tax and/or
service lien shall be transferred to the funds arising from such sale in the
hands of any officer, agent, person, seller, or entity making the sale, and
after remittance to the municipality of the full amount owed, the real estate
so sold shall be discharged from the lien. If the sale funds are not sufficient
to pay and discharge the tax and/or service lien, the unpaid balance of the tax
and/or service lien shall remain a lien upon the real property so sold. (Passed
6-21-16.)
781.07 RECEIPT OF PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIEN.
   Should anyone take action to receive ownership of the subject property by
any means, including, but not limited to, transfer, sale, assignment,
forfeiture or county, state or federal tax sale, the new owner of record shall
take the property subject to all municipal liens and shall thereafter be
responsible for payment thereof. A lien imposed pursuant to this article shall
be effective for a period of ten (10) years from the date of filing at the
county courthouse; Provided that said lien may be extended for additional
periods of ten (10) years by the City filing a document setting forth the
intention to extend said lien for an additional ten (10) years, before the
expiration of the existing ten year period.  (Passed 6-21-16.)
781.08 LIEN PRIORITY; NOTICE OF LIEN; HEARING PROCEDURE; ADMINISTRATIVE
DECISION; RIGHT OF APPEAL; LIEN CREATION.
   (a)    Any municipal fee, tax, interest or penalties due and payable under
this City code shall be a debt due the City. It shall be a personal obligation
of the person or entity chargeable therefor and shall be a lien upon the real
and personal property of such person or entity until paid. This lien shall have
priority over all other liens except those due to banking institutions or the
state and the United States of America as further described herein.
   (b)    Before the City files a notice of lien with the Clerk of the County
Commission regarding one or more delinquencies in payment of any municipal fee,
tax, penalties or interest, the City shall give the person or entity written
notice via certified U.S. Mail return receipt requested to such person's or
entity's last known address, of intent to file the notice of lien setting forth
the amounts due and status of delinquency. Unless the person or entity to whom
the notice is given, or his duly authorized agent, shall within thirty (30)
days after service thereof, either personally or by certified mail, file with
the City a petition for hearing, setting forth in particular, items objected
to, together with the reasons for objections, the City may at any time
thereafter file the notice of the lien.

within the time prescribed, the City shall assign a time and a place for a
hearing thereon before the Judge of the Municipal Court of the City of
Moundsville, and shall notify the petitioner of such hearing by written notice
at least ten (10) days in advance thereof. Such hearing shall be held within
ninety (90) days from the date of filing the petition, unless continued by
agreement of the parties or by the judge for sufficient cause. The hearing
shall be informal and shall be conducted in an impartial manner by the judge.
The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner to show that the notice of
lien is improper, in whole or in part. After such hearing, the judge shall,
within a reasonable time, give notice in writing of the court's decision.
   (d)    If aggrieved by the decision the petitioner may appeal the decision
to the Circuit Court of Marshall County within thirty (30) days after service
of the decision.
      (1)    The appeal shall be taken by the filing of a petition and notice,
which petition and notice shall be served upon or accepted by the City as an
original notice. When the petition and notice is so served it shall, with the
return or acceptance thereon, be filed in the Office of the Clerk of the
Marshall County Circuit Court and docketed as other cases, with the appellant
(fee payer or taxpayer) as plaintiff and the City of Moundsville as defendant.
      (2)    The filing of the appeal shall not stay the collection of the fee
or tax unless the plaintiff shall file with such Clerk a bond for the use of
the defendant, with sureties approved by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of
Marshall County, the penalty of the bond to be not less than the total amount
of the fee or tax, and accumulated penalties and interest to the date of the
appeal, and conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the orders of the
Marshall County Circuit Court; provided, that the Judge of the Marshall County
Circuit Court may stay the collection of the fee, and accumulated penalties

the properties of the plaintiff are sufficient to secure performance of the
Marshall County Circuit Court's orders or that the ends of justice will be
served thereby.
      (3)    The Marshall County Circuit Court shall hear the appeal and
determine anew all questions submitted to it on appeal from the decision of the
municipal judge.
   (e)    The administrative remedies set forth in this section are exclusive.
Failure to timely file a petition in accordance with this section shall
preclude any challenge to the filing of the notice of lien. If no appeal is
taken pursuant to this section within thirty (30) days after service of the
municipal judge's decision, said decision shall become final and conclusive and
not subject to administrative or judicial review.
   (f)    The lien created by this section shall continue until the fee or tax
delinquency is satisfied or becomes unenforceable. The City Manager shall issue
a certificate of release of any lien imposed pursuant to this section upon
finding that the delinquency has been satisfied. The lien created by this
section shall be subject to the restrictions and conditions which apply to
municipal tax liens under West Virginia Code Chapter 38, Article 10C.

effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (b)   Disposition.  If any waters are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or poses
the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which in the judgment of
the City Manager or Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the
sewage works, process, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create
a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the City may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes.
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers.
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.

institutional establishment exceeds normal domestic sewage of 200 milligrams
per liter of five-day biochemical oxygen demand; or 250 milligrams per liter of
suspended solids and where such wastes are permitted to be discharged to the
sewer system by the City, an added charge, as noted below, will be made against
such establishment according to the strength of such wastes.  The strength of
such wastes shall be determined by composite samples taken over a sufficient
period of time to insure a representative sample.  The cost of sampling and
testing shall be borne by the industry or establishment whether owner or
lessee.  Tests shall be made by an independent laboratory or at the City waste
water treatment plant.
         Added charges shall be determined by the formula below.  These charges
shall be based on the cost of operation and maintenance for the sewage works. 
The surcharge to be computed by the formula:
            Cs = (Bc(B) + Sc(s)) Vu
           Where:
            Cs = A surcharge for waste waters of excessive strength.
            Vu = Volume contribution from a user per unit of time.
            Bs = O & M cost for treatment of a unit of biochemical
                  oxygen demand (BOD).
            B  = Concentration of BOD from a user above a base
                  level.
            Sc = O & M cost for treatment of a unit of suspended
                  solids.
            S  = Concentration of ss from a user above a base level.
   (c)   Approval of Treatment or Control.  If the City permits the
pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the
plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the City,
and subject to the requirements of all applicable State agencies' codes,
ordinances and laws.  Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities
are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
(1977 Code Sec. 13.09)
921.10  INTERCEPTORS.

the City, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other
harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units.  All interceptors shall be of a type
and capacity approved by the City, and shall be located as to be readily and
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
(1977 Code Sec. 13.10)
921.11  CONTROL MANHOLES.
   When required by the City, the owner of any property serviced by a building
sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole
together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building
sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes.  Such
manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the City.  The manhole
metering and sampling devices shall be installed by the owner at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe, operable and accessible at all
times.
(1977 Code Sec. 13.11)
921.12  TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS.
   (a)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in
accordance with the most recent edition of "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Sewage," and shall be determined at the control
manhole provided for, or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. 
In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole
shall be considered to be the location determined by the Superintendent.
   (b)   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property.  The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premises is appropriate or whether grab sample or samples should be taken.
(1977 Code Sec. 13.12)
921.13  SEWAGE FLOW DETERMINATION.
   To determine the sewage flow from any establishment, the Sanitary Board may
use one of the following methods:
   (a)   The amount of water supplied to the premises by the City or a private
water company as shown upon the water meter if the premises are metered;

   SURFACE OR GROUND WATER SURCHARGE
   Surface or Ground Water Surcharge
An additional amount shall be charged where surface or ground water is
introduced into the sanitary system where evidence of a violation exists.
   Surcharge formula to be applied in cases where surface drainage is connected
to the utility’s sewer system.
   Applicability
Whenever the utility has discovered that a customer’s roof drain, downspout,
storm sewer or similar facilities conducting surface water have been connected
to the utility’s sewer system, and such customer has failed to take appropriate
action, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the utility in
accordance with the Rules of the Public Service Commission, to eliminate such
connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer calculated on the
basis of the following formula:
      S   =   A x R x .0006233 x C
      S   =   The surcharge in dollars
      A   =   The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection
surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet.
      R   =   The measured monthly rainfall, in inches.
   .0006233   =   A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface to thousands of gallons of water.
   .0008333   =   A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface water to $ per 100 cubic feet
      C   =   The utility’s approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water
usage.
   The utility shall not impose the surcharge unless and until the customer has
been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery,
that it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing, or on-site
inspection that rain or surface water is being introduced into the sanitary
sewer system at the customer’s location, and that the customer has not acted
within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice to divert the water from
the sanitary sewer system.
   Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist.  Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in
accordance with the Rules of the Public Service Commission of West Virginia.
   Surcharge Formula to be applied to a customer producing unusual waste.
   The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on the
basis of the following formula:
Ci = VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
   Ci   =   charge to unusual users per year
   Vo   =   average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume,
in dollars per gallon
   Vi   =   volume of waste water from unusual users, in gallons per year
   Bo   =   average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical, Oxygen
Demand (BOD), in dollars per pound
   Bi   =   weight of BOD from unusual users, in pounds per year
   So   =   average unit costs of treatment (including sludge treatment)
chargeable to total solids, in dollars per pound
   Si   =   weight of total solids from unusual users, in pounds per year
   When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the costs of transport and treatment thereof, will be made.  Waste containing
materials which, in the judgment of the utility should not be introduced into
the sewer system need not be handled by it.  The results of the preliminary
study will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed sewer service
and the charge therefore, based upon the formula set out above.
   Thereafter, unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at the
conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and audit
of the utility records, new cost figures will be calculated for use in the
above formula.  The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall be
paid by the unusual user.  Based on these audited figures, additional billings
covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual user, or
refund given by the utility, as the case may be.  Such audited figures will
then be used for the preliminary billing for the next fiscal year, at the end
of which an adjustment will be made as aforesaid.

Manager shall designate shall forthwith inspect or cause to be inspected the
premises and shall make a written report of his findings.  Whenever

found, the City Manager, Chief of Police or the Building Inspector, or some
other City official whom the City Manager shall designate, may cause the
abatement or removal of such public nuisance.
   (c)   Abatement by Court Action.  If the inspecting officer determines that
a public nuisance exists on private premises but that the nature of such
nuisance is not such as to threaten great and immediate danger to the public

findings with the City Manager, who shall cause an action to abate such
nuisance to be commenced in the name of the City from a court of competent
jurisdiction, which shall include the municipal court, which is hereby

police jurisdiction of the City.  The following definitions shall apply with
respect hereto:
   (b)    “Abatement” means the repair, removal, stoppage, prostration, or
destruction of that which causes or constitutes a nuisance, whether by

effacing it. Abatement shall include the right of the City to declare such
building to be unfit for human occupancy and cause it to be vacated and closed.
   (c)    “Building Enforcement Agency” means the agency created by Article
1717 of this City Code, or any amendment or replacement thereof.
   (d)    “Owner” means the owner of record based on land records at the Office
of the Clerk of the County Commission, or any person with legal, financial or
equitable interest in the property on which the alleged building nuisance

   (e)    “Property” means any real property, premises, structure or location
on which a
building nuisance is alleged to exist.
   (f)    “Building Nuisance” means any fence, wall, shed, deck, house, garage,
building, structure or any part of any of the aforesaid; or any tree, pole,
smokestack; or any excavation, hole, pit, basement, cellar, sidewalk subspace,
dock, wharf or landing dock; or any lot, land, yard, premises, property, or
location which in its entirety, or in any part thereof, by reason of the
condition in which the same is found or permitted to be or remain, shall or may
endanger the health, safety, life, limb or property, or cause any hurt, harm,
inconvenience, discomfort, damage or injury to any one or more individuals in
the City, in any one or more of the following particulars:
      (1)    By reason of being a menace, threat and/or hazard to the general
health and safety of the community.
      (2)    By reason of being a fire hazard.
      (3)    By reason of being unsafe for occupancy, or use on, in, upon,

be vacated and closed.  (Ord. 9-7-10)
1105.02  EMERGENCY OR SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   (a)    Whenever a complaint is made to the City of the existence of a
building nuisance, as defined herein, the Building Enforcement Agency shall
promptly cause to be inspected the property on which it is alleged that such
building nuisance exists. The Building Enforcement Agency shall have the right
and authority, through any of its members or agents duly authorized by the said
Building Enforcement Agency (including, but not limited to the Building
Inspector and the Fire Chief), to enter any dwelling or building for the
purpose of making any inspection or examination.  The City may seek consent
from the owner for inspection or seek an administrative search warrant from a
court of competent jurisdiction, which shall include the municipal court, which
is hereby conferred such authority hereunder.  Should the Building Enforcement
Agency find that a building nuisance exists, and that the public health, safety
or welfare may be in immediate danger, then summary abatement procedures shall
be implemented and the City may cause the nuisance to be removed or abated.
   The Building Enforcement Agency may notify the Building Inspector if the
building nuisance involves a building that appears structurally or otherwise
unsafe. The Building Inspector, upon being notified by the Building Enforcement
Agency shall cause the building on which it is alleged such building nuisance
exists to be inspected and submit a written report of such inspection and the
findings to the Building Enforcement Agency.
   (b)    When summary abatement is authorized, notice to the owner, agent, or
occupant
of the property is not required.  Following summary abatement, the Building
Enforcement Agency shall cause to be posted on the property liable for the
abatement a notice describing the action taken to abate the nuisance, and
attempt to deliver the notice in person or by mail if feasible to the owner,
agent, or occupant.
(Ord. 9-7-10)
1105.03  ABATEMENT IN OTHER CASES; NOTICE, ETC.
   (a)    If the owner fails or refuses to consent to and arrange for an
inspection, the City may seek an administrative search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, which shall include the municipal court, which is
hereby conferred such authority hereunder.  If, after inspecting the property
on which the nuisance is reported, the Building Enforcement Agency or Building
Inspector declares the existence of a building nuisance, but the nature thereof
is not such that the public health, safety or welfare is in immediate danger so
as to require the summary abatement of such nuisance, then, regular abatement
procedures shall be followed.  Photographs and reports of the findings and
inspections shall be made and filed with the City Manager.
   (b)    The Building Enforcement Agency shall determine the individual, firm
or corporation who, from the records in the Office of the Clerk of the County
Commission, appears to be the titled owner of the aforesaid property and
immediately cause a written notice to be served on such individual, firm or
corporation by personal service or by leaving a copy of the notice at the usual
place of residence or business of such owner, or address of such owner shown in
the County Clerk's records, or by copy mailed to such owner at such place or
address by United States certified mail return receipt. If service of such
written notice is unable to be perfected by any of the methods described above,
the Building Enforcement Agency shall cause a copy of the aforesaid notice to
be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, once a week for
two consecutive weeks, and shall further cause a copy of the aforesaid notice
to be left with the individual, if any, in possession of such property on which
it is alleged such building nuisance exists, and any person known to be in
charge of the property, or if there is no such individual in possession or in
charge thereof, the Building Enforcement Agency shall cause a copy of the
notice to be to be posted at such structure, location or premises.  The
Building Enforcement Agency shall also determine from the Office of the Clerk
of the County Commission, who the lienholder of the property, if any, as
documented therein, is and cause a written notice to be served on such
lienholder by United States mail return receipt.
   (c)    The aforesaid notice to the owner, and lienholder, if any, of the
property shall state clearly and concisely the findings of the Building
Enforcement Agency with respect to the existence of a building nuisance. The
notice shall further state that unless the owner thereof shall cause the
abatement of the building nuisance, pursuant to the orders contained in the
Building Enforcement Agency's notice, the building nuisance may, at the City's
discretion, be abated by the City at the expense of the owner.
   (d)    Any person who is the record owner of the premises, location or
structure at the
time an order pursuant to this article is issued and served upon him, shall be
responsible for
complying with that order, and liable for any costs incurred by the City
therewith,
notwithstanding the fact that he conveys his interests in the property to
another after such order
was issued and served.
   (e)    It shall not be a defense to the determination that a building
nuisance exists that the property is boarded up or otherwise enclosed.
(Ord. 9-7-10)
1105.04  ABATEMENT BY OWNER.
   (a)    Within thirty (30) days after the service or posting of a notice to
abate a nuisance, the owner, agent of the owner, or individual in possession of
the affected property shall repair, demolish, or otherwise remove and abate
such nuisance or show that no nuisance in fact exists. Such showing shall be
made by filing a written statement that no nuisance exists. The statement shall
be filed with the Building Enforcement Agency or Building Inspector, which
shall inspect the property in order to verify the same.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, the
application for, or receipt of a building permit or permit to demolish or raze,
shall not be deemed to extend the thirty (30) day time period to repair,
demolish, remove, and abate, unless extended, in writing, pursuant to the terms
of paragraph (b) below.
   (b)    The Building Enforcement Agency or Building Inspector, upon written
application by the owner within the thirty (30) day period after the notice has
been served, may grant additional time for the owner to effect the abatement of
the building nuisance, provided that such extension is limited to a specific
time period, to be issued in writing and receipt thereof acknowledged by the
owner's signature.
   (c)    In the alternative, the City may institute a civil action in a court
of competent jurisdiction against the property owner or other responsible party
for an injunction or order to abate the nuisance and for all costs as provided
in Section
1105.07.  In addition, the City may institute misdemeanor criminal charges
pursuant to Section
1105.99.
(Ord. 9-7-10)
1105.05  APPEAL PROCEDURES; HEARING.
   (a)    The owner or occupant of the property who has been served with a
notice pursuant to this article that a building nuisance exists and that it
must be abated within thirty (30) days, may, within seven (7) calendar days
after receipt of such notice, make a written demand to the City for a hearing
on the question of whether a building nuisance in fact exists. The hearing
shall be held within fifteen (15) calendar days following receipt by the City
of the written demand and at least two (2) days' notice of the hearing shall be
given to the individual who made the written demand for the hearing. 
   (b)    The hearing shall be conducted by the City Council.  The City Council
may amend or modify the notice and/or order, or extend the time for compliance
with the Building Enforcement Agency's order by the owner by such date as the
majority of City Council may determine.
   (c)    The owner, agent of the owner, occupant and lienholder, if any, of
the subject
property shall be given the opportunity to present evidence to the City Council
in the course of
the hearing.
   (d)    In those instances where the nuisance has been abated by the City,
the City Council shall have discretion to waive the cost of abating a nuisance,
in whole or in part, if, in the course of the hearing reviewing the decision,
the City Council finds that any of the following did not conform to the
provisions of this article:
      (1)    The notice to remove the nuisance;
      (2)    The work performed in abating the nuisance; or
      (3)    The computation of charges.
         (Ord. 9-7-10)
1105.06  ABATEMENT BY CITY.
   (a)    Should any building nuisance not be abated at the expiration of the
time stated in the notice/order or within such additional time as the Building
Enforcement Agency, Building Inspector, or City Council  may grant, the City
shall have the authority, at its sole discretion,  to enter upon the property
and abate the building nuisance found thereon. In abating such nuisance, the
City may go to whatever extent may be necessary to complete the abatement of
the building nuisance and should it be practicable to salvage any material
derived in the aforesaid abatement, the City may sell the salvaged material at
private or public sale at the best price obtainable and shall keep an
accounting of the proceeds thereof.
   (b)    The proceeds, if any, obtained from the sale of any material salvaged
as a result of an abatement of a building nuisance by the City shall be
deposited to the General Fund of the City and any deficit between the amount so
received and the cost of the abatement may be levied as an assessment against
the property in question by the City and collected as any other assessment by
the City; however, any other alternative collection method may be utilized by
the City to recoup the deficit. Should the proceeds of the sale of such
salvaged material exceed the cost of abatement, the surplus, if any, shall be
paid to the owner of the property from which the building nuisance was abated
when a proper claim to the excess is made by the owner and established.
   (c)    In abating a building nuisance, the Building Enforcement Agency may
call upon any of the City departments or divisions for whatever assistance
shall be deemed necessary or may by private contract cause the abatement of the
building nuisance.
   (d)    The Building Enforcement Agency shall, after completing the removal
and abatement, file a statement of costs with the City Manager.
(Ord. 9-7-10)
1105.07  NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT; APPEAL OF CHARGES.
   (a)    Upon receipt of the statement of costs from the Building Enforcement
Agency, the City shall mail to the owner of the property upon which the

set forth in the statement plus an additional amount sufficient to defray the
costs of the notice and the charges and penalties provided by Section
1105.10 stating that the City proposes to assess against the property the
amount set forth in the notice and that payment or objections to the proposed
assessment must be made in writing and received by the City within twenty (20)
days from the date of mailing such notice. Upon the expiration of the twenty
(20) day period, if no objections have been received by the City, the City
shall enter that amount in the County liens docket which shall therefore
constitute a lien against the property.
   (b)    If objections of either the property owner or their representative
are received by
the City prior to the expiration of the twenty (20) day period, the matter
shall be referred to the Building Enforcement Agency for administrative review.
   (c)    Upon conclusion of administrative review, the Building Enforcement
Agency shall make a written determination within seven (7) calendar days of the
objection filed, as to whether the amount of the charges shall be canceled,
reduced, or remain the same.  A copy of this determination shall be furnished
to the person making the objections together with a notice of such person's
right to appeal to City Council.  Such appeal must be by written demand within
seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the determination of the Building
Enforcement Agency.  The hearing shall be on the question of whether the
proposed assessment should be canceled, reduced, or remain the same.  The
hearing shall be held within fifteen (15) calendar days following receipt by
the City of the written demand and at least two (2) days' notice of the hearing
shall be given to the individual who made the written demand for the hearing. 
   (d)    If no appeal of a determination by the Building Enforcement Agency is
filed within the time period allowed, a copy of the determination will be
furnished to the City Clerk who shall then enter a lien in the amount
determined by the Building Enforcement Agency in the County liens docket as
provided in subsection (a).
   (e)    If, after the hearing, it is determined that the proposed assessment
or any part of it is proper and authorized, the City Council shall so certify
to the City Clerk who shall enter a lien in such amount as determined
appropriate by the City Council, in the lien docket as provided in subsection
(a).
   (f)    With respect to assessments, the determination of the City Council
upon appeal is a final administrative decision and is not further appealable.
   (g)   (1)    The Building Enforcement Agency, in administrative review, or
the City Council, on appeal, may reduce or cancel a proposed assessment if it
is determined that:
         A.   The owner of the property was eligible for a waiver of costs
under Section
1105.09; or
         B.   Any of the following did not conform to the provisions of this
article:
            1.   The notice to remove the nuisance; or
            2.   The work performed in abating the nuisance; or
            3.   The computation of charges; or
      (2)    The Building Enforcement Agency, in administrative review, or the
City Council, on appeal, may reduce a proposed assessment by eliminating the
civil penalty portion of the invoice if it is determined that:
         A.   The current owner was not in possession of the property at the
time the notice required in Section
1105.03 was served or posted; or
         B.   The owner did not receive the notice to remove the nuisance, did
not have knowledge of the nuisance and could not, with the exercise of
reasonable diligence, have had such knowledge.
   (h)     If, after a lien has been entered in the docket of County liens,
there is a written request of an owner who alleges that the owner did not
receive notice of the proposed assessment, the City Clerk shall refer the
matter for review pursuant to subsection (b) and (c), notwithstanding the time
period therein was not met.  The following may occur upon such review:
      (1)    The lien may be canceled or reduced by the Building Enforcement
Agency, in administrative review, or the City Council on appeal, if it is
determined that the owner did not receive notice of the proposed assessment,
did not previously have knowledge of  the lien or of the nuisance abatement
work constituting the basis of the lien, could not, in the exercise of
reasonable care or diligence, have had such knowledge, and in addition, that
the circumstances are such that a reduction or cancellation of the charges
would have been appropriate had the matter been reviewed pursuant to this
Section prior to assessment. Upon receipt of a certification from the Building
Enforcement Agency (or City Council if there is an appeal), the City Clerk
shall cancel or reduce the lien if required by the determination of the
Building Enforcement Agency or City Council.
   (i)    In the alternative, the City may institute a civil action in a court
of competent jurisdiction against the property owner or other responsible party
for all costs incurred by the City with respect to the abatement and reasonable
attorney fees and court costs incurred in the prosecution of the action.  (Ord.
9-7-10)
1105.08  PERSONAL LIABILITY OF OWNER.
   The person who is the owner of the property at the time at which the notice
required under Section
1105.03 is served or posted shall be personally liable for the amount of the
assessment including all interest, civil penalties, and other charges.
(Ord. 9-7-10)
1105.09  COST OF ABATEMENT; LOW INCOME, ELDERLY PERSONS.
   (a)    Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, the cost of
abating a nuisance shall be waived for low income and elderly persons, if upon

property for which a waiver, pursuant to this Section, shall have been
approved.

   There is hereby continued and re-established in the City of Moundsville an
uninhabitable building registration program.  (Passed 10-3-17.)
1107.02  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   For purposes of this article, the term “uninhabitable building” means:
a building or other structure that is not capable  or fit for occupancy because
it violates the Moundsville Building Code to such an extent as to make it
unsafe for human occupancy for residency or business purposes.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, “owner” or “property owner” means a
person who individually or jointly with others:
      (1)   Has legal title to the property, with or without actual possession
of the property;
      (2)   Has charge, care or control of the property as owner or agent of
the owner;
      (3)   Is an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of the estate of
the owner;
      (4)   Is the agent of the owner for the purpose of managing, controlling
or collecting rents;
      (5)   Is entitled to control or direct the management or disposition of
the property; or
      (6)   is the owner of record based on land records at the Office of the
Clerk of the County Commission, and includes any co-owner, or any person or
entity with legal, financial or equitable interest in the property on which the
building is situate, and any entity subjecting real estate to foreclosure, at
the time the registration fee imposed hereunder becomes due and owing.
         (Passed 10-3-17.)
1107.03  REGISTRATION REQUIRED; INSPECTION; FEE.
   (a)   Registration:  All owners of real estate within the City of
Moundsville upon which is situate an uninhabitable building shall register the
same with the City within thirty (30) days after the building is found to meet
the definition of an uninhabitable building by the Building Inspector or other
city agent designated by the City Manager.  The registration form shall require
information from the registrant deemed necessary by the City to meet the
purposes of this article.  Additionally, the Building Inspector or other
designated City agent, may require that the owner provide a professional
opinion (architect, engineer, etc.) to determine the structural integrity of
the building, any repairs necessary to ensure its structural integrity and that
it will be safe for  entry by fire fighters and police officers in time of
emergency, and that the building and its contents do not present a hazard to
the public during the time the building remains uninhabitable.  Owners failing
to comply or repair may be subjected to prosecution under this article and/or
to other provisions of the City Code dealing with violations of the Building
Code, orders to repair or raze, public nuisance, building nuisance, and the
like.
   (b)   Inspection:  At the time of registration, the Building Inspector, or
other designated city agent, shall determine whether it is necessary for an
inspection of the structure so as to determine occupancy, and to identify any
public safety issued needing addressed.  Other city officials having  an
interest in the public safety, such as the Fire Chief, Police Chief, City
Engineer, and the like, may attend the inspection.  If the owner fails or
refuses to consent to and arrange for an inspection, the City will seek an
administrative search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction, which
shall include the municipal court, which is hereby conferred such authority
hereunder.
   (c)   Uninhabitable Building Fee:  There is hereby imposed on any owner of
real property upon which there is situate an uninhabitable building, an annual
registration fee, the full amount of which shall be due upon initial assessment
thereof by the building inspector, for the ensuing year after the date of
assessment, and each year thereafter on the anniversary date of the initial
assessment if still uninhabitable at said anniversary and continuing each year
thereafter until the owner shall apply for, and be granted an exemption or
otherwise present proof to the Building Inspector that the real property no
longer meets the definition of having an uninhabitable building situate
thereon.  Said fee shall be based on the duration of the condition of being
uninhabitable as determined by the following scale:
      (1)   No fee for properties that are uninhabitable for less than one year
(registration is nevertheless required).
      (2)   $200.00 for properties that are uninhabitable for at least one year
but less than two years.

years but less than four years.

years but less than five years.
      (6)   $1,600.00 for properties that are uninhabitable for at least five
years, plus an additional $300.00 for each year in excess of five years.
   (d)   The owner at the time of determination of vacancy or uninhabitability
shall be the responsible party for the initial registration and fee, and the
owner as of each anniversary date of assessment each year shall be responsible
for the registration and fee for such ensuing year or years.  It shall be
owner’s responsibility to notify any new owner of the uninhabitable building
registration.
   (e)   In no instance shall the registration of an uninhabitable building and
the payment of the registration fees shall be construed to excuse or exonerate
the owner, agent or responsible party from compliance with any other building
or housing code requirement of the City.
(Passed 10-3-17.)
1107.04  ABSENTEE OWNERS.
   (a)   When the owner of the uninhabitable building resides outside of
Marshall County, West  Virginia, the owner shall provide contact information of

shall include:  name, address, home phone, cell phone, work phone, relationship
to the owner, and any other information that may be needed in an emergency.
   (b)   This person or entity shall be authorized to accept service of process

   (m)   If an owner fails to pay the uninhabitable building registration fee,
then the officer may annually post the written notice on the property and send
the written notice to the owner(s) by certified mail.

Such removal shall be done in a manner prescribed by the Chief of Police, the
Director of the Department of Public Works, or any additional City department

above shall not apply if the property owner or responsible party can
demonstrate that:
      (1)   The property owner or responsible party lacks the financial ability
to remove the defacing graffiti; or
      (2)   The property owner or responsible party has an active program for
the removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the graffiti as part

authorized to use public funds for the removal of the graffiti, or for the
painting or repairing of the graffiti, but shall not authorize or undertake to
provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive an area than that

neighborhood or community, or unless the property owner or responsible party
agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or repairing the more extensive area.
      (2)   Right of Entry on Private Property.  Prior to entering upon private
property or property owned by a public entity other than the City for the
purpose of graffiti removal the City shall attempt to secure the consent of the
property owner or responsible party and a release of the City from liability
for property damage or personal injury. If the property owner or responsible
party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time specified by this
article, or if the City has requested consent to remove or paint over the
offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party has refused
consent for entry on terms acceptable to the City and consistent with the terms
of this Section, the City shall commence abatement and cost recovery
proceedings for the graffiti removal according to the provisions specified
below.
   (e)   Abatement and Cost Recovery Proceedings.
      (1)   Notice of Due Process Hearing. The City Manager, or the designee of
the City Manager, serving as the Hearing Officer, shall provide the property
owner of record and the party responsible for the maintenance of the property,
if a person different from the owner, not less than forty-eight (48) hours
notice of the City's intent to hold a due process hearing at which the property
owner or responsible party shall be entitled to present evidence and argue that
the property does not constitute a public nuisance. Notice shall be served in
the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with Rule 4 of the
West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record cannot be found
after a diligent search, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in
a conspicuous place upon the property for a period often (10) days and
publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in the area
in which the property is located.
      (2)   Determination of Hearing Officer. The determination of the Hearing
Officer after the due process hearing shall be final and not appealable. If,
after the due process hearing, regardless of the attendance of the Owner or the
responsible party or their respective agents, the Hearing Officer determines
that the property contains graffiti viewable from a public or quasi-public
place, the Hearing Officer shall give written notice in an eradication order
that, unless the graffiti is removed within ten (10) days, the City shall enter
upon the property, cause the removal, painting over (in such color as shall
meet with the approval of the Hearing Officer), or such other eradication
thereof as the Hearing Officer determines appropriate, and shall provide the
Owner and the responsible party thereafter with an accounting of the costs of
the eradication effort on a full cost recovery basis.
      (3)   Eradication Effort. Not sooner than the time specified in the order
of the Hearing Officer, the City Manager, or the designee of the City Manager,
shall implement the eradication order and shall provide an accounting to the
Owner and the responsible party of the costs thereof.
      (4)   Cost Hearing. The Owner or responsible party may request a cost
hearing before the Hearing Officer on the eradication accounting, and
appropriate due process must be extended to the Owner or responsible party. If
following the cost hearing or, if no hearing is requested, after the
implementation of the eradication order, the Hearing Officer determines that
all or a portion of the costs are appropriately chargeable to the eradication
effort, the total amount set forth in the eradication accounting, or an amount
thereof determined as appropriate by the Hearing Officer, shall be due and
payable by the Owner or responsible party within thirty  (30) days. Any amount
of eradication charges assessed by the Hearing Officer that are less than the
total amount set forth in the eradication accounting shall be explained by
written letter from the Hearing Officer to the City Council.
      (5)   Lien. As to such property where the responsible party is the
property owner, if all or any portion of the assessed eradication charges
remains unpaid after thirty (30) days, the City may seek judgment in a court of
competent jurisdiction in order to place a lien on the property and to enforce
the same.

1111.99  CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Any person violating this article shall be punished by a fine of up to
five hundred dollars ($500.00).
      (1)   In the case of a minor, the parents or legal guardian shall be
jointly and severally liable with the minor for payment of all fines.
      (2)   Failure of the parents or legal guardian to make payment will

1305.01  PURPOSE.
   Any city is empowered to adopt and enforce land subdivision regulations for
the purpose of:
   (a)   Promoting the public safety, health and general welfare;
   (b)   Assuring sites suitable for building purposes and human habitation;
   (c)   Coordinating subdivision streets with existing and planned streets and
highways;
   (d)   Coordinating and extending facilities included in the Comprehensive
Plan;
   (e)   Establishing minimum width, depth and area of lots within the
projected subdivision;
   (f)   Distributing population and traffic in a manner tending to create
conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience and the harmonious
development of the City;
   (g)   Fair allocations of areas for streets, parks, schools, public and
semi-public buildings, homes, utilities, business and industry;
   (h)   Providing proper land records for the convenience of the public; and
   (i)   Providing better identification and permanent location of real estate
boundaries.  (4-24-72)
1305.02  GRANT OF POWER.
   After a Comprehensive Plan and an ordinance containing Land Subdivision
Regulations have been adopted and a certified copy of the ordinance has been
filed with the County Clerk, the Planning Commission shall have exclusive
control over the approval of all plats and replats involving incorporated land
covered by the Comprehensive Plan and Land Subdivision Regulations.
(4-24-72)
1305.03  APPROVAL REQUIRED BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   After a Comprehensive Plan and an ordinance containing Land Subdivision
Regulations have been adopted and a certified copy of the ordinance has been
filed with the County Clerk, a plat or replat of a subdivision shall not be
recorded by the City unless it has first been approved by the Planning
Commission.  The filing and recording of a plat involving the subdivision of
lands covered by such Plan and Regulations shall be without legal effect unless
approved by the Commission; provided, however, that failure to comply with this
section shall not invalidate or affect title to any land within the area of
such plat or replat; and provided further, that if such plat shall bear the
signature of the Chairman and seal of the Commission, it shall be presumed to
have been approved thereby.  (4-24-72)
1305.04  INTERPRETATION.
   In interpreting the requirements of the Land Subdivision Regulations, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the creation of conditions
favorable to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents of
the City.  It is not intended by these Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul
or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or
ordinances, except those specifically repealed by these Regulations, or with
private restrictions placed upon property by covenant, deed or other private
agreements, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to which the
City is a party.  Where these Regulations impose a greater restriction other
than is imposed or required by such existing provisions of law, ordinance,
contract or deed, the provisions of these Regulations shall control.  (4-24-72)
1305.05  GENERAL PROCEDURE REVIEW.
   (a)   Any person, firm or corporation who desires to plat, replat or
subdivide land within the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission of the City,
as provided by the laws of the State, shall submit a written application for a
certificate together with a copy of the proposed plat to the Commission.
   Upon receipt of the application, the Commission if it tentatively approves
the application shall set a date for a hearing, notify the applicant in
writing, and notify by general publication or otherwise any person or
governmental unit having probable interest in the proposed plat.
   In determining whether an application for approval shall be granted the
Commission shall determine if the plat provides for:
      (1)   Coordination of subdivision streets with existing and planned
streets or highways.
      (2)   Coordination with and extension of facilities included in the
Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   Establishment of minimum width, depth and area of lots within the
projected subdivision.
      (4)   Distribution of population and traffic in a manner tending to
create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience and the harmonious
development of the City or County.
      (5)   Fair allocations of areas for streets, parks, schools, public and
semipublic buildings, homes, utilities, business and industry.

      (1)   The manner in which streets shall be laid out, graded and improved.
      (2)   Provisions for water, sewage and other utility services.
      (3)   Provision for schools.
      (4)   Provision for essential Municipal services.
      (5)   Provision for recreational facilities.
   (c)   After the hearing and within a reasonable time after the application
for approval of the plat, the Commission shall, if the Commission approves the
plat, affix its seal on the plat.  If the Commission disapproves the proposed
plat, it shall set forth its reasons in its minutes and provide the applicant
with a copy.
 
   (d)   The Commission shall have the authority to approve a plat for a
subdivision in which the improvements and installations have not been completed
as required by the Commission if the applicant provides a bond which shall:
      (1)   Run to the City of Moundsville.
      (2)   Be in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to
complete the improvements and installations required by the Commission.
      (3)   Be with surety satisfactory to the Commission.
      (4)   Specify the time for the completion of the improvements and
installations required by the Commission.

   (b)   Land subject to flooding and land deemed as subject to hazards of
life, health and safety shall not be subdivided for use until such hazards have
been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards against such hazards are provided
by the subdivision plat or such land is set aside for uses appropriate to the
existing conditions.
(4-24-72)
1315.03  STREET REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Conformity with Official Maps and Plans.  The arrangements, type,
extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform with the Map of
the City, the Comprehensive Plan of the City and any other official City,
regional, County or State Plan which may be prepared, adopted and/or filed as
prescribed by law.
 
   (b)   Relation to Topography.  Streets shall be logically related to the
topography so as to produce usable lots at reasonable grades.
 
   (c)   Relation to Proposed Use.  Streets shall be in appropriate
relationship to the proposed land uses served by such streets.
 
   (d)   Traffic Movement.  Local streets shall be so laid out as to discourage
through traffic but provisions for street connections into and from adjacent
areas shall be generally required.
 
   (e)   Continuance of Streets.  Provisions shall be made for continuing or
extending any existing streets or adjoining subdivisions or land where such
extension may be necessary for public service or convenience and opportunities
shall be provided for extending streets beyond the boundaries of any
subdivision where such extension may be required for public service or
convenience.
 
   (f)   Reverse Frontage.  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing
or proposed arterial street, the Commission may require reverse frontage,
screening or no access which shall provide protection for abutting properties,
reduce the number of intersections and separate local and through traffic.
 
   (g)   Half Streets.  Half streets shall be prohibited except to complete an
existing half street.
 
   (h)   Dead End Streets and Cul-De-Sac's.  A dead end street shall be

permanently, shall not be longer than 500 feet and shall be provided at the
closed end with a turnaround or cul-de-sac having no island thereon, having a
roadway diameter of at least eighty feet and a right-of-way diameter of at
least 100 feet.
 
   (i)   Subdivision Borders on a Railroad or Limited Access Highway.  Where a
subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access
highway right-of-way, there may be required a street approximately parallel to
and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential
districts, or for business or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. 
Such districts shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach, grades and future grade separations.
 
   (j)   Alleys.  Alleys are not permitted in residential districts under the
Moundsville Zoning Ordinance.  However, alleys are permitted in commercial and
industrial districts unless waived by the Commission.  Alley design regulations
are as follows:
      (1)   Minimum cartway width of thirty feet; and
      (2)   Maximum alley grade shall be ten percent (10%).

1319.01  INTRODUCTION.
   (a)   The construction of improvements in a subdivision is the
responsibility of the subdivider since it is his subdivision which is being
developed.  Adequate streets, utilities and other improvements are essential
elements in the development and preservation of stable residential, commercial
and industrial areas.  Once the subdivider disposes of the lots and the
improvements are accepted by the local government, the responsibility of
maintaining such improvements and correcting any construction errors falls on
the local government.
   (b)   Any or all of the following improvements, as may be recommended by the
Planning Commission when considering the needs of the area in which the
proposed subdivision is located, shall have been completed in accordance with
the requirements established by these Land Subdivision Regulations as well as
in accordance with the requirements of the responsible public authority
affected, public officials or the City Engineer for that portion included in
the final plat.
   (c)   If the improvements are not completed, then satisfactory arrangements
should be made with the Commission to the satisfaction of all public
authorities concerned regarding proper completion of such improvements prior to
the consideration of a final plat.
(4-24-72)
1319.02  STREETS, CURBS, BASE AND PAVEMENT.
   Street construction including new streets or reconstruction of existing
streets shall be governed by the succeeding specifications and regulations
established by the City.
   (a)   Grading.  All streets shall be graded to the full width of the right-
of-way and the adjacent side slopes graded to blend with the natural lay of the
land, or in accordance with the cross section presented to the satisfaction of
the City Engineer.  Where fill material is necessary to establish uniform
grades, compacting shall be required in accordance with the regulations
established by the City.  A slope of two horizontal to one vertical, beyond the
right-of-way line in cut or fill, shall ordinarily be required.
   (b)   Street Cross Sections.  Street cross sections for local streets and
collector streets shall be in accordance with the regulations established by
the City.  Where alternatives are available, the Planning Commission may
designate the cross sections to be used on the advice of the City Engineer. 
All details of the cross sections; crowns, curb, pavement, subgrade and
roadside ditches, shall conform to the designated cross section.  Arterial road
cross sections shall be as designated by the City Engineer and approved by the
Commission.  State approval shall be required where necessary.
   (c)   Cross Drains.  Cross drains shall be a minimum of fifteen-inch
reinforced concrete or bituminous covered corrugated metal pipe and shall be
placed wherever necessary to transfer water across the road to a natural water
course and at road intersections where needed.
   (d)   Curbing.
      (1)   Curbing shall be of concrete or of a bituminous mix, either
straight, battered or rolled as determined by the Commission.
      (2)   The requirements of curbs or curbs and gutters shall vary in
accordance with the character of the area and density of development involved.
         A.   Curbs shall ordinarily be required where:
            1.   Streets are designed to serve areas in which the net
residential density of the area surrounding the proposed subdivision equals or
exceeds three families per acre;
            2.   Lot frontage is less than seventy-five feet;
            3.   Commercial development or other similar intensive urban uses
exist; and
            4.   If curbs exist on abutting property, the Commission shall
ordinarily require their extension throughout the proposed subdivision.
         B.   The Commission may require curbs and gutters to be installed on
arterial, collector or local streets if such construction is deemed necessary
for public safety, control of water runoff or clearly defined driving and
parking areas.
         C.   When curbed streets are constructed, the space behind the curb
shall be filled and graded to drain to the street at a slope of three-eighths
of one inch per foot.
   (e)   Base Course.  The base course shall be eight-inch thick (rolled
measurement) native stone, limestone or crushed slag properly graded and
meeting the requirements of the current specifications of the West Virginia
Department of Highways and subject to their complete tests.  Lesser base
courses, to a minimum of six inches, may be authorized by the Commission on
advice of the City Engineer on lesser streets where the character of the
drainage of the subgrade, the size of the subdivision and nature of the traffic
warrants.
   (f)   Pavements.
      (1)   A two and one-half inch bituminous plant mixed surface shall be
placed on the prepared base to meet the requirements of the current
specifications of the West Virginia Department of Highways.  Where a six-inch
base is authorized, a bituminous double surface treatment in accordance with
the West Virginia Department of Highways requirements may be used.
         It shall be the general practice that developers shall not complete
the permanent paving process until such time as all underground utility and
other heavy subdivision construction has been completed to minimize potential
street damage in new developments.  Maintenance of the partially completed
(paved) streets shall be the responsibility of the developer until such time as
the permanent paving process is completed and maintenance responsibility
transferred to the City through the street dedication process.
      (2)   Where concrete pavement is used, the standard requirements of the
West Virginia Department of Highways shall govern and all work shall be
performed in the manner prescribed in the standard specifications for road
construction of such Department, and shall be approved by the City Engineer. 
Local streets shall be at least six inches in thickness and conform to other
specifications of the Department.
      (3)   Either type of pavement listed above shall be approved by the
Commission and City Engineer before application.  The installation shall be
under the direct supervision of the City Engineer. 
         (4-24-72)

at plat boundary or within a reasonable distance thereto, that being 1,000 feet
of the subdivision.  Waterlines shall be located as determined by the City
Engineer for fire protection and water service purposes.
   (b)   If a public water supply system is not available under the conditions
stated above, the subdivider may either provide individual wells or a public
water system for a subdivision of less than twenty-five lots, but shall provide
a public water system for a subdivision of twenty-five lots or more, which
public water system shall be approved by the West Virginia Board of Health.
   (c)   Where individual wells provide a water supply in a large subdivision
at least one test well shall be drilled in the proposed area for each fifty
lots or twenty-five acres, whichever is smaller, or upon the requirements of
the State Health Officer.
   Test wells shall ordinarily be drilled to a reasonable depth which shall
produce safe potable water in sufficient quantity for the use intended and
shall be approved by the State Health Officer.
   (d)   All public water systems shall be laid wherever possible in the
planting strip on the north and east side of the street and constructed in
accordance with the regulations of the West Virginia Board of Health.
   (e)   All phases of construction, including minimum size six-inch line,
excavation, trench, type pipe, backfill, hydrants, tees and valves shall be in
accordance with approved construction drawings, West Virginia Board of Health
Standards and inspected by the City Engineer or his authorized representatives
during the entire construction period.
   (f)   All water mains shall be a minimum six-inch line size or larger as
determined by the City Engineer for fire protection and water service purposes.
(4-24-72)
1319.04  SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)   The subdivider shall construct a sanitary sewer system and connect to
the City public sanitary sewer system where the City sewer main line is

subject to approval by the West Virginia Board of Health and inspected by the
City Engineer.
   (c)   All phases of construction and installation including excavation,
trench, grade, backfill and manholes shall be made in accordance with the
regulations of the West Virginia Board of Health, the City Sanitary Board or
their authorized authority and shall be subject to inspections by the City
Engineer.
   (d)   Sanitary sewer main lines shall be minimum diameter of eight inches or
larger as determined by the City Engineer.
   (e)   House lines, laterals, trunks, manholes and other appurtenances shall
be of such size, spacing and grades as specified by the West Virginia Board of
Health, the City Sanitary Board or their authorized authority.
   (f)   In areas where a City sanitary sewer system is planned, but not yet
available, laterals shall be extended to the centerline of the street and
connected to a trunk line extending to that edge of the subdivision closest to
the street connecting point of the trunk line.  The trunk shall then be capped
until such time as the City main trunk line is available.
   (g)   Connection of any storm water into sanitary sewers shall be
prohibited.
   (h)   The use of septic tanks and private sewer disposal systems shall be
subject to approval by the West Virginia Board of Health, the City Sanitary
Board or their authorized authority and inspected by the City Engineer. 
Installation of septic tanks shall be coordinated with the lot size
requirements as stated in the Moundsville Zoning Ordinance, the drainage
characteristics of the soil in the area, percolation tests at a maximum rate of
sixty minutes per inch as well as the recommendation of the City Health
Officer.
   (i)   On-lot septic tanks and other private sewer systems shall be permitted
in areas where the City sanitary sewer system is not now available (more than
1,000 feet from a tract boundary), is not planned or when no right of way can
be secured by easement through adjoining property to a public sewer.
   (j)   If in the opinion of the West Virginia Board of Health, the City
Engineer and/or the Planning Commission, factors exist which create a public
health and sanitation problem if a certain area is platted, the Commission
shall not approve the subdivision and platting of such area until such factors
are corrected by an adequate sanitary sewer system.  (4-24-72)
1319.05  STORM SEWERS.
   (a)   A storm drainage system adequate to serve the needs of the proposed
new streets or the entire subdivision shall normally be required in new
subdivisions.  When a public storm sewer main is available at the plat boundary
or within 1,000 feet, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system and
connect with such storm sewer main.
   (b)   In areas where a public storm sewer main is not available, the
developer shall take necessary steps to prevent storm drainage onto adjacent
properties and in accordance with the natural drainage pattern of the land.
   (c)   Storm sewers shall be located within a street right of way or utility
easement in a manner approved by the Planning Commission.

1351.04 CLASSIFICATION OF DISTRICTS AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   Except where references on the Zoning Map to a road or street line or
other designated line by dimensions are shown on the Zoning Map, the district
boundary lines are intended to follow lot lines or the centerlines of roads or
streets, as they existed at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance.
To the extent possible, district boundary lines should not be established or
interpreted to bisect property lots. Where district boundary lines are shown
following creeks, streams, or river channels, it is intended that the district
line follow the center of the creek, stream, or river. Where a district line
does not coincide clearly with such lines, or where a district line is not
designated by dimensions, a district line shall be determined by scaling.
   (b)   The boundaries of all zoning districts are shown on the Zoning Map,
which is the official zoning map for the City.
   (c)   Unless a use is allowed as a "use permitted by right," "use permitted
with conditions," "conditional use," "nonconforming use," "accessory use," or
"temporary use," then such use is prohibited.  (Passed 10-3-17.)
1351.05  PROCEDURES RELATING TO ANNEXED OR VACATED AREAS.
   (a)   Zoning of Annexed Lands. Zoning classification for any land annexed
into the City shall be established by ordinance, pursuant to Chapter 8A,
Article 7, simultaneously with the adoption of the annexation resolution
required by West Virginia Code, Chapter 8, Article 6, as amended. City Council
shall hear zoning recommendations from the Planning Commission for the subject
area during the required hearing for annexation. Prior to any hearings, the
Moundsville Planning Commission shall submit its written recommendations, to be
consistent with the comprehensive plan, to City Council at least thirty (30)
days prior to the hearing for annexation.
      (1)   Prior to the annexation hearing and formal zoning designation of
any parcel(s) of land being annexed, the City shall, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the enactment of the zoning map amendment:
         i.   Give written notice, by certified mail, to the landowner(s) whose
property is directly involved in the proposed amendment; and
         ii.   Publish a notice of the proposed amendment to the zoning
ordinance map as a Class II-0 legal advertisement, pursuant to West Virginia
Code Chapter 59.
         iii.   After the required thirty (30) day notice period ends, and the
property owner(s) have been notified by certified mail the City Council shall
hold a public hearing regarding the zoning designation of the newly annexed
land. After the hearing City Council can, by ordinance, designate the zoning
districts for the annexed land.
   (b)   Whenever any street, place, alley, public right-of-way, railroad
right-of-way, waterway, or other similar area is vacated by proper authority,
the districts adjoining each side of such street, place, alley, public way,
railroad right-of-way, waterway, or similar area shall be extended
automatically to the center of such vacation and all area included in the
vacation shall then and thenceforth be subject to all appropriate provisions of
the extended districts. In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining
district, or district nearest the portion vacated, shall be extended
automatically to include all of the vacated area.
(Passed 10-3-17.)
1351.06  USES NOT EXPRESSLY PERMITTED OR CONDITIONAL.
   It is recognized that new types or forms of land use will develop within the
City of Moundsville that are not anticipated by this Zoning Ordinance. In order
to provide for such changes and contingencies, the classification of any new or
unlisted land use shall be made by the Zoning Officer to determine if the use
can reasonably be interpreted to fit into a similar use category described in
this code.

Conditional Use Standards
1361.01   Purpose.
1361.02   General standards.
1361.01  PURPOSE.
   The conditional use permit procedure is intended to provide the Board of
Zoning Appeals with review of requests to establish uses which may be
appropriate in a zoning district, but which may have the potential for negative
impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The conditional use
standards provided in this article are intended to avoid, minimize, or mitigate
adverse impacts such uses may have on the health, safety, and welfare of the
public.
(Passed 10-3-17.)
1361.02  GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   All applications for a conditional use permit shall demonstrate that:
      (1)   The use is consistent with the policies and intent of the
corresponding purpose for the zoning district in which it lies and the City's
comprehensive plan.
      (2)   The use is physically and operationally compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood and surrounding existing uses.
      (3)   The use will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so
that it does not cause substantial injury to adjoining property.
      (4)   The use will be adequately served by public facilities and services
which include, but are not limited to, water, sewer, electric, schools,
streets, fire and police protection, storm drainage, public transit, and public
parks/trails.
      (5)   Adequate off-street parking will be provided on the same property
as the permitted conditional use as well as adequate ingress and egress to the
property in compliance with the standards set forth in this code.
      (6)   Any storage of hazardous material will comply with all state,
federal, and local regulations, including but not limited to Part 11, Health
and Sanitation Code of the City of Moundsville Municipal Code, and all such
material will be  listed and made known to the Chief of the City of Moundsville
Fire Department and Chief of the City of Moundsville Volunteer Fire Department.
      (7)   The use will not endanger the public health or safety or constitute
a public nuisance if located where proposed and developed according to the
plans and information submitted and approved.
      (8)   The use will not conduct operations in connection with the use
which are offensive, dangerous, or destructive of the environment.
   (b)   Conditions may be imposed on a proposed conditional use to ensure that
potential significant adverse impacts on surrounding uses will be reduced to
the maximum extent feasible, including but not limited to conditions or
measures addressing:
      (1)   Location on a site of activities that generate potential adverse
impacts such as noise and glare;
      (2)   Hours of operation and deliveries;
      (3)   Location of loading space and delivery zones;
      (4)   Light intensity and hours of full illumination;
      (5)   Placement of outdoor vending machines;
      (6)   Loitering;
      (7)   Litter control;
      (8)   Placement of trash receptacles;
      (9)   On-site parking configuration and facilities;
      (10)   On-site circulation; and
      (11)   Privacy concerns of adjacent uses.
   (c)   Conditional use permit decisions are made by the Board of Zoning
Appeals (BZA). In considering the proposed conditional use, the BZA must
determine whether the applicable General Standards under Section 1361.02  have
been met. The BZA may impose additional conditions and safeguards deemed
necessary.
   (d)   The breach of any condition, safeguard, or requirement shall be
considered a violation of the conditional use permit approval. If the applicant
fails to comply with any of the applicable requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance, the BZA shall have the authority to revoke any conditional use
permit after providing notice to the property owner and after public hearing is
held in the same manner as the original approval.
   (e)   Validity of approval. Any conditional use approved by the Board of
Zoning Appeals under which the premises are not used, work is not started
within six (6) months, or the use or work has been abandoned for a period of
one (1) year, shall lapse and cease to be in effect. The BZA may permit one (1)
six (6) month extension if the extension is applied for in writing by the
applicant prior to the expiration of the approval, provided that the BZA finds
that the extension is warranted due to circumstances beyond the control of the
applicant.
   (f)   No application which has been denied wholly or in part by the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date
of the last denial, unless permitted by the BZA after demonstration by the
applicant of a change of circumstances from the previous application.  (Passed

ordinance.  (Passed 10-3-17.)
1362.02  ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   All accessory uses and accessory structures shall require a Zoning
Permit.  Accessory uses and accessory structures shall be permitted in all
districts, provided each is customarily incidental and subordinate to a
principal use.  There must be a principal use or structure on the lot prior to
the issuance of a Zoning Permit for an accessory use or structure.
   (b)   No use that is to be carried on in an accessory structure shall be in
violation of the permitted uses in that zoning district, and in no case shall
the maximum lot coverage permitted in a zoning district be exceeded.
   (c)   Except as provided elsewhere in this code, no accessory structure
shall be constructed and used as a dwelling. Provided, however, that one
residential unit for a caretaker may be permitted in conjunction with any
active industrial establishment.
   (d)   Accessory structures shall be no more than 75% the height of the
principal structure height and in no circumstance be higher than the applicable
zoning district's maximum height requirement.
   (e)   Accessory structures such as sheds and detached garages shall not be
placed in the front yard and shall be situated no closer than 3 feet from any
lot line.

other permitted screening devices, whichever is less.  (Passed 10-3-17)
1362.03  ADDITIONAL PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Dwellings. Individual lots or subdivided parcels ten acres or less in
size shall have no building or buildings used for living purposes in addition
to the principal building on the same lot, except garage apartments where
permitted in a zoning district. Undivided land parcels of ten acres or greater
in size shall be limited to one residential structure per ten-acre unit of
undivided land area. This provision does not apply to factory-built home rental
communities.
   (b)   Non-dwellings. Where a lot is not used as a dwelling, more than one
principal building may be located upon the lot or tract, but only when such
buildings conform to all open space and yard requirements around the lot for
the district in which the lot or tract is located. A lot is not used as a
dwelling for purposes of this subsection when the lot contains a caretaker's
residence used in conjunction with an active industrial establishment or a
place of worship or religious institution as provided in this code.
(Passed 10-3-17.)
1362.04 RESERVED.
1362.05  ORIENTATION OF PRINCIPAL STRUCTURES.
   All principal structures shall be required to have a front door facing the
street unless the Zoning Officer determines that the prevailing condition of
the developed lots fronting the same street would warrant a different
orientation, or another orientation is necessary for emergency services
access.  (Passed 10-3-17.)
1362.06  HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Special industrial structures such as cooling towers, elevator
bulkheads, fire towers, tanks, and water towers, which require a greater height
than provided in the district, may be erected to a greater height than
permitted providing:

1362.07  LOT LINES AND IRREGULAR LOTS.
   (a)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall have no rear lot line.
   (b)   Flag Lots. When the handle of a flag lot is less than the minimum
width for a lot in the zoning district in which it is located, the handle is
not to be used in delineating the minimum required lot width. The minimum lot
width shall be taken from the front building setback line. However the handle
shall be used in computing the required minimum lot size, except that in no
case shall the area of the handle constitute more than 50% of the entire lot.
Additionally no structures whether primary or accessory shall be placed in the
handle.
   (c)   Lot Width. In a case where there is only one side lot line, lot width
shall be measured between such side lot line and the opposite rear lot lines or
street line.

from the front lot line adjacent to the street right of way with the greatest
frontage in linear feet.
   (e)   Pie-Shaped Lots. Setbacks on pie-shaped lots shall be measured at the
closest point between the building and the angled lot line.
   (f)   Rear lot line (Irregular). In the case of a lot having no street
frontage or a lot of an odd shape, only the one lot line farthest from any
street shall be considered a rear lot line. Where there is only one lot line
other than street lot lines, it shall be considered the rear lot line.
(Passed 10-3-17.)
 
1362.08   SWIMMING POOLS.
   Private swimming pools are permitted accessory uses only when located in
rear yards, and when completely enclosed with a protective barrier at least
four (4) feet in height to protect persons or animals from trespassing and to
assure that they are not subject to danger or harm.  All openings in the
barrier shall be equipped with gates or doors that shall be securely closed
when not in use. Such swimming pools shall be considered accessory uses in all
districts. For the purpose of this section, "swimming pools" refer to any
structure intended for swimming or recreational bathing, that is capable of
containing water over twenty-four (24) inches deep, including in-ground, above-
ground, and on-ground swimming pools, hot tubs, and spas. Swimming pools and
protective barriers must adhere to setback requirements within the zoning

      (1)   Steps and stoops not exceeding twenty-four (24) square feet;
      (2)   Open or lattice-enclosed fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways

distance to the lot line at every point shall be at least equal to the minimum
dimension required for the yard or distance to the lot line.
   (c)   For purposes of determining the required yard for townhouse
developments, setbacks shall only apply from the perimeter of the main building
to the perimeter of the parent parcel upon which the building is situated.

street corners shall not interfere with any clear sight triangle. The height of
such objects is restricted to three and one-half (3.5) feet within the clear
sight triangle. No fence, hedge, other plantings, or walls shall otherwise
impose a threat to the public safety, including by obstructing the view of
motorists to oncoming traffic or pedestrians.
   (b)   Height restrictions. Fences, walls, hedges, and other plantings used
for the purpose of screening shall not exceed four (4) feet in height from the

   (d)   Landscaped buffer areas.
      (1)   Five (5) foot landscaped buffer areas are the preferred method of
buffering. However, where a buffer strip is considered to be impracticable or
inappropriate, an opaque fence at least six (6) feet in height, in the rear or
side yard, or 4 feet in height in the front yard so as to restrict a clear view
beyond said buffer may be substituted in whole or in part for a natural buffer,
provided it is approved by the Zoning Officer. 
      (2)   Landscaped buffer areas shall be continually maintained by the
landowner. Any plant material that does not survive shall be replaced within
six (6) months. All landscaping shall be kept free of refuse and debris.
      (3)   Landscaped buffer areas may be required by the Board of Zoning
Appeals as a condition of a conditional use permit.

an area of existing natural vegetation that effectively screens the lot from
casual observation to a height of at least six (6) feet.
      (5)   All species within the screen planting shall be indigenous or
otherwise well-suited to the City, except that trees with large leaves which
could clog storm drains and trees which are brittle, disease-prone, have low,
spreading branches or shallow root systems; which drop large fruit or much sap;
or which are otherwise messy shall also be avoided.

extend into the public road, or upon the lands of an adjoining owner, more than
eighteen inches over the dividing line.
   (e)   Property adjacent to dwellings and zoned or existing single-family
residential property. Landscaped buffer areas shall be provided between any new
development adjacent to single-family residential property (existing or zoned)
or adjacent to any dwelling, which landscaping shall be at least five (5) feet
wide and at least three and one half (3.5) feet high, subject to height
limitations contained within this section.
   (f)   Parking lot screening. A landscaped buffer area of at least five (5)
feet in width shall be required between parking areas and abutting property
lines which are not a right of-way, except where accessways or other openings
may be required. 
      (1)   At least one (1) tree for each fifty (50) linear feet shall be
planted in a landscaping strip in addition to other planting materials.
      (2)   Landscaped areas shall be protected from the encroachment of
vehicles by use of curbing, wheel stops, bollards, fencing, or other approved
barriers.
   (g)   Ground-mounted and Monument Signs. All non-temporary ground-mounted or
monument signs shall be installed with a minimum surround of three (3) feet of
regularly maintained floral and shrubbery landscaping in every direction.
      (Passed 10-3-17.)
1362.11  LIGHTING.
   (a)   All lighting shall be low intensity and shielded so there is no
illumination of adjoining residential properties. All lighting shall be erected
and maintained so that light is confined to the property and will not cast
direct light or glare upon adjacent properties or public rights of ways. Bare,
un-shaded bulbs are prohibited.
   (b)   Building, parking, and all other exterior lighting shall be shielded
and directed in a manner that lighting does not reflect or cause glare onto
adjacent properties or adversely interfere with street traffic.
   (c)   Lighting is required for all off-street parking areas, off-street
loading areas, and for driveways providing ingress and egress for
nonresidential and multi-family developments.
   (d)   Feature lighting, such as up lighting of trees or other plant material
or seasonal lighting, shall be so arranged to reflect away from any residential
structure.  Such lighting shall not create a glare on adjacent streets or
properties.
   (e)   For all uses, except dwellings, exterior wall-mounted floodlights
shall be prohibited except for security lighting.  (Passed  10-3-17.)
1362.12  CLEAR SIGHT TRIANGLE.
   In a clear sight triangle, the entire area shall remain clear of
obstructions to sight, including but not limited to fences, hedges, other
landscaping, and signs, above a plane established three and one-half (3.5) feet
in elevation to a height of ten (10) feet from grade level at the intersection
of any street, alley, or other public right-of-way centerline.

Any commercial building not listed Table
1362.13(b), including libraries and museums, which are built, converted,
modified, or structurally altered shall provide one parking space per 200
square feet of gross floor area and one parking space for each regular, full-
time employee or full-time equivalent in the building or on the premises whose
primary duties are in the building or on the premises.
      (3)   Combination of USES. Where there is a combination of uses on a lot,
the required number of parking spaces shall be the sum of that found for each
use, dividing the gross floor area proportionately between the different uses.
      (4)   Location of LOT. The parking spaces required by this code shall be
provided on the same lot as the use or on another lot not more than five
hundred (500) feet radially from the lot where the use is located only if the
Zoning Officer deems it impractical to provide space on the same lot with the
building.

other portions thereof without requiring the use of any public street.
      (5)   Screening. A three (3)-foot-high buffer at the public way shall be
provided for all parking areas of five (5) or more parking spaces. However, on
any lot, no wall, fence, hedge, tree, shrub, or other obstruction shall be
allowed which dangerously obscures the view of approaching traffic along the
street, or at any intersection, including driveways and accessways.

pavers shall be encouraged in residential parking facilities if found to be
structurally sound by a certified engineer.
         ii.   In residential districts, no more than forty (40) percent of the
front yard may be used for parking, including driveways. Vehicles may not be
parked or stored upon any lawn, vegetated, or otherwise landscaped area. All
driveways and parking areas must be paved with a permanent surface material
unless in the side or rear yard, where gravel or other pervious materials may
be used.
      (8)   Compact car parking spaces. If twenty (20) or more parking stalls

zones shall be provided in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and
local laws, including but not limited to the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), ICC A117.1, and West Virginia Code Section 17c-13-6, and any amendments
thereto.

Signs
1364.01   Findings, purpose, and intent; interpretation.

1364.03   Permit not required.
1364.04   Prohibited signs.
1364.05   General requirements.
1364.06   Nonconforming signs.
1364.07   Maintenance and removal.
1364.08   Temporary signs.
1364.09   Signs for single-family residential, multi-family residential, and
recreation-conservation districts.
1364.10   Signs for mixed use and historic and neighborhood commercial
districts.
1364.11   Signs for corridor commercial and industrial districts.
1364.01  FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT; INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The
purpose of this article is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement,
materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private
property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property
values; the character of the various neighborhoods; the creation of a
convenient, attractive, and harmonious community; protection against
destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas; and the safety and welfare
of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and
encouraging economic development. This article allows adequate communication
through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location,
size, and purpose of all signs. This article shall be interpreted in a manner
consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision
of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article
which can be given effect without the invalid provision.
   (b)   Signs not expressly permitted by right or by conditional use permit
under this code are prohibited.
   (c)   A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of
identification, protection, or directing persons to a use conducted therein
shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the
principal use of the land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is
to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to
the land, building, or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for
their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests
identified in this article.
   (d)   These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible
with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant and landscape and
architecture of surrounding buildings, legible and appropriate to the activity
to which they pertain, not overly distracting to motorists, and constructed and
maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.
   (e)   These regulations distinguish between portions of the City designed
for primarily vehicular access and portions of the City designed for primarily
pedestrian access.
   (f)   These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual
speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the
City. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are
most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above.
   (g)   These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may
be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an
appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of
visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms
caused by signs. 
(Passed 10-3-17.)
1364.02  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   In General. Except as provided in this code, a sign permit is required

building code, and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances shall be
approved.
      (3)   If the application is rejected, the Zoning Officer shall provide a
list of the reasons for the rejection in writing. An application shall be
rejected for non-compliance with the terms of this code, building code, or
other applicable law, regulation, or ordinance.
   (c)   Permit Fee. A nonrefundable fee shall accompany all sign permit
applications. The permit fee schedule shall be set by the City of Moundsville.
If the sign is part of a new construction or renovation project, the cost of
the sign permit fee shall be included in the total project permit fee and not
be permitted separately. If the permit is to resurface an existing sign
structure the permit fee will be set by the City of Moundsville based on the
total value of the project with an additional $75 fee for each sign being
resurfaced.
   (d)   Duration and Revocation of Permit. If a sign is not installed within
six (6) months following the issuance of a sign permit, within thirty (30) days
for a temporary sign permit, or within the time period set forth in a permit
issued under Section
1364.05(e)(2), the permit shall be void. The permit for a temporary sign shall
state its duration, not to exceed 30 days unless otherwise provided in this
code. The Zoning Officer may revoke a sign permit under any of the following
circumstances:
      (1)   The information in the application was materially false or
misleading;

application; or
      (3)   The sign violates this code, building code, or other applicable
law, regulation, or ordinance.

uprights, or structure are designed in such a way as to form an integral
background of the display; except, however, when a sign is placed on a fence,
wall, planter, or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate
purpose other than to support the sign, the entire area of such structure shall

combined with an adjoining lot (said lot being owned by the same person and any
or all future assigns) on or after the effective date of these regulations in
order to create a single lot. Where an owner owns adjoining property,
construction may occur across the lot lines if that is the only way the yard
requirements may be met without a variance. If said combination, however,
results in the creation of a single lot that is more than one and one-half
(1.5) times the minimum lot width or area required in the zoning district, then
the single lot may be divided into two lots of equal width and area without
being further classified as non-conforming. For the purposes of this section,
"adjoining" shall be deemed to mean the sharing of one or more common lot lines
and access to both lots can be provided by the same street without crossing
that street.
   (h)   Non-conforming Accessory Uses and Structures. No non-conforming
accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after the principal use or
structure is terminated by abandonment, damage, or destruction unless such
accessory use or accessory structure thereafter is made to conform to the
standards for the zoning district in which it is located. No non-conforming
accessory use or structure shall become or replace any terminated principal
non-conforming use or structure.  (Passed 10-3-17.)
1373.06  VARIANCES.
   (a)   A variance is a deviation from the minimum standards of this Zoning
Ordinance and shall not involve permitting land uses that are otherwise
prohibited in the zoning district nor shall it involve changing the zoning
classifications of a parcel of land.
   (b)   The City of Moundsville Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant a variance
to this Zoning Ordinance if it finds that the variance:
      (1)   Will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare or
the rights of adjacent property owners and residents;
      (2)   Arises from special conditions or attributes which pertain to the
property for which a variance is sought and which were not created by the
person seeking the variance;
      (3)   Would eliminate an unnecessary hardship and permit a reasonable use
of the land;
      (4)   Will allow the intent of this Zoning Ordinance to be observed and
substantial justice done.  (Passed 10-3-17.)
1373.07  APPEAL TO BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   An appeal from any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Zoning Officer or any other person charged with the enforcement of this
Zoning Ordinance shall be filed by an aggrieved person with the City of
Moundsville Board of Zoning Appeals. The appeal shall:
   (a)   Specify the grounds for appeal;
   (b)   Be filed within thirty (30) days of the date of the original order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Officer, which time
period shall be jurisdictional in nature;
   (c)   Be on the form prescribed by the Board; and
   (d)   Upon request of the City of Moundsville Board of Zoning Appeals, the
Zoning Officer shall transmit all documents, plans, and papers constituting the
record of the action from which the appeal was taken.  (Passed 10-3-17.)
1373.08  NOTICE AND HEARING OF APPEAL.
   (a)   Within ten (10) days of receipt of the appeal by the City of
Moundsville Board of Zoning Appeals, the Board shall set a time for the hearing
of the appeal and give notice. The hearing on the appeal must be held within
forty-five (45) days of receipt of the appeal by the Board.
   (b)   At least fifteen (15) days prior to the date set for the hearing on
the appeal, the Board shall publish a notice of the date, time, and place of
the hearing on the appeal as a Class I legal advertisement, pursuant to the
West Virginia Code, and written notice shall be given to the interested
parties. The publication area shall be the area covered in the appeal.
   (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may require the party taking the appeal to
pay for the cost of public notice and written notice to interested parties.
   (d)   At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent, or by an
attorney licensed to practice in this state.
   (e)   Every decision by the Board shall be in writing and state specific
findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the Board based its decision.
If the Board fails to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law adequate
for decision by the circuit court and as a result of the failure, the circuit
court returns an appealed matter to the Board and dismisses jurisdiction over
an applicant's appeal without deciding the matter, whether the court returns
the matter with or without restrictions, the Board shall pay any additional
costs for court filing fees, service of process, and reasonable attorney's fees
required to permit the person appealing the Board's decision to return the
matter to the circuit court for the completion of the appeal.
   (f)   The written decision by the Board shall be rendered within thirty (30)
days after the hearing. If the Board fails to render a written decision within
thirty days after the hearing, then any party may pursue additional legal
remedies to obtain a decision, including, but not limited to, seeking a writ of
mandamus.
   (g)   When an appeal has been filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals, all
proceedings and work on the premises in question shall be stayed, except as
provided below:
      (1)   If the official or board from where the appeal was taken certifies
in writing to the Board of Zoning Appeals that a stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property;
      (2)   Upon further administrative proceedings, including, but not limited
to, submissions to and reviews by the staff or any administrative body; or
      (3)   Upon engineering or architectural work that does not disturb the
real estate beyond what is necessary to complete engineering, survey work, or
other tests.
   (h)   Petition for writ of certiorari. The final decision of the City of
Moundsville Board of Zoning Appeals shall be subject to review by the Circuit
Court of Marshall County, West Virginia, by certiorari, as provided by West
Virginia Code Section 8A-9-1 et seq.
   (i)   Nothing in this section prevents a party from obtaining an injunction.

and A99. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are
specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
      (33)   Start of Construction:  (The definition for start of construction
is to be used only when calculating the starting time for expiration of a
permit.)
   The date the permit was issued, including permits for substantial
improvement or repair of substantial damage, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.  The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as
the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation.  Although a permit must be obtained prior to
beginning, permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For an
alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
      (34)   State Coordinating Office:  The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management
      (35)   Stream:  As defined in WV State Code 7-1-3U, any watercourse,
whether natural or man-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of
their size, through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless
of its volume.
      (36)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, including a gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured
home.
      (37)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.  Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event equals or
exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.  See "Substantial Improvement."
      (38)   Substantial Improvement:
         A.   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the Start of Construction of the
improvement. 
         B.   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed.  The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         C.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      (39)   Top of Bank:  The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (40)   Violation:  The failure of any structure or development to be
fully compliant with all requirements of this ordinance. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

1755.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of the City of
Moundsville which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as shown on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the most recent Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Moundsville by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), dated September 25, 2009, or the most
recent revision thereof.
      (2)   The identified floodplain area shall also be those areas of the
City of Moundsville which have been identified as flood hazard areas by the
City of Moundsville by use of historic or other technical data and shown on the
City of Moundsville "Local Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated
as appropriate with the level of technical data described below and shall be
managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Floodplain Areas.  The identified floodplain shall
consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the floodway map or FIRM. The term shall also include
floodway areas identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed
in subsection (d) below.
   In floodplain areas for which no regulatory floodway has been designated,
the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not incorporating
significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the community, be
considered to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a
distance of one-half the width of the floodplain as measured from the top of
the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the 100 year floodplain
boundary.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area. 
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway (F3) shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-
year flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM or floodway map included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.  For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other
acceptable source shall be used when available.  Where other acceptable
information is not available the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
or other techniques.  When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they
shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts.  The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.  In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the floodplain
administrator.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified floodplain area may be revised by
the City of Moundsville where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or
more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes.  However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
      (2)   The City of Moundsville may identify and regulate new flood hazard
or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated using locally derived technical
information such as flood of record, historic high water marks and/or
topographic data. 
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the Base Flood Elevation
specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the structure shall not be required to
conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-
related development codes in Section
1755.06 Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.  The applicant is advised to
apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the Special Flood
Hazard Area designation removed from the parcel or structure. 
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site
shall be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this article.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of
Moundsville.  The burden of proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.  (Passed
9-1-06)
1755.04  UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Floodway (F1).
      (1)   Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in the Base Flood
Elevation. 
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued. 
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4).
      (1)   In the Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4), any
development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses,
activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the
flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations. 
         A.   In the Approximated Floodplain (F4) the Floodplain Manager shall
review, or shall cause to be reviewed, all proposed development not covered by
sub-section B below to ascertain the amount being invested and the specific
flood risk at the building site and assign a "minimal, moderate or significant"
risk level.
            1.   Development determined to represent a minimal risk and costing
less than $10,000 shall be required to provide "Point on Boundary" elevation
data and historic flood heights. The Floodplain Manager shall attempt to
determine a height that will be reasonably safe from flooding using this
elevation data. The Floodplain Manager shall enter the flood height in Section
"G" of the Elevation Certificate. Any new or substantially improved structures
permitted using  this method (other than appurtenant structures) shall be
required to have the lowest floor elevated at least three (3) feet above the
highest adjacent grade even if the "point on boundary" or historic flood height
data would indicate a lower flood elevation. If this method is not adequate to
allow the Floodplain Manager to confidently determine the flood height or if
the applicant is not satisfied with the height determined the applicant shall
be required to utilize one of the alternate methods set forth below.
            2.   Development determined to represent a low to moderate risk
and/or costing less than $50,000 shall provide the results of a Quick-
2 engineering analysis or attempt to obtain a free Base Flood Elevation by
submitting a Letter Of Map Amendment request to FEMA or obtain flood height
data by using the USGS methodology set forth in the USGS water resources
investigations report 87-4111. These semi-detailed methods will be used by the
Floodplain Manager to determine a "Community Flood Elevation". The Floodplain
Manager shall enter the "Community Flood Elevation" in Section "G" of the
Elevation Certificate. If the applicant is not satisfied with the height
determined the applicant shall be required to utilize the method set forth
below.
            3.   Development determined to represent a high risk and/or costing
more than $50,000 shall develop a Base Flood Elevation using a detailed
engineering study method such as HEC-ras. This data shall be prepared and
certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The
resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms and a completed
Elevation Certificate.  In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc.
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by
the Floodplain Manager. Base Flood Elevations determined using this method can
be used to rate flood insurance, typically resulting in a reduced premium.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
         A.   This data may be available from an authoritative source, such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource
Conservation Service or state and local water resource department.
         B.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. 
   (c)   AE area without floodway (F3).  Within any AE area without floodway,
no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of
the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.  This requirement can
be satisfied by utilization of the floodway area where determined.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the Floodplain Area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail,
the City of Moundsville Floodplain Administrator, The State Coordinating
Office, and any adjacent communities and property owners of all such intended
activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies  of all
required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration. In addition prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
Contact information for State and Federal permitting authorities as well as
addresses for required notification of appropriate County, State & Federal
government agencies are contained in the City of Moundsville Stream Alteration
administrative procedures.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Moundsville in writing
that the carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained.  The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment.  If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by professional engineers, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the floodplain administrator.
      (3)   The floodplain administrator may require the use of certain "best
practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or stream
crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized flooding
caused by blockage.  These techniques may include, but are not limited to, wing
walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to pass
debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the floodplain administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1755.08(c).
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. (Passed 9-1-09)
1755.05  CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.

shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is
of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information.  All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.  Depending on
the type of structure involved, the following information shall also be
included in the application for work within the Floodplain Area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated eighteen inches above the Base Flood
Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.

         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in (1) above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to
eighteen inches above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For structures constructed of flood resistant materials – used
solely for parking of vehicles, or storage, (Appurtenant Structures only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation report or certificate, based on finished
construction, must be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of
demonstrated qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the
structure in question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to eighteen inches above the Base Flood Elevation and
that all utilities are located at least eighteen inches above the Base Flood
Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-conversion Agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-conversion Agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred Non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the floodplain
administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1755.08(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.  The owner or developer of any proposed
development, including Subdivisions Commercial development and Manufactured
Home Parks, shall submit a preliminary site plan to the Floodplain
Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)    Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to floodplain areas, proposed lot sites, and fills. 
In addition, it is required that all subdivision proposals and other proposed
new developments which are proposed to take place either fully or partially
within the approximated floodplain (F4) and which are greater than ten (10)
lots or two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood
elevation data and shall delineate a floodway.  If FEMA has completed a Flood
Insurance Study (FIS), that data must be used to substantiate the base flood. 
Otherwise, the developer may submit data provided by an authoritative source,
such as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, state and local water resource departments, or technical
data developed using detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a
Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be prepared and certified by a
registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lies partially or
completely in the floodplain areas, the plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites.  All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas.
      (4)   Where the subdivision lies partially in the floodplain area and all
proposed development will take place on natural grade a significant vertical
distance above the floodplain boundary depicted on the map, development of
detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary.  In these cases the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
(2) or five (5) feet and clearly delineate the area to be developed and the
location of the floodplain areas as depicted on the FEMA map. A registered
professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Floodplain Areas.  Subdivision
of land in the floodplain area must result in lots that include a buildable
portion outside of the identified flood hazard area and be served by streets
within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower than 1 foot below the
elevation of the line defining the floodplain limits. All new structures must
be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot that is located outside of the
identified flood hazard area.  (Passed 9-1-09)
1755.06  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Design and Construction Standards.  In order to prevent excessive
damage to buildings, structures, and related utilities and facilities, the
following restrictions apply to all development, subdivision proposals,
manufactured home parks, new construction and to construction of substantial
improvements, and the repair of substantial damage, to existing structures
occurring in the Floodplain Area.
      (1)   Basements and Lowest Floors.
         A.   Residential Structures - All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
residential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement, ductwork
and utilities, elevated to eighteen inches above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Non-residential Structures - All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork and utilities, elevated to eighteen inches above the Base Flood
Elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that the structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to
eighteen inches above the Base Flood Elevation.
         C.   Openings - For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters.  Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
      (2)   Manufactured Home Placement.  Certain unique characteristics of
manufactured homes installed in flood hazard areas pose an elevated risk of
substantial damage to property. Thus:
         A.   All manufactured homes to be sited within the identified flood
hazard areas of the City of Moundsville shall be installed by a contractor
possessing a valid WV Manufactured Home Installer's license. The installer
shall use an installation design engineered to withstand flood hazards specific
to the particular home site. Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved within the flood hazard areas shall be installed in accordance with
the following standards: 
            1.   The lowest floor, ductwork and utilities including HVAC/heat
pump shall be elevated eighteen inches above the Base Flood Elevation
            2.   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent

engineered for use in a flood hazard area. Installation designs incorporating
dry stacked block piers shall not be used in flood hazard areas.
            3.   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10.1, 10.2, and
10b as authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-4.  The anchoring shall be
adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.  Methods of
anchoring may include but are not limited to the over-the-top and frame ties,
attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not be adequate
to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement is in
addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces.
            4.   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings; this type of skirting can collapse during
floods and compromise supporting piers. The openings must be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces by allowing for entry and exit
of floodwaters.  Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a Registered Professional Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
            5.   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly
anchored and vented.
         B.   The licensed WV Manufactured Home Installer placing the unit
shall perform a site inspection and certify in writing that the manufactured
home has been installed to the standards set forth in this article.  The
Floodplain Administrator may perform or cause to be performed a site inspection
to verify the installer's certification.
      (3)   Appurtenant Structures.
         A.   Except as provided in subsection B. below, appurtenant structures
shall be located out of the floodplain area or elevated to eighteen inches
above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
            1.   Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size and
valued at less than $10,000.00.
            2.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
            3.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
            4.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
            5.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to eighteen inches above the Base Flood
Elevation.
            6.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least eighteen inches above the Base Flood Elevation.
            7.   The venting requirements contained in Section
1755.06(a)(1) are applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
         C.   A Nonconversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached
garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the
structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance
premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance
with this ordinance.  The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of this agreement.  It shall be the responsibility of the applicant
to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature,
a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1755.08(c).
      (4)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.  Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any floodplain area shall either: 
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions, or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   Fill.  The City of Moundsville officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Placement of fill in the floodplain area is discouraged and should be
minimized. In the floodway, no fill shall be permitted unless it meets the
requirements of Section
1755.04(a).  All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties.  The City of Moundsville may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties.  When required, Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts.  The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed
and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings
in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the City
of Moundsville. During permit review the community shall consider the following
issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access.  For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection.  For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended
use.  At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond
the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of
the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only.  Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted, no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less must be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a mapped flood hazard area must
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant must convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         J.   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures.  All buildings and structures shall be
constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the
flow of water and shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon
the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow and,
         B.   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately
on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All buildings and structures including stream crossings shall be
firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to prevent
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to life and
property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge openings and
other restricted sections of the watercourse.
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, and storage tanks located at or below
the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.  [Deleted]
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of  flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.

reviewed; all permit applications and plans in order to determine whether
proposed building sites are reasonably safe from flooding.

determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance with
the requirements of the state and all other applicable codes and ordinances.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall not issue a permit to any person
who does not possess a valid contractor's license when a contractor's license
is required by West Virginia State Code §21-11-10.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator, before issuance of the permit, shall
require the applicant to furnish satisfactory proof that such person is duly
licensed as a contractor under the provisions of West Virginia State Code. If
the applicant is not licensed a written affidavit that such person is not
subject to licensure as a contractor or subcontractor as defined in §21-11-

Administrator.
      (9)   The City of Moundsville shall provide sufficient space to allow the
Floodplain Administrator to keep on file in perpetuity, in a location safe from
natural hazards, all information collected during the course of the
administration of this ordinance.
   (c)   Application Procedures.  Application for a permit and/or site plan
approvals shall be made, in writing, on the forms supplied by the City of
Moundsville and shall include all information stipulated under Article V of
this ordinance.
   (d)   Changes.  After the issuance of a permit or site plan approval by the
Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made to the
application, permit, or any of the plans, specification or other documents
submitted with the application without the written consent or approval of the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (e)   Permit Placards.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit placard, which
shall be prominently displayed on the premises during the time construction is
in progress. This placard shall show the number of the permit, the date of its
issuance and be signed by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve or install a temporary electrical utility connection to any building or
premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected or rebuilt until
a placard has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator indicating that
the development has applied for a permit and agreed to the requirements of this
local law or, in the case of development occurring outside of the identified
flood hazard area, a Certificate of Compliance has been issued.
   (f)   Start of Construction.  Work on the proposed development shall begin
within 180 days after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall
expire unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. All work on the proposed development must be completed within 18
months of permit issuance, at which time the permit shall expire, unless a time
extension is granted in writing by the Floodplain Administrator. The request

extension.  When considering an extension, the Floodplain Administrator shall
consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Has the developer diligently pursued the completion of the proposed
development during the 18 months?
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,
health, or welfare or injurious to other property?

      (1)   Stop-Work Orders.
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued,
a "Stop Work Order Notice" for any development found ongoing without having
obtained a permit.  Disregard of a stop work order shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1755.08(c) of this local law.

that there has been false statement or misrepresentation by any applicant, the
Floodplain Administrator shall issue a "Stop Work Order Notice" revoke the
permit and request a temporary injunction.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized official may
inspect any development covered by this or previous ordinance to determine
whether any portion of the development has been altered to be in non-compliance
with the requirements of this article.
   (h)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the building or land conforms to the requirements of this local law. Occupying
or using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1755.08(c).
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the
inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by
the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular development
being inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1755.08(c).
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1755.08(c).
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this ordinance or local administrative procedures,
and any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood
proofing certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as
a condition of permit approval.
   (i)   Fees.
      (1)   A Floodplain Determination fee of $20.00 payable to the City of
Moundsville shall be assessed on all proposed development.
      (2)   Application for a permit for proposed development determined to be
occurring in a flood hazard area regulated by this article shall be accompanied
by an additional fee, payable to the City of Moundsville based upon the
estimated value of the proposed construction as determined by the Floodplain
Administrator at the following rates:
 
Type of Development                            Fee
1 & 2 Family Dwelling                          $1.00/per thousand
Accessory Structures                           $1.00/per thousand
Any Other Structures                        $1.00/per thousand
Site Plans, Grading & Filling (additional fee) $100.00/acre or part thereof
Floodway Development Reviews (additional fee)  $1.50/per thousand
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
City of Moundsville for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development.  Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs.  Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the County for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway.  To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.
      (5)   There is created in the City of Moundsville a special revenue fund,
administered by the City Manager, designated the "floodplain development fund".
This fund is not part of the general revenue fund of the City of Moundsville.
All fees collected pursuant to this article shall be deposited into the
floodplain development fund. The floodplain development fund shall contain all
fees or penalties collected pursuant to this ordinance, any appropriations to
the fund; and any gifts, grants or contributions received.
      (6)   The City of Moundsville is restricted to, and shall distribute
funds from, the floodplain development fund only for administrative costs
associated with management of floodplain development, the maintenance or
creation of maps and studies used to administer floodplain development and
other activities which will promote and enhance flood plain management issues
generally.  (Passed 9-1-09)
1755.08  APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals.  Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provision of this ordinance, it is
the right of that person to appeal to the Moundsville City Council which shall
be known as the Appeals Board. Such appeal must be filed with the City of
Moundsville in writing, within thirty (30) days after notification of the
decision.  Upon receipt of such appeal, the Appeals Board shall set a time and
place not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days for the purpose of
hearing the appeal.  Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given
to all parties at which time they may appear and be heard.  The determination
by the Appeals Board shall be final in all cases.
          (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this ordinance
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon (I) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that
failure to grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of an appeal will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.  Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a community official that (I) the issuance of a decision to allow
construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance, (ii) such construction below the
Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property.  Such notifications
shall be maintained with a record of all decisions as required in paragraph D.
of this section; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall (I) maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such decisions
issued in its biannual report to the Federal Insurance Administration.
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties.  Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the community, shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the city attorney for prosecution in
municipal court. A violator shall, upon conviction, pay a fine to the City of
Moundsville of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution.  Each day during which any
violation of this ordinance continues shall constitute a separate offense.  In
addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved
including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this ordinance. 
The  imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or non-compliance
with, this ordinance shall not excuse the violation or non-compliance with the
ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to
correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within a reasonable time. 
Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in
non-compliance with this ordinance may be declared by the City of Moundsville
to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.  (Passed 9-1-09)

proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the City of Moundsville .  All
applicants proposing development in or near a flood hazard area are urged to
