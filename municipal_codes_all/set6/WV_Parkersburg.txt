   EDITOR'S NOTE: The election district boundaries originally established by
the Charter have been amended by a later ordinance pursuant to the authority
granted under Section
2.104 of the Charter. Consult Article
107 for legislation adopting the Election District Map currently in effect.
   SECTION 2.103   PRECINCTS DEFINED.
   The precincts referred to in Section
2.102 shall mean the voting precincts, insofar as they lie within the corporate
limits of the City, fixed by the County court for all State and County
elections as they exist on the effective date of this Charter. Within three
months after their election and qualification, the members of the first Council
elected under this Charter shall cause to be made and kept a detailed map of
the City showing the boundaries of the Municipal election districts herein
described; and each subsequent Council shall cause such map to be kept,
maintained and revised as appropriate. The initial such map and any revised
such map shall be approved and promulgated by Council in the same manner as
provided for the adoption of ordinances.
   SECTION 2.104   COUNCIL REDISTRICTING.
   It shall be the duty of Council to redistrict the City by ordinance, with or
without the assistance of a districting commission, within a period of six
months after the official publication by the United States of the population of
the City as revealed in such official census. Each election district shall be
made to contain as nearly as possible, consistent with general laws, the
population factor obtained by dividing by the number of district Councilmen the
City's population as shown by such official census. If, at the expiration of
the six months period, Council shall have failed to redistrict the City as
herein required, the members of Council shall receive no further compensation
until such ordinance shall have been adopted; and the Director of Finance shall
issue no checks for such compensation which would ordinarily have accrued
during the period of noncompliance. Council may redistrict the City at any more
frequent intervals as it may deem appropriate based upon any other such more
timely information as may become available.
   SECTION 2.105   QUALIFICATIONS OF COUNCILMEN.
   All Councilmen shall be citizens of the United States and qualified electors
of the City, and shall not hold, during their terms of office, any other public
office or position nor be members of any political executive committee;
provided, however, that a notary public, member of the military or naval forces
or public school or college  employee shall not be deemed to hold a public
office or position within the meaning of this section. Each Councilman shall
during his term of office, reside within the district from which elected or
appointed to represent; provided, however, that no redistricting of the City
shall effect the term of any incumbent Councilman during his
or her then existing term of office.  (Amended 8-23-16.)
   SECTION 2.106   ORGANIZATION OF THE COUNCIL; OFFICERS; RULES; EMPLOYEES.
   (1)    The Council shall meet in the Council chamber at the City Hall for
organization at 7:30 p.m. on the Tuesday next following the date its members
assume office, at which time it shall elect one of its members as president and
one of its other members as vice president, both of whom shall serve at the
pleasure of the Council. The president shall be the presiding officer and
shall, together with all other Councilmen, have the right to vote in the
Council at all times, except when serving as acting Mayor. In the event of the
president's absence or disability, or disqualification to act because of his
serving as acting Mayor, the vice president shall act as President. A majority
of the total qualified and acting number of Councilmen shall constitute a
quorum.
   (2)    The Council shall determine and adopt its own rules governing its
officers and employees, for the organization of committees and respecting the
transaction of its business.
   (3)    The Council shall meet regularly at such times as may be prescribed
by its rules, but not less frequently than twice each month. Special meetings
may be called at any time, upon reasonable notice, by the Mayor or the
president of Council and shall be so called by the President upon request of a
majority of all members of the Council. The requirement of reasonable notice,
as mentioned herein, may be fulfilled by delivering a written notice of the
time and place of the special meeting containing a brief statement of the
purpose of the meeting in the method provided by law for the institution of a
civil action within 12 hours of the time set for the meeting, or by such other
method as Council may by ordinance provide.
CHAPTER 2. COUNCIL PROCEDURE
   SECTION 2.200   PROCEDURE RESPECTING ADOPTION OF ORDINANCES.
   Every act of the Council which is to become law shall be by ordinance and
shall begin with the enacting clause, "The Council of the City of Parkersburg
hereby ordains:". The enactment of ordinances shall be performed in the manner
provided in W. Va. Code, §8-11-4 (Acts 1969), except as otherwise herein
provided.
   After the first reading, by title or in full, and the consideration of any
amendments, the question shall be: "Shall the ordinance be advanced to second
reading?". If the question shall be decided in the negative, it shall not again
be put until the ordinance be read by title or in full again. If the question
put is agreed to, the President shall order the ordinance to second reading.

of their duties. He shall see to the protection of property and the
preservation of peace, order and public safety throughout the City, and, to
that end, he shall cause all violators of the City ordinances and of general
law to be apprehended and brought to trial before the Municipal Court or other
proper tribunal. Under the direction of the Mayor, he shall also perform such
other duties as may be required of him by this Charter, by general law or by
City ordinance or order of the Mayor not inconsistent with this Charter or with
general law. The Chief of Police may be removed by the Mayor with the
concurrence of a majority of Council or by a vote of at least two- thirds of
the members of Council.
   Each Chief of Police hereafter appointed shall be a resident of the City
and, being a resident of the City, shall not remove his or her residence from
the City during the term of such appointment. Council shall be the judge of the
residence qualification of the Chief, who shall promptly report each change of
residence to the Council. (Amended 10-15-85.)
   SECTION 10.101  CHIEF OF FIRE DEPARTMENT.
   The Chief of the Fire Department shall be appointed by the Mayor with the
approval of Council to serve for an indefinite term. The Chief of the Fire
Department shall be a person of proved executive and administrative ability,
with experience or training in the suppression and prevention of fires. Subject
to the direction and control of the Mayor, the Chief of the Fire Department
shall be responsible for the supervision and administration of the Fire
Department and shall require of all firemen the proper discharge of their
duties. He shall make such inspection of buildings and property throughout the
City as may be necessary to discover fire hazards, shall take all proper
measures to eliminate such hazards and shall keep an accurate record of all
fires, inspections and fire hazards within the City. Under the direction of the
Mayor, he shall also perform such other duties as may be required of him by
this Charter, by general law or by City ordinance or order of the Mayor not
inconsistent with this Charter or general law. The Chief of the Fire Department
may be removed by the Mayor with the concurrence of a majority of Council or by
a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of Council.
   Each Chief of the Fire Department hereafter appointed shall be a resident of
the City and, being a resident of the City, shall not remove his or her
residence from the City during the term of such appointment. Council shall be
the judge of the residency qualification of the Chief who shall promptly report
each change of residence to the Council.
(Amended 10-15-85.)
   SECTION 10.102  HOSPITALS.
   As provided by general law, the City may own and operate a hospital or other
health services, including Camden-Clark Memorial Hospital, by a board of
trustees, who shall serve without compensation. Such hospital shall be operated
as an entity separate from all other functions of the City and free from the
operative control of Council or any executive officer or agency of the City,
and under such regulations as said board may from time to time prescribe. The
board shall have fifteen members, as presently constituted, with the same
members and for the same terms, except that the Mayor, or his designee, from
time to time, shall be an ex-officio member in the stead of a member of
Council, as heretofore provided. Such board shall be otherwise self-
perpetuating, but Council shall confirm or reject all persons nominated thereto
by the board, as present terms expire or vacancies occur. Nothing herein
contained shall be construed as prohibiting Council from providing for the
operation of such facility by lease as authorized by general law; but any such
lease shall contain such covenants as to reasonably assure nonprofit operation
thereof in the public interest with right of termination in favor of the City
in the event of breach.
   SECTION 10.103  SANITARY BOARD; APPOINTMENT.
   The Sanitary Board, as it is now established, shall be continued in effect,
insofar as it complies with the provisions of general law; provided, however,
that the Sanitary Board shall be composed of the Mayor, who shall be the
Chairman of the Board, and two other persons appointed by the Council, one of
whom shall be a registered professional engineer. Such Sanitary Board, so
composed, shall continue in existence and operation only until such time as
Council performs the duty required of it by Section
10.104 of this article.
   SECTION 10.104  COMBINED WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE SYSTEM.
   Council shall, as soon as practicable, proceed under the provisions of the
statute permitting it, West Virginia Code Chapter 8, Article 20, to combine the
existing waterworks and sewerage systems into a single entity.  Such combined
waterworks and sewerage system shall be under the supervision and control of an
independent utility board as authorized by the provisions of West Virginia Code
8-20-18, from which members of City Council and City department heads shall be
excluded, and such utility board shall have and be limited to all the powers,
authority and duties granted to and imposed upon a board as provided in West
Virginia Code Chapter 8, Article 16.  The number of members of said utility
board and the manner of appointment of said members shall be determined by
ordinance.  From and after the adoption of said ordinance, all the powers and
duties of the existing Sanitary Board shall pass to and vest in the newly
created Utility Board and said Sanitary Board shall be dissolved.
(Amended 5-14-96.)
   SECTION 10.105  BONDS.
   Before entering upon the duties of their employment, the Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Purchasing Agent, the Judge of the Municipal Court and such
other personnel of the City as Council may require so to do, shall give bond
for the faithful performance of their duties, payable to the State of West
Virginia in such amounts and with such corporate surety as may be approved by
Council.  Council may provide for obtaining a blanket bond covering all City
employees, designating specific employees whose bond shall be in excess of the
amount of the blanket bond.  The premiums on such bond or bonds shall be paid
by the City after it has been ascertained that the premiums are not in excess
of the premium schedule filed by the bonding company with the Insurance
Commissioner of West Virginia.  All bonds shall be subject to approval of the
City Attorney as to form and substance and, when so approved, shall be endorsed
with his signature.
   SECTION 10.106  SEPARABILITY CLAUSE.
   If any article, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence or clause of this
Charter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional, such holding shall
not affect the validity, constitutionality or application of any other portion
of this Charter.
   SECTION 10.107  REFERENCE TO GENERAL LAW.
   A reference contained in this Charter to a provision of general law shall be
construed to mean the provision as it now exists or as it may hereafter be

provision of general law referred to in this Charter, the reference shall
include such additional sections.
   SECTION 10.108  SUNDAYS AND LEGAL HOLIDAYS; SATURDAY COUNCIL PROCEEDINGS

appointment or employment, cease to possess any of the requisite qualifications
provided for his office or position, or if any such officer or employee shall
resign or become physically or mentally incapacitated to the point he cannot
perform his duties, then the appointing official shall declare a vacancy. Such
vacancy shall be filled pursuant to applicable law. (Amended 10-15-85.)
   SECTION 10.110  CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   Any City officer or employee who has a substantial financial interest,
direct or indirect or by reason of ownership of stock in any corporation, in
any contract with the City or in the sale of any land, material, supplies or
services to the City or to a contractor supplying the City shall make known
that interest and shall refrain from voting upon or otherwise participating in
his capacity as a City officer or employee in the making of such sale or in the
making or performance of such contract. Any City officer or employee who
willfully conceals such a substantial financial interest or willfully violates
the requirements of this section shall be guilty of malfeasance in office or
position and shall forfeit his office or position. Violation of this section
with the knowledge, express or implied, of the person or corporation
contracting with or making a sale to the City shall render the contract or sale
voidable by the Mayor or Council.
   SECTION 10.111  CENTRAL GARAGE AND MOTOR POOL.
   There shall be a central garage, service center and motor pool, wherein all
automobiles and other vehicles owned by the City shall be maintained, serviced
and repaired and from which the head of any department, commission or agency,
or his designee, shall requisition the use of any such automobiles or other
vehicles as may be required by him or it. The Mayor, or his designee, shall
establish and promulgate such rules and regulations respecting such facility as
to effect the greatest possible economy and efficiency in its operation.
   SECTION 10.112  RESIDENCY DEFINED.

year, that the West Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles and West Virginia
Department of Tax and Revenue recognize that location as his legal residence,
and that he is a qualified voter of The City of Parkersburg.

APPENDIX A
   W.Va. Code, §8-11-4. ORDINANCE PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Notwithstanding any Charter provision to the contrary, which Charter
provision was in effect on the effective date of this section, it shall not be
necessary, except where otherwise provided in this Code, for the governing body
of any municipality to publish in a newspaper any proposed ordinance prior to
the adoption thereof or any enacted ordinance subsequent to the adoption
thereof, and any and all ordinances of every municipality shall be adopted in
accordance with the following requirements, except where different or
additional requirements are specified in other provisions of this Code, in
which event such other different or additional requirements shall be
applicable.
      (1)    A proposed ordinance shall be read by title at not less than two
meetings of the governing body with at least one week intervening between each
meeting, unless a member of the governing body demands that the ordinance be
read in full at one or both meetings. If such demand is made, the ordinance
shall be read in full as demanded.
      (2)    At least five days before the meeting at which a proposed
ordinance, the principal object of which is the raising of revenue for the
Municipality, is to be finally adopted, the governing body shall cause notice
of the proposed adoption of said proposed ordinance to be published as a Class
1-0 legal advertisement in compliance with the provisions of article three,
chapter fifty-nine of this Code, and the publication area for such publication
shall be the Municipality. The notice shall state the subject matter and
general title or titles of such proposed ordinance, the date, time and place of
the proposed final vote on adoption, and the place or places within the
Municipality where such proposed ordinance may be inspected by the public. A
reasonable number of copies of the proposed ordinance shall be kept at such
place or places and be made available for public inspection. Said notice shall
also advise that interested parties may appear at the meeting and be heard with
respect to the proposed ordinance.
      (3)    A proposed ordinance shall not be materially amended at the same
meeting at which finally adopted.
   (b)    Notwithstanding any charter provision to the contrary, which Charter
provision was in effect on the effective date of this section, the governing
body of any municipality may adopt, by ordinance, building codes, housing
codes, plumbing codes, sanitary codes, electrical codes, fire prevention codes,
or any other technical codes dealing with general public health, safety or
welfare, or a combination of the same, or a comprehensive code of ordinances,
in the manner prescribed in this subsection (b). Before any such ordinance
shall be adopted, the code shall be either printed or typewritten and shall be
presented in pamphlet form to the governing body of the Municipality at a
regular meeting, and copies of such code shall be made available for public
inspection. The ordinances adopting such Code shall not set out said Code in
full, but shall merely identify the same. The vote on adoption of said
ordinance shall be the same as on any other ordinance. After adoption of the
ordinance, such Code or Codes shall be certified by the Mayor and shall be
filed as a permanent record in the office of the recorder, who shall not be
required to transcribe and record the same in the ordinance book as other
ordinances are transcribed and recorded. Consistent with the provisions of
subsection (a) of this section, it shall not be necessary that any such
ordinance, either as proposed or after adoption, be published in any newspaper,
and it shall not be necessary that the Code itself be so published, but before
final adoption of any such proposed ordinance, notice of the proposed adoption
of such ordinance and Code shall be given by publication as herein provided for
ordinances the principal object of which is the raising of revenue for the
Municipality, which notice shall also state where, within the Municipality, the
Code or Codes will be available for public inspection.
   (c)    By a charter framed and adopted, revision of a charter as a whole, or
a charter amendment or amendments, as the case may be, subsequent to the
effective date of this section, a City may require any or all ordinances to be
published in a newspaper prior to the adoption thereof, may expressly adopt the
provisions of this section, may specify other additional requirements for the
enactment of ordinances, or may prescribe a procedure for the enactment of
ordinances in greater detail than prescribed in this section, but a City shall
not, except in an emergency as specified in subsection (d) of this section or
except as otherwise provided in this Code, have the power and authority to
lessen or reduce the requirements of this section.
   (d)    The governing body of a municipality may enact an ordinance without
complying with the rules prescribed in this section only (1) in the case of a
pressing public emergency making procedure in accordance with the provisions of
this section dangerous to the public health, safety or morals, and by
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members elected to the governing body, or
(2) when otherwise provided in this Code. The nature of any such emergency
shall be set out in full in the ordinance.
APPENDIX B
REPORT OF THE CHARTER BOARD
   The City of Parkersburg has operated for the past forty years under the
commission form of City government. In that time, the inherent weaknesses of
this form have become apparent. These weaknesses include the placing of both
legislative authority and administrative authority in the same hands namely in
the elected commission. The commission plan offers no opportunity for sound
budgeting practices; there is no practical way to coordinate a planned
expenditure program among five independent administrative authorities. There is
no single responsible executive in the commission plan; this makes impossible a
unified public policy, as well as a known and effective responsibility.
   After due consideration of the plans of city government available under the
Home Rule Statute (city manager, strong mayor, mayor council, commission,) the
Charter Board proposes that the new Charter for the City of Parkersburg be
based on the strong mayor plan.
   The Mayor shall be elected at large under the general election laws of the
State. He shall be the chief administrative officer of the City with
supervision over all executive and administrative work of the City and shall
appoint all City officers and employees. He shall have the authority and
responsibility to carry out the duties vested in him by this Charter, ordinance
of Council or general law in the best interests of the citizens of this City.
   The Council shall have all the legislative powers of the City vested in it.
The Council shall consist of nine members elected from nine Municipal election
districts on a partisan basis. The Council will meet at least twice a month and
will be responsible for providing by ordinance the rules and procedures under
which the Mayor is to administer the City government.
   All appointments and promotions in the administrative service of the City
are to be made according to merit and fitness. Persons holding any office or
employed under the present government will be retained under the new Charter.
   The new Charter provides for departments of Public Works, Finance,
Purchasing, Fire and Police; other departments may be established by Council.
   The primary election for the first Mayor and Council under this Charter will
be held on Tuesday, July 14, 1970; and the first general election will be held
Tuesday, July 28,1970. The Mayor and Council so elected will take office August
17, 1970, and hold office until their successors are elected and qualified on
or after December 31, 1973.
   The Mayor and Council will be elected every four years. The primary will be
held on the first Tuesday after the second Monday in October in the year 1973
and every fourth year thereafter. The general election will be held the first
Tuesday after the first Monday in November in the year 1973 and every fourth
year thereafter. The officers of each new administration will take office on
the first Monday in January after their election.
   This Charter has been completed after long and searching deliberations by
the members of the Charter Board. It is the feeling of the Board that it will
provide a practical and workable framework for the government of the City of
Parkersburg, and the Charter Board unanimously recommends its adoption by the
citizens of Parkersburg.

Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of West Virginia operates on eastern daylight savings
time from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a. m. of the last
Sunday in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act
requiring uniform observance throughout the nation of daylight savings time
starting in 1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state
from daylight savings time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each
with a different time standard. The West Virginia legislature through inaction
has elected to observe eastern daylight savings time throughout the State of
West Virginia.
There are no sections in Article 103. This article has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

   135.01  REQUIREMENTS FOR PURCHASES AND BIDS.
   The City Director of Finance shall exercise his powers and perform his
duties pursuant to the following rules and regulations:
   (a)    Requisition Required. All purchases shall be made upon requisition
signed by the officer in charge of the department for which the supplies or
materials are needed. The requisition shall be filed with the Director of
Finance, who shall thereupon direct his order to the person from whom it is
proposed to purchase the supplies or materials, requiring such person to
deliver the supplies to the person in charge of the department for which
ordered. The person supplying the materials shall make out his bill at the
contract price and send the bill with the goods to the officer in charge of the
department for which they were ordered.
It shall be the duty of the officer to examine the goods delivered and the
quantity thereof, and if he finds the quantity as stated in the order and the
quality of the grade ordered, he shall endorse the bill with a statement that
the goods have been received and the quantity and quality found to be correct,
and return the bill and the order upon which it was furnished to the person
originating the order, who shall file the order with the Director of Finance
for approval and payment. If found incorrect, or if the quality is below the
standard and grade ordered, the officer in charge shall refuse to accept the
goods and shall notify the Director of Finance to that effect, and the person
furnishing the goods shall be notified by the officer in charge of the
department that the goods can only remain where delivered at the risk of the
person delivering.
   (b)    Unauthorized Purchases. Except as herein provided, no City officer
shall order the purchase of any supplies or make any contract within the
purview of this article, other than through the Director of Finance, and any
purchase ordered or contract made contrary to the provisions hereof, shall not
be approved by the Director of Finance, and the City shall not be bound
thereby.
   (c)    Competitive Bidding Required. All purchases of and contracts for
supplies and contractual services, and all sales of personal property which
have become obsolete and unusable shall, except as specifically provided
herein, be based, wherever possible, on competitive bids.
   (d)    Contract Procedure for Architect-Engineer Services. All contractual
services for Architect-Engineer services shall be in accordance with West
Virginia Code Chapter 5G as amended. 
(Ord. 0-940.  Passed 1-11-00.)
   (e)    Contract Procedure for All Other Contracts. All other supplies and
contractual services, except as otherwise provided in this article, when the
estimated cost thereof is fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or more shall be
purchased by formal written contract from the lowest responsible bidder after
due notice inviting proposals.
      (Ord. 0-1299.  Passed 3-25-08.)
      (1)    Notice inviting bids.
         A.    Notice inviting bids shall be published once in at least one
newspaper of general circulation in the City and at least five days preceding
the last day set for the receiving of proposals. Such notice shall include a
general description for the articles to be purchased or sold, and shall state
where specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening bids.
         B.    The Director of Finance shall also solicit sealed bids from all
responsible prospective suppliers who have requested their names to be added to
a "bidders' list" which the Director of Finance shall maintain, by sending them
a copy of such newspaper notice or such other notice to acquaint them with the
proposed purchase or sale. In any case, invitations sent to the vendors on the
bidders' list shall be limited to commodities that are similar in character and
ordinarily handled by the trade group to which the invitations are sent.
      (2)    Bidders' deposit. When deemed necessary by the Director of
Finance, bid deposits shall be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids.
Unsuccessful bidders shall be entitled to return of surety where the Director
of Finance has required such. A successful bidder shall forfeit any surety
required by the Agent upon failure on his part to enter a contract within ten
days after the award.
      (3)   Bid opening procedure.  Bids shall be submitted, sealed, to the
Director of Finance and shall be identified as bids on the envelope.  Bids
shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices
unless it is publicly announced by the Director of Finance at that time that
the receipt of bids is being extended for a time not to exceed two weeks
therefrom.  A tabulation of all bids received shall be posted for public
inspection.
      (4)   Rejection of bids.  The Director of Finance shall have the
authority to reject all bids, parts of bids, or all bids for any one or more
supplies or contractual services included in the proposed contract, when the
public interest will be served thereby.  This statement shall appear in all
invitations for bids.
      (5)   Award of contract.  Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest
responsible bidder.  In determining the lowest responsible bidder, in addition
to price, the Director of Finance shall consider:
         A.   The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract or provide the services required;
         B.   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder;
         C.   The quality of performance of other contracts or services;
         D.   The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the
bidder to perform the contract or provide the services;
         E.   The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service for the use of the subject of the contract.
      (6)   Award to other than low bidder.  When the award is not given to the
lowest bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons for placing the
order elsewhere shall be prepared by the Director of Finance and filed with
other paper relating to the transaction.
      (7)   Tie bids.
         A.   Local vendors.  If all bids received are for the same total
amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, the contract shall be
awarded to a bidder residing or doing business in the City.
         B.   Outside vendors.  Where subsection (7)A. hereof is not in effect,
the Director of Finance shall award the contract to one of the tie bidders by
drawing lots in public.
      (8)   Performance bonds.  The Director of Finance shall have authority to
require a performance bond before entering a contract, in such amount as he
finds reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the City.
      (9)   Prohibition against subdivision.  No contract or purchase shall be
subdivided to avoid the requirements of this section.
      (10)   Preference for resident vendors.
         A.   In any instance that a purchase of supplies or contractual
services by the Director of Finance is required under the provisions of this
article to be made upon competitive bids and the quality and service of some or
all bidders being equal applying the criteria in subsection (e)(5) hereof, such
purchase, where permitted under Federal law, shall be made from a vendor
resident in the State, if such bid does not exceed the lowest qualified bid
from a nonresident vendor by more than two percent (2%) of the latter bid and
if the resident vendor has made written claim for such preference at the time
the bid was submitted.
         B.   For the purpose of considering the amount of a bid by a resident
vendor, the amount of business and occupation taxes which must be paid by such
resident vendor to the City as a result of being awarded the contract which is
the object of the bid, shall be excluded.
         C.   For the purpose of considering the amount of a bid by a resident
vendor, in the case of a bid for financial services, the principal amount of
the loan shall be excluded.
         D.   A vendor shall be deemed to be a resident of this State if such
vendor is an individual, partnership, association or corporation in good
standing under the laws of the State who:
            1.   Is a resident of the State or a foreign corporation authorized
to transact business in the State;
            2.   Maintains an office in the State;
            3.   Has paid personal property taxes pursuant to West Virginia
Code Article 11-5 on equipment used in the regular course of supplying services
of the general type offered; and
            4.   Has paid business and occupation taxes pursuant to West
Virginia Code Article 11-13.  In addition, in the case of a vendor selling
tangible personal property, a resident vendor is one who has a stock of
materials held in the State for sale in the ordinary course of business, which
stock is of the general type offered and which is reasonably sufficient in
quantity to meet the ordinary requirements of customers.
               (Ord. 0-940.  Passed 1-11-00.)
      (11)   Use of local labor.  In any instance that a purchase of services
is made upon competitive bids and such service shall entail the use of labor to
construct, adapt, restore, remodel or demolish any building, road, bridge, park
or other public works, the following shall apply:
         A.    Utilization of business.  Each contractor and subcontractor
undertaking work for a City of Parkersburg project shall assure that to the
greatest extent feasible, work to be performed in connection with the project
is awarded to business concerns located within the local area.
         B.    Good Faith Effort.  Each contractor and subcontractor shall make
a good faith effort to fill all vacant positions during the length of the
project work with local area residents. These Good Faith Efforts will include:
            1.    Attempt to recruit through local advertising media, signs
placed at the proposed site and community organizations and public and private
institutions operating within or serving the project area such as the State
Employment Office.
            2.    Maintain a list of area residents who have applied either on
their own or on referral from any source and employ such person if otherwise
eligible and/or qualified and if a vacancy exists. If no vacancies exist, the
eligibility and/or qualifications of the applicant shall be considered and
listed for the first available opening.
         C.    Certificate of compliance.  The contractor shall execute the
certificate of compliance and cause all subcontractors undertaking work in
connection with this work to furnish the same. An individual shall be deemed a
local area resident if his or her primary residence is located within Wood,
Wirt, Pleasants, Ritchie and Jackson County in West Virginia or in Washington
County, Ohio and such residence is recognized as their legal residence by their
respective State Department of Motor Vehicles.
            (Ord. 0-1430.  Passed 11-13-12.)
   (f)   Open Market Procedure.  All purchases of supplies and contractual
services of less than the estimated value of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000)

observing the procedure prescribed for the awarding of contracts involving sums
in excess of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000).
      (1)   Minimum number of bids.  All open market purchases shall, wherever
possible, be based upon at least three competitive bids, and shall be awarded
to the lowest responsible bidder in accordance with the standards set forth for
the awarding of contracts involving sums in excess of fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000).
         (Ord. 0-1299.  Passed 3-25-08.)
      (2)    Notice inviting bids. The Finance Director shall solicit bids by
telephone and/or direct mail request to prospective vendors.
      (3)   Recording.  The Finance Director shall keep a record of all open
market orders and the bids received in competition thereon, and such records

         (Ord. 0-1238.  Passed 7-25-06.)
   (g)    Emergency Purchases.
      (1)    By Director of Finance. In case of an apparent emergency which
requires immediate purchase of supplies or contractual services, the Mayor or
department head shall be empowered to authorize the Director of Finance to
secure by open market procedure, as herein set forth, at the lowest obtainable
price, any supplies or contractual services, regardless of the amount of the
expenditure, but subject always, however, to any prohibition contained in the
Charter, Codified Ordinances or applicable statutes of the State. A full report
of the circumstances of an emergency purchase shall be filed by the Director of
Finance with Council and shall be entered in the minutes of Council and shall
be open to public inspection.
      (2)    By heads of a department. In case of actual emergency, the head of
any department may purchase directly any supplies whose immediate procurement
is essential to prevent delays in the work of the using department or agency,
which may vitally affect the life, health or convenience of residents. The
department head shall send to the Director of Finance a requisition, and a copy

to waive compliance with this section, when it finds such action is in the best

Waterworks pension fund - see W.  Va.  Code 8-22-29
   141.01  PENSION FUND CREATED.
   A pension fund for the civil service employees of the Department of
Waterworks of the City is hereby revised, such revision being that of the
established 1965 Waterworks Pension Fund of the City and by Section 54B of the
former Charter of the City of Parkersburg.  The pension fund shall be known as
the “Waterworks Pension Fund”.
(Ord.  0-355.  Passed 12-11-84.)
   141.02  BOARD OF TRUSTEES.
   There is hereby created a Board of Trustees composed of the five members of
the Parkersburg Utility Board which shall administer and distribute the moneys
authorized to be raised by this article.
   The Comptroller of the Parkersburg Utility Board shall be the Treasurer of
the Waterworks Pension Fund and as such Treasurer shall keep complete and
permanent records of all proceedings of the Board of Trustees and the ongoing
operation and management of the Waterworks Pension Fund.
   The Waterworks Pension Fund by this name may sue and be sued, plead and be
impleaded, contract and be contracted with, take and hold real property and
personal property for the use of the Waterworks Pension Fund.
(Ord.  0-916.  Passed 5-11-99.)
   141.03  MAINTENANCE OF FUND.
   The Pension Fund shall be financed from the Waterworks Fund of the City from
water revenues at a rate as will after crediting the amount of the
contributions received during such year from the members of the Waterworks
Pension Fund, provide funds equal to the sum of (a) the full amount of
estimated expenditures of the Board of Trustees, and (b) an additional amount
equal to ten percent (10%) of such estimated expenditures, such ten percent
(10%) amount to be taken, accumulated and invested, if possible, as surplus
reserves.  Provided, that in no event shall such an assessment be less than one
quarter percent (1/4%) or more than two percent (2%) of water revenues and
provided that in the event that the funds derived above are not sufficient to
meet the annual expenditures and the surplus reserves for any fiscal year do
not contain a sufficient balance to maintain full retirement benefits for that
fiscal year, the Waterworks Fund of the City shall for that fiscal year provide
an amount not to exceed an additional two percent (2%) of water revenues of the
Waterworks Fund. In the event that the Waterworks Fund is required to deposit
an amount in excess of two percent (2%) of water revenues, the Waterworks Fund
shall assess and collect for only that fiscal year from any member an
additional one percent (1%) of the actual salary or compensation for each one
percent (1%) the Waterworks Fund contributes in excess of the estimated
expenditures which shall become a required part of the Pension Fund to which
the members belong.
   The Waterworks Pension Fund is hereby authorized to take by gift, grant,
devise, or bequest, any money or real or personal property, upon such terms as
to the investment and expenditures thereof, as may be fixed by the grantor are
determined by the Trustees.
   In addition to all other sums provided for the Pension Fund in this section,
it shall be the duty of the City to assess end collect from each member of the
Waterworks Pension Fund each month, the sum of seven percent (7%) of the actual
salary or compensation of such member, and the amount so collected shall become
a regular pert of the Waterworks Pension Fund.
   Waterworks Fund contributions shall be deposited in the Waterworks Pension
Fund assets on at least a quarterly basis and any revenues from any source
which are specifically collected for the purpose of allocation for deposit into
such Fund shall be so deposited within thirty days of receipt by the City.
(Ord. 0-355. Passed 12-11-84.)
   141.04  REFUND OF MEMBERS' CONTRIBUTIONS.
   Any member of the Waterworks Pension Fund who is removed or discharged or
who before retirement on any retirement pension or disability pension severs
his connection with the Waterworks Department, whether or not consecutive,
shall, upon request, be refunded all pension and relief fund deductions made
from his salary or compensation, but without interest. Any member who received
such refund and who subsequently wishes to re-enter the Department, shall be
required to utilize the West Virginia Public Employees Retirement Program for
any future retirement plan.
(Ord. 0-355. Passed 12-11-84.)
   141.05  MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ACTUARIAL SOUNDNESS.
   The Board of Trustees for the Waterworks Pension Fund shall have regularly
scheduled actuarial valuation reports prepared by a qualified actuary. All of
the following standards shall be met:
   (a)    An actuarial valuation report shall be prepared at least once every
three years commencing with the later of: (1) the first day of July 1984, or
(2) three years following the most recently prepared actuarial valuation
report; provided, that this most recently prepared actuarial valuation report
meets all of the standards of this section.
   (b)    The actuarial valuation report shall consist of, but is not limited
to, the following disclosures:
      (1)    The financial objective of the Fund and how the objective is to be
attained;
      (2)    The progress being made toward realization of the financial
objective;
      (3)    Recent changes in the nature of the Fund, benefits provided, or
actuarial assumptions or methods;
      (4)    The frequency of actuarial valuation reports and the date of the
most recent actuarial valuation report;
      (5)    The method used to value Fund assets;
      (6)    The extent to which the qualified actuary relies on the data
provided and whether the data was certified by the Fund's Auditor or examined
by the qualified actuary for reasonableness;
      (7)    A description and explanation of the actuarial assumptions and
methods; and
      (8)    Any other information the qualified actuary feels is necessary or
would be useful in fully and fairly disclosing the actuarial condition of the
Fund.
   (c)    After June 30, 1983, and thereafter, the financial objective of the
Municipality shall not be less than to contribute to the Fund annually an
amount which, together with the contributions from the members and other income
sources as authorized by law, will be sufficient to meet the normal cost of the
Fund and amortize any actuarial deficiency over a period of not more than forty
years. Provided, that for those funds in existence on July 1, 1981, its
actuarial deficiency, if any, shall not be amortized over a period longer than
that which remains under its current schedule. For purposes of determining this
minimum financial objective, the value of the Fund's assets shall be determined
on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into
account fair market value, and all cost, deficiencies, rate of interest and
other factors under the Fund shall be determined on the basis of actuarial
assumptions and methods which, in aggregate, are reasonably taking into account
the experience of the Fund and reasonable expectations and which, in
combination, offer the qualified actuary's best estimate of anticipated
experience under the Fund. If as a result of this legislation the
Municipality's financial commitment to the Fund is materially increased, the
Municipality may elect to phase in this increase over the five fiscal years
commencing July 1, 1983.
   (d)    For purposes of this section, the term "qualified actuary" means only
an actuary who is a member of the Society of Actuaries or the American Academy
of Actuaries. The qualified actuary shall be designated a fiduciary and shall
discharge his duties with respect to a fund solely in the interest of the
members and members' beneficiaries of that fund. In order for the standards of
this section to be met, the qualified actuary shall certify that the actuarial
valuation report is complete and accurate and that in his opinion the technique
and assumptions used are reasonable and meet the requirements of this section.
   (e)    The cost of the preparation of the actuarial valuation report shall
be paid by the Fund.
      (Ord. 0-355. Passed 12-11-84.)
   141.06  DUTIES AND BOND OF CUSTODIAN OF FUNDS.
   The Treasurer of the Municipality shall be the custodian of all of the
assets of the Waterworks Pension Fund, and shall deposit and pay out the moneys
thereof upon, and in accordance with, any proper order of the Board of
Trustees. Such Treasurer shall be liable upon his official bond as Treasurer
for the faithful performance of his duties in respect to such Fund, and the
official bond of the Treasurer covering such Fund shall be executed with a good
and financially responsible surety company authorized to do business in this
State, as surety for such Funds. The Treasurer of the Municipality shall as
Fund fiduciary, discharge his duties with respect to such Pension Fund solely
in the interest of the members and member's beneficiaries for the exclusive
purpose of providing benefits to such members and their beneficiaries and
defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Fund. Such Fund shall be a
trust Fund and shall not be used for any other purpose than provided herein.
Such Treasurer shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for
an actuarial valuation report.
(Ord. 0-355. Passed 12-11-84.)

consolidated fund or the consolidated pension fund. The Board of Trustees shall
invest any moneys received by it and not invested in the consolidated fund or

accounts and not otherwise, which securities and accounts mature on such dates
as will make available such amount of cash as is required:
   (a)   Obligations of the United States or any agency thereof, which are

Loan Insurance Corporation: provided, that an investment in any such savings
account in excess of the amount thereof which would be insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation as the case may be, shall not be made unless such banking
institution, Federal Savings and Loan Association or building and loan

term government bonds, yields for the second preceding calendar month plus an
additional one percent (1%) a year rounded off to the nearest quarter of one
percent (1/4%) a year. Any investment made under this section shall be made
with the exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under circumstances then
prevailing which men of experience, prudence, discretion and intelligence
exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation but for
investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the
probable income to be derived. (Ord. 0-355. Passed 12-11-84.)
   141.08  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of all sections, the words "salary" or "compensation" mean
remuneration actually received by a member, provided, that the remuneration
received by such member during any twelve-consecutive-month period utilized in
determining benefits which is in excess of an amount which is twenty percent
(20%) greater than the average adjusted salary received by such member in the
two consecutive twelve-month periods immediately preceding such twelve-
consecutive-month period utilized in determining benefits shall be disregarded.

   141.09  ELIGIBILITY FOR TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT DISABILITY.
   (a)    All members applying for total and temporary or total and permanent
disability benefits shall be examined by at least two physicians under the
direction of the staff at Marshall University, West Virginia University,
Morgantown or West Virginia University, Charleston: Provided, that if such
member's medical condition cannot be agreed upon by two such physicians, a
third physician shall examine such member. Such medical examination shall
include the review of such member's medical history. The expense of the
member's transportation to such medical examination and the expense of the
medical examination shall be paid by the Board of Trustees. Such medical
expense shall not exceed the reasonable and customary charges for such
services.
   (b)    Effective for members becoming eligible for total and temporary
disability benefits, initially or previously under this subsection, allowance
for initial or additional total and temporary disability payments, the amount
thereof to be determined as set forth in Section
141.10, shall be paid to such member during such disability for a period not
exceeding twenty-six weeks if after medical examination in accordance with
subsection (a) hereof, two examining physicians report in writing to the Board
of Trustees that:
(1) such member has become so totally, physically or mentally disabled from any
reason, as to render such member totally, physically or mentally, incapacitated
for employment, and (2) it has not been determined if such disability is
permanent or it has been determined that such disability may be alleviated or
eliminated if such member follows a reasonable medical treatment plan or
reasonable medical advice. Provided that in any event a member is not eligible
for total and temporary disability payments following the fourth consecutive
twenty-six week period of total and temporary disability unless such subsequent
disability results from a cause unrelated to the cause of the four previous
periods of total and temporary disability. During such two-year period of such
total and temporary disability, the Department is required to restore such
member to his former position in the Department at any time he is determined to
be no longer disabled. Provided, that the Department may refill, on a temporary
basis, the position vacated by such member after the first twenty-six weeks of
his temporary disability.
   (c)    Effective for members becoming eligible for total and permanent
disability benefits initially under subsection (b) hereof, allowance for total
and permanent disability payments, the amount thereof to be determined as
specified in Section
141.10 shall be paid to such member after a medical examination in accordance
with subsection (a) hereof, two examining physicians report in writing to the
Board of Trustees that such member has become so totally physically or
mentally, and permanently disabled, as approximate result of service rendered
in the performance of his duties in such Department, as to render such member
totally, physically or mentally and permanently incapacitated for employment as
a Waterworks employee or, if such member has been a member of such Department
for a period of not less than five consecutive years preceding such disability,
such member has become so totally, physically or mentally, and permanently
disabled from any reason other than service rendered in the performance of his
duties in such Department, as to render such member totally, physically or
mentally, and permanently incapacitated for employment. The phrase "totally,
physically or mentally and permanently disabled" shall not be construed to
include a medical condition which may be corrected if such member follows a
reasonable medical treatment plan or reasonable medical advice.
   (d)    Effective for members becoming eligible for total and temporary
disability benefits under the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, any payments
for total and temporary disability for a period during such disability not
exceeding twenty-six weeks shall cease at the end of such twenty-six week
period under the following conditions.
(1) such member fails to be examined as provided in subsection (a) hereof, or
(2) such member is examined or re-examined as provided in subsection (a) and
two examining physicians report to the Board of Trustees that such member's
medical condition does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) or (c)
hereof.
   (e)    Effective for members becoming eligible for total and temporary
disability benefits under subsection (b) hereof, subsequent to such member's
receipt of total and temporary disability payments for a period of two years,
such payments shall cease at the end of such two-year period under the
following conditions: (1) such member fails to be examined as provided in
subsection (a) hereof, or (2) such member is examined or re-examined as
provided in subsection (a) and two examining physicians report to the Board of
Trustees that such member's medical condition does not meet the requirements of
subsection (c) hereof.

compensation being received by such member, at the time he is so disabled, or
the sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month, whichever is greater,
provided that the limitation provided in subsection (b) hereof is not exceeded.
   The monthly salary or remuneration in this section is to be defined as the
current month's base salary plus a monthly average of the last twelve months
overtime, incentive, longevity, holiday or any other remuneration in addition
to base salary.
   (b)    Any member who becomes eligible for disability benefits under the
provisions of Section
141.09, as approximate result of service rendered in the performance of his
duties within the Waterworks Department, his monthly disability payment as
provided in subsection (a) hereof shall not, when aggregated with the monthly
amount of State Workmen's Compensation, result in such disabled member
receiving a total monthly income from such sources in excess of one hundred
percent (100%) of the basic compensation which is paid to members holding the
same position which such member held within the Department at the time of his
disability. Lump sum payments of State Workmen's Compensation benefits shall
not be considered for purposes of this subsection (b) unless such lump sum
payments represent commuted values of monthly State Workmen's Compensation
benefits.

notify the Mayor of this fact within thirty days of such member's sixty-fifth
birthday; and the Mayor shall cause such sixty-five-year-old member of the
Waterworks to be retired within a period of not more than thirty additional
days. Upon retirement under the provisions of this subsection (d) such member
shall receive retirement pension benefits payable in twelve monthly
installments for each year of the remainder of his life, in an amount equal to
sixty percent (60%) of such member's average annual salary or compensation
received during the three twelve-consecutive-month periods, not necessarily
consecutive, each of such three periods beginning with the same calendar month
of different years and all such three periods falling within the member's final
five years of employment with such Department, in which such member received
his highest salary or compensation while a member of the Department or an
amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month, whichever is greater, and if
such member has been employed in such Department for more than twenty years,
the provisions of subsection (a) hereof shall apply.
   (e)    It shall be the duty of each member of the Waterworks Pension Fund to

within a reasonable length of time, such length of time to be determined by the
Board of Trustees; and then the Board of Trustees and the Mayor shall proceed
to act in the manner provided in subsection (d) hereof and shall cause all
members of the Waterworks Pension Fund who are over the age of sixty-five years
to be retired in not less than sixty days from the date this article is
established. Upon retirement under the provisions of this subsection (e), such
member, whether he has been employed in the Department for twenty years or not

five years of employment with the Department in which such member received his
highest salary or compensation while a member of the Department, or an amount
of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month, whichever is greater, and if such

specified in subsection (b) hereof before retirement on a disability pension
under the provisions of Section
141.10, or a retirement pension under the provisions of Section
141.11, leaving in either case surviving a dependent spouse, or any dependent
child or children under the age of eighteen years, or dependent father or

receive retirement pension benefits under the provisions of Section
141.11, dies from any cause other than as specified in subsection (b) hereof
leaving in either case surviving a dependent spouse to whom the marriage took
place prior to the date of such member's retirement on a disability pension or
a retirement pension, or any dependent child or children under the age of
eighteen years who were born prior to or within ten months after the date of
such member's retirement on a disability pension or a retirement pension or
dependent father or mother or both, or any dependent brothers or sisters or
both under the age of eighteen years; then in any of the cases set forth herein
the Board of Trustees of the Waterworks Pension Fund shall, immediately

surviving dependents the following pension benefits: To such dependent spouse
until death or remarriage, a sum per month equal to thirty percent (30%) of
such member's average monthly salary or compensation received during the three
twelve-consecutive-month periods, not necessarily consecutive, each of such
three periods beginning with the same calendar month of different years and all
such three periods falling within the member's final five years of employment
with such Department, in which such member received his highest salary or
compensation while a member of the Department, hereinafter for convenience
referred to in this section as "monthly average", or an amount of two hundred

occurs; to each such dependent orphaned child a sum per month equal to fifteen
percent (15%) of such monthly average, or the sum of forty-five dollars

such dependent father or mother a sum per month for each equal to ten percent
(10%) of such monthly average, or the sum of thirty dollars ($30.00) per month
for each such father and mother, whichever is greater; to each such dependent
brother or sister the sum of five dollars ($5.00) per month until such
individual attains the age of eighteen years or marries, whichever first
occurs, but in no event shall the aggregate amount paid to such brothers and
sisters exceed thirty dollars ($30.00) per month. If at any time, because of
the number of dependents, all such dependents cannot be paid in full as herein
provided, then each dependent shall receive his pro rata share of such
payments. In no case shall the payments to the surviving spouse and children be
cut below sixty-five percent (65%) of the total amount to be paid to all
dependents.
   (b)    The dependent spouse, child or children, or dependent father or
mother, or dependent brothers or sisters, of any such member who dies by reason

regardless of the length of such member's service, and irrespective of whether
such member was or was not entitled to receive or was or was not receiving
disability pension or temporary disability payments at the time of his death,
receive the death benefits provided for in subsection (a) hereof, and if such
member had less than three years' service at the time of his death, the monthly

children, or dependent father or mother, or dependent brothers or sisters, his
contributions to the Fund plus six percent (6%) interest shall be refunded to
his named beneficiary or, if no beneficiary has been named, to his estate to
the extent that such contributions plus interest exceed any disability or
retirement benefits that he may have received before his death.
   (d)    The provisions of this section shall not be construed as creating or
establishing any contractual or vested rights in favor of any individual who
may be or become qualified as a beneficiary of the death benefits herein
authorized to be made, all the provisions hereof and benefits provided for
hereunder being expressly subject to such subsequent legislative enactments as
may provide for any change, modification or elimination of the beneficiaries or
benefits specified herein.

consider such relevant evidence as may be adduced before him or her (including
hearsay evidence) and give to it such weight and credit as he or she deems to
be proper.  The Administrative Hearing Examiner shall have the power to issue
subpoenas to require attendance of witnesses at any hearing.
   The Administrative Hearing Examiner upon the conclusion of any such hearing
shall make such recommendations as may be required or as he or she may deem
proper to the Mayor and the appropriate department head.  Any such
recommendations shall be advisory only and shall not be binding upon either the
City or any other party.  In all predisciplinary probable cause hearings for
municipal employees the Administrative Hearing Examiner shall specifically 
find whether or not probable cause exists for the proposed disciplinary action
to be taken.

prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to a
fair determination of whether a permit should be issued. Applications shall be
filed not less than five days before the time intended for such parade,
procession or assemblage.
   The permit may be refused or canceled if the resultant conditions would

sufficient police officers or firemen so as to deprive the Municipality of
normal police and fire protection, or would be reasonably likely to provoke
disorderly conduct, create a disturbance or threaten the safety of residents.
   The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe reasonable
conditions, including the hours, the places of assembly and of dispersal, the
route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which
may be used or occupied.
   311.02  PUTTING GLASS OR OTHER DEBRIS ON STREETS.

   311.03  HOSPITAL QUIET ZONES.
   The streets and other public grounds of the City within 200 feet of every
hospital in the City shall constitute and be known as "hospital quiet zones".
The limits of such hospital quiet zones shall be indicated by appropriate signs
placed by the Police Department of the City. Such signs shall be placed at a
distance of 200 feet from every hospital in such conspicuous places that they
may be seen by the public.
   No driver of any vehicle, no rider or driver of any animal, no pedestrian or
other person, upon such streets or public grounds of the City within such quiet
zones, shall make or cause to be made any unnecessary noise. Cutouts and
exhausts upon motor vehicles shall be silenced; horns, klaxons or gongs shall

   311.04  PLAY STREETS.
   The Director of Public Works shall have authority to declare any street or

   Whenever authorized signs are erected indicating any street or part thereof
as a play street, no person shall drive a vehicle upon any such street or
portion thereof except drivers of vehicles having business or whose residences

   311.05  USE OF TOYS ON STREETS RESTRICTED.
   No person upon roller skates or riding in or by means of any coaster, toy

of the rights and shall be subject to all of the duties applicable to
pedestrians. However, this section shall not apply to any street set aside as a
play street. (1947 Code §19.60)
   311.06  OBSTRUCTING VIEW AT INTERSECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   (a)    No person who is the owner of a lot or parcel of ground located at
the intersection of two or more streets, shall plant, grow or permit to grow or
maintain on any such lot any trees, shrubbery, bushes, weeds or obstructions of
any kind which obstructs or interferes with the view or vision of the driver of
a vehicle, or which in any way interferes with intersection vision clearance.
   "Intersection vision clearance" means a triangular space at the street
corner of a corner lot free from any kind of obstruction to vision between the
heights of three and twelve feet above established grade off the roadway
determined by a diagonal line connecting two points measured fifteen feet
equidistant from the street corner along each property line.
   (b)    The Chief of Police or his authorized representative may give or
cause to be given in writing to any person violating subsection (a) hereof,
notice to remove such trees, shrubbery, bushes, weeds or other obstructions.

Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (c)    In the event that the property owner fails to remove such
obstructions in accordance with the notice within ten days from the date of the
service thereof, the Director of Public Works or his duly authorized
representative may cause the same to be removed either by the agents or
employees of the City, or otherwise as he may decide or direct, and the
Director shall report the cost of cutting and removal of such obstruction to
the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance shall immediately mail a bill,
voucher or statement of such costs to the person owning such lot, land or
property and the bill, voucher or statement shall be due within ten days of the
date of the mailing of same, and a copy thereof be forwarded to the Director of
Public Works.
   (d)    The payment of the amount so chargeable to the owner shall not
relieve him of any penalty imposed under the provisions of this section or
constitute a defense against any violation of such provisions.
   (e)    The following obstructions existing upon the effective date of this
section are hereby exempted and shall not be considered violations hereof:
      (1)    Structures used or intended to be used for residential or
commercial purposes;
      (2)    Existing level, grade or slope of unimproved real property;
      (3)    Retaining walls; and

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may,
unless otherwise designated, cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle
shall yield to the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and
to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)    A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close  as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none then at the entrance to the intersection on a one-
way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves to 
the left, may, unless otherwise designated, cautiously make a left turn into
the one-way street but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians  lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except Council may by
ordinance prohibit any such left turn against a red or "stop" signal at any
intersection, which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at such
intersection  giving notice thereof.

from view or interferes with the effectiveness of any official traffic control
device or any railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain
nor shall any public authority permit upon any street any traffic control

such restraint is inappropriate.
   (c)    A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages: provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct an
in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party's failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of. Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine (1) that the injured party failed to wear
a safety belt, and (2) that the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a
failure to mitigate damages. The trier of fact may reduce the injured party's
recovery for medical damages by an amount not to exceed five percent (5%)
thereof. In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of five percent
(5%) of medical damages, the court shall make the calculations and the issue of
mitigation of damages for failure to wear a safety belt shall not be presented
to the jury. In all cases, the actual computation of the dollar amount
reduction shall be determined by the court.

hereof or any motor vehicle which has been altered from the manufacturer's
specification for that vehicle make and model with respect to the distance from
the vehicle body to vehicle frame but within the allowable limits of subsection
(b) hereof may be operated upon a public street or highway in this
Municipality, subject to inspection under West Virginia Code 17C-15-48:
provided, that any motor vehicle which has been altered from the manufacturer's
specification by lowering the bumper height for that vehicle make and model
within the allowable limits of subsection (a) hereof shall be exempt from the
inspection requirements hereunder and may be operated upon a public street or
highway in this Municipality subject to provisions of West Virginia Code

17C-15-48)    343.24  OPERATION OF VEHICLES WITH SAFETY BELTS.    (a)    A
person shall not operate a passenger vehicle on a public street or highway
unless the person, any passenger in the back seat under eighteen years of age,
and any passenger in the front seat of such passenger vehicle is restrained by
a safety belt meeting applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. For
the purposes of this section, "passenger vehicle" means a motor vehicle which
is designed for transporting ten passengers or less, including the driver,
except that such term does not include a motorcycle, a trailer or any motor
vehicle which is not required on the date of the enactment of this section
under a federal motor vehicle safety standard to be equipped with a belt
system. The provisions of this section shall apply to all passenger vehicles
manufactured after the first day of January, 1967, and being 1968 models and
newer.    (b)    The required use of safety belts as provided herein does not
apply to a duly appointed or contracted rural mail carrier of the United States
Postal Service who is actually making mail deliveries or to a passenger or
operator with a physically disabling condition whose physical disability would
prevent appropriate restraint in such safety belt if the condition is duly
certified by a physician who shall state the nature of the disability as well
as the reason such restraint is inappropriate.    (c)    A violation of this
section is not admissible as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence
or comparative negligence in any civil action or proceeding for damages, and
shall not be admissible in mitigation of damages: provided, that the court may,
upon motion of the defendant, conduct an in camera hearing to determine whether
an injured party's failure to wear a safety belt was a proximate cause of the
injuries complained of. Upon such a finding by the court, the court may then,
in a jury trial, by special interrogatory to the jury, determine (1) that the
injured party failed to wear a safety belt, and (2) that the failure to wear
the safety belt constituted a failure to mitigate damages. The trier of fact
may reduce the injured party's recovery for medical damages by an amount not to
exceed five percent (5%) thereof. In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the
reduction of five percent (5%) of medical damages, the court shall make the
calculations and the issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a
safety belt shall not be presented to the jury. In all cases, the actual
computation of the dollar amount reduction shall be determined by the court.

points may be entered on any driver's record maintained by the Division of

alter the provisions of Section

outside the vehicle when parked in a designated accessible parking space.  The
placard may be removed from the rearview mirror whenever the vehicle is being
operated to ensure clear vision and safe driving.  Only in the event that there
is no suitable rearview mirror in the vehicle may the placard be displayed on
the dashboard of the vehicle.  The Commissioner also issues to each applicant
who is granted a special registration plate or windshield placard an
identification card bearing the applicant’s name, assigned identification
number and expiration date.  The applicant shall thereafter carry this
identification card on his or her person whenever parking in an accessible
parking space.  The identification card shall be identical in design for both
registration plates and removable windshield placards.
   (d)   Any person who falsely or fraudulently obtains or seeks to obtain the
special plate or the removable windshield placard provided for in WV Code §17C-
13-6(a) and any person who falsely certifies that a person is mobility impaired
in order that an applicant may be issued the special registration plate or
windshield placard under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may otherwise
incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars.
   (e)   Any person who fabricates, uses or sells unofficially issued
windshield placards to any person or organization is committing a fraudulent
act and is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, in addition to
any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred
dollars per placard fabricated, used or sold.
   (f)   Any person who fabricates, uses or sells unofficially issued
identification cards to any person or organization is committing a fraudulent
act and is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, in addition to
any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined seven hundred
dollars per identification card fabricated, used or sold.
   (g)   Any person who fabricates, uses or sells unofficially issued labels
imprinted with a future expiration date to any person or organization is
committing a fraudulent act and is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall
be fined seven hundred dollars.
   (h)   Any person covered by this section who sells or gives away their
officially issued windshield placard to any person or organization not
qualified to apply or receive the placard and then reapplies for a new placard
on the basis it was stolen is committing a fraudulent act and is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he,
she or they may otherwise incur, shall lose their right to receive or use a
special placard or special license plate for a period of not less than five
years.  The City shall notify the West Virginia Commissioner of Motor Vehicles
if such an infraction occurs.
   (i)   An accessible parking space should comply with the provisions of the
Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG),  contained in
28 C.F.R. 36, Appendix A, Section 4.6.  In particular, the parking space should
be a minimum of eight feet wide with an adjacent eight-foot access aisle for
vans having side mounted hydraulic lifts or ramps or a five-foot access aisle
for standard vehicles.  Access aisles should be marked using diagonal two-to-
four-inch wide stripes spaced every twelve or twenty-four inches apart or other
appropriate markings denoting that the space is a no-parking zone.  All
accessible parking spaces should have a signpost in front or adjacent to the
accessible parking space displaying the international symbol of access sign
mounted at a minimum of eight feet above the pavement or sidewalk and the top
of the sign.  Lines or markings on the pavement or curbs for parking spaces and
access aisles may be in any color, although blue is the generally accepted
color for accessible parking.
   (j)   A vehicle from any other state, United States territory or foreign
country displaying an officially issued special registration plate, placard or
decal bearing the international symbol of access shall be recognized and
accepted as meeting the requirements of this section, regardless of where the
plate, placard or decal is mounted or displayed on the vehicle. (Ord. 0-1161. 
Passed 11-9-04.)
   (k)   Stopping, standing or parking places marked with the intentional
symbol of access shall be designated in close proximity to all public entities,
including state, county and municipal buildings and facilities, places of
public accommodation and commercial facilities.  These parking places shall be
reserved solely for persons with a mobility impairment at all times.
(Ord. 0-1421.  Passed 7-24-12.)
   (l)   Any person whose vehicle properly displays a valid, unexpired special
registration plate or removable windshield placard may park the vehicle for
unlimited periods of time in parking zones unrestricted as to length of parking
time permitted.  Provided, that this privilege does not mean that the vehicle
may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking
during heavy traffic periods during specified rush hours or where parking would
clearly present a traffic hazard.  The parking privileges provided for in this
subsection apply only during those times when the vehicle is being used for
loading or unloading of a person with a mobility impairment.  Any person who
knowingly exercises, or attempts to exercise, these privileges at a time when
the vehicle is not being used for the loading or unloading of a person with a
mobility impairment is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon first conviction
thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall
be fined one hundred dollars, upon second conviction thereof, in addition to
any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred
dollars; and upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any
other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred
dollars.      
   (m)   Any person whose vehicle does not display a valid, special
registration plate or removable windshield placard may not stop, stand or park
a motor vehicle in an area designated, zoned or marked for accessible parking
with signs or instructions displaying the international symbol of access,
either by itself or with explanatory text.  The signs may be mounted on a post
or a wall in front of the accessible parking space and instructions may appear
on the ground or pavement, but use of both methods is preferred.  Accessible
parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.  These spaces
are intended solely for persons with a mobility impairment, as defined in this
section:  provided,  that any person in the act of transporting a person with a
mobility impairment as defined in this section, may stop, stand or park a motor
vehicle not displaying a special registration plate or removable windshield
placard in the area designated for accessible parking by the international
symbol of access for the limited purposes of loading or unloading a passenger
with a mobility impairment:  provided, however, that the vehicle shall be
promptly moved after the completion of this limited purpose.  Any person who
violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be fined one hundred dollars; upon second conviction
thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall
be fined three hundred dollars; and upon third and subsequent convictions
thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall
be fined five hundred dollars.
   (n)   All signs that designate areas as “accessible parking” or that display
the international symbol of access shall also include the words “Up to $500
fine”.
   (o)   No person may stop, stand or park a motor vehicle in an area
designated or marked off as an accessible aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space.  Any person, including a
driver of a vehicle displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special
registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined one hundred dollars;
upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may
otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars; and upon third and
subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may
otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars.
   (p)   City parking enforcement and meter control personnel who otherwise
enforce parking violations may issue citations for violations of this section
and shall reference the number on the vehicle’s license plate, since the driver
normally will not be present.
   (q)   In accordance with WV Code §17C-13-6(o), the City shall retain all
fines and associated late fees established in this section.  These revenues
shall go into the City’s General Revenue Fund.
   (r)   There shall be a minimum of one accessible parking space out of 25 on
all streets within the business district and placed as close as technically
feasible to sidewalk curb ramps or curb cuts.  Trash containers, mail boxes,
newspaper vending units, flower pots or other containers shall not be placed on
the sidewalk close to accessible parking spaces as they prevent effective van-
accessible usability.
   (s)   All off-street public parking lots under the jurisdiction of the City
shall have a minimum of one van-accessible parking space with an associated
eight-foot access aisle.  At all such lots with more than 25 parking spaces,
there shall be a minimum of one out of 25 accessible parking spaces with the
second through sixth accessible parking space having an associated five- foot
access aisle.  After the sixth accessible parking space, another van-accessible
space is then required.  All access aisles may be shared with a second
accessible parking space.  This provision complies with the ADA regarding the
number and types of accessible parking spaces.
   (t)   The Chief of Police is further authorized to designate such other on-
street accessible parking spaces to individuals who request such accommodation
provided they show their identification card issued by the West Virginia
Commissioner of Motor Vehicles identifying them as a person with  a qualified
mobility impairment as defined in the referenced West Virginia Code.

thirty days notice by registered or certified mail that such action shall be
taken unless the motor vehicle is removed or restored to a functional use. 
(Ord. 0-1025.  Passed 5-28-02.)

   (a)   The Police Department which takes into custody and possession any

notify the last known registered owner of such motor vehicle and all
lienholders of record that such motor vehicle has been taken into custody and
possession, such notification to be by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested.  The notice shall: contain a description of such motor
vehicle, including the year, make, model, manufacturer’s serial or
identification number or any other number which may have been assigned to such
motor vehicle by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and any distinguishing
marks; set forth the location of the facility where such motor vehicle is being
held and the location where such motor vehicle was taken into custody and

reclaim such motor vehicle within ten days after the date the notice was
received by the owner or lienholders, upon payment of all towing, preservation
and storage charges resulting from taking and placing such motor vehicle into
custody and possession, and state that the failure of the owner or lienholders
of record to exercise their right to reclaim such motor vehicle within such
ten-day period shall be deemed a waiver by the owner and all lienholders of
record of all right, title and interest in such motor vehicle and of their
consent to the sale or disposal of the aforesaid motor vehicle at a public
auction or to a licensed salvage yard or demolisher.
   (b)   If the identity of the last registered owner of the aforesaid motor
vehicle cannot be determined, or if the certificate of registration or

to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and addresses of all
lienholders, notice shall be published as a Class I legal advertisement in
compliance with the provisions of W.Va. Code 59-3-1 et seq., and the

vehicle.  The notice shall be published within fifteen days after such motor
vehicle is taken into custody and possession and shall have the same contents
required for a notice pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, except that the ten-

the registered owner of such motor vehicle, if known, and all lienholders of
record, if any, within fifteen days after the vehicle is taken into custody and
possession: Provided, that the requirements of this subsection shall not apply
to motor vehicles for which the registered owner cannot be ascertained by due
diligence or investigation.
   (d)   The consequences and effect of failure to reclaim an aforesaid motor
vehicle within the ten day period after notice is received by registered or
certified mail or within ten days after the notice is published in a newspaper
as aforesaid shall be set forth in such notice.

   (a)    If an aforesaid motor vehicle is not reclaimed as provided for in
Section
355.04, the Police Department shall sell it either at a public auction or to a
licensed salvage yard or demolisher. The purchaser of such motor vehicle shall
take title to such motor vehicle free and clear of all liens and claims of
ownership, and shall receive a sales receipt from the Department who disposed
of such motor vehicle. The sales receipt at such sale shall be sufficient title
only for purposes of transferring such motor vehicle to a licensed salvage yard
or to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking or dismantling, and no further
titling of such motor vehicle shall be necessary by either the purchaser at the
auction, the licensed salvage yard or the demolisher, who shall be exempt from
the payment of any fees and taxes required under W. Va. Code 17A-3-1 et seq.:
provided, that the purchaser at the auction shall place such motor vehicle in
the possession of a licensed salvage yard or demolisher within twenty days from
the date he purchased such motor vehicle and the licensed salvage yard or
demolisher must demolish, wreck or dismantle such motor vehicle within six
months after taking possession of such motor vehicle and if such licensed
salvage yard or demolisher does not, such licensed salvage yard or demolisher

   (b)    When the Police Department has in its custody and possession old
vehicle tires or inoperative or abandoned machinery collected in accordance
with Section

licensed salvage yard or demolisher. (Ord. 0- 186. Passed 12-14-82.)
   355.06  PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF ABANDONED OR JUNK VEHICLES AND MACHINERY.
   From the proceeds of any such sale, the Police Department which sold the
abandoned motor vehicle, junked motor vehicle, or inoperative and abandoned
machinery shall reimburse itself for any expenses it may have incurred in
removing, towing, preserving and storing such property and the expenses of
conducting any auction and any notice and publication expenses incurred
pursuant to this article.
   Any remainder from the proceeds of such sale shall be deposited in the City
Treasury to be kept and maintained as a special revolving account, hereinafter
established and designated as the “Abandoned and Junked Property Fund”;
provided that any remainder from proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor
vehicle or junked motor vehicle after payment of such expenses shall be held
for the last registered owner of such motor vehicle or any lienholder for
ninety days, after which time, if no owner or lienholder claims the remainder,
it shall be deposited in the State Road Fund.
   Any moneys so collected and deposited in the special fund shall be used
solely by the Police Department for the payment of auction, towing, removing,
preserving, storing, notice and publication costs which results from taking
other abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, and inoperative or
abandoned machinery into custody and possession.

         (WVaC 61-3A-6)
   (b)   Shoplifting Defined.

manner; or
         B.   Removes or causes the removal of merchandise from the mercantile

      (2)   A person also commits the offense of shoplifting if such person,
alone or in concert with another person, knowingly and with intent obtains an
exchange or refund or attempts to obtain an exchange or refund for merchandise
which has not been purchased from the mercantile establishment.
         (WVaC 61-3A-1)
   (c)   Breach of Peace; Detention.  An act of shoplifting as defined herein,
is hereby declared to constitute a breach of peace and any owner of
merchandise, his agent or employee, or any law enforcement officer who has
reasonable ground to believe that a person has committed shoplifting, may
detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting.  Such reasonable
detention shall not constitute an arrest nor shall it render the owner of
merchandise, his agent or employee, liable to the person detained.
(WVaC 61-3A-4)
   (d)   Evidence.
      (1)   Evidence of stated price or ownership of merchandise may include,

         B.   If such merchandise is not recoverable or is damaged, for actual
damages, including the value of the merchandise involved in the shoplifting;
and
         C.   For other actual damages arising from the incident, not including
the loss of time or loss of wages incurred by the mercantile establishment or

and
         D.   In all cases, for a penalty to be paid to the mercantile
establishment in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) or double the value of
the merchandise whichever is higher.
      (2)   Costs and attorneys' fees.  A merchant who is a prevailing party
under this section is entitled to costs.
      (3)   Effect of conviction.  A conviction for the offense of theft by
shoplifting is not a prerequisite to the maintenance of a civil action
authorized by this section.  However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment.  The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not
limit the right of such establishment to demand, orally or in writing, that a
person who is liable for damages or a penalty under this section remit such
damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action.  (WVaC 61-3A-
5)

      (2)    Second offense conviction. Upon a second shoplifting conviction:
         A.    When the value of the merchandise is less than or equal to five
hundred dollars ($500.00) the defendant shall be fined not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and
such fine shall not be suspended; or the defendant shall be confined in jail
not more than thirty days, or both.
         B.    When the value of the merchandise exceeds five hundred dollars
($500.00), the defendant shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars
($500.00) and shall be confined in jail not more than thirty days.
      (3)    Mandatory penalty. In addition to the fines and imprisonment
imposed by this section, in all cases of conviction for the offense of
shoplifting, the court shall order the defendant to pay a penalty to the
mercantile establishment involved in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00), or
double the value of the merchandise involved, whichever is higher. The
mercantile establishment shall be entitled to collect such mandatory penalty as
in the case of a civil judgment. This penalty shall be in addition to the
mercantile establishment's rights to recover the stolen merchandise.
      (4)    Prior convictions. In determining the number of prior shoplifting
convictions for purposes of imposing punishment under this section, the court

to be used as a weapon, consisting of a sharp edged or sharp-pointed blade,
usually made of steel, attached to a handle, which is capable of inflicting
cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds. "Knife" includes, but is not limited to,
any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and one-half
inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any other
instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds. A pocket

fishing knife carried for hunting, fishing, sports or other recreational uses,
or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement shall not be
included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless such knife is

   (f)    "Metallic or false knuckles" means a set of finger rings attached to

instrument, without reference to the metal or other substance or substances
from which the metallic or false knuckles are made.

with the barrel, designed to be aimed and fired by the use of a single hand.

carried.

(1947 Code §17.1)
   701.02  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO DOING BUSINESS.
   Payment in full of the proper fee as specified in Chapter One of this

   701.07  DURATION OF LICENSES.
   All annual licenses issued under the provisions of Chapter One of this

employment is begun after July 1 of any year, a license effective until the

   Any license issued under the provisions of Chapter One of this Business and

manner set out in this section to any person to whom it might have been
originally granted, and in the event of the death of the licensee, the license
may be assigned by his personal representative in like manner and with like
effect as might have been done by the  licensee himself. A memorandum of the
same shall be endorsed on the face of the certificate of license by the
assignor, and such memorandum attested by the City Clerk. If the assignee would
have been subject to a greater fee than the assignor had  the license
originally been granted to him, such assignment shall be valid only after the
payment of the difference between such two fees, prorated, however, in the same
manner as provided by Section
701.07 for the original issuance of licenses.
(1947 Code §17.11)
   701.12  EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FIRM ON LICENSES.
   No changes in the name of the firm, nor the taking in of one or more new

privileges of any license
granted to such partners or firm. (1947 Code §17.12)
   701.13  CHANGE OF PLACE OF BUSINESS.

activity, trade or employment to another location within the City if it might
have been originally granted under such altered conditions. A memorandum of the
same shall be endorsed on the face of the certificate of license by the holder
and attested by the City Clerk. If the holder would have been subject to a
greater fee at the date of issuance than he actually paid had the license
originally been granted to be exercised at the proposed altered location, such
alteration shall be valid only after the payment of the difference between such
two fees, prorated, however, in the same manner as provided by Section
701.07 for the original issuance of licenses. (1947 Code §17.13)
   701.14 REVOCATION, ALTERATION OR DENIAL OF LICENSE.

of the terms or conditions of the license, or of any of the provisions of
Chapter One of this Business and Taxation Code. Ten days' written notice of the
proposed revocation and the privilege of being heard in person or by counsel
shall be given the licensee. In the event the license is revoked, any fee paid

full and accurate record of all the licenses issued and fees collected by him.
He may require the services of any member of the Police Department in making
collections. The Director of the Department of Finance, with the approval of
Council, may appoint agents to collect fees required by, or to enforce in any
other respect, the provisions of Chapter One of this Business and Taxation
Code. The compensation of such agents shall be paid out of the taxes so
collected.

employment contrary to the provisions of Chapter One of this Business and
Taxation Code, whether without obtaining a license before commencing the same,
or by continuing the same after the termination of the effective period of any
such license, shall, in addition to paying the license fee, be liable to the

one, or for a period of one month or more, ten percent of such fee for each

aforesaid is for any period less than one month, ten percent of such fee for
each such period or part thereof during which he has been in default; and if

penalty. It shall be the duty of the City Clerk or other officer who issues the
certificate of license, to state therein the full amount of the tax thereof and
the penalty separately, and it shall be the duty of the officer charged with
the collection of the tax on such license to collect the full amount thereof
and the penalty.

against the persons, on account of the business and other activities, and in

gross income as set forth in Sections

   If any person liable for any tax under Section
779.03 or
779.04 ships or transports his products or any part thereof out of the City
without making sale of such products, the value of the products in the
condition or form in which they exist immediately before transportation out of

sections, except in those instances in which another measure of the tax is
expressly provided.  The Director of Finance shall follow the rules last
prescribed by the State Tax Commissioner in ascertaining such value.
   In determining value, however, as regards sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation between the buyer and seller is such that the gross proceeds from the
sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the sale,
the Director of Finance shall follow the rules last prescribed by the State Tax
Commissioner for determining the value upon which such privilege tax shall be
levied, corresponding as nearly as possible to the gross proceeds from the sale
of similar products of like quality or character where no common interest
exists between the buyer and seller, but the circumstances and conditions are
otherwise similar.
   Gross income included in the measure of the tax under Sections
779.03 and
779.04 shall neither be added nor deducted in computing the tax levied under
the other sections of this article.
   A person exercising any privilege taxable under Section
779.03 or
779.04 and engaging in the business of selling his natural resources or
manufactured products in the City shall be required to make returns of the
gross proceeds of such sales and pay the tax imposed in Section
779.05 for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling such natural
resources or manufactured products in the City.
   Manufacturers exercising any privilege taxable under Section
779.04 shall not be required to pay the tax imposed in Section
779.05 for the privilege of selling their manufactured products for delivery
outside of the City, but the gross income derived from the sale of such
manufactured products outside of the City shall be included in determining the
measure of the tax imposed on such manufacturer in Section
779.04.
   A person exercising privileges taxable under the other sections of this
article, producing coal, oil, natural gas, minerals, timber or other natural
resource products, the production of which is taxable under Section
779.03, and using or consuming the same in his business or transferring or
delivering the same as any royalty payment, in kind or the like, shall be
deemed to be engaged in the business of mining and producing coal, oil, natural
gas, minerals, timber or other natural resource products for sale, profit or
commercial use, and shall be required to make returns on account of the
production of the business showing the gross proceeds or equivalent in
accordance with uniform and equitable rules for determining the value upon
which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as possible
to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like quality or
character by other taxpayers, which rules as last prescribed by the State Tax
Commissioner shall be followed by the Director of Finance.  (Ord. 0-1052.

the article, substance, commodity or newspaper, manufactured, compounded or
prepared for sale, as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof
by the manufacturer or person compounding or preparing the same, except as
otherwise provided, multiplied by a rate of zero (0%) percent.  The measure of
this tax is the value of the entire product manufactured, compounded or
prepared in the City for sale, profit or commercial use, regardless of the
place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the
City.  The value of electricity generated by persons taxed under the provisions
of this section, which electricity is directly used by such persons in the

to others, shall be exempt from the imposition of any tax under this article. 
With respect to the manufacturing, compounding or preparing for sale of timber

receipts derived from the sale of any motor vehicle, where the purchaser of
such motor vehicle is not a resident of the State of West Virginia, and such

be made to the Director of Finance in writing upon forms prepared by the
Director.  The provisions of this exemption shall not relieve any taxpayer from

article.  It is further the legislative intent of this section that the credit
granted herein is for the purpose of providing an incentive for existing
businesses annexed into the City.

   779.15  COMPUTATION OF TAX; PAYMENT.
   The taxes levied hereunder shall be payable in quarterly installments on or

accrue.  The taxpayer shall, within one month from the expiration of each
quarter, make out a return upon a form prescribed by the Director of Finance,
showing the gross proceeds of the sale or gross income of the business, trade
or calling and compute the amount of the tax for which he is liable for such
quarter, sign and mail the same, together with a remittance in the form
required by Section
 779.22 for the amount of the tax to the office of the Director of Finance. The
Director may require return and payment under this section for other than

reason it is not practicable for the individual taxpayer to sign the same, the
signature may be that of any duly authorized agent.
(Ord. 0-1052.  Passed 1-14-03.)
   779.16  ERRONEOUS COMPUTATION.
   If the taxpayer makes any clerical error which is apparent on the face of
the return in computing the tax assessable against him, the Director of Finance
shall correct such error or reassess the proper amount of taxes, and notify the
taxpayer of his action by mailing him promptly a copy of the corrected
assessment, and any additional tax for which such taxpayer may be liable shall
be paid within fifteen days after the receipt of such statement.  If the amount
already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the basis of the tax
so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately refunded to the taxpayer
upon his request to the Director, who shall pay the refund to the taxpayer out
of any funds available for the purpose.  The taxpayer may, at his election,
apply an overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing hereunder.
(Ord. 0-604.  Passed 8-28-90.)
   779.17  ASSESSMENT OF TAX WHEN INSUFFICIENTLY RETURNED.
   If the Director of Finance believes that the tax imposed by this article is
insufficiently returned by a taxpayer, either because the taxpayer has failed
to properly remit the tax or has failed to make a return, or has made a return
which is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to
investigate and determine or estimate the tax liability of the taxpayer and
make an assessment therefor.
   The Director of Finance may, at any time before the assessment becomes
final, amend, in whole or in part, any assessment whenever the Director
ascertains that such assessment is improper or incomplete in any material
respect.
   The Director of Finance may, at any time within the period prescribed for
assessment, make a supplemental assessment whenever he ascertains that any
assessment is imperfect or incomplete in any material respect.  (Ord. 0-1052. 
Passed 1-14-03.)
   779.18  JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   If the Director of Finance believes that the collection of any tax which he
is required to administer will be jeopardized by delay, he shall thereupon make
an assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment.  The amount
assessed shall be immediately due and payable.  Unless the taxpayer against
whom a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment within twenty
days after service of notice of the jeopardy assessment, such an assessment
becomes final.
   A petition for reassessment by a person against whom a jeopardy assessment
has been made shall be accompanied by such security as the Director of Finance
believes necessary to insure compliance with this article.
(Ord. 0-604.  Passed 8-28-90.)
   779.19  NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; HEARING.

of assessment is directed shall, within thirty days after service thereof
(except in the case of jeopardy assessments), either personally or by
registered mail, file with the Director a petition in writing, verified under
oath by such taxpayer or his duly authorized agent having knowledge of the
facts, setting forth with definiteness and particularity the items of the
assessment objected to, together with the reason for such objections, such
assessments shall become and be deemed conclusive and the amount thereof shall
be payable at the end of the thirty-day period.  In every case where a petition
for reassessment as above described is filed, the Director shall assign a time
and place for the hearing of the petition and shall notify the petitioner of
such hearing by written notice at least twenty days in advance thereof, and
such hearing shall be held within sixty days from the filing of the petition
for reassessment unless continued by agreement or by the Director for good
cause.  The hearing shall be informal and may be conducted by an examiner
designated by the Director.  At the hearing, evidence may be offered to support
the assessment or to prove that it is incorrect.  After the hearing, the
Director shall, within a reasonable time, give notice in writing of the
decision.  Unless an appeal is taken within thirty days from service of this
notice, the decision of the Director shall be final.
(Ord. 0-604.  Passed 8-28-90.)
   779.20  APPEAL.
   An appeal may be taken by the taxpayer to the Circuit Court of Wood County

his determination as provided in Section
779.19.  The petition for appeal and notice thereof shall be served on the City
in the manner provided by the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure for the
service of original process.
   The appellant shall file with such Clerk of the Circuit Court a bond for the
use of the appellee, with sureties approved by the Clerk, the penalty of the
bond to be not less than the total amount of the tax and penalties appealed
from, and conditioned that the appellant performs the orders of the Court;
except that in lieu of such bond, the Director may upon proper showing find and
certify to the Clerk that the properties of the appellant subject to the liens
imposed by Sections
779.24 and
779.26 are adequate to secure the performance of the orders of the Court.
   Any discretionary decision respecting an appellant’s appeal bond made by the
Director of Finance is subject to full judicial review if an application for
such review is filed with the Circuit Court within thirty (30) days of such
decision.
   The Court shall hear the appeal upon the record made before the hearing
examiner and no additional evidence shall be taken unless otherwise required. 
The Court shall render its decree thereon and the Director shall then conform
the assessment to the decree.  An appeal may be taken by the taxpayer or the
Director to the Supreme Court of Appeals of this State.

   If any taxpayer fails to make the return required by this article, or makes
his return but fails to remit in whole or in part the proper amount of tax,
there shall be added to the amount of the tax unpaid, from the date such tax
should have been paid, a penalty in the amount of five percent (5%) of the tax
for the first month or fraction thereof of delinquency, and one percent (1%) of
the tax for each succeeding month or fraction thereof of delinquency.  However,
if such failure is due to reasonable cause, the Director of Finance may waive
or remit these penalties in whole or in part.
   If the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to evade this article, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be added an
additional penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties.
   The penalties so added shall be collected at the same time and in the same

precedent to exercising the privilege taxes, may exercise the privilege for the

enforce the lien therefor in any county in which property of the taxpayer may
be found.
   If the failure of any taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this article
has continued sixty days, the Director of Finance may proceed to obtain an
injunction restraining the taxpayer from doing business in this City until he
fully complies with the provisions of this article.
   In the event a business subject to the tax imposed by this article is

section shall withhold so much of the purchase money as will satisfy the taxes
and penalty which may be due until the former owner produces a receipt from the

purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to withhold purchase money as
above provided, and the taxes and penalty remain unpaid after expiration of the
thirty-day period allowed for payment thereof, he shall be personally liable
for the payment of all taxes, penalties and interest which may be enforced by

at least five days before the return date thereof, by either personal service
made by any person over eighteen years of age, or by registered or certified
mail, but a return receipt signed by the person to whom the subpoena or
subpoena duces tecum is directed shall be required to prove service by
registered or certified mail.  Any party requesting a subpoena or subpoena
duces tecum is responsible for service thereof and payment of any fee for such
service.  Service of other subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum shall be the
responsibility of the Director or his delegate.  Any person, except a person in

duces tecum, shall be entitled to the same fee as sheriffs who serve witness
subpoenas for the circuit courts of this State.
   (c)   Fees.  Fees for the attendance of witnesses subpoenaed shall be the
same as for witnesses before the circuit courts of this State.  All such fees
shall be paid by the Director, if the subpoena or subpoena duces tecum was
issued, without the request of an interested party, at the insistence of the
City.  All such fees related to any subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued at
the request of a party to an administrative hearing shall be paid by the party

the time specified in a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum for compliance
therewith, the circuit court of the county in which the hearing is to be held
or the circuit court of the county in which the person upon whom any such
subpoena or subpoena duces tecum was served resides, has his or its principal
place of business or is employed, or the circuit court of the county in which
any such subpoena or subpoena duces tecum was served, or the judge of any such
circuit court in vacation, may grant any relief with respect to any such
subpoena or subpoena duces tecum which any such circuit court, under the "West
Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure for Trial Courts of Record," could grant, and
for any of the same reasons, with respect to any such subpoena or subpoena
duces tecum issued from any such circuit court.
   (e)   Enforcement of Compliance.  In case of disobedience or neglect of any
subpoena or subpoena duces tecum served on any person, or the refusal of any
witness to testify to any matter regarding which he may be lawfully
interrogated, the circuit court of the county in which the hearing is being
held, or the circuit court of the county in which such person resides, has his
or its principal place of business or is employed, or the judge thereof in
vacation, upon application by the Director of Finance, shall compel obedience
by attachment proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of the
requirement of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued from such circuit
court for a refusal to testify therein.

testify under oath or affirmation.

the same as or wholly contained within the newly annexed area.
   The application shall then be given to the City Engineer, who will certify

with the work are reasonable, and insure no ineligible improvements or costs
are included in the application. The developer shall submit paid invoices,

incurred by said developer, together with a release of lien(s) affidavit.
   Upon certification of costs and acceptability, the Finance Director shall
then provide the applicant with the total dollar amount eligible for rebate.
   (b)   Amendments.  The applicant developer may request an amendment to the
original application before the completion of work contained in the original

the City Engineer that all work to be performed has been completed to City

within the newly annexed development, including taxes paid by prime and
subcontractors, shall be rebated to the developer.  If, however, the amount to

within the newly annexed area shall be collected quarterly as required in
Section
779.15, but accepting the provisions of Article

   A total of 25 percent of the taxes so collected shall be remitted to the
General Fund.
   A total of 75 percent of the taxes so collected shall be remitted to the
applicant developer until such time as the total rebate amount as determined in
subsection (a) hereof has been paid.  If the amount to be paid to the applicant
developer to meet the total rebate amount is less than 75 percent of the taxes
collected, then the applicant developer shall be eligible only for a payment in
the amount so required to meet the total approved rebate amount.
   Once the total rebate amount has been paid to the applicant developer, all
taxes collected shall be remitted to the General Fund of the City or as
otherwise directed by this article.
   The total amount rebated to a developer shall be no more than the actual
costs incurred for eligible expenses as approved by the City Engineer.  (Ord.

789.
   780.01  STATEMENT OF POLICY AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Council finds that the City of Parkersburg provides to all person in
its borders certain services, whether they be residents employed within the
City, or persons living outside the City and employed within the corporate
boundaries of the City or persons visiting within the City. Such services
include police and fire protection and traffic and street maintenance and other
valuable services associated with the police and fire departments and public
works department. Such services are within the authority and are the
responsibility of the municipal government as provided under the general laws
of the State of West Virginia and, since such services are essential to the
creation and maintenance of those jobs which provide livelihood to all person
employed within the City as well as to the property interests of residents and
visitors to the City, it is therefore, reasonable to derive a portion of the
cost of providing and maintaining such services from said individuals.
Additionally, the Council finds that an individual who is a resident and
employed within the City has a greater interest and direct benefit from such
municipal services. West Virginia Code Section 8-13-13 provides that every
municipality has the plenary power and authority to provide by ordinance for
the installation, continuance, maintenance or improvement of such services, to
make reasonable regulations with respect thereto, and to impose by ordinance
upon the users of such services reasonable rates, fees and charges to be
collected in the manner specified in the ordinance.
   (b)   Council further finds that all of those who actually use, enjoy and
benefit from these services should bear an equitable share of the cost thereof.
Council acknowledges that the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has
recognized that no system of assessing the cost to all users will be absolutely
perfect, and that municipalities are only required to install a reasonable
system of distributing the costs to all of the users that it can reach through
a reasonable and prudent means and legislation.
   (c)   Council further acknowledges that the Legislature of the State of West
Virginia has conferred upon municipalities that plenary power to enact
reasonable administrative provisions to ensure the efficient, orderly and
equitable, implementation and collection of the service fees from all possible
users.
   (d)   Council further finds that it has determined that it is in the best
interests of the citizens of the City of Parkersburg and the users of all City
services to enact this Article to impose a city service user fee.
   (e)   Council further finds that there are thousands of person who use and
benefit from municipal services who are not owners of property or residents of
the City of Parkersburg, but who are employed within the City.
   (f)   Council further finds that employers located within the City of
Parkersburg possess important employment information necessary to properly
enforce certain aspects and provisions of the Article. Therefore, reasonable
regulations concerning obtaining certain information from such employers shall
be a necessary and important part of the administration of the City service
user fee.  (Ord. 0-1382.  Passed 1-11-11.)

the floor or roof next above, excluding basements and attics.
   (b)    "Basement" means that portion of a building which is located below

   (e)   “Owner(s)” shall include any part owner, joint owner, tenant in
common, tenant in partnership, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety of the
whole or of a part of the subject real property, and as listed on the land
records in the office of the Clerk of Wood County, West Virginia.
      (Ord. 0-1129.  Passed 5-25-04.)
   781.02  CONTINUATION, MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF FIRE SERVICE.
   The service of fire protection shall be continued, maintained and improved
by the City, in part, at the charge and expense of the owners of all buildings
of every kind and nature within the City, which such owners are declared to be
users and beneficiaries of such fire protection service. The charges and
expenses with respect to each of such users and beneficiaries shall be imposed,
assessed and collected as set out in this article.
(Ord. 0-234. Passed 7-26-83.)
   781.03  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The imposition of fire protection fees under this article is pursuant to
authorization set forth in W. Va. Code 8-13-13. In accordance with such
statute, it is the legislative intent of this article that the fees imposed
hereunder are based, in part, upon recognition of the following legislative
findings:
   (a)    The size of a building, as reflected by the total square feet, is a
factor which affects the cost of providing fire protection. Therefore, it is
the intent and purpose of this article that the fees imposed hereunder be
related, in part, to the size of a building.
   (b)    The number of stories contained in a structure is a factor which
affects the cost of providing fire protection. In order to provide fire
protection for buildings which contain more than two stories, the City has
acquired, at substantial expense, equipment to enable it to provide effective
fire protection to such buildings. It is therefore the intent and purpose of
this article that the owners of buildings who directly benefit from the fire
protection provided through such special equipment be charged additional fees
to defray the cost of such equipment. (Ord. 0-234. Passed 7-26-83.)
   781.04  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or subsection of this article be declared invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such ruling shall not
affect the validity of any other section or subsection, and in such event this
article should be interpreted and applied as if the invalid or unenforceable
section were not in existence. Accordingly, each section and subsection of this
article is severable. (Ord. 0-234. Passed 7-26-83.)

in the City containing three or more stories an additional annual fire
protection fee for each fiscal  year, the sum of one hundred eighty-five
dollars and twenty-five cents ($185.25) for the third story and each  story in

   (d)   An owner may request an adjustment to the determination of the
Director of Finance of the number of square feet in a building by submitting
such request in writing.  The Director of Finance may, in his or her
discretion, make such adjustments in the assessment due to an erroneous billing
or a bona fide adjustment in square footage due to a change in condition or
erroneous measurement as may be fair and equitable.
(Ord. 0-799.  Passed 3-26-96.)
   (e)   In the event it is necessary for the Fire Department to extinguish a
fire, clean up or dispose of any debris or any hazardous or toxic material or
abate any other non-medical emergency on or about a motor vehicle, the Director
of Finance shall impose and assess upon the individual or individuals cited or
otherwise determined to be responsible for such emergency a fee of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00), which fee shall be payable to the City of Parkersburg
within a time and period to be fixed by the Director.  In any case where such
responsibility is undetermined, said fee shall be equally apportioned among the
owners or operators of any and all motor vehicles involved in the occurrence.

for the use of any special or disposable equipment or materials necessary to

are collected, into the General Fund of the City, however, all such monies
shall be used exclusively for the training and education of members of the Fire
Department.

   781.06  ARTICLE TO BE ADMINISTERED BY DIRECTOR OF FINANCE.

event the total revenues derived from this article exceed the total
expenditures of the Parkersburg Fire Department for any fiscal year the City
shall rebate the difference between the revenues derived and expenditures to
the owners who paid such fees on a pro-rata basis.  Such rebate may either be
given by refund within ninety days at the end of the fiscal year, or credited
to the accounts of such owners for fire protection fees for the succeeding
fiscal year.  (Ord. 0-234.  Passed 7-26-83.)
   781.09  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   The City may seek to collect delinquent fire fees imposed by this article as
provided by West Virginia law.  Provided, however, that no action may be
commenced against an owner for any collection of a fire fee under this article

and institutional premises due to a higher incidence of criminal activity
pertaining to the same and therefore requires more surveillance and general
police protection.

incidence of criminal activity therefore requiring less surveillance and

922.04  GENERAL CRITERIA.
   (a)    All existing, proposed, or remodeled food service facilities
discharging to the Parkersburg Utility Board’s POTW shall be required to
install, at the owner’s expense, an approved and properly maintained FOG
interceptor system.
   (b)   Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals, lavatories, etc. shall not
be discharged into the FOG interceptor system. These flows shall be conveyed
separately to the sanitary sewer lateral and shall not be connected prior to
the FOG interceptor.
   (c)    Solid food waste products, unused portions or scraps, are not
intended for treatment by the POTW and should be disposed of through standard
solid waste/garbage disposal means to a landfill by means of a trash hauler.
   (d)    Garbage Grinders shall not discharge to a FOG interceptor. Solids
collect in the bottom of the interceptor and decrease capacity and contribute
to maintenance issues.
   (e)    Produce preparation sinks shall not discharge into the FOG
interceptor system.
   (f)    Commercial dishwashers are not recommended to be connected to the
grease trap. Dishwasher discharge can melt grease and allow it to pass through
an undersized grease trap. If the dishwasher must be connected to the FOG
interceptor, the interceptor must be sized accordingly to allow sufficient
detention time for the water to cool and the grease to separate before
discharging to the POTW.
   (g)    Preflush or prescraping sinks that serve commercial dishwashing
machines must be connected to a FOG interceptor provided that no grinder is
used in these sinks.
   (h)   Yellow Grease shall not be discharged to a grease interceptor or the
sanitary sewer collection system. This material is not intended for treatment
by the POTW and disposal or recycling of this material should be arranged by
the food service establishment.
(Ord. 1395.  Passed 6-14-11.)
922.05  DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   FOG interceptors/traps shall be constructed in accordance with all
applicable standards of the control authority, State of WV, and EPA.

made at the user’s expense. Notice of any maintenance or repairs shall be
submitted to the control authority at the conclusion of the event (cleaning,
pumping or equipment repair).
   (d)    Pumping/cleaning frequency shall be performed when the total volume
of captured grease and solid material displaces more than twenty-five percent
(25%) of the total volume of the unit or once every six months, or as
determined by the control authority, to prevent pass-through of grease into the
sanitary sewer system.
   (e)    All waste removed from the interceptor must be disposed of at a
facility approved to accept such material in accordance with State and Federal
regulations. All waste material must be tracked with a manifest, which confirms

correction by the time of the second re-inspection, the Parkersburg Utility
Board will inform the Owner by letter, that the water service to the Owner's
premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five (5) days. In the
event that the Owner informs the Parkersburg Utility Board of extenuating
circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension, may
be granted by the Parkersburg Utility Board, but in no case will it exceed an
additional thirty (30) days.
         E.   If the Parkersburg Utility Board Determines at any time that a
serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be
terminated immediately.
         F.   The Parkersburg Utility Board will begin initial premise
inspections to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards. Initial
focus will be on high hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (2)   Owner.
         A.   The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection
of all cross-connections on his premises.
         B.   The Owner, after having been informed by a letter from the
Parkersburg Utility Board, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test,
or have tested, any and all backflow preventers on his premise.
         C.   The Owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer
which is revealed by periodic testing.
         D.   The Owner shall inform the Parkersburg Utility Board of any
proposed or modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections
of which the Owner is aware, but have not been found by the Parkersburg Utility
Board.
         E.   The Owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow
preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass.
Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply
additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
         F.   The Owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved
by the Parkersburg Utility Board.
         G.   The Owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
Parkersburg Utility Board or the WVBPH.
         H.   Any Owner having a private well or other private water source
must have approval of the Parkersburg Utility Board and the WVBPH if the well
or source is cross connected to the Parkersburg Utility Board's system.
Permission to cross-connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to install
a backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is
maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the Parkersburg Utility
Board's system.
         I.   In the event the Owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Parkersburg Utility Board's side of the
backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer
installed.
         J.   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the
device fails to operate correctly, and second re- inspections for non-
compliance with Parkersburg Utility Board or WVBPH requirements.
   (g)   Degree of Hazard.  The Parkersburg Utility Board recognizes the threat
to the public water system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be
classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved
backflow prevention device(s).
   (h)   Existing In-Use Backflow Prevention Devices.  Any existing backflow
preventer shall be allowed by the Parkersburg Utility Board to continue in
service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness
of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the
public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a
residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing
backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or
a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no
backflow device is present.
   (i)   Periodic Testing.
      (1)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
      (2)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester.
This testing will be done at the owner's expense. The Owner shall notify the
Parkersburg Utility Board of the date and time of the test. The Parkersburg
Utility Board has the option of being present during all device testing.
      (3)   The Owner shall provide the Parkersburg Utility Board with the
results of all tests performed on the backflow prevention device(s) installed
at the Owner's premises. Owner shall also provide the identity of the tester
and a copy of the certification of said tester.
      (4)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair
the device will be retested at owner's expense to insure correct operation.
High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the
backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the test
date will be established. The Owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two (2) devices is an
effective means of the Owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the Owner desires
such continuity.
      (5)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in (i)(1) above, in cases where there is a history of test failures
and the Parkersburg Utility Board feels that due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be
borne by the owner.
   (j)   Records.  The Parkersburg Utility Board will initiate and maintain the
following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections;
      (2)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections;
      (3)   Copies of all correspondence with the WVBPH relating to backflow
prevention/cross-connection.
   Upon request, the Parkersburg Utility Board will submit records of
inspections, surveys, tests or corrective actions to the West Virginia Bureau
of Public Health.

there is (or may be) a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which
commenced after the publication of proposed Pretreatment Standards under
section 307(c) of the Act that will be applicable to such source if such
Standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section, provided
that:
            1.   The building, structure, facility, or installation is
constructed at a site at which no other source is located; or
            2.   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally
replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of
pollutants at an Existing Source; or
            3.   The production or wastewater generating processes of the
building, structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of
an Existing Source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the Existing Source, should
be considered.
         B.   Construction on a site at which an Existing Source is located
results in a modification rather than a New Source if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the
criteria of subsections (d)(27)A.2. or 3. above but otherwise alters, replaces,
or adds to existing process or production equipment.
         C.   Construction of a New Source as defined under this paragraph has
commenced if the owner or operator has:

properties in wastewater prior to, or in lieu of, introducing such pollutants
into the POTW. This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical,
chemical, or biological processes; by process changes; or by other means,
except by diluting the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an
applicable Pretreatment Standard.
      (35)   Pretreatment Requirements. Any substantive or procedural
requirement related to pretreatment imposed on a User, other than a
Pretreatment Standard.
      (36)   Pretreatment Standards or Standards. Pretreatment Standards shall
mean prohibited discharge standards, categorical Pretreatment Standards, and

            3.   Is designated as such by the Parkersburg Utility Board on the
basis that it has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW’s
operation or for violating any Pretreatment Standard or Requirement.
         C.   The Utility Board may determine that an Industrial User subject
to categorical Pretreatment Standards is a Non-Significant Categorical
Industrial User rather than a Significant Industrial User on a finding that the
Industrial User never discharges more than 100 gallons per day (gpd) of total
categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler

   (b)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.  Users must comply with
the categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N,
Parts 405–471.
      (1)   Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
PUB may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with
subsections (b)(5) and (6).
      (2)   When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the PUB
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users.
      (3)   When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the PUB shall impose
an alternate limit.
      (4)   Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in this subsection (b) in lieu of the
promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived.
      (5)   Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
      (6)   Any Industrial User operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
Standard shall notify the PUB within two (2) business days after the User has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying the PUB of such
anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in
its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average
production rate.
   (c)   State Pretreatment Standards.  Users must comply with State
Pretreatment Standards codified at Title 47 Series 10 of the State of West
Virginia Legislative Rules.
   (d)   Local Limits.

Xylene          2.40            2.40
 
   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to
the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless
indicated otherwise. The
PUB may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based
limitations above.
      (3)   The PUB may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs), by ordinance
or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement
Local Limits and the requirements of Section
925.02(a).
   (e)   Parkersburg Utility Board’s Right of Revision.  The Parkersburg
Utility Board reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits or in general permits, more stringent Standards or
Requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this

any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The
PUB may impose mass limitations on Users who are using dilution to meet
applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 1396.  Passed 6-14-11; Ord. 0-1502.  Passed 1-13-15.)
925.03  PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (a)   Pretreatment Facilities.  Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical Pretreatment Standards, Local Limits, and the prohibitions set out
in Section
 925.02(a) within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the PUB,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the User’s expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
PUB for review, and shall be acceptable to the PUB before such facilities are
constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the PUB under the provisions of
this article.
   (b)   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the PUB may require Users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
User’s compliance with the requirements of this article.
      (2)   The PUB may require any person discharging into the POTW to install
and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and
flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when in the
opinion of the PUB they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the PUB and shall comply with
the City’s Fats, Oils and Grease (FOG) ordinance , and shall be so located to
be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned, and repaired in accordance with the City’s FOG Management
ordinance by the User at their expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (c)   Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plans.  The Parkersburg
Utility Board shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/
slug discharge control plan or other action to control Slug Discharges. The PUB
may require any User to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan
or take such other action that may be necessary to control Slug Discharges.
Alternatively, the PUB may develop such a plan for any User. An accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the PUB of any accidental or
Slug Discharge, as required by Section
925.06(f); and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug
Discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (d)   Hauled Wastewater.
      (1)   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the PUB, and at such times as are established by the PUB. Such
waste shall not violate Section
925.02 or any other requirements established by the Utility Board.

analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
Discharges to the POTW.
         C.   Compliance Certification. A statement, reviewed by the User’s
Authorized Representative as defined in Section
925.01(d)(3) and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
         D.   Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule by which
the User will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance

apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (a)(2)D.:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the User to meet the
applicable Pretreatment Standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
      (3)   The User shall submit a progress report to the Board no later than
fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the User to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Board.
   (c)   Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline.  Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with

following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
User subject to such Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to
the Board a report containing the information described in Section
925.04(e)(1)F. and G. and subsection (a)(2)B. hereof.  For Users subject to
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in Section
925.02(b) this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User’s long-
term production rate. For all other Users subject to categorical Pretreatment
Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
User’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (m)(1). All
sampling will be done in conformance with subsection (j) hereof.
   (d)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   All Significant Industrial Users must, at a frequency determined by
the Board submit no less than twice per year (June and December) reports
indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are
limited by Pretreatment Standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the Pretreatment
Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the User must submit documentation required by the
Board or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status
of the User.
      (2)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with subsection (m)(1) hereof.
      (3)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User’s
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (4)   If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Board, using the procedures prescribed in
subsection (j) hereof, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
   (e)   Reports of Changed Conditions.  Each User must notify the Board of any
significant changes to the User’s operations or system which might alter the
nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least fourteen (14) days before
the change.
      (1)   The Board may require the User to submit such information as may be
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of
a wastewater discharge permit application under Section
1325.04(e).
      (2)   The Board may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or
modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section
1325.05(c) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
   (f)   Reports of Potential Problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately telephone and
notify the PUB of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the User.
      (2)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall,
unless waived by the PUB, submit a detailed written report describing the cause
(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the User’s bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (f)(1) above.  Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the PUB
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug
Discharge.
   (g)   Reports from Unpermitted Users.  All Users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit provide appropriate reports to the PUB
as the PUB may require.
   (h)   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting.  If sampling
performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the PUB within
twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the PUB within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation.
Resampling by the Industrial User is not required if the PUB performs sampling
at the User’s facility at least once a month, or if the PUB performs sampling
at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the
time when the User or the PUB receives the results of this sampling, or if the
PUB has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User.
   (i)   Analytical Requirements.  All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the PUB or other parties approved by EPA.
   (j)   Sample Collection.  Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   Except as indicated in subsection (j)(2) and (3) below, the User
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the PUB. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the PUB the samples must be representative of
the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified
in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited
in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the PUB, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the PUB may authorize a lower
minimum.
   (k)   Date of Receipt of Reports.  Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (l)   Recordkeeping.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this article, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under
Section
925.02(d)(3). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User
or the PUB or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the PUB.
   (m)   Certification Statements.
      (1)   Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports and Initial
Monitoring Waiver.  The following certification statement is required to be
signed and submitted by Users submitting permit applications; Users submitting
baseline monitoring reports under subsection (a)(2)E.; Users submitting reports
on compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines under
subsection (c) hereof; Users submitting periodic compliance reports required by
subsection (d)(1)-(3), and Users submitting an initial request to forego
sampling of a pollutant on the basis of subsection (d)(2)D. hereof. The
following certification statement must be signed by an Authorized
Representative as defined in Section
925.01(d)(3):
      I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations.
      (2)   Annual Certification for Non-Significant Categorical Industrial
Users.  A facility determined to be a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial
User by the PUB  must annually submit the following certification statement
signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in Section
925.01(d)(3). This certification must accompany an alternative report required
by the PUB:
   Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR
____, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the
period from __________, ________ to ________, ________ [months, days, year]:
         (a)    The facility described as ____________________ [facility name]
met the definition of a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User as
described in Section
925.01(d)(41)C.;
         (b)    The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment
Standards and requirements during this reporting period; and (c) the facility

925.07  COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (a)   Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling.  PUB shall have the right to
enter the premises of any User to determine whether the User is complying with
all requirements of this article and any individual wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow PUB ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a User has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the User shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the PUB shall be permitted to enter without delay
for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The PUB shall have the right to set up on the User’s property, or
require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/
or metering of the User’s operations.
      (3)   The PUB may require the User to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the User at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
User at the written or verbal request of the PUB and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be born by the User.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the PUB access to the User’s
premises shall be a violation of this article.
   (b)   Search Warrants.  If the PUB has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the PUB designed to verify compliance with this
ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, the PUB may seek issuance
of a search warrant.
(Ord. 1394.  Passed 6-14-11.)
925.08  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a User obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the PUB’s inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the User
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
PUB, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes,
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
User furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not
be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public
without restriction.  (Ord. 1396.  Passed 6-14-11.)
925.09  PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The PUB shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW,
a list of the Users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months,
were in Significant Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements. The term Significant Noncompliance shall be applicable to all
Significant Industrial Users (or any other Industrial User that violates
paragraphs (C), (D) or (H) of this Section) and shall mean:
   (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken

      (Ord. 1396.  Passed 6-14-11.)
925.10  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Notification of Violation.  When the PUB finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the PUB may serve upon that User a
written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of such
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the User to the PUB. Submission of such a plan in no way
relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the
authority of the PUB to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
   (b)   Consent Orders.  The PUB may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to
be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) hereof
and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing.  The PUB may order a User which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement, to appear before the PUB and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any Authorized Representative of the User as defined in Section
925.01(d)(3). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the User.
   (d)   Compliance Orders.  When the PUB finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement, the PUB may issue an order to the User responsible for the
discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified time.
If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
   (e)   Cease and Desist Orders.  When the PUB finds that a User has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User’s past violations are
likely to recur, the PUB may issue an order to the User directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the User to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
   (f)   Administrative Fines.
      (1)   When the PUB finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, the PUB may fine such User in an amount not to exceed two hundred
dollars ($200.00), per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-
violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
      (2)   A lien against the User’s property shall be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
      (3)   The PUB may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   (g)   Emergency Suspensions.
      (1)   The PUB may immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after informal
notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The PUB may
also immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
         A.    Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the PUB
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals.
         B.    A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the PUB prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under Sections
925.10(c).
      (2)   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any Emergency Suspension under this Section.
   (h)   Termination of Discharge.
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in Section
925.05(d), any User who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
         A.    Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         B.    Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         C.    Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
         D.    Refusal of reasonable access to the User’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
         E.    Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section
925.02.
      (2)   Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
925.02 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the PUB shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the User.
   (i)   Legal Action.  If any person violates any provision of this article,
any Federal or State Pretreatment Requirements, or any order of the Board, the
Board Attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal relief in any court
of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 1396.  Passed 6-14-11.)
925.11  JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Injunctive Relief.  When the PUB finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement, the PUB may petition for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the User. The PUB may
also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
   (b)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be liable to
the PUB for a maximum civil penalty of not less than $1,000 per violation, per
day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The PUB may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the PUB.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the User’s violation, corrective
actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
   (c)   Criminal Prosecution.
      (1)   A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than
one thousand ($1,000) dollars per violation, per day.
      (2)   A User who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
two thousand five hundred ($2,500) dollars. This penalty shall be in addition
to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available
under State law.
      (3)   A User who knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this ordinance,
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who
falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device
or method required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished by
a fine of not more than ten thousand ($10,000) dollars per violation, per day.
         (Ord. 1396.  Passed 6-14-11.)
925.12  SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (a)   Payment of Outstanding Fees and Penalties.  The PUB may decline to
issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any User who has
failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of
any provision of this article, a previous individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder.
   (b)   Water Supply Severance.  Whenever a User has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, water service to the User may be severed. Service will recommence,
at the User’s expense, only after the User has satisfactorily demonstrated its
ability to comply.
(Ord. 1396.  Passed 6-14-11.)
925.13  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section,
      (1)    Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a User’s treatment facility.
      (2)    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (b)   Bypass Notifications.
      (1)    If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the PUB, at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)    A User shall submit oral notice to the PUB of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twenty-four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The PUB may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
   (c)   Bypass.
      (1)    Bypass is prohibited, and the PUB may take an enforcement action
against a User for a bypass, unless
         A.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         C.   The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (b) of
this section.
      (2)   The PUB may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the PUB determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

SECTION 2
SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN CASES WHERE SURFACE DRAINAGE IS CONNECTED TO
THE SYSTEM
APPLICABILITY
Wherever the Utility Board has discovered that a customer's roof drain, down
spout, storm sewer or other similar facilities conducting surface water have
been connected to the sanitary sewer system, and such customer has failed to
take appropriate action within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the
Utility Board, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public
Service Commission, to eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed
upon the customer calculated on the basis of the following formula:
S = A x R x .006233 x C
   S -    The surcharge in dollars
   A -    The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection
surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet
   R -    The measured monthly rainfall in inches, as measured at the WWTP
   .006233 -    The conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface to a thousand gallons of water
   C -    The approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water usage
The Utility Board shall not impose the surcharge unless, and until, the
customer has been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
hand delivery, that it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing,
sewer camera inspection or on-site inspection that rain or other surface water
is being introduced into the sanitary sewer system at the customer's location,
and that the customer has not acted within thirty (30) days from the receipt of
such notice to divert the water from the sanitary sewer system.
Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia.
   (Ord. 0-1469.  Passed 2-25-14.)
   927.02  SANITARY BOARD MAY REQUIRE INSTALLATION OF METERS,  SPECIAL RATES OR
TREATMENT OF WASTES.
   In the event a building or premises discharging sewage, water or other
liquid wastes into the City sanitary sewer system uses water supplied on other
than a metered basis of either a private or public water supply, the owner of
such building or premises shall install a meter or other measuring device,
approved by the Sanitary Board.
   Where users of such sewer system use water in excess of 30,000 gallons per
quarter and maintain independently a separate meter which measures the amount
of water supplied a particular premises and not discharged into such sewer
system, the hereinafter established tariff of rates or charges shall be applied
only to the metered amount of water supplied the premises and discharged into
the system.
   Where sewage, water or other liquid wastes are discharged into sanitary
sewers of any building or premises and the same is determined by the Board to
contain unduly high concentrations of any substances which add to the operating
costs of the sewage system, the owner or other interested party shall specially
treat such sewage water or other liquid wastes before it is discharged into the
City sanitary system.
(Ord.  0-109.  Passed 6-9-81.)
   927.03  COLLECTION OF CHARGES.
   All charges provided by this article shall be billed and collected as
hereinafter provided and the receipts therefrom paid over and delivered to the
Sanitary Board.
   All bills shall be due when mailed to the last known address of the party
owing same.  Each bill shall be a debt due the City and the amount thereof and
charges evidenced thereby, if not paid when due, shall constitute a lien upon
the premises served by the municipal sewage system, and if the bill is not paid
within thirty days after the same is due, it shall be deemed delinquent and the
amount thereof, together with a penalty of ten percent (10%) and a reasonable
attorney’s fee, shall be recovered by the Sanitary Board of the City in a civil
action in the name of the City, and the lien procured in connection with any
such action shall be foreclosed in due course against the lot, parcel of land
or building charged with the amount due, in accordance with the laws relating
thereto.
   No allowance or adjustment of any sewer charge shall be made for any leaks
of any nature occurring on the user’s side of the water meter.

   The rates or charges specified in Section
927.01 shall be billed to the owners of each and every lot, parcel of real
estate or building connected with, served by, or using such sewage system,
provided, that upon application by the tenant of any premises who is not the
owner, filed with the Sanitary Board of the City and accompanied by appropriate
security or indemnity in an amount and of a kind approved by the Sanitary
Board, such bills may be rendered to the tenant.  However, the rendering of a
bill to a tenant who is not the owner of the premises shall not affect or
impair the lien of the amount of such bill on such premises, nor shall such
rendition affect or impair the right of the City to foreclose such lien in the
event any such bill becomes delinquent as provided in Section
927.03. 
(Ord. 19791.  Passed 1-18-55.)
   927.05  SEWER CHARGES BILLED WITH WATER CHARGES;  DISCONTINUATION OF
SERVICES FOR NONPAYMENT.
   Charges for sewer services shall be billed jointly with charges made for
water services to the respective premises and payment of such charges for sewer
services shall be required by each customer at the same time as the payment for
water services.  To the full extent permitted by law the City shall, under
reasonable rules and regulations, shut off and discontinue the supply of the
services and facilities of the sewer system and water services to any customer
for delinquent payment for the services and facilities, and the City will not
restore such services and facilities until all such delinquent charges together
with interest and reasonable penalties have been paid in full.  (Ord. 19791.

section, Council shall direct the City Clerk to cause to be published a notice
which shall name and describe the location of the lot upon which such work has
been done, and give the name of the owner thereof.  If the name of the owner is

may be identified.  The notice shall state the amount assessed against the lot
for the cost of the work and shall cite the owner thereof to appear before
Council within thirty days of the first publication of the notice to show
cause, if any, why such assessment should not be final.  The notice shall be
published once a week for two successive weeks in one or more newspapers of
general circulation published in the City.  Thereupon, proceedings shall be the
same as are provided in the case of assessments for paving and sewers.

1303.01  PURPOSE AND GOALS.
   (a)   The general purpose of a comprehensive plan is to guide a governing
body to accomplish a coordinated and compatible development of land and
improvements within its territorial jurisdiction, in accordance with present
and future needs and resources.
   A comprehensive plan is a process through which citizen participation and
thorough analysis are used to develop a set of strategies that establish as
clearly and practically as possible the best and most appropriate future
development of the area under the jurisdiction of the planning commission.  A
comprehensive plan aids the planning commission in designing and recommending
to the governing body ordinances that result in preserving and enhancing the
unique quality of life and culture in the City and in adapting to future
changes of use of an economic physical or social nature.  A comprehensive plan
guides the planning commission in the performance of its duties to help achieve
sound planning.
   A comprehensive plan must promote the health, safety, morals, order,
convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the inhabitants, as well as
efficiency and economy in the process of development. 
   (b)   The purpose of a comprehensive plan is to:
      (1)   Set goals and objectives for land development, uses and suitability
for the governing body, so a governing body can make an informed decision;
      (2)   Ensure that the elements in the comprehensive plan are consistent;
      (3)   Coordinate all governing bodies, units of government and other
planning commissions to ensure that all comprehensive plans and future
development are consistent;
      (4)   Create conditions favorable to health, safety, mobility,
transportation, prosperity, civic activities, recreational, educational,
cultural opportunities and historic resources;
      (5)   Reduce the wastes of physical, financial, natural or human
resources which result from haphazard development, congestion or scattering of
population;
      (6)   Reduce the destruction or demolition of historic sites and other
resources by reusing land and buildings and revitalizing areas;
      (7)   Promote a sense of community, character and identity;
      (8)   Promote the efficient utilization of natural resources, rural land,
agricultural land and scenic areas;
      (9)   Focus development in existing developed areas and fill in vacant or
underused land near exiting developed areas to create well designed and
coordinated communities; and
      (10)   Promote cost-effective development of community facilities and
services.  A comprehensive plan may provide for innovative land use management
techniques, including:
         A.   Density bonuses and/or density transfer;
         B.   Clustering;
         C.   Design guidelines, including planned unit developments;
         D.   Conservation easements;
         E.   Infill development;
         F.   Consolidation of services; and
         G.   Any other innovative land use technique that will promote the
governing body's development plans. 
            (Ord. 0-1343.  Passed 5-12-09.)
1303.02  STUDY GUIDELINES.
   (a)   When preparing or amending a comprehensive plan, the Planning
Commission shall make comprehensive surveys and studies of the existing
conditions and services and probable future changes of such conditions and
services within the territory under its jurisdiction.
   (b)   The comprehensive surveys and studies may cover such factors as
population density, health, general welfare, historic sites, mobility,
transportation, food supply, education, water and sanitation requirements,
public services, accessibility for the disabled and future potential for
residential, commercial, industrial or public use.
   (c)   The major objective of the planning process is providing information
to and coordination among divergent elements in the municipality.  The elements
in the comprehensive plan shall be consistent and governing bodies, units of
government and planning commissions must work together to ensure that
comprehensive plans and future development are compatible.
(Ord. 0-1343.  Passed 5-12-09.)
1303.03  AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall prepare a comprehensive plan for the
development of land within its jurisdiction.  The Planning Commission shall
then recommend the comprehensive plan to City Council for adoption.
   (b)   The comprehensive plan shall not be considered a comprehensive plan
without the consent of the Planning Commission and City Council.
   (c)   A comprehensive plan should be coordinated with the plans of the
department of transportation, insofar as it relates to highways, thoroughfares,

         (Ord. 0-129. Passed 9-8-81.)
   1307.07  MODIFICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)    The general principles of design and minimum requirements for the
laying out of subdivisions, set forth in Article
1309, may be varied by the City Development Department in the case of a
subdivision large enough to constitute a more or less self-contained
neighborhood which is to be developed in accordance with a comprehensive plan
safeguarded by appropriate restrictions, and which, in the judgment of the
Department, makes adequate provision for all essential community requirements,
provided, however, that no modification shall be granted by the Department
which would conflict with the proposals of the official Thoroughfare Plan or
with the other features of the Comprehensive Plan of Parkersburg and environs,
or with the intent and purposes of the general principles of design and minimum
requirements.
   (b)    Those divisions of land which are excluded from the definition of
"Subdivision", and which are set forth in
1307.02(a) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Parkersburg, are exempt
from the procedural requirements of Article
1307 of the Codified Ordinances regarding plat approval for "Subdivisions".
However, such divisions of land are subject to review and approval for plat
recording by the Planning Commission staff and must conform to the applicable
regulation of Article
1307 and Article
1309 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Parkersburg.
   (c)    In any particular case where the subdivider can show that, by reason
of exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, strict compliance with
any requirement of these Subdivision Regulations would cause unusual difficulty
or exceptional and undue hardship, the Department may relax such requirement to
the extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or
hardship; provided that such relief may be granted without detriment to the
public good and without impairing the intent and purposes of these Subdivision
Regulations or the desirable general development of the neighborhood and the
community in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and the Zoning Ordinance of
Parkersburg and environs. Any modification thus granted shall be entered in the
minutes of the Department setting forth the reasons which, in the opinion of
the Department, justified the modification.

   1309.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   In laying out a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the general
principles and requirements as provided in this Article
1309.
   (a)    The layout shall conform to the official Thoroughfare Plan and other
parts of the adopted Comprehensive Plan of Parkersburg and environs.
      (1)    Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a highway,
primary or secondary thoroughfare or parkway, so designated on the Thoroughfare
Plan, such part of such public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the
location and at the width indicated on the Plan.
      (2)    Where a proposed park, playground or other recreational area,
proposed school site or other public ground, under the adopted Comprehensive
Plan of Parkersburg and environs, is located in whole or in part within the
proposed subdivision, such proposed public ground or part, if not dedicated to
the City or the Wood County Board of Education, shall be reserved for a period
of not less than two years from the date of final approval of the final plat by
the City Development Department, for acquisition by the City or Board of
Education by purchase or otherwise.
   (b)    Where held appropriate by the Department, open spaces suitably
located and of adequate size for parks, playgrounds or other recreational

the deeds and maintained by the property owners.
      (Ord. A-1090. Passed 4-4-67; Ord. A-3165. Passed 3-23-76.)
   1309.02  STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
   (a)    Flatland Subdivisions. The following requirements are applicable to
all flatland subdivisions within the jurisdiction of the City Development
Department.
      (1)    The street layout shall be in general conformity with a plan for
the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and the entire
neighborhood.
      (2)    The street layout shall provide access to all lots and parcels of
land within the subdivision.
      (3)    Where appropriate to the design, streets shall be established to
avoid jogs at intersections and to promote continuity of local streets and
those of higher classification.
      (4)    Streets shall be established to take advantage of the contour of
the land so as to produce useable lots, cause a minimum of cutting and filling,
and to produce streets with reasonable grades as defined in Section
1309.05(a).
      (5)    Certain proposed streets, where appropriate, shall be extended to
the boundary line of the tract to provide for adequate circulation of traffic
within the vicinity of the tract.
      (6)    Streets shall intersect other streets as near to a ninety degree
angle as topography and other factors permit. Intersections of streets with
arterial or collector streets shall be limited to a minimum angle of seventy
degrees unless specifically approved by the Department.
      (7)    Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street
or alley adjacent to the proposed subdivision which conforms to the
Thoroughfare Plan, the remainder of the street or alley shall be platted to the
prescribed width within the proposed subdivision.
      (8)    Street and right-of-way widths shall conform to those indicated in
the Thoroughfare Plan. Where such widths are not prescribed therein, the widths
shall not be less than the minimums stated in Sections
 1309.03 and
1309.04.
      (9)    Alleys shall be platted in the rear of all lots to be used for
business and in the rear of residential lots fronting on arterial or collector
streets as a means of safe access thereto. Alleys will not be approved in other
locations in residential areas, unless required by unusual topography or other
exceptional conditions .
      (10)    Lands abutting arterial or collector streets shall be platted
with the view of making the lots, if for residential use, desirable for such
use by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic on such trafficways, and with the
view also of minimizing interference with traffic on such trafficways as well
as the accident hazard. This may be accomplished in several ways:
         A.    By platting the lots abutting such trafficways at very generous
depth, with setbacks or front yards at least twenty feet greater or deeper than
otherwise required; and providing vehicular access to them by means of either
alleys or service drives in the rear, or frontage access roads next to the
trafficway, connected therewith at infrequent intervals;
         B.    By not fronting the lots on the highway or thoroughfare but on a
parallel local street at a distance of a generous lot depth, in which case
private driveways shall connect with such local street;
         C.    By a collector streets platted more or less parallel with the
highway or thoroughfare, 600 to 1,000 feet distant therefrom, from which loop
streets or dead-end streets would extend toward the highway, the ends of which
provide access to the lots abutting the highway to their rear.
      (11)    Dead-end streets are often desirable and will be approved if
limited to 1,000 feet long and twenty platted lots fronting thereon.
      (12)    Closed subdivisions, with one exit, shall be limited to 100
dwelling units if the entrance or exit street grade exceeds a rise of twenty
feet in 200 feet; and shall be limited to 200 dwelling units if the street
grade is less. When these limits are exceeded, a second exit must be provided
which conforms to the street grade requirements of Section
1309.05.
      (13)    Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of
lots of appropriate depth, unless, in the opinion of the Department, this is
prevented by unusual topography or other physical conditions.
      (14)    The length of blocks shall be such as are appropriate, in the
opinion of the Department, for the locality and type development contemplated,
but shall not exceed 1,800 feet where the average lot size does not exceed two
acres in area.
      (15)    In any block over 900 feet in length, the Department, may require
that a crosswalk or pedestrian way, not less than ten feet wide, be provided
near the center and entirely across the block.
      (16)    The number of intersecting streets along arterial and collector
streets shall be held to a minimum, and where practicable, blocks along such
trafficways shall not be less than 1,200 feet in length.
   (b)    Hillside Subdivisions. The following requirements are applicable to
all hillside subdivisions within the jurisdiction of the Department:
      (1)    The following requirements of subsection (a) hereof for flatland
subdivisions are applicable to hillside subdivisions:
1309.02(a)(1), (3), (5) to (7) and (16).
      (2)    The Department may, at its discretion, modify the following
requirements of subsection (a) hereof for flatland subdivisions where they are
to be applied to hillside subdivisions:
1309.02(a)(2) - see Note A following this subsection (b), (a)(9), (10) and (13)
to (15).
      (3)    Streets shall be established to take advantage of the contour of
the land so as to produce useable lots, cause a minimum of cutting and filling,
and to produce streets with reasonable grades as defined in Section
1309.05(b).
      (4)    Street and right-of-way widths shall conform to those indicated in
the Thoroughfare Plan. Where such widths are not prescribed therein, the width
shall not be less than the minimums stated in Sections
1309.03(b) and
1309.04(b).
      (5)    In hillside subdivisions, dead-end streets are often necessary and
will be approved if limited to 2,000 feet long and fifty platted lots fronting
thereon.
      (6)    Closed subdivisions, with one exit, shall be limited to 100
dwelling units if the entrance or exit street grade exceeds a rise of twenty
feet in 200 feet; and shall be limited to 200 dwelling units if the street
grade is less. When these limits are exceeded, a second exit must be provided
which conforms to the street grade requirements of Section
 1309.05(b).
NOTE "A" - Where it can be clearly demonstrated by the subdivider that the
topographic conditions will prevent the utilization of all possible building
sites in the subdivision if all lots are required to abut on a street, some
variation from that requirement may be permitted by the Commission by means of
the careful design and adequate construction of private drives subject to the
following requirements:
         A.    Not more than three lots shall be served by any one private
drive.
         B.    Private drives shall be constructed of the same material and
with the same design characteristics as required for wider streets in Section
1309.04(b), except that the minimum surface width of a private drive may be
sixteen feet.
         C.    Common and joint maintenance by all owners, present and future,
of the lots served by the private drive shall be made a part of the deed of
each of the lots stipulating adequate maintenance and insuring passability.
         D.    When private drives are utilized, provision shall be made on the
lots for the off-street parking of at least three automobiles for each lot
served by the private drive which shall be in addition to the zoning
requirement for the area. Such additional off-street parking may be provided in
a common and shared lot on the premises.
         E.    When the City Development Department approves the use of private
drives in the subdivision, such approval shall be entered in writing in the
Department records together with a copy of the deed restrictions which is
required by subparagraph C. hereof.

expense of the subdivider including the cost of curb and gutter, if any, and
that of the total width designated in the Thoroughfare Plan shall be borne by
the City or by the Department of Highways of West Virginia when applicable,
unless it is determined by the Commission that such greater width will benefit
the subdivider in proportion to its cost.
      (2)    Local streets, minor streets and dead-end streets shall have
minimum widths of twenty-two feet except where curb and gutter are required;
the total width, face to face of curb, shall be twenty-four feet. The pavement
of a turning circle at the end of dead-end street shall have a minimum outside

      (3)    Alleys shall have minimum widths of twenty feet.
      (4)    Streets shall be graded full width and fully constructed with a
concrete pavement of a minimum thickness of six inches or of asphaltic concrete
or other material of equivalent quality. If the classification of the street
justifies the construction of a thicker section, the additional cost thereof
shall be borne by the City or the Department of Highways, depending upon the
agency having jurisdiction.
      (5)    Alleys, where required, will be constructed with a concrete
pavement of a minimum thickness of six inches or of asphaltic concrete or of
other material of equivalent quality. This requirement may be varied by the
Department if, in their opinion, the requirement imposes too severe a
restriction when related to the projected use of the alley.
   (b)    Hillside Subdivisions. The following requirements are applicable to
all hillside subdivisions within the jurisdiction of the Development
Department:
      (1)    The following requirements of Section

1309.04(a)(1), (3) to (5).
      (2)    Local streets, minor streets and dead-end streets shall have
minimum widths of twenty-two feet except where curb and gutter are required;
the total width, face to face of curb, shall be twenty-four feet. These
requirements may be reduced to a minimum width of eighteen feet, except where
curb and gutter are required; the total width, face to face of curb, shall be
twenty feet, if off-street parking bays are provided integral to the street and
on the uphill side thereof at locations throughout the subdivision readily
accessible to the lots therein, so as to permit the elimination of all on-
street parking. Such bays shall contain, in total, within the subdivision three
spaces per residential lot, such number not to include those spaces required by
the Zoning Ordinance. The required number of parking bay spaces may be reduced
if additional parking spaces are to be provided on the lots in the
subdivisions. The required number of parking bays may in those instances be
reduced by the additional on-lot spaces. The pavement of a turning circle at
the end of a dead-end street shall have a minimum outside diameter of sixty
feet. A "T" or "Y"-shaped, paved space when approved by the Department, shall
extend entirely across the width of the street right of way and shall be at
least sixteen feet wide with the flared portion rounded by a minimum radii of
twenty feet.

at all times shall be required along the rear line of any lot in the
subdivision which backs upon an arterial, collector or secondary street.
   (c)    In a hillside subdivision, the natural ground cover shall not be
disturbed except for the grading of those portions of the lot for building
sites and for the installation of necessary improvements including earth cuts
and fills. The removal of additional natural ground cover under other
circumstances may be permitted by the Department when necessary to the
successful development of the subdivision. In order that erosion caused from

the reasonable use of the land, building or structures.
         D.   The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, and will result
in substantial justice being done.
      (2)    Notice of public hearing shall be given. See Paragraph (b)(2)
hereof.
      (3)    The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney.
      (4)    The Board shall make findings that requirements of paragraph (c)
(1) hereof have been meet by the applicant for a variance.
   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the
same district, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
   In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance and
punishable under Section
1331.99.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to allow a use not
permissible under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance in the district involved,
or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance in such district. (Ord. 3795. Passed 8-22-78.)
   (d)    Decisions of the Board. In exercising these powers, the Board may so
long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this Zoning Ordinance,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement,
decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have
powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.
   The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the administrative
official; or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is
required to pass under this Zoning Ordinance; or to effect any variation in the
application of this Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. A-2530. Passed 2-27-73.)
   1329.06  APPEALS FROM THE BOARD.
   Any person, firm or corporation, or any board, taxpayer,  department, board
or bureau of the City, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the
Board of Zoning Appeals, may seek review by certiorari to the Circuit Court of
the County of such decision in the manner provided by the laws of the State,
and particularly by W. Va. Code 8-24-59 et seq.
(Ord. A-2530. Passed 2-27-73.)

   1329.08  DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL, BOARD, COUNCIL AND COURTS ON
MATTERS OF APPEAL.
   (a)    Duties of Administrative Official, Board and Courts. It is the intent
of this Zoning Ordinance that all questions of interpretation and enforcement
shall be first presented to the administrative official and that such questions
shall be presented to the Board of Zoning Appeals only on appeal from the
decision of the administrative official, and that recourse from the decisions
of the Development Department or the Board shall be to the courts as provided
by law, and particularly by W. Va. Code Article 8-24.
   (b)    Duties of Council. It is further the intent of this Zoning Ordinance
that the duties of Council, in connection with this Zoning Ordinance, shall not
include hearing and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that
may arise. The procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this
section and this Zoning Ordinance. Under this Zoning Ordinance, Council shall
have only the duties of: considering and adopting or rejecting proposed
amendments or the repeal of this Zoning Ordinance, as provided by law; and
establishing a schedule of fees and charges.

responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of the violation and
ordering the action necessary to correct it. He shall order discontinuance of
illegal use of land, buildings or structures; removal of illegal buildings or
structures or of additions, alterations or structural changes thereto;
discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall take any other action
authorized by this Zoning Ordinance to insure compliance with, or to prevent

   1331.02  BUILDING PERMITS REQUIRED; DENIAL OF PERMIT.
   No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, added to or

Zoning Division.  No building permit shall be issued except in conformity with
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance except after written order from the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
   The administrative official shall have the authority to deny and prevent any
and all permits to any applicant who is delinquent in paying any fees, taxes,
or interest or penalty thereon due and owing to the City.  Any permit that has

interest and penalty thereon.
(Ord. 0-1053.  Passed 1-14-03; Ord. 0-1093.  Passed 9-9-03.)
   1331.03  APPLICATION FOR BUILDING PERMIT.
   All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by plans, in
triplicate with one additional site plan and drawn to scale, showing the actual
dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon; the exact sizes and locations
of the lot of buildings already existing, if any; and the location and
dimensions of the proposed building or alteration.  The application shall
include such other information as lawfully may be required by the Code
Enforcement/Zoning Division, including existing or proposed buildings or
alterations; existing or proposed uses of the building and land; the number of
families, dwelling units or rental units the building is designed to
accommodate; conditions existing on the lot, including existing drainage and
proposed drainage; and such other matters as may be necessary to determine
conformance with, and provide for the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance. 
Said plans will be distributed by the Code Enforcement/Zoning Director’s office
to the appropriate departments.
   One copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant by the Code
Enforcement/Zoning Division after such copy has been marked as either approved
or disapproved, and attested to the same by the signature of an authorized
representative of the Code Enforcement/Zoning Division on such copy.  The
remaining copies of the plan, similarly marked, shall be retained by the City
Engineering Division and the Fire Department.

to the persons affected.
   The zoning permit shall expire one year from the date of issuance unless the

   No person shall use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any building
or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until
a zoning permit has been issued therefor by the administrative official stating
that the proposed use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance.
   The zoning permit shall state specifically wherein the nonconforming use
differs from the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.  Failure to make such
application shall be presumptive evidence that the property was in conforming
use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
   No permit for erection, alteration, moving or changing of any structure
shall be issued until an application has been made for a zoning permit.
   A temporary zoning permit may be issued by the administrative official for a
period not exceeding twelve months and may be extended by Council during
alterations or partial occupancy of a structure pending its completion,
provided that such temporary permit may require such conditions and safeguards
as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public.
   The administrative official shall maintain a record of all zoning permits,
and copies shall be furnished upon request, to any person.  Failure to obtain a
zoning permit shall be a violation of this Zoning Ordinance and punishable
under Section
1331.99.
(Ord. O-1093.  Passed 9-9-03.)
   The administrative official shall cause notice of the issuance of a zoning
permit to be published once in a local newspaper of general circulation within
three weeks of the issuance of the permit and shall collect from the applicant
a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) to cover publication costs.  Any surplus fees
collected shall be used for the maintenance and upgrading of City maps and
zoning boundaries.  The legal notice shall include the applicant’s name, the
property address, and a brief description of the type of project.
(Ord. O-1262.  Passed 5-22-07.)
   1331.06  CONSTRUCTION AND USE TO BE AS PROVIDED IN BUILDING PERMITS AND
ZONING PERMITS.
   Building permits or zoning permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the administrative officials authorize only the use,
arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications,
and no other use, arrangement or construction. 
(Ord. 0-1093.  Passed 9-9-03.)
   1331.07  FEES, CHARGES AND EXPENSES.
   Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges and expenses, and a
collection procedure for zoning permits, appeals and other matters pertaining
to this Zoning Ordinance.  The schedule of fees shall be posted in the office
of the administrative official and may be altered or amended only by Council.
   No permit, special exception or variance shall be issued unless or until
such costs, charges, fees or expenses have been paid in full, nor shall any
action be taken until preliminary charges and fees have been paid in full.
   The fee for filing an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be fifty
dollars ($50.00) and shall be paid at the office of the Code Enforcement/Zoning
Division at the time of filing notice of appeal.  The fee for filing an appeal

   1345.01  OFFICIAL ZONING MAP ESTABLISHED; CHANGES; REPLACEMENT.
   The City is hereby divided into zones or districts as shown on the Official
Zoning Map and as described in this Zoning Ordinance and the Map, together with
all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to
be a part of this Zoning Ordinance.
   The Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the
City Clerk, and bearing the seal of the City under the following words: “This
is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in Section A of
Ordinance No.  A-2530 of the City of Parkersburg, West Virginia,” together with
date of the adoption of Ordinance A-2530 (February 27, 1973).
   If, in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and the
provisions of W. Va.  Code Article 8-24, as amended, changes are made in the
district boundaries or other matters portrayed on the Map, such changes shall
be indicated to have been made by marking on the Map in the area changed, the
letter “C”.  The first change so indicated to have been made shall be marked
“C-1" and each subsequent change indicated to have been made shall be
consecutively numbered.  In addition to indicating on the Map that districts or
other matters have been changed, there shall be kept a bound book entitled
"Official Zoning Map Changes" in which each change in districts or other matter
portrayed on the Map shall be set forth verbatim as adopted and approved by
ordinance of Council. All changes adopted and approved by ordinance of Council
shall be indicated on the Map and shall be inserted in the book of Map changes
within one week after formal adoption and approval thereof and each insertion
in the book shall bear the date of final adoption and approval by Council and
shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk. No amendment to
this Zoning Ordinance which involves matters portrayed on the Map shall become
effective until after such change has been indicated on the Map and has been
inserted, dated, signed by the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk in the book
of Map changes.
   It shall be the duty of the City Clerk to mark all indications of the
changes of the Map and to make all insertions of the changes as portrayed on
the Map in the book of changes and at all times to maintain custody and control
of both the Map and the book of changes in the City Clerk's office.
   No changes of any nature shall be made in the Map or matter shown thereon,
except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.
Any unauthorized change of any kind by any person or persons shall be
considered a violation of this Zoning Ordinance and punishable as provided
under Section
1331.99.
   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Map which may from
time to time be made or published, the Map which shall be located in the office
of the City Clerk shall be the final authority as the current zoning status of
land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the City.
   In the event that the Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to
interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, Council
may, by ordinance, adopt a new Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the
prior map. However, in no event shall any Official Zoning Map be intentionally
damaged, destroyed or discarded but shall be kept as a permanent record. The
new Official Zoning Map shall bear the seal of the City, the signature of the
Mayor, attested by the City Clerk under the following words and figures: "This
is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the
Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of the map being replaced), as
part of Ordinance No. __________ of the City of Parkersburg, West Virginia. "

   1345.02  RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)    Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways or alleys, shall be construed to follow such center lines.
   (b)    Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
   (c)    Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be
construed as following City limits.
   (d)    Boundaries indicated as following shore lines shall be construed to
follow such shore lines, and in the event of change in the shore lines, shall
be construed as moving with the actual shore line; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the center lines of streams, rivers, lakes or other
bodies of water, shall be construed to follow such center lines.
   (e)    Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or extensions of, features
indicated in subsections (a) through (d) hereof shall be so construed.
Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be
determined by the scale of the Map.
   (f)    Where physical or other features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances
not covered by subsections (a) through (e) hereof, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall interpret the district boundaries.

   1347.01  PURPOSE OF DISTRICT CLASSIFICATION.
   The residential districts established in this article are designed to
promote and protect public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity and
other aspects of the general welfare. These general goals include, among
others, the following specific purposes:
   (a)    To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for residential
development to meet the housing needs of the City's present and expected future
population, with due allowance for the need for a choice of site and building
types;
   (b)    To protect residential areas against congestion by regulating the
density of population and the bulk of buildings in relation to the land around
them and to one another, and providing for off-street parking spaces;
   (c)    To protect residential areas, as far as possible, against heavy
traffic and against through traffic of all kinds;
   (d)    To require the provision of open space and a maximum conservation of
woodlands and protection of watercourses in residential areas, and to encourage
the provision of additional open space by permitting cluster development of
moderately higher density and intensity coverage with concomitantly higher
standards of open space, in order to provide large open areas with greater
utility for rest and recreation; and to encourage the development of more
attractive, economic and less monotonous building forms, by providing freedom
of architectural and site design;
   (e)   To provide for access of light and air to windows and for privacy by
controls over the spacing and height of buildings and other structures;
   (f)   To provide appropriate space for those public and private educational,
recreational, health, and similar facilities which serve the needs of nearby
residents, which generally perform their own activities more effectively in a
residential environment and which do not create objectionable influences;
   (g)   To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building
development in accord with a well-considered plan, to promote stability of
residential development, to protect the character of the district and its
peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of land and
buildings, and to protect the City’s tax revenue.  (Ord. A-2530.  Passed 2-27-
73.)
   1347.02  R-1 SINGLE-FAMILY LOW-DENSITY DISTRICT USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Purpose and Scope.  It is the purpose of the R-1 District to conserve
values in single-family areas characterized by homes on lots of larger-than-
average size, to reserve open areas with a potential for such type of
development by restricting new developments to those of similar character and
by permitting a minimum of auxiliary nonresidential uses.
   (b)   Principal Permitted Uses.
      (1)   Residential.  One-family detached dwellings.
      (2)   Public utility services underground recommended.
      (3)   Agriculture.  The growing of vegetables, fruits, flowers, shrubs
and trees when not primarily for gain.
         (Ord. A-2530.  Passed 2-27-73.)
      (4)   Group residential facilities.  Residence for disabled persons.
         A.   Disability:  A physical or mental impairment which substantially
limits one or more major life activities or a record of such impairment or
being regarded as having such an impairment.  This term does not include the
illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance.  Ref. 24 CFR Part 14 et.
al., Sect. 100.210. 
            (Ord. 0-811.  Passed 5-28-96.)
   (c)   Principal Conditional Uses.  When authorized by the Board of Zoning
Appeals in accordance with Section
1329.05(b).
      (1)   Recreational.
         A.   Golf courses, playfields and country clubs not primarily for
gain, provided that every building, structure or playing field shall be no less
than 100 feet distant from every abutting property line in an R District.
         B.   Field houses, athletic fields and stadiums used in connection
with educational institutions and primarily for gain, provided that every
building, structure or playing field shall be no less than 100 feet distant
from every abutting property line in an R District.
         C.   Parks, playgrounds, community centers, publicly owned and

   1348.06  ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   There are hereby established separate Architectural Review Boards for
each of the separate Residential Historic Districts which shall act in
reviewing an applicant's building plans for a structure or building that exists
or is to be built within the Historic District.  The Board shall be made up of
four residents of the District and one employee of the Development Department. 
All members shall be nominated by the Mayor and confirmed by Council.  The
Board shall make no charge for its services.  The term of office of each member
shall be as follows:  One for one year, two for two years and two for three
years.  If a vacancy occurs by resignation or otherwise, Council shall appoint
for the unexpired term a replacement member that satisfies the membership
criteria of the vacant office.
   (b)   The Board shall adopt rules necessary to the conduct of its affairs in
keeping with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.  At the first meeting of
each year, the Board shall elect a chairman and vice-chairman from its
members.  Meetings shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other
times as the Board may determine.  All meetings shall be open to the public.  A
majority of the members of the Board shall constitute a quorum.  No action of
the Board shall be official unless authorized by a majority of those present.
   (c)   The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon each question or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such
fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions,
all of which shall be a public record and be immediately filed in the office of
the Division of Planning of the Department of Development.
   (d)   Realizing the importance of attaining the objectives as set forth in
this article, it shall be the responsibility of all members of the Board to
attend all meetings.  If three consecutive meetings are missed by any members
of the Board, such member shall automatically forego his position.
(Ord. 0-1635.  Passed 9-24-19.)
   1348.07  ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD POWER AND DUTIES; REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   The Architectural Review Board shall review an applicant's building proposal
for the alteration or construction of a structure or building that exists or is
to be built within the Residential Historic District and approve, approve
conditionally or disapprove such building, construction or alteration.  The
Board shall be governed by the Architectural Review Guidelines.
   The Board shall review the applications referred to it by the zoning
administrators.  If the application is found to be in conformance with the
Guidelines, the Board shall so signify in writing to the zoning administrator
from whom the application was referred.
   The Avery Historic District ARB will utilize the Design Guidelines, set
forth in Section
1348.11 to guide and inform the review process.
   If, for some reason, the application is found not to be in conformance with
the requirements enumerated in the Guidelines then the Board shall advise the
zoning administrator from whom the application was referred, in writing, that
the application is not in conformance and the reasons that it is not in
conformance, in which case a building permit shall not be issued.  Provided,
however, that if the Board is of the opinion that the ends of justice shall be
served by granting approval to such application conditional upon a change in
plans to conform with the Guidelines, it may so advise the zoning administrator
from whom the application was referred, in writing, of such conditional
approval, enumerating the requirements which shall be complied with by a change
of plans, in which case a building permit may be issued conditional upon such
changes as required by the Board in order to comply with the Guidelines.
   In no event shall the Board grant a variance or conditional use deviating
from the guidelines or any other requirements or provisions of this article.
   All applications shall be ruled upon within sixty days of the date of
application and the applicant shall be provided with a written notice of either
approval, conditional approval or denial.

cause the exterior portion of any building or structure owned or leased by them
including walls, fences, light fixtures, steps, pavement, path, trees or any

either demolition or removal.
   (d)   Other provisions of this article notwithstanding, nothing herein shall

being violated or that any person or corporation is threatening to violate any
provision of this article, such administrative officials may institute civil
action in the name of the City for injunctive relief to restrain the violation
or threatened violation.
   Nothing herein contained shall prevent such administrative officials from
taking such other lawful action necessary as enumerated by the Zoning Ordinance
or available in the law, to prevent or remedy such violation or threatened
violation.
(Ord.  0-1635.  Passed 9-24-19.)
   1348.11  AVERY HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Introduction to Guidelines.
      (1)   These design guidelines are intended to provide assistance to
property owners and contractors looking to do work on existing buildings or new
construction within the Avery Historic District. The guidelines are not to be
considered unyielding rules, but rather strong suggestions of how construction
and repair work should be done in order to preserve the character of the
historic architecture found in the district. The Avery Historic District
Architectural Review Board (ARB) will use these design guidelines as a resource
guiding their decisions on whether or not to approve proposals. It is important
to note that the guidelines will not require property owners to make
improvements to existing structures within the district. The intent of the
guidelines is to generate solutions that meet the needs of the property owner
and protect the preservation interests of the Avery Historic District. In cases
of economic hardship, the ARB can modify guidelines to facilitate a positive
outcome for both the applicant and the historic district.
   (b)   Characteristics of the Avery Historic District.
      (1)   In 1986, the Avery Historic District was listed on the National
Register of historic places and is considered Parkersburg's first suburb. The
district is a primarily residential neighborhood and is comprised of 12
distinct styles of historical architecture. Those styles are: National Style,
Gothic Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Romanesque Revival, Folk Victorian,
Classical Revival, Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, Craftsman, International
Style, and Victorian Eclectic. These were all highly prevalent styles
throughout the United States during the time period when the Avery Historic
District was developed in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. However,
there are very few true examples of these styles within the district. Instead,
most of the buildings in the district demonstrate the creative merging of
elements comprising of multiple different architectural styles.
   (c)   Design Guidelines.
      (1)   The design guidelines listed herein will apply uniformly to all the
known architectural styles described above in the Avery Historic District,
except in cases where abiding by the guidelines would cause undue economic
hardship.
         A.   Original building materials and architectural details should not
be covered up.
         B.   Historic materials and distinguishing features should not be
removed. Attempt to preserve as much original architecture as possible.
         C.   Always try to repair rather than replace materials or
distinguishing features whenever feasible.
         D.   When it is necessary to replace, attempt to replicate the
original building material or distinguishing feature as closely as possible.
         E.   In cases where replication of original materials or features is
not feasible, replacements should be congruent with the character of the
structure.
         F.   During the restoration process, look for clues as to the
appearance of the original structure. Oftentimes original details have simply
been covered up by later work. For example, original siding is frequently
covered with vinyl siding on historic homes.
         G.   When original details cannot be identified for reference,
rehabilitation efforts should be simplistic and focused on making sure the new
work is in character with the existing structure.
         H.   Restoration work should not make the building look older than the
time period in which it was built. If a determination of age cannot be made
from the building, look to surrounding buildings in the historic district for
reference.
         I.   In order to help preserve the historic character of the building,
the size of original doorways and windows should not be changed.
         J.   Any historic walls and fencing should be preserved or replaced
in-kind.
         K.   The architecture of the original roofline, including features
such as chimneys, should not be altered. In cases where replacing the roof in
kind is not economically feasible, the applicant should work with the ARB to
come to some reasonable accommodation. For example, instead of replacing an old
slate roof with a new slate roof, the applicant could replace it with a new
shingle roof that is designed to look like slate.
         L.   Every effort should be made to retain and preserve original
ornamentation, as these details often help differentiate buildings in the
historic district.
         M.   Exterior accessories, such as light fixtures, should be
compatible with the overall character of the property.
         N.   When doing brick work, proper mortar joints should be utilized.
         O.   If a structure was painted, paint it again when doing restoration
work. The color of paint used should highlight the ornamentation of the
building.
         P.   Surface cleaning should be done gently and should not utilize
methods such as sandblasting. Ideally, cleaning and paint removal should be
avoided if possible.
         Q.   Do not assume that later additions to buildings are not
historically significant because they are not original. These additions may be
significant as examples of their own architectural style.
         R.   In cases of new construction, design work and materials should be
consistent with the architectural styles listed herein. For examples of
defining features that should be replicated by design and materials in new
construction, refer to the brief descriptions of each style in the Avery
Historic District Architectural Reference Guide.
         S.   New construction should be sited to match surrounding setbacks;
and it should be scaled in both size and height to match the existing buildings
in the historic district.
         T.   Any additions should be considered as new construction.
   (d)   Demolitions.
      (1)   Demolitions should only be approved when the owner can prove that
the building cannot be reused and that there is no economic benefit to be
realized from salvaging all or part of the building.
      (2)   Demolitions should be approved in cases where there is an
insignificant building or addition that does not contribute any historical
value to the district; and where that demolition will not have any adverse
impacts on the surrounding district's historic character.

congestion particularly in areas where the established pattern is predominantly
residential, but includes local retail uses, by regulating the intensity of
local and neighborhood retail development, by restricting those types and size
of establishments which generate heavy traffic and by providing for off-street
parking and loading facilities;

explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation and other hazards, and against
offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust and other particulate matter, odorous
matter, heat, humidity, glare and other objectionable influences connected with
industrial development;
   (f)    To provide sufficient and appropriate space, and in particular
sufficient depth from the street, to meet the needs of the City's central and
community commercial center, including the need for off-street parking space in
areas where a large proportion of customers come by automobile, with due
allowance for the need for a choice of site, and to encourage commercial
development to concentrate in continuous retail frontage within commercial
areas, to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants;
   (g)    To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for all types of
commercial and miscellaneous service activities, with due allowance for the
need for a choice of sites;

weekends, after receiving an application. Upon reviewing the application, the
Committee shall act upon it and shall give written notice of its decision to
the applicant within thirty (30) days of the date of the application. If the
application is approved, the Committee shall issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness. The Certificate should be signed by the chairman, and
transmitted to the City Zoning Officer. The Committee shall keep a record of
all Certificates of Appropriateness issued.
   Failure of the Design and Facade Committee to approve or disapprove an
application within thirty (30) days from the date of the application for the
building permit, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant and
Committee, shall be deemed to constitute approval and the Zoning Officer shall
proceed to process the application without regard to a Certificate of
Appropriateness. However, such thirty (30) day provision shall not apply in
instances where the Committee deems an incomplete application has been
submitted or where additional information has been requested of the applicant
by the Committee.
   Should the Committee disapprove the application, it shall state its reasons
for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action and reasons therefor in
writing to the applicant. The Committee shall state its reasons for
disapproving the plans submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may
make modifications to the plans and shall have the right to resubmit said
application at any time after so doing.
   In the event that a Certificate of Appropriateness is denied, the applicant
may file an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to Chapter
1329 and
 1350.15.
   Upon receiving a Certificate of Appropriateness, the applicant may apply for
a building permit in accordance with the City Building Codes.
   The Code/Zoning Administration Division shall inspect the construction,
alteration and/or improvements of a project within nine (9) months after a
Certificate of Appropriateness is issued, if the project is not already
finished and a final inspection completed and approved by the Code
Administration.  The inspector shall have the authority to issue a “Stop Work
Order” if the project is found not to be in compliance with the existing
Certificate of Appropriateness.
   Upon project completion, the applicant must schedule a final inspection with

APPENDIX A
DOWNTOWN FACADE AND DESIGN GUIDELINES
Introduction
   The Downtown Facade and Design Guidelines were created to provide direction
for the improvement and enhancement of commercial, governmental, cultural and
housing within the downtown and surrounding areas of downtown Parkersburg.
   The goal of the City of Parkersburg is to establish aesthetic continuity,
and to protect the investment of the business community. For the Facade
Improvement Program to have the maximum effect on business retention, growth,
and recruitment goals, the City of Parkersburg will establish a board appointed
by the Mayor and approved by Council.
   The Downtown Facade and Design Committee will consist of five (5) members.
One member shall be a local architect, a member of Council appointed by the
President, a resident whose primary occupancy is within the Central Business
District, and two (2) members of the downtown business community. The Planning
Director and Code Enforcement Director shall serve as non-voting staff members.
Concept
   To encourage desirable development, the City of Parkersburg shall adopt the
Downtown Facade and Design Ordinance. This process provides for a case-by-case
review of design aspects of new development and redevelopment before a building
permit is issued.
The Review Process
   Applications for design review may be obtained in the New Business/Zoning
Division office. An application for review must be accompanied by a set of
submittals, including the following, as applicable:
   1.    A Zoning application including information on existing and proposed
land uses and signage plan, if applicable, in accordance with Article
1364.03.
   2.    A narrative description of the proposed design or change in design,
use of materials and colors, finish grade line, landscaping and orientation of
the structure to adjacent properties. Also include color and material samples.
Artist or architectural renderings/conceptual designs are encouraged, though
not required.
   3.    An off-street parking plan, drawn to scale, showing the location,
extent, nature, character, dimensions of parking and loading facilities
(include handicap facilities), ingress/egress routes, total square footage and
landscaping. Also indicate details of lighting, drainage and surfacing.
   Public or private proposals for construction, reconstruction, remodeling,
alterations, maintenance, repairs or demolition of structures and lands within
the subject areas will be classified as either major or minor projects. A minor
project is one that is defined as such by the Facade Ordinance and will be
reviewed administratively by the Planning and Code Divisions. Minor projects
are those which will not significantly affect the character, use and
development of surrounding properties. Major projects are reviewed by the
Facade Committee.
   An application for review by the Facade Committee must be filed prior to the
onset of any work and accompanied by an adequate set of submittals. Include any
presentation material that is essential to the understanding of the proposal
and its relationship to its environment.
   Upon receipt of an application and submittals adequately describing the
project, an administrative hearing on the proposal will be scheduled within 5
days excluding weekends.
   Approval by the Planning Division or Facade Committee will result in
issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness and subsequently a Certificate of
Zoning Compliance. After the certificates are secured, Building and Demolition
Permits may be issued by the Code Enforcement Division.
   All repair, maintenance and demolition work must be completed within 90 days
of approval. Appeals must be filed with the Planning Division within 45 days of
final decision.
   Project designers are strongly encouraged to request an early briefing with
the Planning Division staff prior to formal application for a hearing. Such
meetings provide an opportunity for informal discussion of the specific
circumstances of the project and how the guidelines might affect its
development.
About the Guidelines
   The guidelines in this document are to be used to implement the goals for
downtown improvement and design. They are intended to aid project designers in
understanding the principal expectations of the City and the concerns and
objectives of downtown redevelopment.
   The guidelines are not intended to be inflexible prescriptive requirements,
and therefore exceptions to them for appropriate proposals may be granted. The
Facade Committee, while concerned that every project address itself to all
applicable guidelines, is also interested in encouraging creative solutions to
design problems.
   The guidelines are divided into three topic categories: General Principles,
Special Cases and Historic Preservation. They represent the most significant
factors affecting the appearance of the downtown area. Historic Preservation
has been addressed as a major issue area because of the number of buildings on
the National Register of Historic Places, as well as the Julia-Ann Square and
George Avery Historic Districts.
   The guidelines herein focus on relation of buildings, space and people. They
are used to coordinate and enhance the diversity of activities taking place in
the downtown area. Many ways of meeting a particular guideline exist, and since
it is not the intent to prescribe any specific solution, the guidelines
encourage a diversity of imaginative solutions to issues raised by this
document.
   This set of guidelines is not to be all-inclusive, but subject to
modification.
GOALS FOR DOWNTOWN PLANNING AND DESIGN
   The following goals are proposed as general statements of objectives for
planning and design review in Parkersburg's downtown.
   1.    Enrich the character, definition and form of downtown Parkersburg.
   2.    Recognize and preserve the distinctive historical and architectural
character of properties that reflect an earlier period of Parkersburg's
history.
   These goals express the desired ends of the review process. Both the goals
and guidelines extend the property development regulations for providing an
opportunity for a detailed, measured review of project proposals.

   1351.01  PURPOSE OF DISTRICT CLASSIFICATION,
   The manufacturing districts established in this article are designed to
promote and protect public health, safety and general welfare. These general
goals include, among others, the following specific purposes:
   (a)    To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the
needs of the City's and the metropolitan area's expected future economy for all
types of manufacturing and related activities, with due allowance for the need
for a choice of sites.
   (b)    To provide, as far as possible, that such space will be available for
use of manufacturing and related activities, and to protect residences by
separating them from manufacturing activities and by prohibiting the uses of
such space for new residential development.
   (c)    To encourage manufacturing development which is free from danger of
fire, explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation and other hazards, and
from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust and other particulate matter,
odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare and other objectionable influences, by
permitting such development in areas where this Zoning Ordinance restricts the
emission of such nuisances, without regard to the manufacturing products and
processes involved.
   (d)    To protect manufacturing and related development against congestion
as far as is possible and appropriate in each area, by limiting the bulk of
buildings in relation to the land around them and to one another, and by
providing space off public streets for parking and loading facilities
associated with such activities.
   (e)    To protect adjacent residential and commercial areas, and to protect
the labor force in other establishments engaged in less offensive types of
manufacturing and related activities, by restricting those manufacturing
activities which involve danger of fire, explosions, toxic and noxious matter,
radiation and other hazards, or create offensive noise, vibration, smoke and
other particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare and other
objectionable influences, to those limited areas which are appropriate
therefor;
   (f)    To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building
development in accord with a well-considered plan, to promote stability of
manufacturing and related development, to strengthen the economic base of the
City, to protect the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for
particular uses, to conserve the value of land and buildings, and to protect
the City's tax revenues.

   1353.01  PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of the Flood Plain Overlay District to promote the general
health, welfare and safety of people in the City by minimizing the risk of
flood damage to property and to protect human life through the institution of
development standards in the one hundred year flood plain. Specifically, the
purpose of the Flood Plain Overlay District is to protect persons and property
in the City from a one hundred year flood by retaining sufficient natural
floodway area to convey flood flows and to assure the proper floodproofing of
structures located and constructed in areas subject to flooding. It is also the
purpose of the Flood Plain Overlay District to minimize risks to public health
and safety by minimizing the risk of flood damage to the water supply, sanitary
sewage disposal, natural drainage and other public and private utility systems
by regulating design and construction of and development in areas subject to
flooding. It is also the purpose of the Flood Plain Overlay District to reduce
potential financial burdens caused by flood damage by providing accepted design
and construction standards for development in areas subject to the one hundred
year flood.

April 17, 1989 and as measured from the National Geodetic Vertical Datum.  From
that determination, boundaries for the land area subject to the waters of the
one hundred year flood have been established.
   Within the approximated floodplain (F-3), the base flood elevation shall be
established as the elevation of a representative point on the boundary of the
approximated floodplain which is nearest to the construction site in question.
   Within the floodway fringe (F-2), the base flood elevation shall be as
established by the detailed study data and profiles contained in the Federal
Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Study, Community No. 542014, as
revised April 17, 1989. 
   (d)   “Chief Executive Officer (CEO)” means the official of the community
who is charged with the authority to implement and administer laws, ordinances
and regulations for that community.
   (e)   “Development” means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, the

            (Ord. 0-835.  Passed 12-10-96.)
   1353.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOOD PLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   The Flood Plain Overlay District includes all areas subject to inundation by
the waters of the one hundred year flood. The source of the delineation for the
base flood shall be the Flood Insurance Study for the City of Parkersburg as
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Flood Insurance
Program. For purposes of this article, the Flood Plain Overlay District shall
be comprised of the following three subdistricts:
   (a)    Floodway (F-l): That portion of the Flood Plain Overlay District
required to carry and discharge the waters of the one hundred year flood
without increasing the water surface elevation at any point more than one foot
above existing conditions, as demonstrated in the Flood Insurance Study of the
City of Parkersburg.
   (b)    Floodway Fringe (F-2): Those portions of land within the Flood Plain
Overlay District subject to inundation by the one hundred year flood, lying
beyond the floodway in areas where detailed study data and profiles are
available.
   (c)    Approximated Flood Plain (F-3): Those portions of land within the
Flood Plain Overlay District subject to inundation by the one hundred year
flood, where a detailed study has not been performed, but where a one hundred
year flood plain boundary has been approximated.
   (d)    Base Flood Elevation: For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State or other acceptable sources shall be used
when available and approved by the City Engineer. When such other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be established as
the elevation of a representative point, as determined by the City Engineer on
the boundary of the approximated flood plain which is nearest to the
construction site in question. (Ord. 0-531. Passed 2-23-88.)
   1353.04  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The delineation of the Flood Plain Overlay District boundary may be revised,
amended and modified through the amendment procedures outlined in Article
1333 in compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program, when there are
changes through natural or other causes, or changes are indicated by future
detailed hydrologic and hydraulic studies. All such changes shall be subject to
the review and approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.
(Ord. 0-531. Passed 2-23-88.)
   1353.05  BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
   Should a dispute arise concerning the Flood Plain Overlay District boundary,
an initial determination shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. In making
the boundary determination, the Zoning Administrator may request the assistance
of various City departments. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning
Administrator may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The burden of proof
shall be on the appellant to sustain his contention.
(Ord. 0-531. Passed 2-23-88.)
   1353.06  FLOODWAY (F-1).
   In any Floodway (F-1) subdistrict, the development and use of land is
regulated by the underlying zoning district, provided that no such use,
activity or development shall be permitted which would result in an increase in
the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
When a developer proposes to offset the effects of development in the Floodway
by construction of stream improvements, he shall submit an engineering study
prepared by a registered professional engineer which fully evaluates the
effects of such construction. The engineering study shall use the base flood as
herein defined as the basis of analysis. All adjacent communities and the State
Coordinating Office shall be notified by the developer by certified mail of all
such intended activities prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse
and shall submit copies of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administrator. In addition, the developer shall assure the City in a manner
agreed upon by the City Attorney that the flood- carrying capacity within the
altered or relocated portion of the watercourse in question will be maintained.
   All uses, activities and other developments shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the floodproofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations. (Ord. 0-531. Passed
2-23-88.)
   1353.07  FLOODWAY FRINGE (F-2) AND APPROXIMATED FLOOD PLAIN  (F- 3).
   (a)    In the Floodway Fringe (F-2) and Approximated Flood Plain (F-3), the
development and use of land is regulated by the underlying zoning district,
provided that all such uses, activities and development shall be undertaken in
strict compliance with the floodproofing and related provisions contained
herein and all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations. For any
manufactured home park or subdivision within the Floodway Fringe or
Approximated Flood Plain, the owner or operator shall file with the disaster
preparedness authorities of Wood County and the City an evacuation plan which
indicates alternate vehicular access and escape routes.
   (b)    In addition, whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a
watercourse within the Floodway Fringe (F-2) or Approximated Flood Plain (F-3),
the developer shall notify in writing by certified mail all adjacent
communities and the State Coordinating Office of all such intended activities
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse, and shall submit
copies of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administrator. The
developer shall also assure the City in a manner agreed upon by the City
Attorney, that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse in question will be maintained.
(Ord. 0-531. Passed 2-23-88.)
      
   1353.08  DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In order to prevent excessive damage to buildings and structures, the
following restrictions shall apply to all new construction and any substantial
improvement to an existing structure within the Flood Plain Overlay District.
   (a)    Basements and Lowest Floors. All new construction and substantial
improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor including
basement elevated to the one hundred year flood elevation (base flood
elevation). All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the
base flood elevation; or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood elevation, the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement shall either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: a
minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be
provided.
   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or
devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
   (b)    Fill. If fill is used to raise the finished surface of the lowest
floor to the base flood elevation:
      (1)    Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen feet beyond the building line from all points. For
nonresidential structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable
for intended use. At grade access, fill shall extend laterally fifteen feet
beyond the building line to a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
      (2)    Fill shall consist of soil or rock materials only. Sanitary land
fills shall not be permitted.
      (3)    Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling.
      (4)    Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Division of Code Administration.
      (5)    Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely effect adjacent properties or cause drainage problems.
   (c)    Placement of Buildings, Structures and Manufactured Housing.
      (1)    All buildings and structures shall be constructed and placed on
the lots so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall
be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of
floodwater. (Ord. 0-531. Passed 2-23-88.)
      (2)   Manufactured homes, including those which have incurred
“substantial damage” as the result of a flood, and any improvements thereto
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation so that the lowest floor of each
manufactured home will be at the base flood elevation.
         (Ord. 0-835.  Passed 12-10-96.)
      (3)   All manufactured homes shall be provided with adequate surface
drainage and access for a mobile home hauler.
   (d)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All buildings and structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance
with accepted engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral
movement, thus reducing the threat to life and property and decreasing the
possibility of the blockage of bridge openings, and other restricted sections
of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes and storage tanks located at or below
the first floor level shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation.
         (Ord. 0-531.  Passed 2-23-88.)
      (3)   All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement by providing over-the-top and frame ties to ground
anchors.  Specifically:
         A.   Over-the-top ties shall be provided at each of the four corners
of the manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate
locations and manufactured homes less than fifty feet long requiring one
additional tie per side.
         B.   Frame ties shall be provided at each corner of the manufactured
home with five additional ties per side at intermediate points, with
manufactured homes less than fifty feet long requiring four additional ties per

(Ord. 0-418. Passed 11-12-85.)
   1354.06  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)    Lot Requirements.
      (1)    Lot area. No minimum lot area is required, however an area can be
considered a Planned Neighborhood Development only if a variety or the
arrangement of different types of dwelling units is provided.
      (2)    Front yard. Variations in building setbacks are encouraged.
However, no building shall be erected closer than ten feet to the front
property line of the building site.
      (3)    Side yard. Zero lot line (ZLL) and cluster developments are
encouraged. There shall be a total minimum side yard of ten feet. One side yard
may be reduced to zero feet if the other is a minimum of ten feet. In no case
however, shall a combination of side yards be allowed which would create a
separation of less than ten feet between nonattached structures. Building
separation between nonattached structures shall be increased by one foot for
each foot by which any adjoining building exceeds thirty feet in overall
height. A corner lot shall have a side yard of not less than ten feet extending
to the rear property line on the street side of the lot.
      (4)    Rear yard. No building shall be erected closer than ten feet to
the rear property line of the building site.
      (5)    Maximum building site coverage. The maximum building coverage for
lots 4,000 square feet and over shall be fifty percent (50%). Lots containing
less than 4,000, but 3,500 or more square feet shall have a maximum building
coverage of forty-five percent (45%). Permitted lots containing less than 3,500
square feet shall have a maximum building coverage of forty percent (40%). 
         (Ord. 0-418.  Passed 11-12-85.)
      (6)    Density. The Planned Neighborhood Development shall comply with
the following residential density requirements for the zoning district in which
the development is proposed.
 
Zoning District Maximum Dwelling Units/Gross Acre
R-1             4
R-2             6

         (Ord. 0-418.  Passed 11-12-85; Ord. 0-1123.  Passed 3-23-04.)
When a proposed Planned Neighborhood Development (PND) is split between two
zoning districts, the density of the entire project shall be governed by
calculating the percentage of the project site contained within each district.
The subsequent location of the dwelling units is at the discretion of the
applicant contingent upon Planning Commission approval.
Single-family developments which do not utilize zero lot line (ZLL) clusters or
equally creative site design must conform to the yard area and setback
requirements of the zoning district in which the project is proposed.
      (7)    Landscaping. The provision of landscaping, screening and
decorative features is encouraged within the Planned Neighborhood Development.
The location, type and treatment of the landscaping design shall be
incorporated into the site plan required in Section
1354.07(a)(2)B. and be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission.
   (b)    Minimum Parcel Size. The gross area of a tract of land to be
developed in a Planned Neighborhood Development within a residential district
shall be not less than one acre.
   When a Planned Neighborhood Development proposes a mixture of residential
uses with commercial uses within a Business District the gross area of a tract
of land shall not be less than two acres, for residential uses only, the tract
of land shall be one acre.
   (c)    Density Increases. Density increases shall be allowed if the
applicant furnishes improvements based on the following criteria. The increase
in density shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the maximum density
specified in that zoning district in which the project is proposed.
      (1)    Common open space. Common open space is not required but may be
permitted. If common open space is provided, provisions satisfactory to the
Planning Commission shall be made to assure that nonpublic areas and facilities
for the common use of the occupants of the PND shall be maintained in a
satisfactory manner without expense to the City. For each ten percent (10%) of
the gross land area developed in a PND for common open space or recreational
facilities an increase in density of ten percent (10%) shall be allowed. Public
utility and similar easements, floodway and other similar channels, parking
lots and streets shall not be considered an open space unless such land or
right of way is usable as a trail or other purpose as approved by the Planning
Commission. The common open space shall be disposed of as required in
subsection (d) hereof
      (2)    Architectural and siting variation. The landscaping, siting and
design features shall be considered cause for density increases not to exceed
fifteen percent (15%), provided these factors contribute to the objectives of a
Planned Neighborhood Development. Features for which density increases may be
granted by the Planning Commission include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         A.    Landscaping, maximum density increase of five percent (5%), that
includes improvements to the common open space, pedestrian way treatment and
plazas.
         B.    Siting, maximum increase of five percent (5%), that includes use
and maintenance of existing physical features, variation in building setbacks,
and building groupings, such as clustering.
         C.    Design features, a maximum increase of five percent (5%), that
includes use of various architectural styles, providing varied housing types,
and landscaping and screening of parking areas.
   (d)    Disposition of Common Open Space. If common open space is provided
provisions satisfactory to the Planning Commission shall be made to assure that
nonpublic areas and facilities for the common use of occupants of the PND shall
be maintained in a satisfactory manner without expense to the City. Such
provisions may be provided by the incorporation of provisions requiring
mandatory participation in an automatic-membership home association for the
purpose of continually holding title to the common open space and facilities
and levying assessments against each lot, whether improved or not, for the
purpose of paying the taxes and maintaining such common open space. Such
assessments shall be a lien superior to all other liens except first mortgage
liens and tax liens. Other methods for the disposition of common open space and
facilities may be acceptable if they provide for the proper and continuous
payment of taxes and maintenance without expense to the City. The instrument
incorporating these provisions shall be approved by the City Attorney as to
form and legal sufficiency before submission to the Planning Commission.
   (e)    Perimeter Yards. For a Planned Neighborhood Development located in a
residential district, structures located on the perimeter of the development
shall maintain the yard provisions of the zoning district in which the project
is located. No driveway, off-street parking or intensive recreation area shall
be permitted in such area.
   (f)    Parking. Off-street parking, loading and service areas shall be
provided in accordance with Article
1363 subject to the following design standards:

continuous row without being interrupted by landscaping.
      (4)    All parking areas shall be paved in accordance with the
construction plans approved by the City Engineer.
      (5)    All parking areas shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of
all surface waters without erosion, flooding or creating inconvenience to
adjacent properties in accordance with the construction plans approved by the
City Engineer.
      (6)    A minimum of two off-street parking spaces, excluding the private
garage/carport shall be required for each lot.
   (g)    Private Streets; Ownership. Standards of design and construction for
streets, both public and private, within Planned Neighborhood Developments
shall conform to the applicable requirements specified in the Subdivision
Regulations. Right-of-way width and street roadway widths may be reduced as
deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission, especially where it is found
that the plan for the PND provides adequate offstreet parking facilities.
   Private streets shall be considered owned and maintained by the automatic-
membership home association or other type of maintenance entity that is
approved by the City Attorney prior to approval of the final plat. All future
repair and maintenance costs shall be borne by the automatic-membership home
association or other maintenance entity that is approved by the City Attorney.
   Separate utility easements shall be acquired independently for all public
utilities located within the private street right of way. Utilities shall only
be placed under the pavement when required at crossings or where no other
location is feasible. Any subsequent repairs to a private street necessitated
by utility maintenance or replacement activities shall be borne by the home
association or maintenance entity.
   (h)    Utility Requirements. Underground utilities, including telephone and
electrical systems, are required within the limits of all Planned Neighborhood
Developments. Accessory structures to these systems which can be effectively
screened may be exempted from this requirement if the Municipal Planning
Commission finds that such exemption will not conflict with the character of
the Planned Neighborhood Development.
   (i)    Maintenance and Drainage Easements. A perpetual four-foot wall
maintenance easement shall be provided on the lot adjacent to the zero lot line
property line, which, with the exception of walls and/or fences, shall be kept
clear of structures. This easement shall be shown on the plat and incorporated
into each deed transferring title to the property. The wall shall be maintained
in its original color and treatment unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
the two affected lot owners. Roof overhangs may penetrate the easement on the
adjacent lot a maximum of twenty-four inches, but the roof shall be so designed
that water runoff from the dwelling placed on the lot line is limited to the
easement area.
   (j)    Openings Prohibited on the Zero Lot Line Side. The wall located on
the zero lot line shall have no windows, doors, air conditioning units or any
other type of opening, provided however, that one opening on the atrium or
court shall be permitted on the zero lot line side when the court or atrium is
enclosed by three walls of the dwelling unit and a solid wall of at least eight
feet in height is provided on the zero lot line. The wall on the zero lot line
shall be constructed of the same material as the exterior walls of the unit.
   (k)    Sidewalks Required. Sidewalks of such width as determined by the City
Development Department and of such type of construction as specified by the
City Engineer shall be constructed based on the following criteria:
      (1)    The construction of sidewalks shall be required at a minimum on
one side of cul-de-sac and dead end streets; and
      (2)    The construction of sidewalks shall be required on both sides of
through streets.
   In addition, sidewalks shall, whenever feasible, connect to both on and off-
site community and public facilities of schools, recreational areas and
commercial sites and existing off-site sidewalks. (Ord. 0-418. Passed 11-12-
85.)

regardless of the districts in which they are located.
(Ord. A-2530. Passed 2-27-73.)
   1363.02  OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    General.
      (1)    When required.  In connection with every use, there shall be
provided, at the time any building or structure is erected or enlarged, off-
street parking spaces for automobiles, in accordance with the requirements
specified in subsection (h) hereof. The provisions and maintenance of required
off- street parking is the continuing obligation of the property owner and/or
tenant and are subject to the design guidelines described in subsection (i)
hereof. Required parking spaces shall be improved as required and made
available for use before the final certificate of occupancy is issued by the
Code Enforcement Division.
      (2)    Minimum size. Each off-street parking space shall contain an area
of not less than 160 square feet, exclusive of access drives and aisles, and
shall be of usable shape and condition.
      (3)    Access.
         A.   Residential use:
            8' to 10' for a one-lane driveway
            16' to 20' for a two lane driveway
         B.   Commercial and public use:
            13' for a one lane driveway
            26' for a two-lane driveway
         C.   Industrial use:
            15' for one-lane driveway
            30' for two-lane driveway.
      (4)    Type. Parking spaces for all types of uses may be provided either
in garages or parking areas conforming with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)    Location of Parking Facilities. Except as otherwise provided in the
applicable district use regulations, required off-street parking facilities
shall be located on the same lot as the principal building or on a lot within
300 feet thereof. The distance specified herein and the distances specified in
the district use regulations shall be measured from the nearest point of the
parking facility to the nearest point of the lot occupied by the building or
use that such facility is required to serve.
      (1)   When feasible, off-street parking lots shall be located to the side
and/or rear of the principle building, thereby preserving architectural unity
of the street side of the building lot to pedestrians and motor vehicles.  For
an example see illustration in subsection (i) hereof.
   (c)    Units of Measurement. For the purposes of determining off-street
parking requirements, the following units of measurement shall apply:
      (1)    Floor area. In the case of uses where floor area is the unit for
determining the required number of off-street parking spaces, such unit shall
mean the floor area used or intended to be used by tenants, or for service to
the public as patrons, patients, visitors, residents or persons in attendance,
including the area used principally for nonpublic purposes, such as storage and
incidental repairs, for toilets or rest rooms and for utility rooms, but
excluding outside walls, space used or intended to be used for mechanical
equipment, stairways, elevator shafts, parking within the principal building,
and any other fire-enclosed spaces.
      (2)    Hospital bassinets. In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted
as beds.
      (3)    Places of public assembly.
         A.    Benches: in stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other places
of public assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews, or other
similar seating facilities, each twenty inches of such seating facilities shall
be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining off-street parking
requirements under this Zoning Ordinance.
         B.    Fixed seats and assembly area: in cases where a place of
assembly has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be
computed separately for each type and added together.
      (4)    Fractions. When units of measurement determining number of
required parking spaces result in requirements of a fractional space, any
fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions over
one-half shall require one parking space.
   (d)    Change in Use: Additions and Enlargements.   Whenever there is change
in use, enlargement of building or the extension of land use results in an
increase in the number of units used to measure required off-street parking
spaces, and such alteration or change creates a need for an increase of more
than ten percent in the number of required off-street parking spaces,
additional off-street parking shall be provided on the basis of the increase in
the number of such units of measurement and shall be subject to design
guidelines described herein; provided, however, that in case a change or
increase in use creates a need for an increase of less than five off-street
parking spaces, no additional parking facilities shall be required.
   (e)    Mixed Occupancies and Uses Not Specified. In the case of mixed uses,
the total requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of
the requirements for the various uses computed separately. Where a use is not
specifically mentioned, the requirements for a use which is so mentioned, and
to which such use is similar, shall apply. Off-street parking facilities for
one use shall not be considered as providing requirements for any other use,
except as specified in subsection (g) hereof for joint use.
   (f)    Collective Provision. Where permitted by the applicable district use
regulations, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent provisions
of collective off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses,
exclusive of facilities required for dwelling units. In cases of collective
use, the required total of such off-street parking space supplied collectively
shall be: not less than eighty-five percent of the sum of the requirements of
the various uses computed separately; and not less than the largest amount
required for any of the uses computed separately; provided further that the
applicable district use regulations shall be complied with.
   (g)    Joint Use of Facilities. Off-street parking facilities required for
churches shall be reduced by fifty percent where such churches: abut, either
directly or across a street or alley, a nonresidence district; or are located
within a nonresidence district; or abut a parking lot serving a business or
industrial use in a nonresidence district.
   (h)    Off-Street Parking Requirements. For permitted residential,
institutional, community facilities and office uses.

(Ord. 0-1192.  Passed 6-14-05.)
   1364.06  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   No flood lights shall be utilized as a part of a sign illumination
system which are not shielded so that the light is not visible from any public
right of way or adjacent property nor shall any sign otherwise reflect or emit
a glaring light so as to impair driver vision or impair the privacy of an
adjoining residential use.
   (b)   No sign illumination system shall contain or utilize any beacon, spot,
search or stroboscopic light or reflector which is visible from any public
right of way or adjacent property, nor shall such light be operated outside
under any circumstances, except by authorized public agencies.
   (c)   No sign shall obstruct the view of a motor vehicle operator entering a
public roadway, from a driveway, street or alley.
   (d)   No sign shall be permitted which may be confused with an official
traffic sign, signal or device, railroad sign or signal or any other official
sign or which uses the words, “stop”, “warning”, “danger”, “caution” or similar
words implying the existence of danger or need for stopping or maneuvering.
   (e)   No sign is permitted to be displayed on any trees, natural feature,
shrubs or utility poles within the public right of way.  This shall not apply
to any sign, signal or other information device erected or placed by a
governmental agency or its designee.
   (f)   No signs or sign structure shall be placed closer than five (5) feet
to the public right of way.
   (g)   No sign projecting into a public right of way shall be lower than nine
(9) feet.
   (h)   When a business has ceased operation for more than sixty (60) days,
the sign and fixtures must be removed unless a new business at that location
has made application with the Zoning Administrator or his designee to utilize
the existing sign structure. Signs associated with a business which is normally
opened on a seasonal basis shall not be considered to be ceased, provided there
is clear intent to continue operations of the business within nine (9) months.
   (i)   A person that applies for a sign for which a permit is required that
is erected, installed, removed, rehung or maintained over public property shall
file in the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) an insurance
policy for public liability with the Code Enforcement Division.
   (j)   No person shall locate a sign on the premises so as to intentionally
or effectively deny an adjoining property owner reasonable public vision access
to an existing sign.
   (k)   The City shall have the right to cause the removal of any obsolete
sign if the owner thereof fails to remove such sign within thirty (30) days of
written notification or if the owner cannot be located; and the costs thereof
shall be collected, if not paid, legal proceedings will take place and a lien
placed upon said property. 
   (l)   No sign shall be placed upon a vacant lot except for real estate,
political or construction signs.
   (m)   A clear view at each corner of an intersection shall be maintained by
establishing an unobstructed “sight triangle”.  The extent of the required
sight triangle varies according to the speed limit of streets forming the
intersection.  For streets signed 35 MPH or greater, the area to be clear of
view obstructions at unsignalized intersections is generally to be the
triangular area formed by the point of intersection of street right of way
lines and a point located along each right of way line at a distance of 35 feet
from the point of intersection.  For intersecting streets signed for less than
35 MPH, the shaded area in the figure #1 illustrates the area which must, in
most instances, be clear of obstructions to driver visibility at unsignalized
intersections.    No sign or other obstruction to vision shall be installed,
constructed, set out, or maintained so as to obstruct cross-visibility in the
sight triangle between 30 inches and 72 inches above the level of the center of
the street intersection. 
(Ord. 0-1192.  Passed 6-14-05.)
   1364.07  DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   All signs shall be constructed of durable materials, and when
required, shall be securely attached to a building or structure by metal
supports, such as bolts, anchors, supports, chains, guy or steel rods and shall
meet or exceed the wind and snow loads of this regions.
   (b)   Any sign erected, constructed or maintained shall not obstruct any
fire escape or any window or door or opening used as a means of any fire escape
or be placed as to hinder any emergency response.
   (c)   Any sign erected shall meet all building codes adopted by the City of
Parkersburg, NFPA and Electrical codes.
(Ord. 0-1192.  Passed 6-14-05.)
   1364.08  MEASUREMENT OF SIGN AREA.
   (a)   The permitted size of a sign shall apply to the entire area enclosing
the extreme limits of writing, representation, emblem or figure, together with
any frame or other material or embellishment forming an integral part of the
display.  Necessary supports or uprights on which a sign is placed are excluded
from the measurement of sign area. 
   (b)   The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base
of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component to the
sign.  Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of existing grade prior
to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of
any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating
the sign.
(Ord. 0-1192.  Passed 6-14-05.)
   1364.09  SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   Hospitals:
   (a)   Hospitals shall be permitted one (1) ground sign at each entrance
which shall not exceed one hundred twenty (120) square feet in area or ten
(10’) feet in height or be located closer than five (5) feet to any lot line.
   (b)   Hospitals shall be permitted one (1) wall sign for each building
entrance or street frontage for the purpose of identifying the hospital or
activity.  No such sign shall exceed fifty (50) square feet in area.
      (Ord. 0-1192.  Passed 6-14-05.)
   1364.10  HAZARDOUS SIGNS.
   Upon determination of the Code Enforcement Director or his designee that any
sign is hazardous or insecure, or is a menace to the public, he/she shall give
by means of written notice, sent certified mail to the owner, agent or person
having the beneficial interest in the premises on which the sign is located. 
Correction of the condition which caused the violation shall be effected within
five (5) days after receipt of the notice.  If the condition is not corrected
by the end of the fifth (5th) day, the Code Enforcement Director or his
designee is hereby authorized to cause the sign to be removed forthwith at the
expense of the owner, agent or person having the beneficial interest in the
premises on which the sign is located.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the Code Enforcement Director or
his designee is authorized to cause any sign to be removed immediately and
without notice, at the expense of the owner, agent or person having the
beneficial interest in the premises on which the sign is located, whenever he/
she determines that such sign is an immediate peril to persons or property. 
(Ord. 0-1192.  Passed 6-14-05.)
   1364.11  NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   For the purpose of this section, a non-conforming sign shall be defined as a
sign existing legally at the time of the effective date of this section which
does not comply with every provision of this article.
   (a)   A non-conforming sign shall not be enlarged, structurally altered or
extended unless such sign shall be made to comply with all the provisions of
this Article.  Normal maintenance of a non-conforming sign is permitted.
   (b)   No conforming sign shall be erected on the same premises as an
existing non- conforming sign until the non-conforming sign has been removed or
changed to a conforming sign.  However, for a multi-occupant land use, the fact
that one particular establishment therein has a non-conforming sign will not
prohibit a different establishment therein from erecting a conforming sign on
the same premises.
   (c)   A non-conforming sign shall be made to conform with the requirements
of this Article whenever there is a change in the use, name change of the
business or occupancy of the building which the sign serves, or whenever the
building or structure which the sign serves is externally expanded or
remodeled. 
   (d)   A non-conforming sign which is destroyed or damaged by fire or other
cause to the extent that the cost of restoration will exceed sixty percent
(60%) of the original cost of such sign, shall not be restored unless it is
made to conform to all the regulations of this Article.  In the event that such
damage or destruction is less than sixty percent (60%) of the original cost of
such sign, no repairs or construction shall be made unless such restoration is
started within one (1) month from the date of the partial destruction (pending
upon completion of insurance claim) and is diligently pursued to completion.

   1364.14  OFF-PREMISE BILLBOARD SIGNS.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose.  This section establishes the regulations for
the continuing use of off-premise billboard signs in order to encourage an
attractive environment for businesses, inform and direct the general public,
protect and enhance the physical appearance of the community, ensure public
safety along streets and highways, and provide business with a format for
advertising the goods and services made available by the business community.
   Off-premise billboard advertising is a traditional and legitimate
advertising medium involving the lawful use of private property.
   Off-premise billboard advertising should be regulated to provide for safe
structures, to be properly located so as to meet uniform standards for
construction and maintenance, and to be maintained to conform to a neat and
pleasant community appearance.
   In support of the previous statements and in order to assure the
compatibility of off- premise billboard signs with surrounding land usage, to
enhance the economy of the City, to protect the public interest in streets and
highways, to promote and maintain the safety and general welfare of persons and
their property in the vicinity of off-premise billboard advertising structures,
to allow property owners the opportunity to sell or lease their properties for
off- premise billboard advertising uses, and to provide and protect tax
revenues by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of off-
premise billboard advertising, it is deemed to be in the public interest to
enact this section.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   Advertising structure:  A sign which has a flat surface sign space
upon which advertising may be posted, painted or affixed, and which is

point.
      (8)   Wall Sign:   An off-premise billboard sign attached to the wall of
a building or structure.
   (c)   Permitted Districts:   Off-premise billboards signs shall be a

(Manufacturing Districts).
      
   (d)   Legal Non-conforming Signs:  Any off-premise billboard sign lawfully
erected and in existence as of the effective date of this section which does
not meet the requirements of this section may be maintained as a matter of
right as a legal non-conforming sign.
   Any non-conforming off-premise billboard sign that would be removed or any
destruction of the structure with replacement cost of 50% or more, shall adhere
to the applicable zoning-sign ordinance for the said zoning district.
   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or the
restoration to a safe condition any off-premise billboard sign or part thereof,
declared to be unsafe by the Code Enforcement Division official.
   (e)   General Provisions:
      (1)   No off-premise billboard sign shall be constructed which resembles
any official marker erected by a governmental entity, or which by reason of
position, shape or color would conflict with the proper functioning of any
official traffic control device.
      (2)   Off-premise billboard signs shall be constructed in accordance with
City and State building and electrical codes and shall be subject to wind and

1364.12
   1365.01  INTENT.
   Within the districts established by Ordinance A-2530, passed February 27,
1973, or amendments that may be later adopted, there exists lots, structures
and uses of land and structures which were lawful before Ordinance A-2530 was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this article or future amendment.
   The legitimate interests of those who lawfully established these
nonconformities are recognized in this article by permitting such uses to
continue subject to regulations for and limitations upon their restoration,
reconstruction or extension. It is recognized, however, that nonconformities
substantially and adversely affect the development, maintenance, use and
taxable value of other properties in the district that are subject to the
regulations of this article. In order to secure eventual compliance with the
standards of this article, it is therefore necessary to regulate
nonconformities and to prevent their re-establishment once they have been
discontinued. It is further the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that
nonconformities not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall affect the
plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of Ordinance A-2530. Actual building construction means the placing
and fastening of construction materials in a permanent manner. In the case
where a demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially
begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to
be actual construction if a building permit has been obtained, provided that
work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building is
accomplished and a certificate of occupancy is issued.
(Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-86.)
   1365.02  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance passed February 27, 1973. Such lot shall be
in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the
same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in
the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not
involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located. Any variance of yard
requirements shall be obtained only through application to and authorization by
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage are in single ownership or of record at the time of passage
or amendment this Zoning Ordinance passed February 27, 1973, and if all or part
of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established
by this Zoning Ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an
undivided parcel. No portion of such parcel shall be used or sold which does
not meet lot, width and area requirements established by this Zoning Ordinance,
nor shall any division of the parcel be subsequently made which leaves the
remaining width or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-86.)
   1365.03  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Ordinance, passed February 27, 1973, a lawful use of land exists that is made
no longer permissible under the terms of this article, such use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   (a)    Expansion. No such nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged,
increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    Moving. No such nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or
in part to any other position of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    Abandonment. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any
reason for a period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such land
shall conform to the regulations specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the
district in which such land is located.
   (d)    Accessory Structure. No additional structure not conforming to the
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such
nonconforming use of land nor shall any existing structure be allowed to
expand. (Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-86.)
   1365.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES WITH PERMITTED USES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, passed February 27, 1973, that could not be
built under the terms of this article by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-86.)
   (a)    Expansion of Residential and Nonresidential Structures. A
nonconforming residential or nonresidential structure which contains a
permitted use may be enlarged or altered provided that such enlargement or
alteration conforms to the following requirements: A structure devoted to a
permitted residential or nonresidential use in the district in which it is
located shall be allowed to expand by not more than twenty-five percent (25%)
of the existing first floor area. Such expansion shall not extend beyond the
existing nonconforming side or rear yard building lines. No enlargement or
alteration shall occur in any required front yard in a manner that increases
its nonconformity.
      (Ord. 0-774. Passed 6-13-95.)
   (b)    Reconstruction. In the event that a nonconforming residential or
nonresidential structure which contains a permitted use is damaged or destroyed
by any means to any extent it may be reconstructed provided that such
reconstruction does not occupy a greater area than the structure that was
damaged or destroyed and provided that reconstruction starts within two years.
   (c)    Moving. No nonconforming residential or nonresidential structure
shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance to another location on the
same or on another lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to
the regulations of the district in which it is located after being moved.
      (Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-86.)
   1365.05  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES.
   If a lawful residential or business use of a structure, or structure and
premises in combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Zoning Ordinance, passed February 27, 1973, that would not be allowed
in the district under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, the lawful
nonconforming residential or business use may be continued subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)    Expansion. A structure devoted to a residential or business use not
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance in the district in which it is located may be
allowed to expand once by not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
existing floor area, provided however, that such enlargement may be made only
upon application to and authorization by the Board of Zoning Appeals. The
expansion of a structure containing a nonconforming residential or business use
may be authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals only if the following findings
of fact are made relative to the proposed expansion:
      (1)    That the proposed expansion will not adversely affect the health,
safety and welfare of persons residing or working in the district;
      (2)    That the proposed expansion will not cause a depreciation of the
value of other property and uses permitted in the district;
      (3)    That the proposed expansion will not significantly increase
traffic congestion;
      (4)    That the proposed expansion will not adversely affect the privacy
of persons residing in the immediate vicinity;
      (5)    That the proposed expansion will not reduce parking incidental to
the nonconforming use of the structure;
      (6)    That the proposed expansion will not increase the hazard in the
area of fire, offensive noise, smoke, dust, debris or other objectionable
influences;
      (7)    That the proposed expansion will not adversely affect any
recreational, institutional or other use previously authorized by the Board;
and
      (8)    That the proposed expansion will not inhibit the desirability,
feasibility and likelihood of future residential or commercial development or
expansion in the immediate vicinity.
Any such expansion of a nonconforming use of a structure shall not be
authorized unless the area that is expanded conforms to applicable off-street
parking provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. The portion of the nonconforming
use of a structure being enlarged shall conform to the setback provisions and
yard requirements of the district in which it is located. The Board shall have
the right to authorize such other reasonable restrictions upon the proposed
expansion as deemed necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of
persons residing within the vicinity of the nonconforming use.
   (b)    Extension. A nonconforming use of a structure may be extended to any
portion of the building that was designed or arranged for such use at the time
of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance. The extension of the
nonconforming use outside of the structure shall be subject to the provisions
of subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)    Change. Any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and
premises in combination, may be changed to another nonconforming use, provided
that the Board of Zoning Appeals, either by general rule or by making findings
in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate
or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In
permitting such change, the Board may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)    Reconstruction. When nonconforming use status applies to a structure,
or structure and premises in combination, the removal or destruction of the
structure shall eliminate the nonconforming use status of the land and any
further development or construction on the land shall conform to the applicable
zoning requirements of that district. Destruction for the purpose of the
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%)
of the replacement cost at the time of destruction.
   (e)    Repairs and Maintenance. On any structure devoted in whole or in part
to a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive
months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding twenty-five percent
(25%) of the current replacement value of the building at the time the
application for the permit is made, provided that the square footage of the
building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of the Zoning
Ordinance, passed February 27, 1973, shall not be increased.
   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition any structure or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by the Director of the Division of Code Administration, upon order of
such official.
(Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-86.)
   1365.06  PERMITTED CONDITIONAL USES NOT NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any use permitted as a conditional use, as provided in this Zoning
Ordinance, shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in such district. (Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-
86.)
   1365.07  TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USE STATUS.
   (a)    Abandonment. A nonconforming use of a structure which has been
abandoned shall not thereafter be returned to such nonconforming use. For
purposes of administration of the Zoning Ordinance, a nonconforming use shall
be considered abandoned:
      (1)    When the use of the structure has been discontinued for a period
of twelve consecutive months; or
      (2)    When the characteristic equipment and furnishings of the
nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been
replaced by similar equipment within one year; or (Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-86.)
      (3)    When all utility services have been disconnected from the
structure. (Ord. 0-774. Passed 6-13-95.)
   (b)    Replacement of Nonconforming Use. Any structure, or structure and
premises in combination in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a
permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which such structure, or structure and premises in combination, is located and
the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
(Ord. 0-465. Passed 9-23-86.)
   1365.08  EXISTING AGRICULTURAL, MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL USES
SAFEGUARDED.
   The prohibitions contained in this article shall not apply to alterations or
additions to or replacement of buildings or structures by any farm, industry or
manufacturer, or to the use of land presently owned by any farm, industry or
manufacturer but not used for agricultural, industrial or manufacturing
purposes, or to the use or acquisition of additional land which may be required
for the protection, continuing development or expansion of any agricultural,
industrial or manufacturing operation or any present or future satellite
agricultural, industrial or manufacturing use. If a nonconforming use has been
abandoned, any future use of such land, building or structure shall be in
conformity with the provisions of the article regulating the use in the
district in which such land, building or structure may be located; provided,
however, that abandonment of any particular agricultural, industrial or
manufacturing process shall not be construed as abandonment of an agricultural,
industrial or manufacturing use. (Conformance with Section 8-24-50 of the West
Virginia Code.)

1367.06 APPLICATION AND PERMIT PROCESS.
   The Development Director is authorized to issue permits for the use of
public sidewalks for restaurant tables, chairs, and similar or related
equipment for the purpose of serving food and non-intoxicating beer to the
public, subject to the following conditions.
   (a)    An Outdoor Dining Area permit shall be required prior to placing
tables, chairs, or any other equipment on any public sidewalk. Permits issued
hereunder shall be valid from January 1 through December 31 of said calendar
year, unless revoked prior to expiration, and may be renewed on an annual
basis. An application for an Outdoor Dining Area permit shall be accompanied by
a $50.00 administrative fee. An annual renewal permit fee of $25.00 shall be
assessed for an existing Outdoor Dining Area permit. Any Outdoor Dining Areas
that do not project more than two and one-half feet into the sidewalk from the
line of the abutting property are still required to complete an Outdoor Dining
Area permit application but all administrative fees will be waived.
   (b)    Any Operator holding a valid existing permit for a particular Outdoor
Dining Area that continues to utilize that Outdoor Dining Area, shall be deemed
to have re-applied for permission to use the same space for a succeeding permit
term. Such Operator shall pay the annual renewal permit fee, complete all
renewal paperwork and comply with any other renewal requirements of the
Development Department, within thirty (30) days of the commencement of the
succeeding permit term. If the Operator fails to meet all renewal requirements
within the thirty (30) days, then the Operator's permit shall be deemed to have
expired.
   (c)   A completed Outdoor Dining Area permit application shall include: a
site plan, drawn to scale showing the layout for the Outdoor Dining Area which
accurately depicts the existing sidewalk conditions, including sidewalk width
from building face to curb; location and dimensions of tree wells; locations of
lamp posts, traffic and parking signs, signal poles, trash receptacles,
benches, bicycle racks, and other sidewalk features or obstructions; as well as
design, location, size and space of the dining area, chairs, tables,
enclosures, aisles between tables; routes of ingress and egress; clearances
between the seating area and the curb, a picture  and/or description of the
barrier/landscape materials to be used, as well as any outdoor furniture and
any such additional requirements of the Development Department with respect to
type, style, or specifications of the Outdoor Dining Area, including those
requirements that may be subject to approval of the West Virginia Alcohol
Beverage Control Administration.
The design and placement of tables and chairs, as well as other equipment,
shall comply with applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities
Act. Outdoor Dining Area shall not be allowed within ten (10) feet of a fire
hydrant, Fire Department standpipe connection, fire escape, loading zone, mail
boxes, bus stops or traffic signal stanchions. No permits will be issued for
off-site seating (i.e. seating in front of another business).
   (d)    After reviewing the application and site plan, the Development
Director shall determine if the proposed Outdoor Dining Area, consistent with
the requirements of this article, is reasonable, promotes pedestrian and retail
friendly vitality, and that there is no less than forty-eight (48) inches
remaining within the public right-of- way to facilitate safe circulation of
pedestrian traffic, while promoting the overall public health, safety, and
welfare. Thereafter, the Development Director may approve, approve with
conditions, or deny an application. The permit shall be posted at the
Operator's premises, visible to customers and the public. No material change to
the approved plan shall be made without prior written approval by the
Development Department and West Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control
Administration.
   (e)    If serving non-intoxicating beer, a conditional permit will be
granted for the outdoor dining area until the operator submits documentation
from the West Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Administration giving the
operator approval for serving non-intoxicating beer within the Outdoor dining
area. At that time, a final permit will be issued.
   (f)    The issuance of an Outdoor Dining Area permit does not grant or imply
vested rights to use the area by the Operator but instead is a privilege
granted to the Operator. The City retains the right to deny the issuance of a
permit or the renewal of a permit for any lawful reason. The City shall have
broad discretion to grant or revoke permits issued pursuant to this article in
the interests of promoting pedestrian and retail friendly vitality, and improve
the overall public health, safety and welfare. The City shall also have the
right and power to prohibit the operation of an outdoor dining area at any
time, because of the anticipated or actual problems and conflicts in the use of
the sidewalk area. Such problems and conflicts may arise from, but are not
limited to, scheduled festivals and similar events or parades or marches, or
repairs to the street or sidewalk, or from demonstrations or emergencies
occurring in the area. The Development Director may suspend or revoke the
Outdoor Dining Area permit after providing at least three days' prior written
notice, except in an emergency, to the Operator.  (Ord. 0-1574.  Passed 9-26-

APPENDIX B
Group Housing Projects
   (a)    Purpose and Scope. It is the purpose of the Regulations for Group
Housing Projects to allow greater flexibility in planning projects of the group
type by releasing them from the yard requirements in effect for single
structures on single lots, but at the same time to assure that such
developments will have enough open space for light, air, recreation and
pedestrian circulation, adequate street capacity for vehicular circulation and
access, sufficient off-street parking space and other amenities.
(Ord. A-2530. Passed 2-27-73.)
   (b)    Definition. "Group Housing Project" means a group of two or more
multi-family dwellings on a parcel of ground not less than 50,000 square feet
in area in single or multiple ownership with not less than fifty feet of
frontage on a public street, which frontage shall serve as the principal means
of access to the property, and with at least fifty feet of such access in open,
continuous frontage unobstructed by buildings to a depth not less than 100
feet. (Ord. A-2761. Passed 8-27-74.)
   (c)    Regulations. A Group Housing Project shall conform to the following
regulations.
      (1)    Density.
         A.    Minimum lot area per dwelling unit. The minimum lot area per
dwelling unit shall be 2,500 square feet.
         B.    Conditions applicable to the density calculation.
            1.    In a Group Housing Project, all land proposed within the
project for residential use, including outdoor use space, interior streets and
other circulation ways, may be counted as part of the lot area in complying
with the density requirement.
            2.    A Group Housing Project shall be considered as one parcel,
regardless of the extent to which the parcel is subdivided by interior streets.
            3.    If a Group Housing Project parcel is cut by a zoning district
boundary line, the density provisions of the district in which each portion of
a Group Housing Project is located shall apply unless a plan is approved by the
Board of Zoning Appeals permitting a different distribution of dwelling units,
except that the total number of dwelling units shall not exceed the number
resulting from adding together the number permitted in each district.
      (2)    Vehicular access.
         A.    Total dwelling units in relation to paved widths of exterior
streets serving the project: the maximum number of dwelling units in any Group
Housing Project, as determined by the density limitations hereinafter
specified, shall be further controlled by the cumulative number of units
gaining vehicular access to exterior public streets serving the project at any
one point of entry, in accordance with the following standards.
 
                                                 Minimum Paved Width for
Cumulative Number of Dwelling Units              Boundary
          at Any One Point of Entry      Street or Other Exterior
                                                 Street (feet)
less than 20                                     20
20 to 99                                         24
100 to 499                                       36
500 to 999                                       44
         B.    Distance of residential structures from vehicular access and
public streets: every residential structure in a Group Housing Project shall be
within 200 feet of vehicular access and within 400 feet of a public street. For
the purposes of this section, vehicular access means any of the following:
            1.    A walkway intended primarily for pedestrian use, but so
designed as to be usable for vehicular traffic in case of emergency or special
service, and having a paved width of no less than nine feet.
            2.    A paved parking area and any access drive thereto, the latter
having a paved width of no less than twelve feet in the case of a single-lane
drive and no less than eighteen feet in the case of a two-lane drive.
            3.    A street, as defined in the Subdivision Regulations.
         C.    Interior Streets: in cases where a Group Housing Project is to
have interior streets, their paved widths shall be in accordance with the
design standards contained in the Subdivision Regulations.
      (3)    Open space, setbacks and courts.
         A.    General regulations not applicable: except as hereinbefore
specified with respect to density requirements, the district regulations
governing single structures on separate lots shall not apply to Group Housing
Projects, which instead shall be governed by the requirements hereinafter
specified.
         B.    Open space.
            1.    Principal buildings.
               a.    General: Around every principal building there shall be a
minimum required open space, unobstructed by any other building, which shall be
provided in an amount and manner hereinafter specified.
               b.    Overlapping of open space: The open space allocated to any
principal building may overlap the open space allocated to any other principal
building.
               c.    Required open space:
                  (i)    There shall be an open space for each story, measured
at right angles to each side of, and outside of, the rectangle of least area
within which the principal building could be enclosed at each story.
(ii)    Opposite one longer side of such enclosing rectangle, the open space in
its least dimensions shall be not less than sixty feet, which minimum shall be
increased at the rate of five feet per story for a building height in excess of
two stories and at the rate of one foot for each five feet by which the
rectangle exceeds sixty feet, except as provided for setbacks from street
lines.
                  (iii)    When the enclosing rectangle is a square, any one of
its sides may be considered as the one longer side.
                  (iv)    Opposite each of the three sides other than the one
longer side of the enclosing rectangle, open space in its least dimension shall
be not less than thirty feet, which minimum shall be increased at the rate of
two and one-half feet per story for a building height in excess of two stories
and at the rate of one foot for each ten feet by which the length of the
rectangle exceeds sixty feet, except as provided for setbacks from street
lines.
               (v)    Where the controls specified in paragraphs (i) through
(iv) above do not apply, no building shall be closer than twelve feet to any
other building.
            d.    Credits toward required open space:
(i)    The area of any open space between the side of the enclosing rectangle
and the wall of the building may be credited toward the area of the required
open space outside such enclosing rectangle, and abutting the same side of the
rectangle.
(ii)    Such credit shall be made by reducing one dimension of the required
open space outside the enclosing rectangle, measured perpendicularly between
the side of such rectangle and the building wall, the least amount possible for
such area reduction, provided that the reduced dimension shall in no case be
less than one-half that originally required, or thirty feet, whichever is
greater.
            2.    Accessory buildings. No accessory building shall encroach
upon any open space required for any principal building.
         C.    Setbacks from property lines other than street lines:
            1.    Principal buildings. The minimum distance between a property
line other than a street line and the nearest side of the rectangle of least
area enclosing any principal building shall be determined according to the
requirements for minimum open space around a principal building, as specified
in subparagraph (c)(3)B.1. hereof, except that where no side of the enclosing
rectangle of a principal building is parallel to such property line:
            a.    The minimum distance between the property line and the
nearest side of the rectangle of least area enclosing any principal building
may be taken as an average, provided that the minimum distance at either end of
the side of the rectangle shall in no case be less than one-half that
originally required, or thirty feet, whichever is greater.
b.    The minimum distance required because of the length of the side of the
enclosing rectangle of least area shall be based on the length of the side of
the enclosing rectangle most nearly parallel to the property line.
         2.    Accessory buildings. The minimum distance between a property
line other than a street line and an accessory building shall be ten feet,
which minimum shall be increased at the rate of five feet per story for a
building height in excess of one story and at the rate of two feet for each
five feet by which the length of the building exceeds twenty-five feet,
provided that in no case need the setback exceed thirty feet.
      D.    Setbacks from street lines.
         1.    Principal buildings.
            a.    The minimum distance between a street line and the nearest
side of the rectangle of least area enclosing any principal building shall be
twenty feet, which minimum shall be increased at the rate of five feet per
story for a building height in excess of two stories and at the rate of one
foot for each six feet by which the length of the rectangle exceeds sixty feet,
except as provided in subparagraph c. below.
b.    Where no side of the enclosing rectangle is parallel to the street line,
the increase above the minimum of twenty feet required because of the length of
the side of the enclosing rectangle shall be based on the length of the side of
the enclosing rectangle most nearly parallel to the property line.
            c.    Where an exterior street abuts a Group Housing Project parcel
or is extended into the parcel as an interior street, and fifty-one percent or
more of the lots on the same side of the street within the same block and
within 200 feet of the bounding line of such parcel are improved with residence
buildings, no principal building shall project beyond the average alignment of
the residence buildings, provided that no setback shall be less than ten feet
and need not exceed forty feet in depth.
         2.    Accessory buildings. No accessory building shall be closer to
any street line than fifty feet.
      E.    Courts (inner or outer). The least dimension of a court shall be
thirty feet, which minimum shall be increased at the rate of five feet per
story for a building height in excess of two stories and at the rate of one
foot for each five feet by which the wall length exceeds sixty feet, provided
that the open space allocated to any wall may overlap that allocated to any
other wall facing the same court. For the purposes of determining the length of
a building wall, the length shall be deemed the longest side of the rectangle
of least area within which such wall could be enclosed.
      (4)    Building coverage. The total ground floor area of the buildings
shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the area of the Group Housing Project
parcel.
         A.    Group Housing Projects, in addition to being subject to Article
1363 where applicable, shall comply with the requirements contained in
subparagraphs B. through F. hereunder.
B.    As an accessory use for each dwelling unit, not less than 180 square feet
of land or building area shall be set apart and developed as automobile parking
space along with ingress and egress from the street or streets to which each
parking space has vehicular access.
         C.    Automobile parking spaces within the boundaries of a Group
Housing Project shall be located not farther than 200 feet from the buildings
they are designed to serve.
         D.    No parking areas other than those provided as an integral part
of a building shall be located closer than fifteen feet to any principal
building.
         E.    The maximum vertical grade of any drive leading to a parking
compound shall be fifteen percent.
         F.    All parking areas for ten or more vehicles shall be paved with
asphalt or concrete and shall be drained to provide for surface water run-off.
      (5)    Distance from fire hydrants. No part of any building shall be more
than 400 feet distant from a fire hydrant capable of furnishing an adequate
water supply for fire-fighting purposes as defined by the National Fire
Protection Association. All such fire hydrants shall be located not more than
eight feet from a roadway capable of supporting any fire apparatus of the Fire
Department of the City.
   (d)    Single Ownership. For the purposes of these regulations, property
may, at the option of the owner, be considered in single ownership even though
parts of it are owned by different corporations, all of which are subsidiaries
of the same parent corporation or by corporations in which fifty-one percent or
more of the stock is owned by the same person or persons.
   (e)    Transmittal of Site Plan. Every Final Site Plan submitted to the
administrative official shall be transmitted to the Development Department for
review and report to the administrative official.
   (f)    Recording of Parcel Plat Covenants.
      (1)    Prior to the commencement of construction of any building under
the provisions of these regulations, the owner of a Group Housing Project
parcel shall file with the administrative official a plat, in quadruplicate,
showing the layout and occupancy of the buildings to be constructed on such
parcel and the land which is to be used to meet the requirements of these
regulations as to density, open space, setbacks, yards, courts, vehicular
access, building coverage, automobile parking space and other outdoor use
space, together with a written instrument, approved as to form by the City
Attorney, in which such owner shall covenant on behalf of himself, his heirs,
executors and assigns, not to  encroach upon the land used to satisfy the
requirements of these regulations as to density, open space, setbacks, courts,
vehicular access, building coverage, automobile parking space and other outdoor
use space, and that the land used to satisfy such requirements shall not be
considered as satisfying the requirements for any other building or group of
multiple dwellings erected under the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)    No building permit for the construction of any building on a Group
Housing Project parcel shall be issued by the administrative official until the
owner of such parcel has filed with the administrative official the covenants
and plats required under subsection (f)(1) hereof. The administrative official
shall cause a copy of this covenant to be recorded at the cost of the owner in
the office of the County Recorder, Wood County, West Virginia.
      (3)    Nothing herein shall be construed aa preventing the owner of a
Group Housing Project parcel from modifying the plat, provided that such
modification complies in all respects with the Regulations for Group Housing
Projects, but no building permit shall be issued for any building in accordance
with the modified plat until copies of such modified plat have been filed with
the administrative official.
   (g)    Modifications of  the Regulations.
      (1)    In cases where there are special conditions or characteristics
pertaining to a Group Housing Project parcel, or where special design features
are proposed for a Group Housing Project, or where greater livability would
result from modification of one or more provisions of these regulations, the
City Development Department shall have the power to modify such regulations,
provided that such modifications shall remain in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance, so that the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare will be conserved and
justice done.
      (2)    The submission of requests for modifications and the approval of
such modifications shall be in accord with procedures and standards adopted by
the City Development Department, after a duly advertised public hearing, as
Modifications of Zoning Ordinance Regulations, which regulations shall be
consistent with this Zoning Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations.
      (3)    Approval of any modification or modifications by the City
Development Department shall constitute the basis for the issuance of a
building permit, provided that all other requirements of these regulations have
been complied with, and provided further that such modification or
modifications have been incorporated on the parcel plat covenant in accord with
the procedures hereinbefore specified.

Code do not apply, or the requirements of the Building Code are adequately
satisfied by other means.
      (Ord. 0-1508.  Passed 5-12-15.)
   1711.07  APPEALS.
   (a)   An appeal taken from the requirement, notice, order, decision or the
determination made by the administrative official charged with the enforcement

   1711.08  VARIANCES AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   The board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that
the provisions of the Building Code inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
appellant.  The Board may grant a variance provided the following findings are
made, where relevant, in a given case:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions to the
particular property, and that the necessary hardship is due to such conditions,
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of
the Building Code;
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Building Code and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
      (3)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
      (4)   The that variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
      (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue. 
   (b)   In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
the Building Code.
   (c)   Special Exceptions.  The Board shall hear and decide requests for all
special exceptions as provided in this section and in accordance with such
standards and criteria contained in this section.  In granting a special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in
addition to those expressed in the section, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes and intent of the Building Code.
(Ord. 0-1508.  Passed 5-12-15.)
   1711.09  REMEDIES AND PENALTY.
   (a)   The Board or any designated enforcement official may institute a suit
for injunction in the Circuit Court of Wood County, West Virginia, in the name
of the City, to restrain an individual or a governmental unit from violating
the provisions of the Building Code.  The Board or any designated enforcement
official may also institute a suit for mandatory injunction in the Circuit
Court of Wood County, West Virginia, in the name of the City, directing an
individual or governmental unit to remove a structure erected in violation of
the provisions of this Building Code.  If the Board or any designated
enforcement official is successful in its suit, the respondent shall bear the
costs of the action.

      (35)   Start of Construction.  The date the permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date.  The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.  Although
a permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure.  For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
      (36)   State Coordinating Office.  The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management
      (37)   Stream.  As defined in WV State Code 7-1-3U, any watercourse,

liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured
home.
      (39)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.  Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.  See "Substantial Improvement."
      (40)   Substantial Improvement.
         A.   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the Start of Construction of the
improvement. 
         B.   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed.  The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         C.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      (41)   Top of Bank.  The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (42)   Violation.  The failure of any structure or development to be
fully compliant with all the requirements of this ordinance. Any structure or
other development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(Ord. 0-1465.  Passed 10-22-13.)
   1761.04  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Parkersburg which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood,
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Parkersburg by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated November 6, 2013 or the most recent
revision thereof  including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the City of Parkersburg by use of
historic or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local
Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the
level of technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas.  The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway  shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area. 
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the City of Parkersburg where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes.  However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
      (2)   A City of Parkersburg's base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon
as practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the City of Parkersburg shall notify the NFIP Administrator
of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The City of Parkersburg may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard
Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies. 
   (d)   Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Parkersburg. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail.  Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. 
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this ordinance if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either; 1. The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or 2. The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the City
of Parkersburg in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall then
be required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of
this ordinance.
         (Ord. 0-1465.  Passed 10-22-13.)
   1761.05  UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the City
of Parkersburg during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant
engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.  In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued. 
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
City of Parkersburg, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the
adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood
hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland
limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe.  Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE without Floodway.  Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.  This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).  Within any Approximated Floodplain
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding. 
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine; 1. The amount being invested and, 2. The
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
will be reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
are required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered Professional
Engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study shall include a cover letter,
signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in
basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
See appendix 4.4 for Sample "Approximated floodplain (Zone A) techniques"
   (e)   Alteration or relocation of a stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Parkersburg,  The Floodplain Administrator, the
State Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property
owners of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of
the stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the
local permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval.
   See appendix 4.5 for Sample "Stream Alteration process and contact sheet"
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Parkersburg in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained.  The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment.  If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage.  These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City of Parkersburg a
legal agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be
performed on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and
other stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
transfer this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the
watercourse alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and
provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1761.09(c).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.

be prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
               a.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               b.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

            3.    In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion
agreement and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion
agreement to any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of
the transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1761.09(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.
      (1)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
         A.   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
         B.   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
         C.   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites.  All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
         D.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments
which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the
approximated floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2)
acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and
shall delineate a floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain
Administrator.
            1.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
            2.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
            3.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. 
         E.   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary.  In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly
delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard
boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer
or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.

and has no permanently attached additions, or
         C.    Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
ordinance.
      (5)   Fill.  The City of Parkersburg officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore;
         A.   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
         B.   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
         C.   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
         D.   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1761.05(a) of this ordinance.  All fill placed in the special flood hazard area
shall meet or exceed the following standards:
            1.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties.  The City of Parkersburg may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties.  When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City of Parkersburg During permit review the City of
Parkersburg shall consider the following issues that have the potential to
cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
               a.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
               b.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
               c.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing
structures.
               d.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
               e.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
            2.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
            3.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid
ponding)
            4.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access.  For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection.  For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended
use.  At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond
the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of
the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
            5.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only.  Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
            6.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
            7.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two
(2) horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are
submitted to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
            8.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
               a.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or
less will be protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds,
or similar vegetative undergrowth.
               b.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet
per second will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock
slope protection.
            9.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area
shall obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when
directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be
issued. After fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a
Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of
compliance can be issued.
            10.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures and other development.  All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area.  Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area.  The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of    flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be
stored below Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection. 
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage.
         A.   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
         B.   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (12)   Backflow Preventers.  Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area.  (Ord. 0-1465.  Passed 10-22-13.)
   1761.08  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of Floodplain Administrator:  The City Engineer is hereby
appointed as Floodplain Administrator and is vested with the responsibility,
authority and means to implement the commitments made in our agreement with the

Floodplain Administrator shall also be responsible for submitting all required
reports to FEMA concerning the City of Parkersburg's participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program.
   (b)   Development Permits and Site Plan Approvals Required.  It shall be
unlawful for any contractor, person, partnership, business, or corporation to
undertake or cause to be undertaken, any development or the new construction,
substantial improvement, repair of substantial damage, the placement or
relocation of any structure (including manufactured homes) within City of
Parkersburg, unless a permit application and standard site plan has been
completed, and a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator. 
In addition, where land that is either partially or fully in the special flood
hazard area is to be subdivided, utilized for a manufactured home park or
subdivision or otherwise developed, a detailed site plan shall be submitted to,
and approved by, the Floodplain Administrator prior to any development.
   (c)   Approval of Permits and Plans.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be
reviewed; all permit applications and plans in order to determine whether
proposed building sites are reasonably safe from flooding.
      (2)   All permits and plans shall be approved only after it has been
determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance with
the requirements of the state and all other applicable codes and ordinances.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall not issue a permit to any person
who does not possess a valid contractor's license when a contractor's license
is required by West Virginia State Code §21-11-10.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator, before issuance of the permit, shall
require the applicant to furnish satisfactory proof that such person is duly
licensed as a contractor under the provisions of West Virginia State Code. If
the applicant is not licensed a written affidavit that such person is not
subject to licensure as a contractor or subcontractor as defined in §21-11-

      (9)   The City of Parkersburg shall provide sufficient space to allow the
Floodplain Administrator to keep on file in perpetuity, in a location safe from
natural hazards, all information collected during the course of the
administration of this ordinance.
   (d)   Application Procedures.  Application for a permit and/or site plan
approvals shall be made, in writing, on the forms supplied by the City of
Parkersburg, and shall include all information stipulated under Article V of
this ordinance.
   (e)   Changes.  After the issuance of a permit or site plan approval by the
Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made to the
application, permit, or any of the plans, specification or other documents
submitted with the application without the written consent or approval of the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (f)   Permit Placards.  The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit
placard, which shall be prominently displayed on the premises during the time
construction is in progress. This placard shall show the number of the permit,
the date of its issuance and be signed by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (g)   Start of Construction.  Work on the proposed development shall begin
within 180 days after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall
expire unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. All work on the proposed development shall be completed within
18 months of permit issuance, at which time the permit shall expire, unless a
time extension is granted in writing by the Floodplain Administrator. The
request for a time extension shall be in writing and shall state the reasons
for the extension.  When considering an extension, the Floodplain Administrator
shall consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Has the developer diligently pursued the completion of the proposed
development during the 18 months?
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,
health, or welfare or injurious to other property?
   (h)   Inspections, Stop-Work Orders, Violation Notice and Revocations.
      (1)   Inspections.
         A.   Upon learning of a potential violation of this ordinance, the
Floodplain Administrator or staff shall investigate to determine whether a
violation has occurred.
         B.   During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or
other authorized official may inspect the premises to determine that the work
is progressing in compliance with the information provided on the permit
application and with all applicable laws and ordinances. 
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized official may
inspect any development covered by this or previous ordinance to determine
whether any portion of the development has been altered to be in non-compliance
with the requirements of this ordinance.
      (2)   Stop-Work Orders.  The Floodplain Administrator shall immediately
issue, or cause to be issued, a "Stop-Work Order" for any development found
ongoing without having obtained a floodplain determination or a permit. 
Disregard of a stop work order shall subject the violator to the penalties
described in Section
1761.09(c).
      (3)   Violation Notice and Revocations.  When it appears after
investigation that a permitted development is non-compliant with the provisions
of this law and/or the conditions of the permit, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify the violator by means of written violation notice.  The violation
notice shall specify the nature of the violation and request that the violation
be corrected within fifteen (15) days from the date appearing on the notice. 
Failure to correct the violation within this time period shall be cause for
revocation of the permit and the governing body, or authorized employee or
agent to:
         A.   Seek an injunction in the Circuit Court of Wood County to
restrain the violator from continuing the violation, including but not limited
to requests for the removal of structures or land uses from the property
involved; and
         B.   Seek a misdemeanor conviction in magistrate court or circuit
court.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the building or land conforms to the requirements of this local law. Occupying
or using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1761.09(c).
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the
inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by
the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular development
being inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1761.09(c).
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1761.09(c).
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this ordinance or local administrative procedures,
and any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood
proofing certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as
a condition of permit approval.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   A Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by the City of Parkersburg
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this ordinance shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to the City of Parkersburg based upon a set schedule approved by the
City of Parkersburg using the estimated value of the proposed construction as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
City of Parkersburg for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development.  Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs.  Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the County for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway.  To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.  (Ord. 0-1465.  Passed 10-22-
13.)
   1761.09  APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals.  Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provision of this ordinance, it is
the right of that person to appeal to the Town Council of the City of
Parkersburg which shall be known as the Appeals Board. Such appeal shall be
filed with the Town Council of the City of Parkersburg, in writing, within
thirty (30) days after notification of the decision.  Upon receipt of such
appeal, the Appeals Board shall set a time and place not less than (ten (10)
nor more than (sixty (60) days for the purpose of hearing the appeal.  Notice
of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to all parties at which
time they may appear and be heard.  The determination by the Appeals Board
shall be final in all cases.
          (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this ordinance
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that
failure to grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of an appeal will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.  Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a City of Parkersburg official that (i) the issuance of a decision
to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result
in increased premium rates for flood insurance, (ii) such construction below
the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property.  Such
notifications shall be maintained with a record of all decisions as required in
paragraph (4) of this section; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such decisions
issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA)..
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties.  Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this ordinance or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the City of Parkersburg,
shall be unlawful and shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Parkersburg of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00)
or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. Each day
during which any violation of this ordinance continues shall constitute a
separate offense.  In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this ordinance.  The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or
non-compliance with, this ordinance shall not excuse the violation or non-
compliance with the ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within
a reasonable time.  Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in non-compliance with this ordinance may be declared by the Town
Council of the City of Parkersburg to be a public nuisance and abatable as
such.  (Ord. 0-1465.  Passed 10-22-13.)
   1761.10  GOVERNMENT ACTIONS.
   (a)   Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
      (1)   The County floodplain ordinance in effect on the date of annexation
shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all
annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which
meets or exceeds the  requirements for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (2)   Municipalities with existing floodplain ordinances shall pass a
resolution acknowledging and accepting responsibility for enforcing floodplain
ordinance standards prior to annexation of any area containing identified flood
hazards.
      (3)   All plats or maps of annexation shall show the special flood hazard
area boundaries, Base Flood Elevation and location of floodway where
determined.
      (4)   In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 44
Subpart (B) Section 59.22 (a) (9) (v) all NFIP participating communities will
notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State
Coordinating Office in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of
Parkersburg have been modified by annexation or the City of Parkersburg has
otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce flood plain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that all Flood Insurance
Rate Maps accurately represent the City of Parkersburg's boundaries, a copy of
a map of the City of Parkersburg suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating
the new corporate limits or new area for which the City of Parkersburg has
assumed or relinquished flood plain management regulatory authority shall be
included with the notification.
   (b)   Permits for Government Entities.  Unless specifically exempted by law,

addition the entity claiming exemption shall provide copies of all relevant
legal documentation demonstrating the exemption.  (Ord. 0-1465.  Passed 10-22-
13.)
   1761.11  SEVERABILITY AND MUNICIPAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Severability.  If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence,
clause, or phrase of this ordinance shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this
ordinance which shall remain in full force and effect and for this purpose the
provisions of this ordinance are hereby declared to be severable.
   (b)   Liability.  The granting of a permit or approval of a subdivision or
development plan in an identified flood-prone area, shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the City of Parkersburg,
or by any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the
proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the City of Parkersburg.

ARTICLE 1765
Vacant Buildings
1765.01   Purpose.
1765.02   Definitions.
1765.03   Inspection.
1765.04   Corrective action.
1765.05   Registration generally.
1765.06   Right of appeal.
1765.07   Amending information.
1765.08   Non-payment of fees/liens.
   1765.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)    The City has determined that an uninspected and unmonitored vacant
building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (b)    Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings with the City, make payment of a fee for the registration
thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building regulations.
   (c)    This article ensures that, through a registration, inspection, and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and/or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not present otherwise
a public hazard.
   (d)    The City, by and through Its departments shall inspect and monitor
vacant buildings (especially vacant downtown buildings), shall assess the
effects of the condition of those buildings on nearby structures, and shall
promote substantial efforts to rehabilitate and develop such buildings when
appropriate.
   These provisions will streamline and consolidate the existing procedure
(that is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders, fines, liens,
appeals and due process lien enforcement), by placing the responsibility to
register and maintain vacant structures on the building owner before a
building's condition falls into disrepair or otherwise merits a complaint. 
(Ord. 0-1476.  Passed 6-24-14.)
   1765.02  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following words and
phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows:
      (1)   Boarded: A building or structure subject to the provision of this
section shall be deemed to be "boarded" if in place of one or more exterior
doors, other than a storm door, or of one or more windows, there is a sheet or
sheets of plywood or similar material covering the space for such door or
window.
      (2)   Exterior maintenance and major systems: The phrase "exterior
maintenance and major systems" shall mean the safe and lawful maintenance of
the facade, windows, doors, roof and other parts of the exterior of the
building and the maintenance of its major systems consisting of the roof, the
electrical and plumbing systems, the water supply system, the sewer system, and
the sidewalk, driveway, if any, area of the lot, as applicable and as enforced
by the City, particularly in connection with codes adopted by the City as well
as all applicable local, state and federal laws.
      (3)   Occupied: Any building or structure shall be deemed to be occupied
if one or more persons actually conducts a lawful business or resides in all or
any part of the building as the licensed business occupant, or as the legal or
equitable owner/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-transient basis,
or any combination of the same. For purposes of this section, evidence offered
to prove that a building is so occupied may include, but shall not be limited
to, the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail through the U.S. Postal
Service; proof of continual telephone, electric, gas, heating, water and sewer
services; a valid City business license, or the most recent, federal or state
income tax statements indicating that the subject property is the official
business or residence address of the person or business claiming occupancy; or
proof of bonafide pre-rental inspection.
      (4)   Open: A building or structure subject to the provisions of this
section shall be deemed to be "open" if anyone or more exterior doors other
than a storm door is broken, open and/or closed but, without a properly
functioning lock to secure it, or if one or more windows is broken or not
capable of being locked and secured from intrusion, or any combination of the
same.
      (5)   Owner: An owner of the freehold of the premises or any lesser
estate therein, a mortgagee, a vendee-in-possession, assignee of rents,
receiver, executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or
corporation that is directly or indirectly in control of a building subject to
the provisions of this section, and as set forth below.
      (6)   Vacant: A building or structure shall be deemed to be vacant if no
person or persons actually, currently conducts a lawfully licensed business, or
lawfully resides, dwells, or lives in any part of the building as the legal or
equitable owner(s) or tenant occupant(s), or owner-occupant(s), or tenant(s) on
a permanent, non-transient basis. A building or structure shall be deemed
vacant and subject to the registration and possible penalty provisions provided
herein if the exterior maintenance and major systems of the building and the
surrounding real property thereof, as defined in this section, are in violation
of the building codes or health and sanitation codes and if there is no proof
of continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources), water service, etc. Continued is meant to be
without more than one (1) thirty (30) day interruption in any given three-
hundred sixty (360) day period. In order for such continual utility service to
be considered as being actually in use as described in this section, it must be
more than merely registered to the owner for purposes of billing and must be
utilized, at a minimum, in order to keep the property and the major systems of
the building in compliance with building and safety codes. The person or entity
asserting that there has been continued utility service has the burden to
produce actual bills evidencing utility service for the relevant period.
   (b)    All vacant structures shall also comply with the following criteria:
      (1)   Exterior property areas are to be mowed regularly and non-
cultivated gardens maintained at no more than seventeen (17) inches of growth.
All noxious weeds are prohibited.
      (2)   Structure is to be broom swept and cleared of all contents, not
including building materials or components to be used in the future renovation
at that structure.
      (3)   Electrical service is to be provided to the building via temporary
pole service on the exterior of the structure or create a permanent service for
the structure and install two (2) GFCI protected receptacles.
      (4)   NEC and OSHA compliant string lighting is to be provided to the
entire structure so that it may be illuminated as needed to view the structure.
      (5)   Unstable interior and exterior surfaces and components are to be
removed. Unstable or unsound accessory buildings are to be razed or renovated.
      (6)   Using wood sheet goods; all loose, deteriorated and broken windows
and doors are to be covered to eliminate the danger of their falling and to
prevent the unwanted entry of trespassers. Such wood sheet goods are to be cut
and neatly fit, not just nailed over the opening.
      (7)   All loose or deteriorated trim, gutter or overhang extensions
(masonry or frame) are to be removed or reattached to prevent falling.
      (8)   Regular routine monitoring of the structure is to occur by the
owner to ensure that the building is being kept in compliance with the above
items.
      (9)   Utilities need to be connected to the structure.
   (c)   Applicability. The requirements of this section shall be applicable to
each owner of any building that is found to be vacant pursuant to the language
contained herein. Each such owner shall cause to be filed a notarized
registration statement, which shall include the street address and parcel
number of each such vacant building, the names and addresses of all owners, as
hereinafter described, and any other information deemed necessary by the City.
The registration fee(s) as required by this section shall be billed by the City
and shall be paid by last day of the month when the property has been
registered. For purposes of this section, the following shall also be
applicable:
      (1)   If the owner is a corporation, the registration statement shall
provide the names and residence addresses of all officers and directors of the
corporation and shall be accompanied by a copy of the most recent annual
franchise tax report filed with the secretary of state;
      (2)   If an estate, the name and business address of the executor of the
estate;
      (3)   If a trust, the name and address of all trustees, grantors, and
beneficiaries;
      (4)   If a partnership, the names and residence addresses of all partners
with an interest of ten percent or greater;
      (5)   If any other form of unincorporated association, the names and
residence addresses of all principals with an interest of ten percent or
greater;
      (6)   If an individual person, the name and residence address of that
individual person.  (Ord. 0-1476.  Passed 6-24-14.)
   1765.03  INSPECTION.
   (a)   At the time of registration, the Director of Code Enforcement, Fire
Chief, City Engineer and Police Chief shall determine whether it is necessary
for any or all of them to inspect the structure so as to identify any public
safety issues needing addressed. Inspections shall also be available to verify
the status of any property concerning occupancy, vacancy, etc. If an internal
inspection is deemed necessary, the owner will be notified of the same and
arrangements made for the same. If the owner fails or refuses to consent to and
arrange for an inspection, the City will seek an administrative search warrant
from a court of competent jurisdiction, which shall include the Municipal
Court, to authorize inspection of the premises for the purpose of determining
the structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to insure its
structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by firefighters and
police officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do
not present a hazard to the public during the time that the building remains
vacant.
   (b)   All vacant structures are subject to re-inspection on an annual basis
or as deemed necessary.  (Ord. 0-1476.  Passed 6-24-14.)
   1765.04  CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   The property owners shall be notified in writing of any corrective action
deemed necessary for life, safety and building code matters by City officials,
the applicable code provisions or regulations, and will be afforded a
reasonable time to the corrective action. Corrective action concerning the
occupancy of vacant structures is discussed later herein.
(Ord. 0-1476.  Passed 6-24-14.)
   1765.05  REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
   (a)    At the time of adoption of this article, all owners of realty within
the City of Parkersburg that contain a vacant structure, as defined above,
shall register the same with the Division of Code Enforcement of the City. For
those structures that qualify as a vacant structure and after the adoption of
this article, the owner thereof shall be required to register the structure
with the Division of Code Enforcement within thirty (30) days after the
structure is found to meet the definition of a vacant structure. The
registration form shall require information from the registrant deemed
necessary by the Director of Code Enforcement, Fire Chief, City Engineer and
Police Chief of the City, so as to ensure that the purpose of this article is
met. Specifically, the above named City officers shall have the authority to
require that the property owner provide a professional opinion (architect,
engineer, etc.) to determine the structural integrity of the building, the
repairs necessary to ensure its structural integrity and that it will be safe
for entry by firefighters and police officers in time of emergency, and that
the building and its contents do not present a hazard to the public during the
time the building remains vacant. The above named officers shall have the
authority to issue orders to the owner for corrective action deemed necessary.
The Director of Code Enforcement and Fire Chief shall rely upon the West
Virginia State Building Code and Fire Code, as well as other applicable law,
for guidance during any such structural review.
   (b)    Registration statement and fees; local agent. If none of the persons
listed, as above, is shown at an address within the state, the registration
statement also shall provide the name and address of a person who resides
within the state and who is authorized to accept service of process on behalf
of the owners and who shall be designated as a responsible, local party or
agent, both for purposes of notification in the event of an emergency affecting
the public health, safety or welfare and for purposes of service of any and all
notices or registration statements as herein authorized and in connection
herewith. Registration shall be required for all vacant buildings, whether
vacant and secure, vacant and open, or vacant and boarded, and shall be
required whenever any building has remained vacant for forty-five (45)
consecutive days or more. In no instance shall the registration of a vacant
building and the payment of registration fees be construed to exonerate the
owner, agent or responsible party for compliance with any other building code
or housing code requirement. One registration statement may be filed to include
all vacant buildings of the owner so registering, but each structure
constitutes a separate fee. The owner of the vacant property as of the last day
of the month when the property has been registered of each calendar year shall
be responsible for the payment of the non-refundable registration fee. Said fee
shall be billed by the City; and based on the duration of the vacancy as
determined by the following scale:
      (1)   No fee for properties that are vacant for less than one (1) year;
      (2)   One-hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for properties that are
vacant for one (1) year or more.
         (Ord. 0-1476.  Passed 6-24-14.)
   1765.06  RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   (a)    Appeal Rights. The owner shall have the right to appeal the
imposition of the registration fees to the Director of Public Works upon filing
an application in writing to the Division of Code Enforcement no later than
fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of the billing statement. On appeal,
the owner shall bear the burden of providing satisfactory objective proof of
occupancy as defined in this article specifically.
   (b)    One Time Waiver of Registration Fee. A one-time waiver of the
registration fee, or an extension of a waiver for up to ninety (90) days from
the date of the current billing statement, may be granted by the Director of
Public Works, or his designee upon application of the owner and upon review and
advice of the Director of Code Enforcement, Public Health and Safety Officials
and City Engineer; if the owner;
      (1)   Demonstrates with satisfactory proof to the Director of Public
Works or his designee that he/she is in the process of demolition,
rehabilitation, or other substantial repair of the vacant building; and
      (2)   Objectively demonstrates to the Director of Public Works or his
designee a reasonable anticipated length of time for the demolition,
rehabilitation, or other substantial repair of the vacant building;
      (3)   Provides satisfactory proof to the Director of Public Works or his
designee that he/she was actively attempting to sell or lease the property
during the vacancy period; or
      (4)   Provides satisfactory proof to the Director of Public Works to be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis, that the vacancy is temporary and may be due
to illness of the owner, active military service, or some other reasonable
explanation believed to be short term in nature and documentable as necessary.
      (5)   Within thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as possible, as the
waiver application is received by the Director of Public Works or his designee
shall grant or deny the waiver, or request for extension, in writing, and
dispatch the written decision by mail to the owner. If the owner properly
submitted an application for a one-time waiver or request for extension to the
Director of Public Works or his designee, and the Director of Public Works or
his designee rendered a decision which the owner seeks to appeal to the City
Council, the owner must file an application in writing no later than thirty
(30) calendar days from the date of the Director of Public Works or his
designee's decision. City Council shall either grant or deny the appeal.
Thereafter the decision of City Council is final unless within thirty (30) days
of such decision the owner appeals for injunctive relief to the Circuit Court
of Wood County.
         (Ord. 0-1476.  Passed 6-24-14.)
   1765.07  AMENDING INFORMATION.
   (a)    Duty to Amend Registration Statement. If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any calendar year, it is
the responsibility of the owner, responsible party or agent for the same to
contact the division of code enforcement within thirty (30) days of the
occurrence of such change and advise the division in writing of those changes.
   (b)    Exceptions. This section shall not apply to any building owned by the
United States, the State, the City, or any of their respective agencies or
political subdivisions.
   (c)    Violations and Penalties for Failure to Register. The failure or
refusal for any reason of any owner, or agent of an owner acting on behalf of
the owner, to register a vacant building upon adoption of this Article, or to
pay any fees required to be paid pursuant to the provisions of this Article,
within thirty (30) days after they become due, shall constitute a violation
punishable upon conviction thereof by a fine in the amount of not less than
one-hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five-hundred dollars ($500.00) for
each failure or refusal to pay a required vacant building fee, as applicable.
In such cases, whenever the minimum fine of one-hundred dollars ($100.00) is
imposed, it shall not be subject to suspension or reduction for any reason. 
(Ord. 0-1476.  Passed 6-24-14.)
   1765.08  NON-PAYMENT OF FEES/LIENS.
   (a)    Delinquent Registration Fees as a Lien. After the owner is given
notice of the amount of the registration fee due, except for those owners that
have properly perfected an appeal pursuant to subsection (b) (4) above, and the
owner fails to pay the amount due, said amount shall constitute a debt due and
owing to the City and the City may commence a civil action to collect such
unpaid debt.
   (b)    "Lien" or "Liens" as used in this section shall arise whenever the
fees and charges as described in this section are levied or imposed.
   (c)    If an owner fails to pay the registration fee as assessed and the
City begins the collection action to enforce its lien, then the Code
Enforcement Officer shall post the written notice on the property and send the
written notice to the owner(s) by certified and regular mail.
   (d)    The City may take action to sell the subject property by means of
forfeiture and the court ordered enforcement process to collect the debt owed
the City. Should the City take the steps necessary to sell the subject
property, the City shall do so, subject to all liens and real and personal
property taxes that are due. Purchasers of the subject property shall be
similarly responsible for registration pursuant to this section in the same
manner as the prior owner and must begin the registration process anew if said
property remains vacant.
(Ord. 0-1476.  Passed 6-24-14.)
