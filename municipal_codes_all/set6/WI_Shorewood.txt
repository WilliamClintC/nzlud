A request for a record may be denied as provided in §
138-6
hereof. If a request is made orally,the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons fordenying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial.

Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that ifthe request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review uponpetition for a writ of mandamus under § 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the AttorneyGeneral or the District Attorney.

This inference is rebutted if the defendant demonstrates that he or she purchasedthat device for a legitimate use.
Give technical assistance or instruction to any person in obtaining or attempting to obtain anycable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the grantee providingthat service. This subsection does not apply if the defendant demonstrates that the technicalassistance or instruction was given or the installation of the connection, descrambler orreceiving device was for a legitimate use.

Erosion and other pollutant control requirements. The following requirements shall be met on allsites described in Subsection
A
:
Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by sediment basins or otherappropriate best management practices specified in the BMP Handbook. Water may not bedischarged in a manner that causes erosion of the site, adjacent sites, or receiving channels.
Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials (including garbage,debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or hazardous materials) shall beproperly disposed of and not allowed to be carried off site by runoff or wind.
Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficientwidth and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Anysediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by street cleaning before the endof each workday. Flushing may not be used unless sediment will be controlled by a sedimentbasin or other appropriate best management practice specified in the BMP Handbook.
Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected with a straw bale, filter fabric, orequivalent barrier as specified in the BMP Handbook or approved by the Village.
Sediment cleanup. All off-site sediment deposits occurring as a result of a storm event shallbe cleaned up by the end of the next workday. All other off-site sediment deposits occurringas a result of construction activities shall be cleaned up by the end of the workday.
Site erosion control. The following criteria [Subsection
B(6)(a)
through
(e)
] apply only to landdevelopment or land disturbing activities that result in runoff leaving the site.
Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be diverted arounddisturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall be protected as describedbelow in Subsection
B(6)(c)[3]
. Sheet flow runoff from adjacent areas greater than10,000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around disturbed areas unless shown tohave resultant runoff velocities of less than 0.5 foot per second across the disturbed areafor the ten-year, twenty-four-hour storm as defined in the BMP Handbook. Diverted runoffshall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance and receivingchannels. For allowable velocities in the different types of channels, Soil ConservationService guidelines shall be followed.
All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area ofbare soil exposed to any one time.
Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by meeting eitherSubsection
B(6)(c)[1]
and
[2]
or
[1]
and
[3]
.
All disturbed ground left inactive for seven or more days shall be stabilized bytemporary or permanent seeding, temporary or permanent seeding and mulching,sodding, covering with tarps, or equivalent best management practices. If temporaryseeding is used, a permanent cover shall also be required as part of the final sitestabilization. Seeding or sodding shall be conducted as specified in the BMPHandbook or by the Village. Variances from the requirements of this subsection maybe granted by the Building Inspector upon application, but only if the failure tocomply is due to extended periods of rain or other construction delays beyond thecontrol of the responsible party.
For sites with 10 or more acres disturbed at one time, or if a channel originates in thedisturbed area, one or more sediment basins shall be constructed. Each sedimentbasin shall be designed and constructed as specified in the BMP Handbook.
For sites with less than 10 acres disturbed at one time, filter fences, straw bales, orequivalent best management practices shall be placed along all sideslope and

Article II. Stormwater Management
[Adopted
12-15-2003
by
Ord. No. 1861
(Ch. 9, Art. 3B of the 1986 Code)]
§ 250-9. Purpose, intent and findings of fact.
Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to set forth stormwater requirements and criteriathat will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and the aquatic environment due torunoff of stormwater from land development activity. Specific purposes are to:
Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions;
Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater, prevent and control soil erosion,prevent and control water pollution, and protect spawning grounds, fish, and aquatic life;
Assure the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; preventundue channel erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulatematter; and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property; and
Control building sites, placement of structures, and land uses and promote sound economicgrowth.
Intent. The intent of this article is to manage the long-term, postconstruction stormwaterdischarges from land development activities. Where such system plans have been developed andapproved by the Village, it is the intent that all land development activities will include stormwatermanagement measures that meet performance standards set forth in those approved plans.Where such stormwater management system plans have not been developed or approved, it isthe intent of the Village that the generic stormwater management standards set forth be appliedunless otherwise accepted by the Planning and Development Department.
Findings of fact. This article is based on the finding that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from landdevelopment activity has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and

general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of naturalresources. Specifically, uncontrolled stormwater runoff can:
Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bedscour, diminishing groundwater recharge, and diminishing stream base flows;
Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational, andwater supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants;
Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads;
Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading;
Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers,drainageways, and other minor drainage facilities;
Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by increasing major flood peaksand volumes;
Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding;and
Aggravate excessive infiltration and inflow of water into sanitary sewer connections duringpeak storm events causing the conveyance system to surcharge, overflow or back up intobasements.

More restrictive discharge controls are needed because existing downstreamconveyance or storage facilities are or will be rendered inadequate as a result ofdevelopment activity.
The land development activity is covered by an approved stormwater managementsystem plan that contains management requirements consistent with the purpose andintent of this article.
Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility, provided that all of thefollowing conditions for the off-site facility are met:
The facility is in place.
The facility is designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater controlequal to or greater than would be provided by on-site practices meeting the requirementsof this article.
The facility has a legally obligated entity responsible for its long-term operation andmaintenance.
The Planning and Development Department finds that meeting the minimum on-sitemanagement requirements of this section is not feasible due to space or site restrictions.
Protective areas.
"Protective area" means an area of land that commences at the top of the channel of lakes,streams and rivers, or at the delineated boundary of wetlands, and that is the greatest of thefollowing widths, as measured horizontally from the top of the channel or delineated wetlandboundary to the closest impervious surface. However, in this subsection, "protective area"does not include any area of land adjacent to any stream enclosed within a pipe or culvert,such that runoff cannot enter the enclosure at this location. In Subsection
J(1)(a)
,
(d)
and
(e)
below, determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to wetlands shall be madeon the basis of the sensitivity and runoff susceptibility of the wetland in accordance with thestandards and criteria in § NR 103.03, Wis. Adm. Code.
For outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters, and for wetlands inareas of special natural resource interest as specified in § NR 103.04, Wis. Adm. Code:75 feet.
For perennial and intermittent streams identified on a United States Geological Survey7.5 minute series topographic map or a county soil survey map, whichever is morecurrent: 50 feet.
For lakes: 50 feet.
For highly susceptible wetlands: 50 feet. Highly susceptible wetlands include thefollowing types: fens, sedge meadows, bogs, low prairies, conifer swamps, shrubswamps, other forested wetlands, fresh wet meadows, shallow marshes, deep marshesand seasonally flooded basins. Wetland boundary delineations shall be made inaccordance with § NR 103.08(1m), Wis. Adm. Code. This subsection does not apply towetlands that have been completely filled in accordance with all applicable state andfederal regulations. The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled inaccordance with all applicable state and federal regulations shall be measured from thewetland boundary delineation after fill has been placed.
For less susceptible wetlands: 10% of the average wetland width, but no less than 10feet nor more than 30 feet. Less susceptible wetlands include degraded wetlandsdominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass.

applies to postconstruction sites located within a protective area, exceptthose areas exempted pursuant to Subsection
J(4)
below.
The following requirements shall be met:
Impervious surfaces shall be kept out of the protective area to the maximum extentpracticable. The stormwater management plan shall contain a written site-specificexplanation for any parts of the protective area that are disturbed during construction.
Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within a protective area, and where noimpervious surface is present, adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative cover of 70%or greater shall be established and maintained. The adequate sod or self-sustainingvegetative cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability, maintenance of fishhabitat and filtering of pollutants from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flowconditions. Nonvegetative materials, such as rock riprap, may be employed on the bankas necessary to prevent erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high-velocity flowsoccur.
Best management practices, such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention basins, whichare designed to control pollutants from nonpoint sources may be located in the protectivearea.
This Subsection
J
does not apply to:
Redevelopment postconstruction sites.
Infill development areas less than five acres.
Structures that cross or access surface waters, such as boat landings, bridges andculverts.
Structures constructed in accordance with § 59.692(1v), Wis. Stats.
Postconstruction sites from which runoff does not enter the surface water, except to theextent that vegetative ground cover is necessary to maintain bank stability.
Credit for removal of impervious surfaces.
Same site credit. The Planning and Development Department may use the removal ofpavement, covered structures or other impervious surfaces at the same property to calculatethe net postconstruction impervious acreage and corresponding water quantity managementduties. Credit may equal, but not be larger than, the acreage of impervious surfaces removedwhen runoff release rates and detention are the best management practices utilized at thesite. When best management practices with a higher order of preference are utilized in lieu ofdetention, equivalent credit may be granted as determined by the Planning and DevelopmentDepartment with the concurrence of the MMSD. Credit for reducing impervious surfaces at asite, not utilized by the development on the site, belongs to the Planning and DevelopmentDepartment and may be banked for allocation to other development within the watershedunder Subsection

The Village Board finds that businesses such as restaurants and taverns make importantcontributions to the Village's economy. These establishments serve important public purposes,including increasing the property tax base, providing employment, offering services andentertainment to Village residents, encouraging visitors to the Village and enhancing the economicand cultural climate in the Village. Excessive license fees deter business and are contrary to theabove-stated public purposes. 1997 Wisconsin Act 27 requires municipalities to establish aminimum fee of $10,000 for each Reserve "Class B" License issued, and the new fee far exceedsthe actual cost of licensing the activity. It is the purpose of this section to utilize revenue generatedby 1997 Wisconsin Act 27 to assist reserve "Class B" licensees to achieve the important publicpurposes identified herein.
Following the issuance of a new reserve "Class B" license and upon application, the Village Boardmay provide an economic development grant to the licensee in an amount not to exceed theamount actually paid by the licensee to the Village for issuance of the reserve "Class B" liquorlicense, minus the fee for a "Class B" license. The application shall be referred to the CommunityDevelopment Authority for review under this section. Upon the recommendation of the CommunityDevelopment Authority, prior to awarding any grant, the Village Board may make such findingsand establish such conditions as appropriate to assure that any funds awarded hereunder servepublic purposes and are in the public interest.

If more than 65% of the parking spaces areoccupied by parked vehicles, then no further vehicle counts will be made. If 65% of thespaces are not occupied but it may be expected that the sixty-five-percent level may beobtained, then additional parked vehicle counts shall be made until an average of 65% isfound or rejected. In those residential areas where 65% of the parking spaces are occupied, astudy will be made to determine whether or not those persons using the spaces in that areaare residents of that area. If more than 25% of the parking spaces are occupied by commutervehicles, the area may be qualified to have restricted permit parking.
In making its recommendation to the Board, the staff should consider such matters as:
The availability of an alternate means of transportation to and from the proposedrestricted district;
Air pollution caused by automobile traffic within that district;
The environmental impact of automobile use in the district;
The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking and related health andsafety hazards;
The proximity of public transportation to the residential district;
The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in and to the Village ofShorewood; and
The desire and need of the residents of the district for residential permit parking and theirwillingness to bear the administrative costs in connection therewith.
Each permit parking district, for the purpose of this section, shall include and be no smallerthan both sides of the street commencing at an intersection and extending 300 feet therefromor, in the alternative, both sides of the street between two intersecting streets or between anintersecting street and a cul-de-sac.

This chapter shall be known as the "Zoning — Floodplain Regulations" for the Village of Shorewood,Wisconsin, and shall be referred to as either "this chapter" or 'this ordinance" throughout this chapter.
§ 536-5. General provisions.
Areas to be regulated. This chapter regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional floodor base flood.
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study.Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base floodare identified as A Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplainsor A Zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the Village of Shorewood FloodplainAppendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or onthe Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMAbefore it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFEs) on non-FEMA maps shall beeffective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of theVillage Clerk, Village of Shorewood. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most-restrictive information shall apply.
Official maps: based on the Milwaukee County Flood Insurance Study (FIS), datedSeptember 2008, Volume Numbers 55079CV001A, 55079CV002A, 55079CV003A,55079CV004A, and 55079CV005A.
Milwaukee County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), Panel Numbers 55079C0081E,55079C0082E, 55079C0084E, 55079C0101E, and 55079C0103E, dated September 26,2008, with corresponding profiles that are based on the FIS approved by the DNR and FEMA.
Establishment of districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts, as follows:
The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of thefloodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters.
The Flood Fringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the regional flood limitsand the floodway.
The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may be covered byfloodwater during the regional flood.
Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the Official FloodplainZoning Map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsection
D(1)
or
(2)
below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to §
536-12
. TheZoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny aland use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall beresponsible for documenting actual predevelopment field conditions and the basis upon which thedistrict boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under thissection. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundaryline shall be settled according to §
536-11D(3)
and the criteria in Subsection
D(1)
and
(2)
below.
If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the districtboundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies.
Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the mapscale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM,

General development standards. The community shall review all permit applications to determinewhether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site isin a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed ormodified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of thestructure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with materialsresistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages;and be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipmentand other service facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering oraccumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall be reviewedfor compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured homeparks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets thesubdivision definition of this chapter.
