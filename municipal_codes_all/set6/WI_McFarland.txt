PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of McFarland, Wisconsin. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1998 Code, as supplemented through December 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Village Board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1998 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been titled to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER ORDINANCES 	CHT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publisher is most grateful to Don Peterson, Village Administrator, Deb Neal, Village Clerk, and Lawrence E. Bechler, Village Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Village's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER ORDINANCES[1] 
VILLAGE OF McFARLAND CHARTER ORDINANCE NO. 1-88 
A CHARTER ORDINANCE TO CREATE A PROCEDURE FOR DEFINING 
[AUTHORITY,] COMMITTEE, BOARD AND COMMISSION VACANCIES 
The Village Board of the Village Board of McFarland do ordain as follows: 
Section 1: The Village of McFarland, pursuant to Wis. Stats. 1985 §§ 17.03(13) and 66.01, hereby elects to declare by special provision of law the events which may create a vacancy on Village [Authorities,] Committees, Boards and Commissions. 
Section 2: Section 1.05(f) of the McFarland Municipal Code is hereby created to read as follows. 
"(f)  Attendance. The chair of each [authority,] committee, board and commission shall maintain a record of the attendance of the members at meetings. Any member who misses a meeting shall give prior notice of the absence to the chair. On any [authority,] committee, board or commission chaired by a non-trustee, if the non-trustee chair misses a meeting, he or she shall give prior notice of the absence to another [authority,] committee, board or commission officer, who shall thereafter maintain a record of the non-trustee chair's attendance at meetings. Failure to attend regularly scheduled meetings four times in any year commencing from the annual organizational meeting shall be deemed to be an event by which the member or chair vacates the position to which he or she was appointed.

Section 3: This is a charter ordinance and shall take effect 60 days after its passage and publication unless within such 60 day period a referendum petition as provided by Wis.

ORDINANCE 96-07 
A CHARTER ORDINANCE TO MODIFY THE TERMS OF 
OFFICE OF THE CITIZEN MEMBERS OF THE PLAN COMMISSION 
Purpose: For may [many] years, the citizen members of the Plan Commission have been appointed for gradually lengthening terms to provide experience without being committed to a full three-year term of office. One effect of this selection process is the possibility that many terms of office may expire in a given year, losing the benefits of staggered terms of office. 
This Ordinance attempts to balance the existing policy with the benefits of staggered terms. 
Sponsor: Administrator Peterson 
Recommended Referral: Plan Commission 
Public Hearing: Suggested 
The Village Board of the Village of McFarland do hereby ordain as follows: 
1.  Pursuant to Wis. Stats. §§ 61.195, 61.197 and 66.01, the Village of McFarland hereby elects not to be governed by those portions of Wis. Stats. § 62.23(1), as made applicable to villages by Wis. Stats. § 61.35, which are in conflict with this Ordinance. 
2.  Section 2-4-3(b)(12) of the McFarland Municipal Code is hereby repealed and recreated to read as follows: 
"(2)  Citizen Members. The citizen members shall be appointed by the Village President, subject to Village Board approval, at the organizational meeting, for the terms set forth herein. Upon an initial appointment, a citizen member shall serve a one year term. If the citizen member is reappointed, the second term shall be for a term of no less than one nor more than three years, so that no more than two reappointed citizen members' terms shall expire in any one year. Thereafter, for any subsequent term, the citizen members shall serve staggered three year terms." 
This is a Charter Ordinance and shall take effect 60 days after its passage and publication unless within such 60 day period a referendum petition as provided by Wis. Stats. § 66.01 shall be filed, in which case this Ordinance shall not take effect until it shall have been submitted to a referendum vote of the electors and approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon. 
The above and foregoing Charter Ordinance was duly adopted at a regular meeting of the McFarland Village Board on the 13 day of May, 1996.

(c)  Supporting documentation. Payment of the fees set forth in Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section shall be accompanied by documentation verified by an agent or officer with the authority to legally bind the provider that is sufficient for the City to verify the accuracy of the fees being paid by the provider.

(b)  Location of PEG channels. PEG channels must be carried on any service tier that is viewed by more than 50 percent of the video service provider's or cable operator's customers. Video service providers or cable operators may not charge an extra fee nor require the rental of special equipment in order for their customers to view such PEG channels if such fees or equipment are not required to view any of the non-PEG channels on such service tiers. 
(c)  Quality of PEG channels. Video service providers and cable operators shall not carry a PEG television signal in a lesser format or lower resolution than that afforded to a nonbroadcast digital programmer carried on the video or cable system. The signal quality of PEG channels shall be indistinguishable or better than the signal of other non-PEG channels carried by the video service provider or cable operator. 
(d)  Drops/origination points.

A video service provider or cable operator must provide written notice to the PEG channel director within ten days of the first or original airing of any program that the video service provider or cable operator is objecting to the program as having not been locally produced. Such notice shall describe with particularity the program being objected to, the date and time the program was first aired and the factual basis supporting the objection. Failure to timely provide this notice waives the objection and, therefore, such program will be counted towards the determination of whether said PEG channel is being substantially utilized. 
b.  Written notification of failure to substantially utilize channel. A video service provider or cable operator must provide written notification to any PEG channel director within ten days following any week in which the video service provider or cable operator objects that the PEG channel has not been substantially utilized. Such notice shall describe with particularity the time period being objected to, the dates and times during the week in which qualifying programming was not aired and the factual basis supporting the objection. Failure to timely provide this notice waives the objection and, therefore, such programming period will be counted towards the determination of whether said PEG channel is being substantially utilized. 
c.  Written notification of intention to disconnect, reprogram or drop PEG channel. A video service provider or cable operator must provide 120 days' advance written notification to any PEG channel director that the video service provider or cable operator intends to disconnect, reprogram or drop. A video service provider or cable operator may not disconnect, reprogram or drop any PEG channel that it has not timely provided with such written notice. Furthermore, should any PEG channel director provide the video service provider or cable operator with a written response that the PEG channel was substantially utilized by the municipality, the video service provider or cable operator shall not disconnect, reprogram or drop the PEG channel. 
d.  Penalty for failing to provide notice. If any video service provider or cable operator disconnects, reprograms or drops any PEG channel without providing the notice as required in Subsections (e)(1)a through c of this Section the video service provider or cable operator shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Immediate reinstatement of the PEG channel to its location in the channel line-up prior to the disconnection, reprogramming or dropping of the channel. 
2.  The issuance of a citation demanding a forfeiture of not less than $1,000.00 nor more than $10,000.00 for each day that the PEG channel is disconnected, reprogrammed or dropped. 
(2)  Locally produced programming. Locally produced programming shall include all programming produced by any PEG channel and shall include all programming that has not been commercially aired. "Locally produced programming" includes any program that was in part produced for original airing in the broadcast market in which it was produced either in part or in whole. The term "locally produced" shall not require that the programming was created, filmed or produced in the McFarland or Dane County area. PEG stations may share and exchange programming content in order to meet the substantial utilization requirements of Wis. Stats. § 66.0420(5)(b). 
(f)  Underwriting of Programming. PEG channels may transmit noncommercial programming to subscribers generally or specific recipients of video service providers or cable operators. Nothing herein shall in any way prohibit or prevent PEG channels from accepting grants or sponsorships in support of such programming nor shall PEG channels be prohibited from acknowledging such grants or sponsorships before, during or immediately after such PEG programming has been broadcast in a manner that is similar to the manner in which the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) acknowledges the substantially similar support of its programming content. Such acknowledgements shall comply with the requirements of 47 USC 399b as though the PEG channel was a public broadcast station. 
(g)  Notice of intention to move PEG channel locations/designations. Any video service provider or cable operator who intends to move any PEG channel from the channel designations may only make such a change after providing 60 days' advance written notice to the affected PEG channel. Additionally, such video service provider or cable operator shall engage in a public education program of such intensity and duration as to reasonably inform the general public of the proposed PEG channel designations.  
Sec. 2-363. - Police powers, design/construction standards and rights-of-way. 
(a)  Subject to police powers. Video service providers and cable operators are subject to the police power of the Village to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety, health and welfare of the public. The grant of a statewide video or cable franchise does not render or to any extent lose, waive, impair or lessen the lawful powers and rights, now or hereafter vested in the Village under the Constitution and statutes of the state to regulate the use of streets and public ways or to regulate any matter affecting the safety, health and welfare of the public. The Village shall make the video service provider's and cable operator's history of compliance with such codes and ordinances available to the Department of Financial Institutions so that the Department of Financial Institutions may determine the provider or operator's legal, financial and technical qualifications to provide video services. 
(b)  Design, permits, construction and excavation. Video service providers and cable operators shall comply with all applicable Village codes and ordinances including, without limitation by expression herein, Section 53-122, and shall be subject to any forfeitures so specified for any violations thereof. The Village shall make the person's history of compliance with such codes and ordinances available to the Department of Financial Institutions so that the Department of Financial Institutions may determine the provider's or operator's legal, financial and technical qualifications to provide video services.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 2-792. - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and public employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established in this Chapter a Code of Ethics for all Village public officials and public employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members of authorities, boards, committees and commissions of the Village, as well as any individuals who are candidates for elective office as soon as such individuals file nomination papers with the Village. 
(b)  The purpose of this Ethics Code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such public officials and public employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the Village and by directing disclosure by such public officials and public employees of private associational, financial, personal or other interests in matters affecting the Village. The Village Board believes that a Code of Ethics for the guidance of elected and appointed public officials and public employees will help them avoid conflicts between their personal interests and their public responsibilities, will improve standards of public service and will promote and strengthen the faith and confidence of the citizens of this Village in their elected and appointed public officials and public employees. The Village Board hereby reaffirms that each elected and appointed Village public official and public employee holds such position as a public trust, and any intentional effort to realize substantial personal gain through official conduct is a violation of that trust. The provisions and purpose of this Ethics Code and such rules and regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best interests of the Village.

(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested.

Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 2-875(f)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the Village Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize the party's request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 2-877. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that, if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the Attorney General or a district attorney.

c.  The item is no longer able to reliably or economically perform the work required of it.

Surplus Village property shall not include property that is obtained by the Village as a result of abandonment or loss by the property's original owner. (See Division 3 below) 
(3)  The term shall not include property that is utilized as a trade-in to reduce the cost of a newly purchased replacement item.

Sec. 2-932. - Determination of surplus Village property. 
(a)  Initial determination. Before an item of Village property is determined to be surplus, the department head shall determine whether the property may reasonably be of use to another Village department. The department head shall submit a description of the item to the Administrator, who shall distribute a notice to all departments of the availability of the item. If the property is transferred to another department as a fixed asset or a capital asset, the receiving department shall so notify the Administrator in writing of the description of the item, identification number, the location where the item is to be used, and the date the item is put into service. If no other department claims the item within the time set forth in the notice, a final determination shall be made as provided in subsection (b). 
(b)  Final determination. 
(1)  Whenever any item is considered surplus on the basis that the Village no longer performs the service for which the item was originally purchased, the Village Board shall determine whether or not the item is surplus Village property regardless of value. 
(2)  Whenever the estimated fair market value of other items is $10,000.00 or more, the Village Board shall determine whether or not the item is surplus Village property. 
(3)  Whenever the estimated fair market value of other items is more than $5,000.00 but less than $10,000.00, the Administrator shall determine whether or not the item is surplus Village property. 
(4)  Whenever the estimated fair market value of other items is $5,000.00 or less, the department head shall determine whether or not the item is surplus Village property. 
(5)  If the purchase of a replacement item is specifically enumerated in the approved operating or capital budget, the item being replaced shall be automatically deemed surplus Village property unless the department requests and receives approval to retain the item. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 6-19-2014)  
Sec. 2-933. - Disposal of surplus Village property. 
(a)  Disposal of surplus Village property shall be prohibited except as authorized in this section. 
(b)  Whenever a determination of the estimated fair market value is required for an item of surplus Village property, that determination shall be made by the department head responsible for the property, whose decision shall be final. If necessary and appropriate to determine the fair market value of an item, the department may hire an appraiser to help establish that value. 
(c)  If an item of surplus Village property is deemed to have potential net value, every reasonable effort shall be made to sell the item before it is donated or destroyed. 
(d)  Whenever the estimated fair market value of an item of surplus Village property is less than $500.00, the department head responsible for the item shall dispose of the property in the manner deemed most advantageous to the Village or by having it destroyed. Property need not be offered for sale if it appears the probable costs surrounding the sale would exceed the value of the property. 
(e)  Whenever the estimated fair market value of an item of surplus Village property is more than $500.00 and it has been determined that the item is not of use to another Village department, the department head responsible for the item shall dispose of the property by the following prioritized methods: 
(1)  Public auction (live or online); 
(2)  Sale by sealed bid; or 
(3)  Negotiated sale (prior Village Board authorization required); 
(4)  Donation to a nonprofit organization within the Village or to a governmental agency. 
(f)  Minimum bid or reserve amount. 
(1)  A minimum bid or reserve amount shall be established for disposal of any surplus property item having an estimated fair market value greater than $5,000.00. The department head shall determine the actual amount of the minimum bid or reserve amount that is established. 
(2)  In the event that the actual high bid for an item is less than the minimum bid or reserve amount established by the department head, the decision as to whether to sell the item for the lower amount will be made by: 
a.  The Administrator if the original minimum bid or reserve amount was $5,000.00$10,000.00; 
b.  The Village board if the original minimum bid or reserve amount was greater than $10,000.00. 
(g)  No live public auction or awarding of bids shall occur under this Section unless a description of the item to be sold and an advance notice of the time and place for such auction or bid submission first published as a class 2 notice in the official Village newspaper. If the item to be sold is placed for sale through a bona fide surplus auction, however, the advance notice requirements shall not apply. When the surplus auction method is used the Village shall provide a link on its website to the auction site and shall provide a listing of available property in a suitable location on its website. Such auction shall be run for no less than seven days unless the nature of the property to be disposed of requires a shorter timeframe. 
(h)  In the event of a live public auction or sale by sealed bid, the item will be sold in as-is condition to the person submitting the highest bid provided, however, that a lower bid submitted by a nonprofit organization or governmental agency may be accepted by the Village. The department head responsible for the item shall determine the time in which the successful bidder must remove the item. In the event the item is not removed within that time, the item shall revert to the Village and the amount of the bid shall be forfeited to the Village. In the event no bids are received, the item shall be disposed of at the discretion of the department head in the manner deemed most advantageous to the Village. 
(i)  Whenever this Section provides for an auction or other disposition of any property, the Village Board shall be authorized to hire an auctioneer or take such other action as is necessary to properly dispose of the property; provided, however, that the fees of such auctioneer and all such costs, other than those for Village labor and the use of Village property, do not exceed the amount of revenue expected to be received by the Village from the auction or sale of the property. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 6-19-2014)  
Sec. 2-934. - Proceeds from disposal of Village property. 
All net proceeds realized from the sale of Village property shall be forwarded to the Administrator/Clerk-Treasurer for deposit and crediting to the fund which originally paid for the property item which was sold.

(a)  Whenever it is determined to be in the best interest of the Village to dispose of property by auction or by sealed bid, or when required by Section 2-961, the Village may in its discretion utilize an online auction service, provided said auction service is available to the general public. When such a method is utilized for the disposal of abandoned or surplus property, the Village shall provide a link on its website to the auction site and shall provide a listing of available property in a suitable location on its website. Such auction shall be run for no less than seven days unless the nature of the property to be disposed requires a lesser timeframe. For property not disposed of via an online auction service, notice of such auction or the awarding of bids shall be preceded by a class 2 notice describing the property and arranging the time and place for the auction or bid submission; such notice shall be published in the official Village newspaper. The property auctioned or sold by sealed bid shall be sold in as-is condition to the highest bidder.

The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall promptly post in at least three public places in the Village notices of quarantine. 
(b)  Exemption of vaccinated dog or cat from Village quarantine. A dog or cat which is immunized currently against rabies, as evidenced by a valid certificate of rabies vaccination or other evidence, is exempt from the Village quarantine provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section if a rabies vaccination tag or substitute tag is attached to the dog's or cat's collar. 
(c)  Quarantine or sacrifice of an animal suspected of biting a person or being infected or exposed to rabies. 
(1)  Quarantine or sacrifice of dog or cat. An officer shall order a dog or cat quarantined if the officer has reason to believe that the animal bit a person, is infected with rabies or has been in contact with a rabid animal. If a quarantine cannot be imposed because the dog or cat cannot be captured, the officer may kill the animal. The officer shall attempt to kill the animal in a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage to the animal's head. 
(2)  Sacrifice of other animals. An officer may order killed or may kill an animal other than a dog or cat if the officer has reason to believe that the animal bit a person or is infected with rabies.

(1)  Delivery to isolation facility or quarantine on premises of owner. An officer who orders a dog or cat to be quarantined shall deliver the animal or shall order the animal delivered to an isolation facility as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after the original order is issued or the officer may order the animal to be quarantined on the premises of the owner if the animal is immunized currently against rabies as evidenced by a valid certificate of rabies vaccination or other evidence. 
(2)  Health risk to humans. If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal bit a person, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal under strict isolation under the supervision of a veterinarian for at least ten days after the incident occurred. In this Subsection, the term "supervision of a veterinarian" includes, at a minimum, examination of the animal on the first day of isolation, on the last day of isolation and on one intervening day. If the observation period is not extended and if the veterinarian certifies that the dog or cat has not exhibited any signs of rabies, the animal may be released from quarantine at the end of the observation period. 
(3)  Risk to animal health. 
a.  If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal has been exposed to a rabid animal and if the dog or cat is not currently immunized against rabies, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal leashed or confined for 180 days. The owner shall have the animal vaccinated against rabies between 155 and 165 days after the exposure to a rabid animal. 
b.  If a dog or cat is ordered to be quarantined because there is reason to believe that the animal has been exposed to a rabid animal but if the dog or cat is immunized against rabies, the custodian of an isolation facility or the owner shall keep the animal leashed or confined for 60 days. The owner shall have the animal revaccinated against rabies as soon as possible after exposure to a rabid animal. 
(4)  Destruction of a dog or cat exhibiting symptoms of rabies. If a veterinarian determines that a dog or cat exhibits symptoms of rabies during the original or extended observation period, the veterinarian shall notify the owner and the officer who ordered the animal quarantined and the officer or veterinarian shall kill the animal in a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage to the animal's head. If the dog or cat is suspected to have bitten a person, the veterinarian shall notify the person or the person's physician. 
(e)  Delivery of carcass; preparation; examination by laboratory of hygiene. An officer who kills an animal shall deliver the carcass to a veterinarian or local health department. The veterinarian or local health department shall prepare the carcass, properly prepare and package the head of the animal in a manner to minimize deterioration, arrange for delivery by the most expeditious means feasible of the head of the animal to the State Laboratory of Hygiene and dispose of or arrange for the disposal of the remainder of the carcass in a manner which minimizes the risk or exposure to any rabies virus. The Laboratory of Hygiene shall examine the specimen and determine if the animal was infected with rabies. The State Laboratory of Hygiene shall notify the Village, the veterinarian or local health department which prepared the carcass and, if the animal is suspected to have bitten a person, that person or the person's physician. 
(f)  Cooperation of veterinarian. Any practicing veterinarian who is requested to be involved in the rabies control program by an officer is encouraged to cooperate in a professional capacity with the Village, the Laboratory of Hygiene, the local health department, the officer involved and, if the animal is suspected to have bitten a person, the person's physician. 
(g)  Responsibility for quarantine and laboratory expenses. The owner of an animal is responsible for any expenses incurred in connection with keeping the animal in an isolation facility, supervision and examination of the animal by a veterinarian, preparation of the carcass for laboratory examination and the fee for the laboratory examination. If the owner is unknown, the county is responsible for these expenses.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 8-668. - Authority. 
This Article is adopted pursuant to the guidelines in Wis. Stats. § 61.354. 
(Code 1998, § 15-5-1)  
Sec. 8-669. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Findings. The Village Board finds that soil erosion from land development activities and subsequent development can disturb natural cover and land surfaces resulting in a change of run-off patterns that may have a detrimental effect on water quality and downstream uses. This is of particular concern in the Village, in which a substantial portion of the surface water of the Village is within the boundaries of the Yahara Monona Priority Watershed Project boundaries. Land development activities and subsequent development need to be strictly regulated to avoid damage to other properties and sensitive areas. Further, effective sediment and stormwater management depends upon proper planning, design and timely installation of conservation practices, as well as continuing maintenance practices. 
(b)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to preserve the natural resources; to protect the quality of the waters of the state and Village; and to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the people, to the extent practicable by minimizing the amount of sediment, soil loss, and other pollutants carried by runoff or discharge from land development activities on the property to lakes, streams and wetlands.

Sec. 8-813. - Findings. 
The Village Board finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land development activity has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Specifically, uncontrolled stormwater runoff can: 
(a)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing stream bed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, and diminishing stream base flows; 
(b)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational, and water supply uses by increasing loadings of nutrients and other urban pollutants; 
(c)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads; 
(d)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading; 
(e)  Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways and other drainage facilities; 
(f)  Threaten public health, safety, property, and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes; 
(g)  Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding; and 
(h)  Diminish the public enjoyment of natural resources. 
(Code 1998, § 15-5-21; Ord. No. 2002-10, § 1(15-5-21), 9-9-2002)  
Sec. 8-814. - Purpose. 
The general purpose of this Article is to set forth stormwater management requirements and criteria that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare, and to the environment due to runoff of stormwater from land development activity. Specific purposes are to: 
(a)  Maintain and enhance safe and healthful conditions; 
(b)  Regulate longterm, post-development stormwater discharges from land development activities; 
(c)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater, prevent and control soil erosion, prevent and control water pollution, and protect spawning grounds, fish, and aquatic life; 
(d)  Reduce runoff velocities and retain sediments and pollutants on the site to the maximum practical extent; 
(e)  Control the overflow of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; 
(f)  Prevent undue channel erosion; 
(g)  Control increases in the scouring of drainageways and transportation of particulate matter; 
(h)  Prevent conditions that endanger downstream property; 
(i)  Control building sites, placement of structures, and promote sound economic growth; and 
(j)  Provide services to maintain and enhance the quality of life within the community. 
To this end, the Village will manage stormwater to protect, maintain and enhance the natural environment, human life, diversity of fish and wildlife, and recreational use of waterways within the Village limits.

Significant changes to wetland functional values due to stormwater pollutant loads shall be avoided. 
(d)  Stormwater pretreatment and infiltration. Stormwater discharges shall be pre-treated prior to infiltration, to prolong maintenance of the infiltration practice and to prevent discharge of stormwater pollutants at concentrations that will result in exceedances of groundwater preventive action limits or enforcement standards established by the Department of Natural Resources in Wis. Admin. Code Ch. NR 140. Stormwater shall not be injected underground through excavation or openings that would violate Wis. Admin. Code § NR 812.05. Stormwater infiltration is prohibited under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Stormwater runoff is generated from highly contaminated source areas at manufacturing or industrial sites; 
(2)  Stormwater runoff is carried in a conveyance system that also carries contaminated, nonstormwater discharges; 
(3)  Stormwater runoff is generated from active construction sites. 
(e)  Stormwater ponds and infiltration devices. Stormwater ponds and infiltration devices shall not be located closer to water supply wells than indicated in this Subsection without first notifying the Village Engineer:

(2)  Within 400 feet from a municipal water supply well. 
(f)  Land development activities. Land development activities with stormwater runoff reaching Outstanding or Exceptional Resource Waters as identified in Wis. Admin. Code Ch. NR 102, may be required to use additional stormwater management measures that exceed the minimum requirements in this Article. 
(g)  Stormwater management goals. The following standards shall be met whenever possible, and proposed design, suggested location and implementation of practices to meet these goals shall be included in plans: 
(1)  For existing development, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 40 microns on the site (20 percent reduction) resulting from a one-year 24-hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension. 
(2)  For street reconstruction, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 20 microns on the site (40 percent reduction) resulting from a one-year, 24-hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension. 
(h)  Oil and grease control. For all stormwater plans for commercial or industrial developments and all other uses where the potential for pollution by oil and/or grease exists, the first 0.5 inches of runoff will be treated. This requirement may be waived by the Village Engineer only when the applicant can demonstrate that installation of such practices is not necessary. 
(i)  Sediment control. Plans shall be designed, engineered and implemented to achieve the following results: 
(1)  For new development, design practices to retain soil particles greater than five microns on the site (80 percent reduction) resulting from a one-year 24-hour storm event (2.5 inches over 24 hours), according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension; 
(2)  For redevelopment resulting in exposed surface parking lots and associated traffic areas, design practices to retain soil particles greater than 20 microns on the entire site (40 percent reduction) resulting from a one-year 24-hour storm event, according to approved procedures, and assuming no sediment resuspension. Under no circumstances shall the site's existing sediment control level or trapping efficiency be reduced as a result of the redevelopment.

(b)  Peak flow rates of stormwater runoff. The proposed land development shall not increase peak flow rates of stormwater runoff from that which would have resulted from the same storm occurring over the site with the land in its predevelopment conditions for storms of 24-hour duration and recurrence intervals of two, ten, 25, and 100 years. 
(c)  Conveyance systems. All stormwater conveyance systems within the proposed development, and receiving surface runoff from the proposed development, shall be designed to completely contain peak storm flows as described in this Article. Calculations for determining peak flows for conveyance system sizing shall use curve numbers based on the existing or future proposed land use for off-site areas (whichever results in the highest peak flows), and the proposed land use for the on-site areas.

(a)  Complaints should be filed with the Village Building Inspector, who has been designated to coordinate Section 504 compliance. 
(b)  A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and address of the person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations. 
(c)  A complaint should be filed within 30 days after the complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation.

Sec. 11-58. - Investigation; approval of application. 
(a)  The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the Chief of Police, Fire Inspector and Building Inspector of each new or renewal application, and these officials shall inspect or cause to be inspected each application and the premises, together with such other investigation as shall be necessary to determine whether the applicant and the premises sought to be licensed comply with the regulations, ordinances and laws applicable thereto, including those governing sanitation in restaurants, and whether the applicant is a proper recipient of a license. The Police Department shall conduct an investigation of the applicant, including, but not limited to, requesting information from the state, surrounding municipalities, and/or any community where the applicant has previously resided concerning the applicant's arrest and conviction record. The report of the Police Department shall include any and all incidents relating in any manner to the premises sought to be licensed, whether or not the incident led to any official action against the premises or its licensee. These officials shall furnish a report to the Village Clerk-Treasurer in writing, who shall forward to the Village Board and the Public Safety Committee, the information derived from such investigation accompanied by a recommendation as to whether a license should be granted or refused. No license shall be renewed without a re-inspection of the premises and report as originally required. 
(b)  The Chief of Police is required to maintain records of any and all incidents in any way related to the licensed premises, whether or not there was actual prosecution and/or conviction. 
(c)  If the inspecting officials recommend the denial of the application, the applicant shall be notified by the Village Clerk-Treasurer prior to the Public Safety Committee hearing at which the application is to be considered. The notice shall set forth the basis for such recommendation and inform the applicant of the opportunity to appear before the Public Safety Committee and to provide evidence as to why the application should be approved. The Public Safety Committee shall make an advisory recommendation to the Village Board on the advisability of granting such license. 
(d)  In determining whether to grant such license, consideration shall be given to the arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to the limitations imposed by Wis. Stats. §§ 111.321, 111.322 and 111.335 and Wis. Stats. § 125.12(1)(b); financial responsibility of the applicant, the appropriateness of the location and premises where such licensed business is to be conducted, and generally the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reported. An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two offenses that are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right granted solely to the Village Board, the Village Board, and the Public Safety Committee in making its recommendation, reserves the right to consider the severity and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the determination to grant, deny or not renew a license. 
(e)  If the Village Board denies the license, the applicant shall be notified in writing, by certified mail or personal service, of the reasons for the denial. The notice shall also inform the applicant of the opportunity to appear before the Village Board and to provide evidence as to why the denial should be reversed. Such written notice shall be mailed or served upon the applicant at least ten days prior to the Village Board meeting at which the application is to be reconsidered. If, upon reconsideration, the Village Board again denies the application, the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons therefor. An applicant who is denied any license upon reconsideration of the matter may apply to Circuit Court pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 125.12(2)(d), for review.

Sec. 11-59. - Additional application considerations.

In the event of the sale of a business or business premises of the licensee, the purchaser of such business or business premises must apply to the Village for reissuance of said license and the Village, as the licensing authority, shall in no way be bound to reissue said license to said subsequent purchaser. 
(b)  Whenever the agent of a corporate holder of a license is for any reason replaced, the licensee shall give the Village Clerk-Treasurer written notice of said replacement, the reasons therefore and the new appointment. An application for change of agent shall be made on a form furnished by the Village Clerk-Treasurer. A fee for such transfer shall be the fee established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A of this Code. Until the next regular meeting or special meeting of the Village Board, the successor agent shall have the authority to perform the functions and be charged with the duties of the original agent.

Sec. 11-74. - Issuance or denial of operator's license. 
(a)  Issuance of approved licenses. If the Police Department recommends granting the operator's license, or the Village Board approves granting the operator's license, the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall issue the license. Such licenses shall state the applicant's name and address and the date of the expiration of such license. The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall make the license available for pick up at the Village Clerk-Treasurer's office. Any operator's license for which the fee is not paid within 15 days of approval of the application by the Village Board shall be returned to the Village Clerk-Treasurer for cancellation or other disposition. 
(b)  Denial. 
(1)  If the application is denied by the Village Board, the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall, in writing, inform the applicant of the denial, the reasons therefor, and of the opportunity to request a reconsideration of the application by the Village Board. Such notice must be sent by registered mail to, or served upon, the applicant at least ten days prior to the Village Board's reconsideration of the matter. At such reconsideration hearing, the applicant may present evidence and testimony as to why the license should be granted. 
(2)  If upon reconsideration, the Village Board again denies the application, the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons therefor. An applicant who is denied any license may apply to Circuit Court pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 125.12(2)(d), for review. 
(c)  Basis for denial. 
(1)  Consideration for the granting or denial of a license will be based on: 
a.  Arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to the limitations imposed by Wis. Stats. §§ 111.321, 111.322, and 111.335, and Wis. Stats. § 125.12(1)(b); 
b.  Reserved; 
c.  Generally, the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed. 
(2)  If a licensee is convicted of an offense substantially related to the licensed activity. 
(3)  An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right granted solely to the Village Board, the Village Board reserves the right to consider the severity, and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the determination to grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the Village Board, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two or more offenses that are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one year or more.

ARTICLE IX. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 
 
Sec. 11-260. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  It is a lawful purpose of the Village Board to enact rules and regulations as are necessary for the preservation of health and to prevent the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases. It has been found by municipalities through the State of Wisconsin, particularly Milwaukee, Racine, Waukesha, Delafield, Kenosha, Middleton, West Allis, Dane County and St. Croix County, as well as communities around the country, including Cleveland, Ohio; Phoenix; Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Indianapolis, Indiana; Austin, Texas; Belleview, Washington; Houston, Texas; Cleburne, Texas; Denver, Colorado; and Kansas City, Missouri; as well as other communities around the country, that sexually oriented adult entertainment establishments are predisposed to the creation of unsafe and unsanitary conditions; that operators and employees of such businesses tend to participate in sex-related offenses on the premises, creating substantial law enforcement problems, and that the such businesses have a deleterious effect on surrounding areas, resulting in neighborhood blight and reduced property values, especially when such businesses are concentrated in one area. Many of such establishments install movie viewing booths with doors in which patrons view videotapes, movies, films and other forms of entertainment characterized by their emphasis on depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas, and that such booths have been and are being used by patrons to engage in sexual acts resulting in unsanitary, unhealthy and unsafe conditions in said booths and establishments. This Article is intended to establish standards in order to prevent the spread of AIDS and other communicable or sexually transmitted diseases, and to eliminate the deleterious effects described above in the Village of McFarland. 
(b)  The Village Board has explicit authority under Wis. Stats. § 125.10(1) to adopt regulations governing the sale of alcohol beverages which are in addition to those set forth under Wis. Stats. Ch. 125. 
(c)  The Village Board finds a likelihood exists for commercial exploitation of human sexuality by owners of premises holding "Class B" and Class "B" alcohol beverage licenses in the State of Wisconsin in the form of employing or permitting persons to perform or exhibit their nude or semi-nude bodies to other persons as an inducement to other persons to purchase alcohol beverages. The direct result of such exploitation is criminal activity, moral degradation and disturbance of the peace and good order of the community. In addition, this commercial exploitation of such nude and semi-nude acts is adverse to the public's interest in the quality of life, commercial activity and total community environment in the Village of McFarland.

ARTICLE XI. - TOURIST ROOMING HOUSES[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2017-22 , § 1, adopted Nov. 13, 2017, amended Art. XI in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. XI, §§ 11-35011-363 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2017-05 , § 1, adopted March 13, 2017. 
 
Sec. 11-350. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this Article is to ensure that the quality of tourist rooming houses operating within the Village is adequate for protecting public health, safety and general welfare, including establishing minimum standards of space for human occupancy and for an adequate level of maintenance; determining the responsibilities of owners, operators and property managers offering these properties for tourists or transients, to protect the character and stability of residential areas of the Village; to provide minimum standards necessary for the health and safety of persons occupying or using buildings, structures or premises; and provisions for the administration and enforcement thereof. The Village Board specifically finds that use of single family residences in the Village for short term rental creates the increased potential for adverse impacts on single family neighborhoods. The increased potential for adverse impacts is due to a higher degree of residential use and occupancy by vacationers who may tend to more frequently keep different hours engaging in recreational and social activities than the permanent residents in the surrounding neighborhood. Further, lacking any connection to the surrounding neighborhood, are less likely to be sensitive to the needs and concerns of neighbors. Finally, the lake side neighborhoods in which tourist rooming houses may be most likely to operate in the Village typically have small lots with homes very close to one another thereby increasing the potential for conflicts or disturbances.

(1)  Disposal. The discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking or placing of any hazardous material or waste into or on any land or water so that the hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment, be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including groundwaters. 
(2)  Generation. The act or process of producing hazardous waste. 
(3)  Hazardous material. Any element, compound or combination thereof that is flammable, corrosive, etc., and which, because of handling, storage, processing or packaging, may have detrimental effects on operating and emergency personnel, the public, equipment and/or the environment. 
(4)  Hazardous waste. Any waste or combination of wastes of a liquid, gaseous or semi-solid form which, because of its quantities, concentration or physical, chemical or infectious characteristics, may cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness, or pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported or disposed of, or otherwise managed. Such wastes include, but are not limited to, those that are toxic, carcinogenic, flammable, irritants, strong sensitizes or which generate pressure through decomposition, heat or other means, as well as containers and receptacles previously used in the transportation, storage, use or application of substances described as hazardous waste. 
(5)  Storage. Containment in such manner as not to constitute disposal. 
(6)  Transport. The movement from the point of production, generation or use to any intermediate site and finally to the point of ultimate storage or disposal.

(1)  Increasing production and consumption rates, continuing technological development and energy requirements have led to the generation and use of greater quantities of hazardous materials and associated hazardous waste; 
(2)  The problems of disposing of hazardous waste are increasing as a result of air and water pollution controls and a shortage of available landfill sites; 
(3)  While it is technologically and financially feasible for hazardous waste generators to dispose of their waste in a manner that has a less adverse impact on the environment then current practices, such knowledge is not being utilized to the extent possible; 
(4)  Even though the Village is not heavily industrialized, there is significant daily hazardous waste disposal problems; and

(h)  Enforcement. The Fire/EMS Chief shall have authority to issue citations or complaints under this Section. 
(i)  Financial liability. Any person, firm or corporation in violation of this Section shall be liable to the Village for any expenses incurred by the Village or loss or damage sustained by the Village by reason of such violation and to any individual whose person or property was damaged by such violation. The party responsible for the release, escape or discharge of wastes shall be held financially liable for the cost of any cleanup or attempted cleanup deemed necessary or desirable and undertaken by the Village, or its designated agent, in any effort to minimize the pollutional effects of the discharged waste or hazardous material substance.

(1)  Informal written quotation. An informal written quotation is a written request for quotation sent to vendors. The informal written quotation is used for the purchase of goods and services in an amount over $5,000.00 but less than $25,000.00. The Village shall give a class 1 legal public notice of the proposed construction before the contract for the construction may be executed. 
(2)  Formal bid. The formal bid procedure is used for purchasing goods and services in an amount of $25,000.00 and higher, and in some instances in amounts less than $25,000.00. The formal bid procedure requires a class 1 legal public notice and contains detailed, written specifications regarding the goods and services to be purchased and a summary of specific conditions associated with the purchase. 
(3)  Quotation form. The Village may solicit verbal or written quotations on items the Village purchases, which are less than $5,000.00. The results of verbal quotations are recorded on a "Memorandum of Quotation" form. 
(b)  Bid solicitation. 
(1)  Competitive bids or quotations shall be obtained before contracting to purchase articles, goods, wares, material services or merchandise, which amount in bulk to $25,000.00 or higher. Purchases up to $25,000.00 may be made by competitive quotation or by informal written quotation. Purchases of $25,000.00 and over, pursuant to Subsection (b)(2) of this Section, shall be made by formal bid unless exempted from it by action of the Village Board or by a committee designated by the Village Board. 
(2)  Verbal quotations for goods and services shall be secured from at least two qualified vendors and the results of the quotations shall be recorded on a "Memorandum of Quotation" form and signed by the person receiving the quotations. 
(3)  Informal requests for written quotations shall be solicited from at least three qualified bidders on the request for quotation form. All written requests for quotations shall be issued by the applicable department heads and returned to and analyzed by the applicable department heads. Informal requests for written quotations may also be solicited by telephone. Vendors shall be given a reasonable time to respond to the request for an informal, written quotation and shall be given clear, concise specifications and informal bidding instructions to facilitate competitive bidding. 
(4)  When a formal bid is required or deemed to be in the best interests of the Village, the bidding procedure shall follow the legal requirements associated with a class 1 notice under Wisconsin Statutes and the procedures normally associated with formal bid solicitations. 
(5)  Bidding procedures. When a formal bid is required or deemed to be in the best interests of the Village, the bidding procedure shall comply with formal bid solicitation standards identified in the Village's Purchasing Policies and Procedures and contain at least the following information: 
a.  A bid solicitation identifier. 
b.  A detailed description of the goods and services, including enough information about the items or services required so that, ordinarily, more than one vendor can meet the specifications. 
c.  The time, date and place the bids will be opened. 
d.  The address to which the bids shall be mailed or delivered. Instructions to bidders shall include such information as delivery dates, transportation charges, proposal prices, conditions for guaranteeing the proposal, payment terms, right of rejection of proposals, right to reject merchandise, insurance requirements, alternative proposal consideration, tax information, and other appropriate information regarding the awarding and execution of the contract and contract considerations. 
e.  The bid solicitation shall also include a section on special provisions including guarantees and service considerations, trade-in considerations, and other information relating to special conditions. 
(6)  Specifications for all items purchased shall be developed with the full involvement and participation of the using departments. However, the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall ensure that the specifications are sufficiently broad enough that competition in the bidding process is preserved.

Failure of the binding referendum shall preclude the Village from proceeding with the project. The wording of any referendum shall provide the specific purpose, location, and cost of the project.

(1)  Demolition of an existing structure to facilitate the construction of a designated new building or structure shall be considered part of the construction cost of the approved building. 
(2)  All public construction included in a single solicitation for bids or covered under the same general contract shall be deemed part of a single project. 
(3)  A contract for construction, remodeling, additions or alterations to a single building or structure awarded prior to, or within six months after, the substantial completion of any other such work on the same building or structure shall be deemed part of the initial project. 
(4)  Any number of contracts with individual trades for interrelated work on an integrated construction, remodeling or building addition project shall be deemed part of the same project. 
(5)  Construction of two or more buildings or structures on the same building lot shall be considered a single project if construction on the second building or structure is commenced prior to, or within six months of, substantial completion of the first building. 
(6)  Periodic repairs, replacement or resurfacing of parking lots, driveways, roofs, exterior lighting fixtures or similar improvements shall not be deemed part of the cost of construction activities within an existing building if all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The repair, replacement or resurfacing is necessitated by damage or normal wear unrelated to the construction on the same site; 
b.  The improvement is not materially altered in any dimension or in location; 
c.  The repair, replacement or resurfacing neither necessitates, nor is necessitated by, the construction occurring on the site; 
d.  The repair, replacement or resurfacing is accomplished with substantially the same materials and quality as the existing improvement.

Sec. 23-117. - Intent and purpose. 
This Division is intended to allocate financial burdens of providing public facilities fairly between residents living in the Village at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this Division is derived and owners of existing development projects in the Village and developers of new land developments, as well as to comply with Wis. Stats. § 66.0617. The Village Board is adopting this Division to provide a means to recover the cost of development beyond that already existing to finance public facilities by other means authorized by law as authorized under Wis. Stats. § 66.0617(2)(b), including, without limitation because of enumeration herein, Wis. Stats. §§ 236.45, and Wis. Stats. Ch. 56.

(a)  The following Village documents contain the needs assessments for the impact fees identified under Section 23-118, and demonstrate Village compliance with the requirements of Wis. Stats. § 66.0617(4): 
(1)  Public Facilities Needs Assessment for Public Water Impact Fees prepared by Town and Country Engineers dated December 9, 1997; 
(2)  Report on Impact Fees prepared by Virchow, Krause & Company dated December 9, 1997, as amended by Report dated February 21, 2002; 
(3)  Park Impact Fee, Fee in Lieu of Land Dedication and Public Facility Needs Assessment prepared by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP dated January 27, 2020; and 
(4)  Public Facilities Needs Assessment for Public Library Impact Fees prepared by Virchow Krause & Company, LLP dated March 7, 2006. 
(b)  Revenues collected by the Village as impact fees shall be placed by the Village Clerk-Treasurer in separate segregated interest-bearing accounts, and shall be accounted for separately from other funds of the Village. Impact fee revenues and interest earned on impact fee revenues may be expended by the Village only for the particular capital costs for which the impact fee was imposed, and shall be expended on a first-in first-out basis. Separate accounts shall be kept of fees collected from different impact fee zones, where the particular impact fee ordinance provides for differential fees according to zones, and revenues collected in particular zones shall be spent in those zones as appropriate. 
(c)  All fees collected under this Section shall be spent or refunded to the current property owner within the time set forth in the study prepared under Subsection (a) of this Section, but no later than the maximum time period permitted by law. 
Fees held by the Village and not used within the time period specified herein or pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0617(9) shall be refunded to the current owner of record of the property at the time of the refund with respect to which the impact fees were imposed along with any interest that has accumulated. 
(d)  The Village Board may authorize the payment of impact fees otherwise payable in full at the time of the issuance of a building permit in installment payments. If installment payments are authorized, interest shall be paid on the installment payments at the same rate charged by the Village on installments of special assessments. 
(e)  A "developer," as defined in Wis. Stats. § 66.0617(1)(b), may appeal to contest the amount, collection or use of the impact fee in the manner provided herein: 
(1)  It shall be a condition to the commencement of such an appeal that the impact fee from which the developer appeals shall be paid as and when the fee becomes due and payable, and upon default in making any such payment, such appeal may be dismissed. 
(2)  The only questions appealable under this Section are the following, as authorized by Wis. Stats. § 66.0617(10): 
a.  The amount of fee charged and paid by the developer; 
b.  The method of collection of the impact fee; 
c.  The use to which the particular fee paid by the developer is made by the Village. 
(3)  Appeals must be brought within 30 days of the date of payment of the impact fee. 
(4)  The appellant shall pay the filing fee stated in the fee schedule established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code at the time of filing of the appeal. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Village Administrator. 
(5)  Following the filing of the notice of appeal, the Village Administrator shall compile a record of the ordinance imposing the impact fee that is the subject of the appeal, a record of the management and expenditure of the proceeds of the impact fee, and shall transmit these documents to the Village Board. In consultation with the Village departments, the Village Administrator shall also compile a report on each appeal in which the appellant is seeking a reduction or total refund of the impact fee paid. This report shall specify the fiscal impact on the Village if the appeal overturns the impact fee. If the fiscal impact report indicates that the appeal, if successful, will cause a revenue shortfall that otherwise was not budgeted with respect to the public facility, and if this revenue shortfall cannot be reconciled by reduction in impacts caused by development on the appellant's property, the report shall estimate whether it will be necessary for the Village to adjust impact fees, or amend existing ordinances to recover the proposed revenue shortfall. 
(6)  The Village Board shall hold a public hearing on the appeal, preceded by a class 1 notice, providing fair opportunity for the appellant to be heard. The burden shall be on the appellant to establish illegality or impropriety of the fee from which the appeal has been taken. Following the close of the public hearing, the Village Board shall deliberate upon the matter, and shall conduct such studies and inquiries as it deems appropriate to decide the appeal. 
(7)  If the Village Board determines that the appeal has merit, it shall determine appropriate remedies. These may include reallocation of the proceeds of the challenged impact fee to accomplish the purposes for which the fee was collected, refunding the impact fee in full or in part, along with interest collected by the Village thereon, or granting the appellant the opportunity to make the impact fee payment installments, or such other remedies as it deems appropriate in a particular case.

Whenever any such vehicle has been left unattended on any street or highway in the Village or upon private or public property without the permission of the property owner or other person charged with the lawful jurisdiction thereof for more than 72 hours, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and constitutes a public nuisance. A motor vehicle shall not be considered an abandoned motor vehicle when it is out of ordinary public view or when designated as not abandoned by the Chief of Police or the Building Inspector or their designees. 
(c)  Presumptions. For purposes of this Section, the following irrebuttable presumptions shall apply: Any vehicle left unattended for more than 72 hours on any public street or public ground or left unattended for more than 72 hours on private property without the consent of the property owner is deemed abandoned and constitutes a nuisance; provided, that the vehicle shall not be deemed abandoned under this Subsection if left unattended on private property and is enclosed within a building, or if designated as not abandoned by the Chief of Police. 
(d)  Enforcement procedures. Any vehicle that qualifies as abandoned under Subsection (b) of this Section shall first be placarded with a notice indicating the abandonment of the vehicle. Thereafter, the Chief of Police or designee shall send a notice of abandonment by mail to the owner and lienholders of record as reflected by the registration records of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. If the vehicle remains in approximately the same location for at least 72 hours after placarding and 48 hours after the mailing of notice of abandonment, the Police Department may issue a vehicle abandonment citation and tow the vehicle. 
(e)  Exception for emergencies. The procedure in Subsection (d) of this Section shall not apply if the vehicle in question is blocking a driveway, in a posted tow away zone, blocking traffic or is impeding snow plowing operations during a snow emergency. In such situations, the vehicle may be issued a citation and towed immediately, and the vehicle shall be returned to the owner upon the owner's application without being cited under this Section.

(1)  Is in disrepair (including, but not limited to, incapable of present locomotion, lack of engine, on blocks, without tires); and

(g)  Deposit; release of vehicle. All vehicle abandonment citations shall be retained by the Police Department for personal service on the owner or lienholder of record when such person appears at the Police Department. At the time of personal service, the individual requests a court date, the individual shall deposit such individual's valid Wisconsin operator's license or money in the citation amount with the Police Department, and the procedures in Wis. Stats. §§ 345.34 to 345.47 shall apply. In either case, the vehicle shall be released to the individual. 
(h)  Disposal of abandoned vehicle.

If the vehicle's value is appraised at or at less than $100.00 or if the vehicle is in excess of 19 model years of age, or it is deemed by the Police Department that the cost of towing and storage charges would exceed the value of the vehicle, the Police Department shall send a registered mail notice to the owner and lienholder informing them that if the vehicle is not reclaimed within ten days of the date of receipt of the notice, the vehicle will be junked or sold. If the vehicle's value is appraised at more than $100.00, the Police Department shall send registered mail notice to the owner and lienholder, informing them that, upon their failure to reclaim the vehicle within ten days, such failure is construed as a waiver of all right, title and interest in the vehicle and a consent to the sale of the vehicle. Such sale shall be by sealed bid and shall conform substantially to the procedure set forth in Wis. Stats. § 342.40(3)(c). In either case, if an individual does appear to reclaim the vehicle, the deposit and release procedure set forth in Subsection (g) of this Section shall apply. 
(2)  The notice sent under Subsection (h)(1) of this Section shall notify the owner of record of the right to reclaim personal property contained in the towed vehicle without payment of any kind upon proof of identification and ownership. 
(3)  If a person reclaiming the vehicle does not pay the forfeiture at that time and fails to appear in court at the time specified in the citation, the procedure set forth in Wis. Stats. § 345.28(4), and Section 35-248 shall apply. 
(i)  Violations. Any person violating this Section shall forfeit not less than $20.00 nor more than $100.00 for each violation. The forfeiture for violation of this Section shall be in addition to any other nonmoving traffic violations assessed to the vehicle. The Village shall not separately charge the owner for any costs attributable to towing or storing the vehicle. 
(j)  Collector vehicle exception. The procedure in Subsection (d) of this Section shall not apply to vehicles owned by individuals holding licenses from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation as a collector pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 341.266, or as a hobbyist pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 341.268, provided the licensed collector or hobbyist stores the vehicle on such licensed collector or hobbyist's property and the vehicle and outdoor storage area are maintained in such a manner that they do not constitute a health hazard and are screened from ordinary public view by means of a fence, rapidly growing trees, shrubbery or other appropriate means.

(8)  It appears that the proposed event is so poorly organized that participants therein are likely to engage in aggressive, destructive, or otherwise unlawful activity. 
(9)  If any part of the area described in the said event permit application includes a through intersection such that the highways cross each other. 
(10)  If the event is to be held between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., or, in the case of a parade, sufficient parade marshals are not provided as to reasonably assure the orderly conduct of the parade. 
(11)  The event organizer(s) refuses to cooperate with, meet with or communicate with Village Officials regarding event planning and related requirements, and/or fails to or has demonstrated a past history of failing to comply with conditions set forth for this or past event permits.

(5)  If it is for a use of the park or park facility at a date and time when, in addition to the proposed use, anticipated nonexclusive use by others of the park or park facility is expected and would be seriously adversely affected. 
(6)  If the law enforcement requirements of the exclusive use will require so large a number of persons as to prevent adequate law enforcement to the park, park facility or shelter area involved or of the rest of the Village.

Such sewer service charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided, and in an amount determinable as follows: 
(1)  There shall be three classes of users. 
a.  Category A metered users shall be those discharging normal domestic strength wastewater with up to 250 milligrams per liter for CBOD, and/or 250 milligrams per liter of suspended solids, and/or 40 milligrams per liter or TKN, and/or ten milligrams per liter of TP. 
b.  Category B users shall be those whose wastewater meets the criteria applicable for category A users, but whose water use is unmetered. 
c.  Category C users shall be metered users whose wastewater discharges are high strength wastewater having organic concentrations of CBOD greater than 250 milligrams per liter and/or suspended solids greater than 250 milligrams per liter and/or TKN greater than 40 milligrams per liter, and/or TP greater than ten milligrams per liter. 
(2)  Each user shall be charged a bimonthly customer charge based upon the size of the water meter serving the user. The customer charges shall be as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. 
(3)  Each user shall also be charged a volume charge expressed in dollars per 1,000 gallons of metered water. The charge for each 1,000 gallons of normal domestic strength wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer system shall be as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. 
(4)  Category A users shall be charged a service charge consisting of the customer charge plus the volume charge for each applicable billing cycle. 
(5)  Category B users discharging normal domestic strength wastewater shall be billed at the rate established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. This rate shall be applied only to single-family residential and small commercial customers, and approximates the costs for 12,500 gallons bimonthly discharged to the sewer system. If it determined by the sewer utility that the user discharges more than 12,500 gallons bimonthly to the system, an additional charge established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code will be made for estimated additional usage. 
(6)  Category C users be billed, in addition to the applicable customer charge and volume charge, a high strength surcharge as part of their service charge. The BOD charge shall be as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. The suspended solids charge shall be as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. The TP charge shall be as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. The TKN charge shall be as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. All category C users shall have their wastestreams sampled periodically to determine the extent to which the wastewater stream is subject to the high strength surcharge. 
(e)  Reassignment of sewer users. The Village will reassign sewer users into appropriate sewer service charge categories if wastewater sampling programs and other related information indicate a change of categories is necessary. 
(f)  Billing, payment and penalty. Sewer service charges shall be billed to each user once every two months, or more frequently, if so determined by the Public Utilities Committee. Such charges shall be payable not later than 20 days after the end of each billing period, unless the time for payment has been extended. A penalty of one percent per month shall be added to all bills not paid by the date fixed for payment. 
(g)  Charges a lien. All sewer service charges shall be a lien upon the property serviced pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0821(4)(d), and shall be collected in the manner therein provided. 
(h)  Disposition of revenue. The amounts received from the collection of charges authorized by this Section shall be credited to a sanitary sewerage account, which shall show all receipts and expenditures of the sewerage system. Charges collected for replacement expenses shall be credited to a segregated, nonlapsing replacement account. These funds are to be used exclusively for replacement. When appropriated by the Village, the credits to the sanitary sewerage account shall be available for the payment of the requirements for operation, maintenance, repairs, and depreciation of the sewerage system consistent with 40 CFR 35.929. Any surplus outside the preview of 40 CFR 35.929, in said account, shall be available for the payment of principal and interest of bonds issued and outstanding, or which may be issued, to provide funds for said sewerage system, or part thereof, and all or part of the expenses for additions and improvements and other necessary disbursements or indebtedness, and the Village may resolve to pledge such surplus or any part thereof for any such purpose. All present outstanding sewer system general obligation bonds, including the refunding bonds, shall be paid from this fund as to both principal and interest. 
(i)  Excess revenues. Excess revenues collected from a user class will be applied to operation and maintenance costs attributable to that class for next year. 
(j)  Annual audit. The Village shall authorize and conduct an independent annual audit, the purpose of which shall be to maintain proportionality between users and user classes of the user charge system and to ensure that adequate revenues are available relative to increasing operation, maintenance and replacement costs and debt retirement. The findings and recommendations of this audit shall be published in the Village's official newspaper.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Secs. 47-18947-214. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 2. - WATER SERVICE EXTENSION 
 
Sec. 47-215. - Within the Village. 
The Village Water Utility will extend water mains within the Village and will decide the size of pipe to be used and whether fire protection is to be provided and whether or where hydrants are to be located on the following basis: 
(a)  Public way frontage. In accordance with past practices, rules and policies, water main extensions will be made and water service provided only to those premises that have a frontage on a regularly dedicated and accepted public street, alley or other public strip. 
(b)  Special assessment basis. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, the total cost of extending water distribution mains will be specially assessed pursuant to law including Wis. Stats. §§ 66.0627, 66.0701 and 66.0703, and acts amendatory thereto. 
(c)  Customer financed basis. Where the Village Board decides that, because of present density of prospective customers or because the amount reasonably assessable being in excess of benefits afforded by the extension or because of substantial opposition by owners of property along the line of the requested extension or because of other conditions, the existence of which make it inexpedient and not in the best interest of the utility, its customers, or the residents and taxpayers of the Village or because of any combination of such conditions found to exist, an extension on a special assessment basis is not then warranted, then extensions will be made upon a customer financed basis as follows: 
(1)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this Subsection, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this Subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
a.  Contribution. The owner of property at the time a contribution is made or a refund is payable unless a specific written agreement approved by the Village Board otherwise provides. 
b.  Customer. The owner of premises to which water is to be furnished unless a specific written agreement approved by the Village Board otherwise provides. As to contributions or refunds, the term "customer" more specifically means the owner of the premises at the time the contribution is to be made or the refund becomes payable. 
(2)  Contributions from original customers. The entire cost of the extension, including street crossings and fire hydrants, will be computed and such cost will be divided by the number of feet of main in the proposed extension. The cost of the extension must be advanced and paid to the Village Water Utility by the applicants for the extension before the extension will be made. 
(3)  Additional customers and refunds. When new customers are connected to a water main extension that was paid for in part by initial customers, the Village Water Utility shall require a contribution from each subsequent customer equal to the existing average customer contribution made prior to the new customer's connection. The amount of the average contribution paid by the new customer will be refunded pro-rata within ten years of the date of installation of the water main extension to all contributors (including the new customer) whose remaining unrefunded contribution exceeds the amount that would have been assessed to such customer's property at the time of the original extension if the assessment were computed on a foot basis under Subsection (b) of this Section. When refunds have so reduced the contribution of any contributor, no further refund will be made and after all contributors have received refunds reducing their contribution to such level, then the charge to additional customers who connect to the extension will be assessed at the amount that would have been assessed to their property if it had been assessed under Subsection (b) of this Section on a front-foot basis. 
(4)  When additions to extension will be considered a separate extension. When an addition to an existing extension is required to serve a new customer and the cost of the addition per customer exceeds the remaining average contribution in the original extension then the addition will be treated as a new, separate and distinct extension project; but if the cost of the addition per customer on the addition to an extension is lower than the average remaining contribution in the original extension, then the new customer shall pay the amount of the average remaining contribution from which will be first deducted the cost of the addition and the balance of the contribution refunded as hereinbefore provided for new extensions. 
(5)  Utility financed basis. Where the Village Board decides that it is in the best interests of the public that an extension pursuant to Subsection (b) of this Section on a special assessment basis is not warranted, then extension may be made upon a utility financed basis. New customers that are connected to a water main extension paid for by the utility shall be required to contribute and a pro-rata refund shall be given to the utility.

Sec. 47-216. - Water service and extensions beyond the municipal limits of the Village. 
(a)  In order to provide and maintain adequate fire protection for persons and property within the corporate limits of the Village and to ensure protection of the public and welfare of the Village residents without placing an undue financial burden on the Village taxpayers and to effectively coordinate water department operations with other municipal public works activities and for the purpose of conserving the available water supply, it is hereby determined that it is necessary to specifically limit the territory to an extent to which the Village water utility will serve areas outside of the municipal boundary limits of the Village, and further reserves the right to deny water service to any territory outside of the Village. 
(b)  When water mains are extended outside the corporate limits of the Village, the property owner requesting water service shall pay the total cost of such extensions, including engineering, legal and administrative expense, prior to commencement of work, and any other persons that receive water service from such extension shall be required to pay to the Village Water Utility an amount representing benefits therefrom, based on pro-rata costs of such extension and laterals, and after the Village has, as determined by the Village Board, received in full its costs for said extension and laterals, the balance thereof shall be paid to the persons that paid the original cost of extension thereof. Standard rates to apply. 
(c)  The Village Board, upon request, deems it necessary where practical to extend the water service outside the corporate limits of the Village, from such mains that lay in the Village adjacent to the property to be served and previously installed by special assessment. The property owner desiring such water service shall pay to the Village Water Utility, before commencement of work, a sum as determined by the Village, which amount includes the cost of lateral to property line. Standard water rates to apply. 
(d)  The extension of and/or furnishing of water service to such areas outside the Village shall be subject to all the provisions governing extensions and furnishing of water service to customers that are within the Village limits with the following exceptions: 
(1)  The Village shall not pay any sum for fire protection service afforded by any extension or service outside the Village, and shall be paid by the municipality wherein the same is extended on the same basis as paid by the Village. 
(2)  Water rents charged for service afforded may be in such additional amounts as shall be from time to time provided and approved by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission and shall be payable in advance. 
(3)  Water will be furnished to applicants living outside the Village limits only when such service can be furnished without any adverse effect upon the service inside the Village and the Village Board must approve all applications for extensions and service before extensions will be made or service given. 
(4)  If the application is for water service from an existing main and the application is approved, the main will be tapped and upon installation of the service to the point of use the water will be turned on, but no work will be performed by the utility and no water turned on until: 
a.  The Village Water Utility has been advanced the full cost of the work to be done and materials to be used and provided by the Utility incidental to making the connection including the cost of installation service pipe from the main to the premises. 
b.  The first advance payment for water rental is made. 
(5)  If the application for service requires an extension or addition to the distribution mains, the application will not be approved unless the applicants have secured, in writing, acceptable easements or franchises over the highway, street, public way or public strip where the main is to be extended and unless the applicants agree, in writing, with the Village Board to pay the total cost of the extension and connections thereto pursuant to such specifications as may be made by the Village Board, including the cost of such fire hydrants and hydrant connections as may be required by the Village Board and including the cost of installation across the street and highway intersections and across any other public ground without any free limit provided. Upon such agreement being made and executed, the Village Board shall, if it approves the application, and before the commencement of any work, require the applicants to advance to the utility the total estimated cost to the utility of the extension, the connections thereto and the first advance payment of water rental for each proposed initial connection. 
(6)  All plans and specifications for such extensions must be approved by the State Board of Health. 
(e)  Water mains and connections thereto outside the Village limits shall be under the supervision of the Village Board. 
(f)  All applications for extensions outside of the Village shall be submitted with the understanding and condition that if and when any portion of the property supplied comes into the Village by operation of law, annexation or other proceedings, the ownership of the water main within such area shall become the property of the Village Water Utility without compensation.

ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER UTILITY 
 
Sec. 47-267. - Purpose. 
The Village Board finds that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges draining to the Yahara River watershed and Lake Waubesa is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the Village, its citizens and businesses and others in the surrounding area. In addition, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources have implemented new standards for stormwater management that will require significant upgrades to the existing stormwater practices of the Village, as well as increased costs for complying with these standards. Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the Village by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten residences and businesses with water damage, and create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the Village. A system for the collection and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the Village and surrounding areas including properties not currently served by the systems. The cost of operating and maintaining the Village stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the Village Board hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish the rates for stormwater management services adopting and publishing as required by law the regulations contained in this Section, the Village is acting pursuant to the authority granted by Wis. Stats. § 66.0821.

(c)  Subject to the approval of the Village Board, the McFarland Stormwater Utility, shall have the power and authority to acquire, construct, lease, own, operate, maintain, extend, expand, replace, clean, dredge, repair, conduct, manage, and finance such utilities, operations and activities, as are deemed by the Village to be proper and reasonably necessary for a system of stormwater and surface water management. These facilities may include, without limitation due to enumeration, surface and underground drainage facilities, sewers, watercourses, retaining walls, ponds, streets, roads, ditches and such other facilities relating to collection, runoff and retention. This includes facilities that will support a stormwater management system, whether such facilities are owned and operated directly by the Village or are provided under statutory or contractual provisions and furnishing of which facilities create or impose a cost or charge upon the Village for the services afforded by such facilities.

A stormwater utility charge to cover the costs of the stormwater management system necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in Section 47-267 shall apply to each developed parcel in the Village. The Village Engineer shall prepare a map depicting all such properties in the Village other than single-family and duplex units and which shall be approved by the Public Utilities Committee. In the alternative, the Village Engineer may submit data justifying the calculation of impervious surface areas for properties other than single-family and duplex units not yet included on such map. A copy of such map or such calculations of impervious areas shall be kept on file in the office of the Director of Public Works. Stormwater charges shall not apply to public highways, railroad rights-of-way or cemeteries. 
(Ord. No. 2007-10, § 1(9-6-4), 11-12-2007)  
Sec. 47-271. - Calculation of stormwater utility charges. 
(a)  Customer classification. All property subject to stormwater utility charges shall be classified into one of the following customer classes: 
(1)  Single-family or duplex unit. 
(2)  Non-single-family or duplex unit. 
(b)  Stormwater fee. Each customer shall be charged a stormwater fee based upon a charge as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code unless a different charge is recommended by the Public Utilities Committee and adopted by the Village Board by resolution. The stormwater fee shall include amounts for the fixed costs of the Stormwater Utility, as well as the Variable Costs of the Stormwater Utility based on its actual experience in the administration of the Stormwater Utility. The Public Utilities Committee shall assure that the fixed cost component and the Variable Cost component of the stormwater fee are accounted for separately on an ongoing basis. A copy of any such resolution shall be filed with the Village Clerk-Treasurer and Village Engineer upon adoption. 
(c)  Single-family and duplex units. Each single-family and duplex unit shall equal one ERU. 
(d)  Non-single-family or duplex units. Each other parcel, whether multifamily residential, commercial, industrial or institutional, shall be charged for one ERU or a number of ERUs equal to the ratio of the total impervious area of the parcel to the square footage of one ERU whichever is greater. (For example, a parcel with 5,200 square feet of impervious area shall be charged for 1.5 ERUs.) The number of ERUs shall be rounded to the nearest tenth. 
(Ord. No. 2007-10, § 1(9-6-5), 11-12-2007; Ord. No. 2010-02, § 4, 1-11-2010; Ord. No. 2017-12 , § 138, 6-26-2017)  
Sec. 47-272. - Credits. 
Credits may be obtained toward a reduction of the stormwater fee chargeable to a given parcel which is attributable to operation and maintenance expenses of the Utility. Such credits may be obtained as follows: 
(a)  Discharge rate reduction. Owners of developed parcels having impervious area with greater than one ERU assigned to such parcels and not containing single-family or duplex units may receive a credit calculated against the stormwater fee in accordance with Subsection (i) of this Section, arising from the portion of the stormwater fee related to impervious areas that are in excess of one ERU if new on-site stormwater facilities not specifically required by ordinance, permit, statute or regulation are installed which reduce stormwater discharge rates below levels specified in the Stormwater Credit Manual. In all cases, reduction shall be calculated in accordance with the then-current calculation methodologies by the Wisconsin Department of Resources and by Dane County as set forth in the Stormwater Credit Manual. 
(b)  Runoff volume reduction. Owners of developed parcels having impervious area with greater than one ERU assigned to such parcels and not containing single-family or duplex units may receive a credit against the stormwater fee calculated in accordance with Subsection (i) of this Section, arising from the portion of the stormwater fee related to impervious areas that are in excess of one ERU if new on-site stormwater facilities not specifically required by ordinance, permit, statute or regulation are installed which reduce the total volume of runoff to levels specified in the Stormwater Credit Manual. In all cases, reduction shall be calculated in accordance with the then-current calculation methodologies approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and by Dane County as set forth in the Stormwater Credit Manual. 
(c)  Quality improvement. Owners of developed parcels having impervious area with greater than one ERU assigned to such parcels not containing single family or duplex units may receive a credit against the stormwater fee calculated in accordance with Subsection (i) of this Section, arising from the portion of the stormwater fee related to impervious areas that are in excess of one ERU if new on-site stormwater facilities not specifically required by ordinance, permit, statute or regulation are installed which reduce suspended solids discharges below levels specified in the Stormwater Credit Manual. In all cases, reduction shall be calculated in accordance with the then-current calculation methodology approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and by Dane County as set forth in the Stormwater Credit Manual. 
(d)  Education. A credit not to exceed 20 percent of the total stormwater fee due against the stormwater fee related to impervious areas for that property that is in excess of one ERU for any elementary, middle or high school, property may be granted where an established stormwater education curriculum is taught. Such credit shall apply only to the property of the school where the stormwater education curriculum is taught. The method of calculation of the credit shall be established by the Village Board upon review of a proposed curriculum. A qualified stormwater education curriculum shall present stormwater and water resources management education to every student at least one time during each student's time at the particular school and shall be reasonably calculated to encourage appreciation and stewardship of water resources and thereby reduce negative impacts on local streams and lakes. Subsections (h) through (l) of this Section shall not apply to obtain this credit. Application for this credit shall be made by submitting a proposed curriculum to the Village Administrator with a written request for consideration of a credit. The Village Administrator shall review the proposed curriculum and shall submit a recommendation to the Village Board within 45 days of receipt of the request unless an extension of time is agreed to, in writing, by the school or district. The Village Administrator may negotiate with the school or district during the 45 days regarding the specifications of the curriculum and the amount of credit to be recommended, however, the Village Board shall have final approval authority. 
(e)  Direct discharge. Owners of developed parcels having impervious area with greater than one ERU assigned to such parcels and not containing single-family or duplex units may receive a credit against the stormwater fee calculated in accordance with Subsection (i) of this Section, arising from the portion of the stormwater fee related to impervious areas that are in excess of one ERU if the owner demonstrates as set forth in the Stormwater Credit Manual that more than 50 percent of the parcel area drains directly to Lake Waubesa or Upper Mud Lake without passing through any portion of the stormwater collection and conveyance system operated or maintained by the Village or without crossing any public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Combined. Where a stormwater fee credit is sought by an owner for multiple reductions or improvements, the maximum credit allowed shall not exceed that portion of the total stormwater fee calculated in accordance with Subsection (i) of this Section, that exceeds one ERU. 
(g)  Effect of credits. In the event the Village grants any stormwater fee credits, the cost of any credits may be reallocated across other Village properties by increasing the amount of a single ERU so that the total revenue available to the Stormwater Utility shall not be reduced by the amount of the credits allowed. 
(h)  Application. To obtain a stormwater fee credit, the owner must submit an application on a form prescribed by the Village Clerk-Treasurer including design calculations as specified in the Stormwater Credit Manual. The Village Engineer shall review the application and supporting materials to determine eligibility and amount of the credit. No property shall receive a credit unless the calculation methodology conforms to the calculation methodologies specified in the Stormwater Credit Manual. If the information submitted is complete, the Village Engineer shall make a determination within 30 days of submittal. 
(i)  Calculation of credit. If any property qualifies for a stormwater fee credit under Subsections (a) through (e), the maximum available credit shall be applied only against the Variable Cost component of the stormwater fee. No credit is available against the Fixed Cost component of the stormwater fee. In no event may a credit reduce the stormwater fee below the charge for one ERU per year. 
(j)  Appeal. Appeal of the determination of the Village Engineer shall be heard by the Public Utilities Committee. Written notice of appeal shall be filed with the Village Clerk-Treasurer within 15 days of receipt of the Village Engineer's determination. The notice of appeal shall describe the basis of the appeal. 
(k)  Fees. The credit application shall be accompanied by a fee as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. Any notice of appeal under Subsection (j) of this Section shall be accompanied by a fee as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. 
(l)  Effective date. No credit shall take effect unless the stormwater management facilities for which the application was filed are installed and approved by the Village Engineer. Any stormwater facility approved by the Village Engineer shall receive a credit as of July 1 in the year of completion if completed prior to April 1 of such year. Any stormwater facility approved by the Village Engineer after April 1 of any year shall receive a credit on January 1 of the next succeeding year. 
(m)  Maintenance. Once installed, the owner of developed parcels shall maintain the practices for which credit was granted. In order to qualify for a credit in each succeeding year, owners shall certify in writing to the Village no later than November 1 of each succeeding year of their continued maintenance of the practice for which credit was granted. Failure to maintain the practice shall result in cancellation of the credit.

Sec. 47-371. - Video service provider fee and PEG channel monetary support. 
(a)  Video service provider fee. Video service providers and cable operators shall pay, in addition to the PEG support fee set forth in Subsection (b) of this Section, a video service provider fee to the Village in an amount equal to five percent of the provider's gross receipts. 
(b)  Public, educational and government (PEG) channel monetary support. Video service providers and cable operators shall pay, in addition to the video service provider fee set forth in Subsection (a) of this Section, a monthly fee of $0.25 per subscriber, which payment shall be used to fund PEG access related external costs. The allocation of the PEG channel monetary support fee between public access and government access activities/channels shall be at the sole discretion of the Village, and the Village may alter such allocation at any time and without notice. 
(c)  Supporting documentation. Payment of the fees set forth in Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section shall be accompanied by documentation verified by an agent or officer with the authority to legally bind the provider that is sufficient for the Village to verify the accuracy of the fees being paid by the provider. The failure to provide such documentation shall subject the provider to a forfeiture of not less than $100.00 nor more than $5,000.00 per day until such time the documentation is provided to the Village.  
Sec. 47-372. - PEG channel requirements. 
(a)  Number of PEG channels. Video service providers and cable operators shall provide capacity for three PEG channels. These channels shall be allocated as follows: one specifically designated for the McFarland Cable Channel for the operation by the Village of McFarland of a governmental access channel, one channel dedicated for use by WYOU, which is operated as a public access channel by WYOU Community Television Inc., and one channel dedicated for use as an educational access channel by the McFarland School District. 
(b)  Location of PEG channels. PEG channels must be carried on any service tier that is viewed by more than 50 percent of the video service provider's or cable operator's customers. Video service providers or cable operators may not charge an extra fee nor require the rental of special equipment in order for their customers to view such PEG channels if such fees or equipment are not required to view any of the non-PEG channels on such service tiers. 
(c)  Quality of PEG channels. Video service providers and cable operators shall not carry a PEG television signal in a lesser format or lower resolution than that afforded to a non-broadcast digital programmer carried on the video or cable system. The signal quality of PEG channels shall be indistinguishable or better than the signal of other non-PEG channels carried by the video service provider or cable operator. 
(d)  Crops/origination points. Video service providers and cable operators shall apply and maintain upstream capacity from all current origination points (also known as "live drops") and shall provide sufficient capacity for carriage of a television signal from each of these origination points at all times. These origination points are all located in the Village of McFarland as follows: 
(1)  McFarland Municipal Center, 5920 Milwaukee Street; 
(2)  E.D. Locke Public Library, 5920 Milwaukee Street; 
(3)  McFarland High School, 5101 Farwell Street;

(5)  Madison Curling Club, 4802 Marsh Road. 
(e)  Substantial utilization of PEG channels and PEG programming. 
(1)  Procedures for disconnection due to failure to substantially utilize PEG channel. 
a.  Written notice of objection to program as not locally produced. A Video service provider or cable operator must provide written notice to the PEG channel director within ten days of the first or original airing of any program that the video service provider or cable operator is objecting to the program as having not been locally produced. Such notice shall describe with particularity the program being objected to, the date and time the program was first aired and the factual basis supporting the objection. Failure to timely provide this notice waives the objection and, therefore, such program will be counted towards the determination of whether said PEG channel is being substantially utilized. 
b.  Written notification of failure to substantially utilize channel. A video service provider or cable operator must provide written notification to any PEG channel director within ten days following any week in which the video service provider or cable operator objects that the PEG channel has not been substantially utilized. Such notice shall describe with particularity the time period being objected to, the dates and times during the week in which qualifying programming was not aired and the factual basis supporting the objection. Failure to provide this notice in a timely manner waives the objection and, therefore, such programming period will be counted towards the determination of whether said PEG channel is being substantially utilized. 
c.  Written notification of intention to disconnect, reprogram or drop PEG channel. A video service provider or cable operator must provide 120 days' advance written notification to any PEG channel director that the video service provider or cable operator intends to disconnect, reprogram or drop. A video service provider or cable operator may not disconnect, reprogram or drop any PEG channel that it has not provided in a timely manner with such written notice. Furthermore, should any PEG channel director provide the video service provider or cable operator with a written response that the PEG channel was substantially utilized by the Village, the video service provider or cable operator shall not disconnect, reprogram or drop the PEG channel. 
d.  Penalty for failing to provide notice(s). If any video service provider or cable operator disconnects, reprograms or drops any PEG channels without providing the notice(s) as required in Subsections (e)(1)a. through (e)(1)c. of this Section, the video service provider or cable operator shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Immediate reinstatement of the PEG channel to its location in the channel lineup prior to the disconnection, reprogramming or dropping of the channel. 
2.  A forfeiture of not less than $1,000.00 nor more than $10,000.00 for each day that the PEG channel is disconnected, reprogrammed or dropped. 
(2)  Locally produced programming. Locally produced programming shall include all programming produced by any PEG channel and shall include all programming that has not been commercially aired. For the purposes of this Subsection, the term "locally produced programming" includes any program that was in part produced for original airing in the broadcast market in which it was produced either in part or in whole. The term "locally produced" shall not require that the programming was created, filmed or produced in the Village or County area. PEG stations may share and exchange programming content in order to meet the substantial utilization requirements of Wis. Stats. § 66.0420(5)(b). 
(f)  Underwriting of programming. PEG channels may transmit non-commercial programming to subscribers generally or specific recipients of video service providers or cable operators. Nothing herein shall in any way prohibit or prevent PEG channels from accepting grants or sponsorships in support of such programming, nor shall PEG channels be prohibited from acknowledging such grants or sponsorships before, during or immediately after such PEG programming has been broadcast in a manner that is similar to the manner in which the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) acknowledges the substantially similar support of its programming content. Such acknowledgements shall comply with the requirements of 47 USC 399b as though the PEG channel were a public broadcast station. 
(g)  Notice of intention to move PEG channel locations/designations. Any video service provider or cable operator who intends to move any PEG channel from the channel designations may only make such a change after providing 60 days' advance written notice to the affected PEG channel(s). Additionally, such video service provider or cable operator shall engage in a public education program of such intensity and duration as to reasonably inform the general public of the proposed PEG channel designations.  
Sec. 47-373. - Police powers, design/construction standards and rights-of-way. 
(a)  Subject to police powers. Video service providers and cable operators are subject to the police power of the Village to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety, health and welfare of the public. The grant of a statewide video or cable franchise does not render or to any extent lose, waive, impair or lessen the lawful powers and rights, now or hereafter vested in the Village under the constitution and statutes of the state to regulate the use of streets and public ways or to regulate any matter affecting the safety, health and welfare of the public. The Village shall make the video service provider's and cable operator's history of compliance with such codes and ordinances available to the Department of Financial Institutions so that the department may determine the provider or operator's legal, financial and technical qualifications to provide video services. 
(b)  Design, permits, construction and excavation. Video service providers and cable operators shall comply with all applicable Village codes and ordinances including, without limitation by expression herein, Section 53-122, and shall be subject to any forfeitures so specified for any violations thereof. The Village shall make the person's history of compliance with such codes and ordinances available to the Department of Financial Institutions so that the department may determine the provider or operator's legal, financial and technical qualifications to provide video services.

Sec. 53-482. - Application. 
Application for such permit shall be made to the Building Inspector on a form provided by the Village and shall be accompanied by a drawing accurately depicting the portion of the proposed private driveway to be constructed, reconstructed, altered or enlarged lying within the dedicated portion of the public street, the dimensions thereof and a statement of the materials proposed to be used. The applicant shall pay the fee established by the Village Board from time to time and declared in Appendix A to this Code. Upon receipt of the application and the fee if required, unless the proposed private driveway is a part of construction for a building or other structure for which a building permit has been applied for, in which case no additional fee is required, the Building Inspector may approve such application if the proposed driveway complies with the terms and conditions of this and any other applicable Village ordinance.

All driveway permit applications shall contain the applicant's statement that: 
(a)  The applicant represents all parties in interest, and that such proposed driveway is for the bona fide purpose of securing access to the applicant's property and not for the purpose of parking or servicing vehicles, advertising, storage or merchandising of goods within the dedicated portion of the Village street, or for any other purpose. 
(b)  The Village, notwithstanding the construction of such driveway, reserves the right to make any changes, additions, repairs or relocations within the dedicated portion of the Village street at any time, including relocation, reconstruction, widening and maintaining the street without compensating the owner of such private driveway for the damage or destruction of such private roadway. 
(c)  The permittee, successors or assigns, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Village, its officials, officers, agents or employees, against any claim or any cause of action for personal injury or property damage sustained by reason of the exercise of such permit. 
(d)  The Village does not assume any responsibility for the removal or clearance of snow, ice or sleet or the opening of any windrows of such material upon such portion of such driveway within the dedicated portion of the Village street. 
(Code 1998, § 6-3-1(d))

The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in and graded only when the following requirements are complied with: 
(a)  The filling or draining shall be to grades approved by the Director of Public Works and, except where highway drainage is by means of curb and gutter, water drainage of the area shall be directed away from the street roadbed in a suitable manner. 
(b)  Culvert extensions under the restricted area shall be of the same size and of equivalent acceptable material as the culvert under the driveway. Intermediate manholes adequate for cleanout purposes may be required where the total culvert length is excessive. 
(c)  Where no street side ditch separates the restricted area from the street roadbed, permanent provision may be required to separate the area from the street roadbed to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes by construction of a border, curb, rail or posts as may be required by the Director of Public Works.

(Code 1998, § 6-3-2(a)(10))  
Sec. 53-518. - Variances. 
Any of the requirements listed in this Article may be varied by the Village Board in such instances where the peculiar nature of the property or the design of the street may make the rigid adherence to the requirements listed in this Article impossible or impractical, or when the Village Board determines that a variance is appropriate in order for the property to have reasonable and adequate street access, after considering the risk to the public, the volume of traffic on the affected street, and any other factor the Village Board determines relevant in making this determination.

Stats. § 236.293, which constitute a restriction on the use of all private or platted property within a minor land division or Subdivision for the benefit of the public or property owners and to provide mutual protection against undesirable aspects of development, which would tend to impair stability of values. 
(ff)  Replat. The process of changing, or a map or plat that changes, the boundaries of a recorded Subdivision Plat or part thereof. The legal dividing of a large block, lot or outlot within a recorded Subdivision Plat or Certified Survey Map without changing exterior boundaries of said block, lot or outlot is not a Replat. 
(gg)  Shorelands. Those lands within the following distances: 1,000 feet from the high-water elevation of navigable lakes, ponds and flowages or 300 feet from the high-water elevation of navigable streams or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever is greater. 
(hh)  Subdivider. Any person, firm or corporation, or any agent thereof, dividing or proposing to divide land resulting in a Subdivision, Certified Survey Map or Replat. 
(ii)  Subdivision. A division of a lot, parcel, or tract of land by the owner thereof or agent for the purpose of sale or of building development where: 
(1)  The act of division creates five or more parcels or building sites of 35 acres each or less in area; or 
(2)  Five or more parcels or building sites of 35 acres each or less in area are created by successive divisions within a period of five years; 
(3)  The act of division or the creation of any parcels or building sites results in the creation or alteration of any street or alley; 
(4)  The definitions herein shall apply with equal effect to the division or creation of parcels or building sites whether or not said tracts shall, at such time, be part of a previously platted Subdivision. 
(jj)  Surveyor. A State of Wisconsin registered land surveyor.

The Village shall not issue any building permit relating to any parcel of land forming all or any part of lands included in a Subdivision, land division, Replat or Certified Survey Map originally submitted to the Village on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this Chapter is derived until the applicant has complied with all of the provisions and requirements of this Chapter. 
(e)  Applicability to condominiums. This Chapter is expressly applicable to condominium developments within the Village's jurisdiction, pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 703.27(1). For purposes of this Chapter, a condominium unit and any associated limited common elements shall be deemed to be equivalent to a lot or parcel created by the act of Subdivision. 
(Code 1998, § 14-1-20; Ord. No. 99-11, §§ 35, 8-23-1999)  
Sec. 56-7. - Land suitability. 
(a)  Suitability. 
(1)  No land shall be subdivided for residential, commercial or industrial use which is held unsuitable for such use by the Village Board, upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission, for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the future residents of the proposed Subdivision or of the community. 
(2)  The Village Board, in applying the provisions of this Section, shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for residential, commercial, industrial or institutional use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability if the subdivider so desires. Thereafter the Village Board may affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability. 
(b)  Existing flora. The subdivider shall make every effort to protect and retain all existing trees, shrubbery, vines, and grasses not actually lying in public roadways, drainageways, building foundation sites, private driveways, soil absorption waste disposal areas, paths, and trails. Such trees are to be protected and preserved during construction in accordance with sound conservation practices, possibly including the preservation of trees by well islands or retaining walls whenever abutting grades are altered, pursuant to a landscaping plan filed by the subdivider. 
(Code 1998, § 14-1-21)  
Sec. 56-8. - Condominium developments. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The Village Board hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this Chapter to condominium developments. The state legislature has recognized that Subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that Subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium. 
(2)  The factor that makes this Chapter applicable to a condominium development is the creation of multiple, distinct property entities at or near the ground surface, subject to property taxation as separate parcels, with each property entity having different ownership and management. The Village determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar, both physically and in ownership, from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership, management, and control. 
(3)  Thus, the Village Board hereby finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments that are characterized by division of land into lots. These impacts include: 
a.  Additional population density. 
b.  Possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the land's characteristics. 
c.  Additional demands upon Village parks, recreation areas, utility facilities and schools. 
d.  Additional traffic and street use. 
(b)  Portions of Chapter applicable to condominium developments. The following Sections of this Chapter shall apply to condominium developments: 
(1)  Section 56-7 relating to land suitability and construction practices. 
(2)  Sections 56-3556-37 relating to Preliminary Plat approval. This stage of approval shall be the only approval required for a condominium development. The technical requirements for Preliminary Plats set forth in Section 56-69 shall not apply, since condominiums have separate technical standards set forth in Wis. Stats. Ch. 703. 
(3)  Article VIII of this Chapter relating to fees for review. 
(4)  Article IV of this Chapter relating to required improvements. 
(5)  Article V of this Chapter relating to design standards for improvements. 
(6)  Article VI of this Chapter relating to dedication requirements. 
(c)  Exceptions. This Section shall not apply to the following condominiums: 
(1)  Any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this Chapter is derived.

ARTICLE II. - PLAT REVIEW AND APPROVAL 
 
Sec. 56-35. - Preliminary consultation. 
Before submitting a Preliminary Plat or Certified Survey Map, the subdivider is encouraged to consult with the Community Development Director for advice regarding general Subdivision requirements. Information on meeting dates, agenda deadlines and filing requirements may be obtained from the Community Development Department. The subdivider shall also submit a location map showing the relationship of the proposed Subdivision to traffic arteries and existing community facilities. This consultation is neither formal nor mandatory but is intended to inform the subdivider of the purpose and objectives of these regulations, the comprehensive plan, comprehensive plan components and duly adopted plan implementation devices of the Village and to otherwise assist the subdivider in planning a development. In so doing, both the subdivider and planning agency may reach mutual conclusions regarding the general program and objectives of the proposed development and its possible effects on the neighborhood and community. The subdivider will gain a better understanding of the subsequent required procedures. 
(Code 1998, § 14-1-30; Ord. No. 99-11, § 6, 8-23-1999)

The plat shall not be approved or deemed approved until any objections have been satisfied. If the objecting agency fails to act within the 20 day limit it shall be deemed to have no objection to the plat. 
(3)  In lieu of the procedure under Subsection (h)(1) of this Section, the subdivider or the subdivider's agent may submit the original plat to the Wisconsin Department of Administration, which shall forward two copies to each of the agencies authorized to object. The Wisconsin Department of Administration shall have the required number of copies made at the subdivider's expense. Within 20 days of the date of receiving the copies of the plat, any agency having authority to object shall notify the subdivider, and all agencies having the authority to object, of any objection based upon failure of the plat to comply with the statutes or rules which its examination is authorized to cover, or if there is no objection, it shall so certify on the face of a copy of the plat and return that copy to the Wisconsin Department of Administration. After each agency and the Wisconsin Department of Administration have certified that they have no objection or that their objections have been satisfied, the Wisconsin Department of Administration shall so certify on the face of the plat. If an agency fails to act within 20 days from the date of the receipt of copies of the plat, and the Wisconsin Department of Administration fails to act within 30 days of receipt of the original plat, it shall be deemed that there are no objections to the plat and, upon demand, it shall be so certified on the face of the plat by the Wisconsin Department of Administration. 
(i)  Drafting standards. The subdivider shall submit to the Village Clerk-Treasurer and to those agencies having the authority to object to plats under provisions in Wis. Stats. Ch. 236 copies of a Preliminary Plat (or Certified Survey Map) based upon an accurate exterior boundary survey by a registered land surveyor that shall show clearly the proposed Subdivision at a scale of not more than one inch per 100 feet having two-foot contour intervals, shall identify the improvements (grading, tree planting, paving, installation of facilities and dedications of land), easements that the subdivider proposes to make and shall indicate by accompanying letter when the improvements will be provided. Any proposed restrictive covenants for the land involved shall be submitted.

Sec. 56-37. - Preliminary Plat review and approval. 
(a)  Plan commission review. After review of the Preliminary Plat and negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of public improvements that will be required, the Plan Commission shall, within 60 days, or within such time as extended by agreement with the subdivider of its submission, approve, approve conditionally, or reject the plat. The subdivider shall be notified in writing of any conditions for approval of the reasons for rejection. Such action of the Plan Commission shall be submitted to the Village Board for approval and the subdivider shall be notified in writing of any changes or modifications in the action of the Plan Commission and the reasons therefor. 
(b)  Public hearing. The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall schedule a public hearing on the Preliminary Plat before the Plan Commission. The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall give notice of the Plan Commission's review and public hearing on the Preliminary Plat or Certified Survey Map by listing it as an agenda item in the Plan Commission's meeting notice published in the official Village newspaper. The notice shall include the name of the applicant, the address of the property in question and the requested action. Property owners within 200 feet of the proposed land division shall receive written notice of the public hearing. 
(c)  Board action. After receipt of the Plan Commission's recommendation, the Village Board shall, within 90 days of the date the plat was filed with the Village Clerk-Treasurer approve, approve conditionally or reject such plat and shall state, in writing, any conditions of approval or reasons for rejection, unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. Failure of the Village Board to act within 90 days or extension thereof shall constitute an approval of the Preliminary Plat, unless other authorized agencies object to the plat. The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall communicate to the subdivider the action of the Village Board. If the Preliminary Plat is approved, the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall endorse it for the Village Board. 
(d)  Effect of Preliminary Plat approval. Approval or conditional approval of a Preliminary Plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the Final Plat, except that if the Final Plat is submitted within 36 months of Preliminary Plat approval and conforms substantially to the Preliminary Plat layout, the Final Plat shall be entitled to approval. The Preliminary Plat shall be deemed an expression of approval or conditional approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of the Final Plat, which will be subject to further consideration by the Plan Commission and Village Board at the time of its submission. 
(e)  Preliminary Plat amendment. Should the subdivider desire to amend the Preliminary Plat as approved, the subdivider may resubmit the amended plat, which shall follow the same procedure, except for the fee, unless the amendment is, in the opinion of the Village Board, of such scope as to constitute a new plat, in which such case it shall be refiled.

(a)  Compliance with statutes. In laying out a Subdivision, the owner shall conform to the provisions of Wis. Stats. Ch. 236, and all applicable Village regulations. In all cases where the requirements of this Chapter are different from the requirements of Wis. Stats. Ch. 236, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
(b)  Dedication. The subdivider shall dedicate land and improve streets as provided in this Chapter and Section 56-106. Streets shall be located with due regard for topographical conditions, natural features, existing and proposed streets, utilities and land uses and public convenience and safety. Streets shall conform to Official Maps adopted by the Village Board. The Subdivision, Certified Survey Parcel or land division shall be so designed as to provide each lot with satisfactory access to a public street or road. 
(c)  Compliance with comprehensive plan. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to any Village Comprehensive Plan and to this Chapter and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographical conditions, to run-off of stormwater, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The arrangement of streets in new Subdivisions shall make provision for the appropriate continuation at the same width of the existing streets in adjoining areas. 
(d)  Comprehensive Plan. In areas not covered by a Village Comprehensive Plan, the layout of streets shall conform to the plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas of the neighborhood. Streets shall be designed and located in relation to existing and officially planned streets, topography and natural terrain, streams and lakes and existing tree growth, public convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets. 
(e)  Street classifications. Streets shall be classified as indicated below. 
(1)  Arterial streets. Arterial streets shall be arranged to provide through traffic for a heavy volume of vehicles. 
(2)  Collector streets. Collector streets shall provide ready collection of traffic from commercial and residential areas and conveyance of this traffic to the major street and highway system and shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as schools, houses of worship and shopping centers and other concentrations of population and to the major streets into which they feed. 
(3)  Local streets. Local streets shall be arranged to conform to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit the design of efficient storm and sanitary sewerage systems and to require the minimum street area necessary to provide safe and convenient access to abutting property. 
(4)  Proposed streets. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary lines of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Village Board, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the Subdivision or land division or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. 
(f)  Reserve strips. Reserve strips shall not be provided on any plat to control access to streets or alleys, except where control of such strips is placed with the Village under conditions approved by the Village Board. 
(g)  Alleys. 
(1)  Commercial and industrial. Alleys shall be provided in all Commercial and Industrial Districts for off-street loading and service access, except that the Village Board may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading and parking, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
(2)  Residential. Alleys shall not be approved in residential areas unless deemed appropriate or necessary by the Village Board. 
(3)  Width. The width of alleys shall not be less than 24 feet. 
(4)  Dead end. Dead-end alleys are prohibited, and crooked and "T" alleys shall be discouraged. 
(h)  Continuation. Streets shall be laid out to provide for possible continuation wherever topographic and other physical conditions permit. Provision shall be made so that all proposed streets shall have a direct connection with, or be continuous and in line with, existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Village Board, upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the Subdivision with existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. 
(i)  Local streets. Local streets shall be so laid out so as to discourage their use by through traffic. 
(j)  Number of intersections. The number of intersections of local streets with major streets shall be reduced to the practical minimum consistent with circulation needs and safety requirements, preferably not more than two. 
(k)  Frontage roads. Where a Subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial highway, the Village Board may require a frontage road, nonaccess reservation along the rear of the property contiguous to such highway or such other treatment as may be necessary to ensure safe, efficient traffic flow and adequate protection of residential properties. 
(l)  Private streets. Private streets are prohibited, except as part of a condominium development; and the Village Board shall not permit installation of public improvements in any private street.

a.  Arterial streets: six percent. 
b.  Collector streets: seven percent. 
c.  Local streets, alleys and frontage streets: ten percent. 
d.  Pedestrian ways: 12 percent unless steps of acceptable design are provided. 
The grade of any street shall in no case exceed ten percent or be less than one-half of one percent. 
(2)  Street grades shall be established wherever practicable so as to avoid excessive grading, the promiscuous removal of ground cover and tree growth, and general leveling of the topography. 
(3)  All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent in feet to 15 times the algebraic difference in the rates of grade for major and collector streets and one-half this minimum for all other streets. 
(p)  Radii of curvature. When a continuous street centerline deflects at any one point by more than ten degrees, a circular curve shall be introduced having a radius of curvature on said centerline of not less than the following: 
(1)  Arterial streets and highways: 300 feet. 
(2)  Collector streets: 200 feet. 
(3)  Local streets: 100 feet. 
Curves should be provided when centerline deflections exceed one degree in rural areas and in urban areas when deflection exceeds three degrees. 
(q)  Half-streets. Where an existing dedicated or platted half-street is adjacent to the Subdivision, the other half-street shall be dedicated by the subdivider. The platting of half-streets should be avoided where possible. 
(r)  Intersections. 
(1)  Property lines at street intersections of major thoroughfares shall be rounded with a radius of 15 feet or of a greater radius where the Village Engineer considers it necessary. 
(2)  Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. 
(3)  Number of streets converging at one intersection shall be reduced to a minimum, preferably not more than two.

The subdivider shall dedicate usable land to provide park, playground, recreational and open space to meet the needs to be created by the Subdivision, land division, or development project in accordance with the standards set forth in this Article, subject to approval by the Village Board. Whenever a proposed park, playground, or other public land, other than streets or drainageways, is designated in the Village Comprehensive Plan and Outdoor Recreation & Open Space Plan is included, all or in part, in a tract of land to be subdivided, these proposed public lands shall be dedicated to the public by the subdivider. The parkland dedication shall meet the service standard of 2,106 square feet per single family dwelling unit, 1,463 square feet per multi family dwelling unit, including apartments and duplexes, and 804 square feet per group quarters dwelling unit, determined by the number and types of dwelling units in the proposed development and the most current needs assessment. The dedication shall be made part of the Plat or Certified Survey Map. 
(b)  Park-land impact fee in lieu of parkland dedication. The Plan Commission may determine in any proposed Subdivision or other land division that, based on an evaluation of the proposed dedication against the Village's Comprehensive Plan and Outdoor Recreation & Open Space Plan, and any other policies adopted by the Village Board, the subdivider shall pay the park-land impact fee in lieu of dedicating parklands. If the Plan Commission determines that a proposed dedication meets some but not all the usable land criteria, the Plan Commission may recommend, and the Village Board may approve, acceptance of that land with partial credit to the land dedication requirement. 
(c)  Other land dedications. Whenever a tract of land to be subdivided embraces all or any part of an arterial street, collector street, drainageway or other public way that has been designated in the Village Comprehensive Plan, said public way shall be dedicated by the subdivider in the locations and dimensions indicated on said plan, and made part of the Plat or Certified Survey Map. 
(d)  Shoreland. 
(1)  Public access. All Subdivisions abutting on a navigable lake or stream shall provide public access at least 60 feet wide providing access to the low watermark so that there will be public access, which is connected to existing public roads, at not more than one-half-mile intervals as measured along the lake or stream shore except where greater intervals and wider access is agreed upon by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the Wisconsin Department of Administration, and excluding shore areas where public parks or open-space streets or roads on either side of a stream are provided. No public access established under this Chapter may be vacated except by Circuit Court action. This Subsection does not require the Village to improve land provided for public access. 
(2)  Lake and stream shore plats. The lands lying between the meander line, established in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 236.20(2)(g), and the water's edge, and any otherwise unplattable lands that lie between a proposed Subdivision and the water's edge shall be included as part of lots, outlots or public dedications in any plat abutting a lake or stream. This Subsection applies not only to lands proposed to be subdivided but also to all lands under option to the subdivider or in which the subdivider holds any interest and which are contiguous to the lands proposed to be subdivided and which abut a lake or stream. 
(e)  Unknown number of dwelling units. Where the plat, certified survey, or condominium does not specify the number of dwelling units to be constructed, the land dedication shall be based upon the maximum number of units permitted by the Village Zoning Chapter and this Chapter. 
(f)  Access to dedicated land. All dedicated land shall have frontage on a public street and shall have unrestricted public access. 
(Ord. No. 2020-08 , § 4, 2-24-2020)  
Sec. 56-174. - Reservation of additional land.

(Ord. No. 2020-08 , § 4, 2-24-2020)  
Sec. 56-175. - Development of park area. 
(a)  When parklands are dedicated, the subdivider is required to: 
(1)  Properly grade and contour for proper drainage; 
(2)  Provide surface contour suitable for anticipated use of area; 
(3)  Cover areas to be seeded with a minimum of four inches of quality topsoil, seed as specified by the Director of Public Works, fertilized with 16-6-6 at a rate of seven pounds per 1,000 square feet, and mulched. The topsoil furnished for the park site shall consist of the natural loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam humus-bearing soils adapted to the sustenance of plant life, and such topsoil shall be neither excessively acid nor excessively alkaline; and 
(4)  Install or provide for installation of water and sanitary sewer lines to the property line of all dedicated land. 
(b)  The Village Board may require certification of compliance by the Village Engineer. The cost of such report shall be paid by the subdivider. 
(c)  Grading and seeding of parklands is to be completed as soon as ten percent of the planned lots in the Subdivision are sold, as determined by the Village Board. 
(d)  If the subdivider fails to satisfy the requirements of this Section, the Village Board may contract said completion and bill such costs to the subdivider, following a public hearing and written notice to the subdivider of noncompliance. Failure to pay such costs may result in the immediate withholding of all building permits until such costs are paid.

Sec. 56-206. - Variances and exceptions. 
(a)  Where, in the judgment of the Village Board, it would be inappropriate to apply literally the provisions of this Chapter because of the proposed Subdivision being located outside of the corporate limits, or because exceptional or undue hardship would result, the Village Board may waive or modify any requirements to the extent deemed just and proper. Application for any such variance shall be made in writing by the subdivider at the time when the Preliminary Plat is filed for consideration, stating fully all facts relief upon by the petitioner, and shall be supplemented with maps, plans or other additional data that may aid the Plan Commission and Village Board in the analysis of the proposed project.

(2)  The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variation is sought and are not applicable generally to other property; 
(3)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, financial hardship or self-imposed hardship, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out; 
(4)  That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same vicinity. 
(c)  Such relief shall be granted without detriment to the public good, without impairing the intent and purpose of this Chapter or the desirable general development of the Village in accordance with any Village Comprehensive Plan or component thereof, this Chapter, or the Village Zoning Code. A two-thirds majority vote of the entire membership of the Village Board shall be required to grant any modification of this Chapter, and the reasons shall be entered in the minutes of the Village Board.

Sec. 59-23. - Abatement of tree disease and insect nuisances. 
(a)  Insects and pathogens. The Village Board has determined that there are many trees growing on public and private premises within the Village, the loss of which would substantially depreciate the value of public and private property, impair the use and enjoyment of public and private premises and erode the tax base of the Village, and that the health and life of such trees is threatened by fatal insect infestation and diseases. The Village Board hereby declares its intention to control and prevent the spread of pests and specifically declares oak wilt and the insect vectors of this and other such diseases to be public nuisances. The Village Board also authorizes the Natural Resources Committee to investigate new diseases and nuisances as they come into existence and authorizes said Natural Resources Committee to take actions similar to those described herein for such future diseases and nuisances. 
(b)  Treatment. When made aware that any tree, shrub or part thereof growing on private property is a public nuisance, or which endangers life, health, safety or public property or which is infested with parasites, insect pests or disease that may spread or disperse to public trees and shrubs, the Village Forester shall notify the owner or agent (in accordance with Section 59-21(c)) that the nuisance must be sprayed, removed or otherwise abated as directed within a reasonable period of time as directed by the Village Forester. If the owner fails to comply with the terms of the notice, the Village Forester may perform the necessary remediation and charge the cost thereof to the owner. If the owner fails to pay the cost within 30 days thereof, the Village may place the unpaid amount on the tax roll as a special charge pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(c)  Abatement of nuisances with public and private trees; duty of Village Forester. 
(1)  The Village Forester shall order, direct, supervise and control the abatement of public nuisances as defined in Section 59-20 by spraying, removing, burning, quarantining, trenching to sever root grafts or by other means the Village Forester determines to be necessary to prevent as fully as possible the spread of any deleterious or fatal tree disease or insect pest or the vectors known to carry such diseases. The Village Forester shall provide advance notification to adjacent property owners if trees are to be sprayed. 
(2)  Whenever the Village Forester, after inspection or examination shall determine that a public nuisance as herein defined exists on public property in the Village, the Village Forester shall immediately abate or cause the abatement of such nuisance in such manner as to destroy or prevent as fully as possible the spread of any deleterious or fatal tree disease or insect pest or vectors known to carry such disease pathogens. 
(3)  Whenever the Village Forester shall find, on examination, or is otherwise made aware, that any tree or shrub or part thereof growing or located upon private property is a public nuisance as defined in Section 59-20, or which endangers the life, health, safety, or public property, or which is infested with parasites, insect pests or disease that may spread or disperse to public trees and shrubs, the Village Forester shall notify the owner or agent, by personal service or certified mail, that the nuisance must be sprayed, removed, or otherwise abated as directed in the notice within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Village Forester unless the Village Forester shall determine that immediate correction or removal is necessary for public safety. If the owner of such property or agent thereof shall refuse or neglect to comply with the notice, the Village Forester shall cause the nuisance to be abated and shall report the expense thereof to the Village Clerk who shall enter it as a special charge against the property under Wis. Stats. § 66.0627 upon which the tree or shrub is located. 
(d)  Oak wilt prevention. The Village Board has determined that the health of oak trees within the Village limits is threatened by the fatal disease known as oak wilt. The loss of oak trees growing on private and public property substantially depreciates the value of property within the Village and impairs the safety, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is in the public interest for protection of public and private property to control the spread of oak wilt fungus. The spread of oak wilt fungus is believed to be increased by the cutting and pruning of oak trees between April 1 and October 1 of each year. Accordingly, the Village Board hereby declares oak wilt as a public nuisance. 
(e)  Oak wilt management. 
(1)  Whereas the Village Board recognizes that oak wilt is spread more readily from tree to tree during the spring and summer months than during other times of the year, the Village Board hereby declares its intention to help control the spread of this disease by regulating work on these tree species during this sensitive period. 
(2)  No removal, pruning or maintenance of any oak tree shall be conducted annually between the dates of March 1 to November 1 without written permission from the Village Forester. 
a.  The Village Forester may grant an exemption in cases where pruning or removal is necessary to abate an imminent and immediate hazard or in cases of storm-damaged trees. 
b.  The Village Forester may grant an exemption for public utilities; however, such an exemption shall be stipulated within the work permit issued by the Village to the utility as described in Section 59-24. 
In the case of any exemption, all possible precautions shall be exercised in order to limit the infection of these trees, including the application of a sterile wound dressing/paint to pruning wounds created during this time. Such wound dressing should be applied at the time pruning occurs. 
(f)  Stump removal. After the removal of any public tree or shrub, the Village Forester may cause the removal of such public tree or shrub's stump at the Village's expense. If a private tree or shrub is removed for the purpose of abating a public nuisance and at the order of the Village Forester, the Village Forester may also cause the removal of such private tree or shrub's stump if its presence also poses a public nuisance as defined in Section 59-20 and the expense shall be charged to the property pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(Code 1998, § 6-4-5; Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(6-4-5), 10-22-2007)  
Sec. 59-24. - Permit for planting, maintenance and removal of trees and shrubs. 
(a)  Permit required. No person, except upon order of the Village Forester, shall plant, transplant, move, spray, brace, trim, remove, or perform major pruning as determined by the Village Forester on a tree or shrub in the public right-of-way terrace area or cause such act to be done by others without first obtaining a written permit for such work from the Village Forester as herein provided. The applicant shall comply with the planting standards of Section 59-25. The fee for the permit shall be as established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code. 
(b)  Permit exemptions. No permit shall be required to cultivate, fertilize or water trees or shrubs or for work by Village personnel on park properties. No permit is necessary to plant trees inside the property line. 
(c)  Permit requirements and conditions. 
(1)  If the Village Forester determines that the proposed work or planting described in an application for a permit is necessary and in accord with the purposes of this Article, taking into account the safety, health and welfare of the public, location of utilities, public sidewalk, driveways and street lights, general character of the area in which the tree or shrub is located or proposed to be located, type of soil, characteristics and physiological need of the genus, species and variety of tree or shrub, the Village Forester shall issue a permit to the applicant. Trees may be planted in the terrace area, but any damage to streets and sidewalks caused by such trees shall be at the cost of the adjacent property owner. 
(2)  As a condition of granting any permit to remove a public tree or shrub, the Village Forester may require that the permittee replace the one removed; and no permittee under such a conditional permit shall fail, refuse, or neglect to plant trees or shrubs of the type, size, and in the location specified in the permit. 
(3)  As a condition of granting any permit to maintain a public tree or shrub, the Village Forester may require the work to be performed by a certified arborist according to the most current version of the American National Standards Institute's A300 Standards for Pruning and for Cabling and Bracing (see Public Works Department for more information). 
(d)  Permit form; expiration; inspection. Every permit shall be issued by the Village Forester on a standard form and shall include a description of the work to be done and shall specify the genus, species and variety, size, nursery grade and location of trees or shrubs to be planted, if any. Any work under such permit must be performed in strict accordance with the terms thereof and the provisions of this Article. Permits issued under this Section shall expire three months after date of issuance. There will be no charge for this permit. 
(e)  Permits to public utilities. 
(1)  Whenever a permit is issued under this Section to a public utility to remove, trim, prune, cut, disturb, alter or perform surgery on any public tree or shrub, the Village Forester shall limit the work to be done to the actual necessities of the utility and may assign an inspector to supervise the work done under the provisions of the permit. The expense of such inspection or supervision shall be charged to the utility at the usual Village rate. 
(2)  A public utility may secure an annual working agreement with the Village Forester's office that gives the Village Forester the authorization to supervise and direct work associated with trees and shrubs. 
(Code 1998, § 6-4-6; Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(6-4-6), 10-22-2007)  
Sec. 59-25. - Planting of trees and shrubs. 
(a)  Purpose. The Village Board hereby states its determination that the planting, care and protection of the trees within the Village is desirable for the purposes of beauty, shade, comfort, noise abatement and economic betterment, and hereby encourages all persons to assist in a program of tree planting, care and protection. 
(b)  Tree planting program. The Village shall require a diversification of tree species. The Natural Resources Committee shall designate the types of trees to be planted in the planting of public trees. On newly opened streets, the Natural Resources Committee may designate the size, type, or types of trees or shrubs and the manner in which they shall be planted, using the Village of McFarland Landscaping Standards. Developers shall provide a copy of the planting plan to the Village Forester identifying the species to be planted. 
(c)  Planting standards. 
(1)  The size, genus, species, variety and nursery grade of trees and shrubs to be planted in public areas and boulevards and the manner of planting shall be submitted to the Village Forester for approval before commencement of such work. 
(2)  The following provisions shall apply: 
a.  All new street trees must be selected from a list of approved trees compiled by the Natural Resources Committee and described within Section 59-35. New trees must be single stemmed with a minimum trunk diameter of one and one-half inches measured at six inches above ground level. 
b.  The tree shall be planted in accordance with the planting specifications given in Section 59-34. 
c.  The tree shall be kept well watered and mulched in accordance with the young tree maintenance specification given in Section 59-34. 
d.  The good health of all trees planted hereunder shall be guaranteed for two years by the developer, after which time such trees shall become the property of the Village. 
(3)  On newly opened streets, curbs and sidewalks must be installed prior to street tree planting. Distance between the face of the curb and the outer edge of the sidewalk must be at least five feet. Trees must be planted half way between the sidewalk and curb unless underground utilities prevent such planting. No tree shall be planted closer than two feet from the curb. 
(4)  Due to the complexities of determining tree placement, exact planting locations shall be selected and staked by the Village Forester prior to planting. Trees may not be planted closer than: 
a.  Twenty-five feet to a utility or street lighting pole for large and medium growing species and 15 feet for small growing species (see Section 59-35 for species description). 
b.  Fifteen feet to a driveway or alley. 
c.  Six feet to a fire hydrant, water stop box or gas shut-off. If possible, allow more distance than six feet. 
d.  Twenty-five feet to the intersection of two streets from either corner measured on the property line. 
e.  Fifty feet between large and medium growing tree species and 25 feet between small growing tree species (see Section 59-35). 
f.  Trees and shrubs located within 15 feet of overhead utility wires shall be limited to those with a mature height that is at least five feet less than the height of the wires. 
(5)  New street trees shall not be planted over an existing tree stump within two years of removal unless the previous tree's stump has previously been removed to a depth of four feet. 
(6)  The property owner has the responsibility to locate underground utilities before digging. 
(7)  Only Village-approved, small-growing trees (see Section 59-35 for species description) may be planted where there are overhead utility wires. 
(8)  Evergreen trees shall not be planted in a terrace area. 
(9)  It shall be unlawful to plant or maintain shrubbery, ground cover or other plants not considered to be a deciduous leaf tree within terrace areas whose growth is in excess of 1824 inches in height above the top of the nearest curb. 
(d)  Improperly planted trees. Trees, plants or shrubs planted within any terrace or planting easement without the authorization and approval of the Village Forester may be removed. The Village Forester shall notify the abutting owner in writing, listing the improperly planted trees, plants or shrubs, ordering their removal, and establishing a reasonable time within which such removal shall be accomplished. In the event that removal is not to be accomplished within the time specified, the Village may remove such trees, plants or shrubs and charge the costs thereof to the owner pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(e)  Mulching or framing. Any person, adjacent to whose land any shade or ornamental tree or shrub is growing in any street, may, for the purpose of protecting such tree or shrub, cover the soil surface beneath a tree's crown with mulch and/or surround the same with a box or frame suitable for protection, but all such work shall be performed under the supervision and direction of the Village Forester. 
(f)  Approved street trees. A list of tree types that are approved for planting within Village terraces, including tree genus, species and variety, can be found in Section 59-35. 
(g)  Prohibited trees and shrubs. Various types of trees and shrubs are inappropriate for planting within Village terraces due to their poor structure and/or fruiting characteristics (see Section 59-36). The planting of these tree and shrub species within terrace areas is prohibited. 
(h)  Certification. Following the completion of all plantings of trees in accordance with a landscaping plan by a developer, the developer shall request that the building inspector certify that all plantings have been completed in accordance with the approved landscaping plan. In the event that the plantings are not in compliance with the approved landscaping plan, the building inspector shall specify the necessary additional plantings or revisions of the plan that are necessary in order to comply with the approved landscaping plan. Any security required for the landscaping plan shall not be released by the Village until the building inspector has certified compliance with the approved landscaping plan. 
(Code 1998, § 6-4-7; Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(6-4-7), 10-22-2007; Ord. No. 2010-14, §§ 13, 6-28-2010; Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 5-23-2011)  
Sec. 59-26. - Trimming. 
(a)  Trees and shrubs standing in or upon any public right-of-way between the lot line and the curb or ledge of the improved street or upon any private premises adjacent to any public street, right-of-way, park, playground, or place shall be kept trimmed by the owner of the premises upon or in front of which such trees or shrubs are standing so that the lowest branches projecting over the public street or right-of-way provide a clearance of not less than 13½ feet and over all other public places of not less than ten feet. The Village Forester may waive the provisions of this Section for newly planted trees if the Village Forester determines that they do not interfere with public travel, obstruct the light of any street light, or endanger public safety. Further exemptions may be granted for shade trees located in Village Parks. 
(b)  The Village Forester may determine the necessity of such pruning. 
(c)  Clearance from sidewalk to lower branches shall not be less than ten feet. All trees standing upon private property in the Village, the branches of which extend over the line of the street, shall be trimmed so that no branch shall grow or hang over the line of the sidewalk lower than ten feet above the level of the sidewalk. No tree shall be permitted to grow in such a manner as to obstruct the proper diffusion of light from any public street light. 
(d)  Trimming or pruning of more than one-quarter of the crown shall be considered to be major pruning and shall require a permit from the Village Forester. 
(Code 1998, § 6-4-8; Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(6-4-8), 10-22-2007)  
Sec. 59-27. - Trees and shrubbery obstructing view at intersection or view of traffic signs. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, no person shall maintain, plant or permit to remain on any private or public premises situated at the intersection of two or more streets or alleys in the Village any hedge, tree, shrub or other growth that may obstruct the view of the operator of any motor vehicle or pedestrian approaching such intersection. 
(b)  It is unlawful for any person to plant, cause to grow, allow to grow or maintain any trees, bushes, shrubbery or vegetation of any kind that is an obstruction to the clear and complete vision of any traffic sign or driveway approach to a street in the Village. It shall be the duty of every owner of such tree, bush, shrubbery or vegetation to remove such obstruction. 
(c)  In the case of corner lots, no vegetation shall be grown or permitted to grow between the heights of three feet and ten feet above the curb level or its equivalent within the triangular space formed by two intersecting street lines or their projections and the line joining points on such street lines located a minimum of 25 feet from the street intersection in order to provide adequate vehicular vision clearance. 
(d)  Any shrub, tree or other plant that obstructs the view at an intersection or the view of a traffic sign shall be deemed to be dangerous to public travel and the Village Forester may order, by written notice, the owner or occupant of any private place or premises on which there stands a tree or shrub that unreasonably interferes with or encroaches upon the street or sidewalk, to take such steps as are necessary to remove such interference. If such owner or occupant fails, within ten days of receipt of notice, to take such necessary steps, the Village Forester and/or Director of Public Works shall order Village employees to remove the interference. The cost of removing the interference shall be levied and collected as a special charge upon the property pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627 upon which or in front of which such tree or shrub stands. 
(e)  Any person who is an owner, occupant, firm or corporation failing to obey the written notice of the Village Forester as specified in Subsection (d) of this Section shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a forfeiture as established in Section 1-16. 
(Code 1998, § 6-4-9; Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(6-4-9), 10-22-2007)  
Sec. 59-28. - Topping. 
(a)  Injurious pruning. The Village has determined that there are many trees growing on public and private premises within the Village, the improper pruning of which would pose future hazard to the safety of public and the long-term health of the tree. The Village also recognizes that the practice of topping trees, formerly a popular method for reducing tree height, can lead to dangerous regrowth of weakly attached stems and development of crown decay that would pose a potential hazard by weakening the tree. 
(b)  Prohibitions. 
(1)  No person shall utilize topping techniques on a tree located on Village property or in the public right-of-way terrace area or cause such act to be done by others. 
(2)  No person shall utilize topping techniques on a tree on private property or cause such act to be done by others where such a tree would pose a future danger to adjacent Village or private property or the life, health, safety or welfare of persons located thereon. 
(3)  The Village Forester may grant exemptions to these prohibitions for any tree that constitutes a hazard and may also grant possible exemptions, on a case by case basis, for pruning near overhead utilities. 
(Code 1998, § 6-4-10; Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(6-4-10), 10-22-2007)  
Sec. 59-29. - Removal of trees and stumps. 
(a)  Dangerous, obstructive and infected trees. In the normal course of business, it is not the duty of the Village Forester to routinely inspect or be responsible for trees on private property. Any tree or part thereof, whether alive or dead, which the Village Forester shall find to be infected, hazardous or a nuisance so as to endanger the public or other trees, plants or shrubs growing within the Village, or to be injurious to sewers, sidewalks or other public improvements whether growing upon public or private premises, shall be removed, trimmed or treated by the owner of the property upon or adjacent to which such tree or part thereof is located. The Village Forester shall give written notice to said owner to remedy the situation, which shall be served personally or posted upon the affected tree. Such notice shall specify a reasonable period of time within which the action must be taken as determined by the Village Forester on the basis of the seriousness of the condition of the tree or danger to the public. If the owner shall fail to remove, treat or trim said tree within the time limit, the Village Forester shall cause the tree to be removed, treated or trimmed and shall thereupon enter such cost as a special charge against the property pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.0627. 
(b)  Removal standards. In cutting down trees located in public and terrace areas, the tree must be removed with the stump and emergent roots grubbed out, or ground out to a depth of at least nine inches below grade measured in a straight line with the normal grade of sidewalk to top of nine inches below grade measured as a straight line, normal grade of sidewalk to top of curb. All wood and debris must be removed from the street prior to the end of each working day and all holes shall be filled to normal grade level with topsoil. Backfilling should be done by the end of the workday in which the stump is removed. If it is not possible to fill in the hole by the end of the workday, the hole should be staked-off and marked with high visibility paint or flagging to avert accidents. 
(c)  Private removal. No person, firm, organization or corporation shall plant, injure, trim, remove or destroy any tree or shrub located in or upon any public place, until a permit shall have been issued by the Village Forester. Such permit shall be issued only when the removal, trimming or cutting of the tree or shrub is necessary, as determined by the Village Forester, because of a public nuisance and/or location, or its location is such that substantial detriment is done to the property upon which the tree or shrub stands, or property abutting the same. Such permit shall expressly state the premises upon which the tree or shrub stands and the location of the tree thereon. The Village Forester may require submission of professional credentials and evidence of adequate liability insurance coverage. 
(d)  Tree preservation. In the development of commercial property involving previously undeveloped land, the developer will, as part of its development plan identify which trees are to be removed to install the infrastructure for the development. The developer will also provide a plan specifying methods of protecting trees not approved for removal. The developer must ensure that protective structures shall remain in place until on-site construction is complete. The Village Forester, shall review and recommend a tree preservation plan to the Plan Commission. In the development of a new Subdivision involving previously undeveloped land, the developer, as part of the Preliminary Plat, will identify which trees are to be removed to install infrastructure for the development. The developer will also provide a plan specifying methods of protecting trees not approved for removal. The developer must ensure that protective structures shall remain in place until on-site construction is complete. The Natural Resources Committee, after consultation with the Village Forester, shall review and approve a Preliminary Plat tree preservation plan to the Plan Commission.

(a)  Damage to municipal trees. No person shall, without written permits from Village Forester in the case of a terrace-area tree, public tree or shrub, perform or cause to be performed by others any of the following acts: 
(1)  Secure, fasten or run any rope, wire sign, electrical installation or other device or material to, around or through a tree or shrub. 
(2)  Break, injure, mutilate, deface, kill or destroy any tree or shrub or permit any fire to burn where it will injure any tree or shrub. 
(3)  Damage tree roots, through compaction or excavation of the soil, so extensively so as destabilize, make hazardous, damage the health of or necessitate the removal of such a tree. 
(4)  Permit any toxic chemical, gas, smoke, oil or other injurious substance to seep, drain or be emptied upon or about any tree or shrub. 
(5)  Deposit, place or store upon any public place of the Village any stone, brick, dirt, soil, concrete or other materials that may impede the free passage of water, air or nutrients to the roots of any tree on said property, except by written permit by the Village Forester. 
(6)  Remove any guard, stake or other device or material intended for the protection of a public tree or shrub, or close or obstruct any open space about the base of a public tree or shrub designed to permit access of air, water and fertilizer. 
(7)  Attach any sign, poster, notice or other object on any tree, or fasten any guy wire, cable, rope, nails, screws or other device to any tree; except that the Village may tie temporary "no parking" signs to trees when necessary in conjunction with street improvement work, tree maintenance work or parades. 
(8)  Erect, alter, repair or demolish any building or structure without placing suitable guards around all nearby public trees or shrubs that may be injured by such operations. 
(b)  Excavations and operation of heavy equipment near public trees. No person shall excavate any ditches, tunnels or trenches, drive vehicles, or install pavement within a radius of 15 feet of the outer limit of the canopy of any public tree without a permit from the Village Forester. All trees on any parkway or other publicly owned property near any excavation or construction of any building structure or street work shall be sufficiently guarded and protected by those responsible for such work as to prevent any injury to said trees. No person shall excavate any ditches, tunnels or trenches, or install pavement within a radius of 15 feet from any public tree without a permit from the Village Forester. Any publicly owned trees near any excavation site or site of construction of any building, structure, or street work, shall be guarded with a substantial fence not less than four feet high and eight feet square with the protected tree sited in the center of said fence; or at a distance in feet from the tree equal to the diameter of the trunk in inches at breast height, whichever is greater. 
(1)  The Village Forester may grant an exemption to any public utility corporation to augur under a public tree or shrub and excavate within five feet of any public tree or shrub, but such public utility shall be liable for any injury or damage caused to any public tree or shrub, and if any public tree or shrub is permanently damaged due to the acts of a public utility corporation, it shall be removed, including the stump, and shall be replaced by a tree at least ten feet tall, or as otherwise approved by the Village Forester, all at the expense of the utility. 
(2)  The Village Forester may grant an exemption to municipal employees performing their assigned duties and using all due diligence. Utility companies may apply for a written exemption after the fact in the event of responding to an emergency.

Sec. 59-34. - Tree planting and maintenance recommendations. 
(a)  Planting. 
(1)  It is important to plant trees at the correct depth to avoid potential tree health problems. Trees should be planted with the top of their root crown at or slightly above the surrounding soil grade. When planting bare-root trees, the root crown is normally visible as the point where the top-most root emerges from the trunk. However, the root crowns of trees grown in containers or balled in burlap may be buried by nursery soil. To determine where the top of the root crown occurs in these types of nursery stock, you may need to dig into the nursery soil to locate this point (the top-most root can normally be found within the top two inches of the container/root ball). Once the top of the root crown has been located, measure the vertical distance between the top-most root and the bottom of the container, root ball, or lowest root. Dig the hole about ten percent shallower than this depth and at least 1.5 times the diameter of the container, root ball or root system. The root ball should be positioned in the hole so the finished grade of the landscape soil is even with or slightly lower than the point where the top-most root emerges from the trunk. 
(2)  Place the tree in the planting hole so that the trunk is vertical. Before backfilling, be sure to remove all packaging materials from the root ball including containers, burlap, wire baskets, or any other material that would impede the growth of the tree's trunk or roots. 
(3)  Be sure that when finished planting, there is "NO LANDSCAPE SOIL" placed over the top of the root ball. Landscape soil (as well as thick mulch layers more than three inches deep spread over the root ball) can prevent water and air from entering the root ball. 
(b)  Mulching. Weed and turf suppression during establishment is essential. Apply a three-inch thick layer (after settling) of mulch around the tree or shrub to help discourage weeds. This area should be maintained during the establishment period at least two feet in diameter for each inch of tree trunk diameter. Avoid piling mulch directly against the tree's trunk in order to keep the trunk dry and allow rainwater, irrigation, and air to easily enter the root ball. 
(c)  Staking. In many instances, if root balls are heavy enough stakes are not necessary. If it is necessary to stabilize a weak tree, the tree should be staked in such a way as to allow for some trunk movement using a material that does not damage the tree's bark. All staking material should be removed within one year after planting. 
(d)  Fertilization. The application of fertilizer is not recommended during the establishment period (approximately one year after planting for a one-inch caliper tree). Afterward, a slow release (or controlled release) fertilizer can be applied on top of the root ball or mulch. All fertilizer should be applied according to the directions on the product to avoid tree damage. Soluble fertilizers should be avoided on newly installed plants as they can burn roots or kill the tree entirely if too much is applied. 
(e)  Irrigation. Recently transplanted trees and shrubs establish quickest with light, frequent irrigation. If rainfall is inadequate, trees should receive supplemental irrigation to provide a total of at least one-inch of irrigation per week during the establishment period. Irrigation is most effective when performed during the early morning or evening to minimize evaporation from the soil surface. Consequently, irrigating during this time also conserves water. 
(Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(app. A), 10-22-2007)  
Sec. 59-35. - Approved trees in the right-of-way. 
No species of tree or shrub shall be planted in Village rights-of-way that have not been approved for planting by the Village Forester. The Village Forester shall not approve any tree for planting that is listed in Section 59-36. The Village Forester, in exercising reasonable discretion under this section, shall consider the susceptibility of the species to disease, maintenance of healthy diversity to the Village tree population, cost of maintenance of the trees and surrounding rights-of-way and any other factor according to professionally accepted forestry practices that furthers the purpose of this Chapter.

Sec. 62-65. - A1 Agriculture-Transition District. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the A1 Agriculture-Transition District is to preserve, for an unspecified time period in agricultural and related open-space land uses, those lands generally located in proximity to developed areas within the Village where urban expansion in inevitable and broadly in keeping with long time plans for development. It is intended that urban development be deferred in such areas until the appropriate authorities concerned determine that it is economically and financially feasible to provide public services and facilities for uses other than those permitted in the district. It is also intended that the status of all areas in this district be reviewed by the appropriate authorities periodically in order to determine whether, in light of current land development trends, there should be a transfer of all or any part of those areas to some other appropriate use district. Any such review will consider developments in keeping with the Village's Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  Standards applicable to conditional uses in the Agricultural District. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection shall be notified of the approval of any conditional use permit. In passing upon applications for conditional use permits, the Plan Commission shall consider the following relevant factors: 
(1)  The statement of purposes of the zoning district. 
(2)  The potential for conflict with agricultural use. 
(3)  The need of the proposed use for a location in an agricultural area. 
(4)  The availability of alternative locations. 
(5)  Compatibility with existing or permitted use on adjacent lands. 
(6)  The productivity of the lands involved. 
(7)  The location of the proposed use so as to reduce to a minimum the amount of productive agricultural land converted. 
(8)  The need for public services created by the proposed use. 
(9)  The availability of adequate public services and the ability of affected local units of government to provide them without an unreasonable burden. 
(10)  The effect of the proposed use on water or air pollution, soil erosion and rare or irreplaceable natural resources. 
(c)  Reserved. 
(d)  Rezoning. 
(1)  Rezonings of lands from the Agriculture-Transition District shall be based upon consideration of: 
a.  The availability of adequate public facilities to accommodate proposed development. 
b.  The likelihood that the proposed development will not place unreasonable burdens on budgets of the Village, the school system or the county. 
c.  The assurance that the proposed development will not result in water or air pollution, unreasonable soil erosion or unreasonable impact on rare or irreplaceable natural features. 
d.  The suitability of the proposed development. This criterion shall be deemed satisfied if the Village rezones the site to a Planned Development District. 
(2)  Planning principles for Agriculture-Transition District lands upon consideration of rezoning to the Planned Development District. 
a.  Individual sites should be placed within a framework of planning, at least at the general level, for neighborhoods; and 
b.  Where land uses are to be mixed, attention must be given to buffering and transitioning between differing uses. 
(Code 1998, § 13-1-44; Ord. No. 2003-03, § 1(13-1-44), 3-24-2003; Ord. No. 2018-02 , § 4, 1-23-2018)  
Sec. 62-66. - PD-I Planned Development Infill District. 
(a)  Intent. The PD-I District is referred to as an "infill" zoning regulation because it is intended to be used in situations where new development or redevelopment is proposed within an already developed area or neighborhood. Mixed use may be allowed to the extent that no land use conflicts will result. It is a basic public expectation that landowners requesting the use of the PD-I District will develop design, building architecture, landscape design and construction materials. The extent of variation or exception that will be recommended by the Village Plan Commission with final approval by the Village Board in accordance with the standards specified in Subsection (d)(1) of this Section will be dependent on how well the above stated expectations are expressed in the proposed development plan. 
(b)  Application procedures. The procedures and requirements for applying for a PD-I zoning change are the same as those for the basic PD rezoning request. The procedures call for a two-step submittal with approval of a General Implementation Plan (GIP) and the subsequent submittal of a Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP). The application procedure is stated in Section 62-67. 
(c)  PD-I zoning lot. The minimum zoning lot, for purpose of a PD-I submittal, shall include all abutting or adjacent parcels owned or otherwise controlled by the applicant for the PD-I zoning. The zoning lot may include more than one parcel and more than one owner. For purposes of applying the criteria and standards for PD-I zoning, the total area of the zoning lot shall be considered as one parcel regardless of the number of parcel Subdivisions that may exist. 
(d)  Standards and criteria for approval of a PD-I. In addition to the general requirements for approval listed in Section 62-67, the following standards and criteria shall be used by the Village Plan Commission and Village Board when acting on a rezoning application in PD-I: 
(1)  Maximum impervious surface ratio: 
a.  Five-tenths residential. 
b.  Seven-tenths nonresidential and mixed use. 
(2)  Maximum floor area ratio: 0.70. 
(3)  Minimum required usable open space per dwelling unit: 100 SF/DU. 
(e)  Additional standards. 
(1)  Screening and requirements for buffer yards shall be included as part of plan reviews. Such screening shall shield neighboring properties from any adverse external effects of the proposed developments. Screening and buffer yards shall also be used to shield the proposed development from the negative impacts of adjacent uses, such as streets, industrial uses, etc. Special emphasis shall be placed on screening the intrusion of automobile headlights on neighboring properties from parking areas and driveways. 
(2)  Pedestrian circulation should be carefully planned so as to prevent pedestrian use of vehicular ways and parking spaces. In all cases, pedestrian access shall be provided to public walkways. 
(3)  The usable open space required for residential development projects and mixed use residential projects shall be designed for use of each individual dwelling unit or shall be located and designed to be of utility to every dwelling unit proposed. This required usable open space shall be designed to maximum privacy and usability to the residence. 
(4)  Special emphasis shall be placed on trash collection points. Trash containers shall be screened and so designed so as to be conveniently accessible to their users and collectors. 
(5)  Within the PD-I District, mixed land uses may be proposed. However, they must be found to be compatible based on the site and building design proposed. Compatibility will also be judged on the basis of how well the proposed project fits within the context of the neighborhood and abutting properties. The basic intent of this Chapter and Village Comprehensive Plan must be adhered to. 
(6)  Snow removal areas and procedures must be described in the plans. 
(7)  All site lighting shall be controlled so as not to extend a direct light source onto abutting properties. Cutoff type luminaries shall be used and all lighting sheds shall be indicated in the plans. 
(8)  The physical attributes of the site shall be respected with particular concern for preservation of natural features, tree growth and open space. 
(f)  Exceptions to standards. Exceptions to these standards may be recommended by the Village Plan Commission, subject to final approval given by the Village Board.

It is intended that urban development be deferred in such areas until the appropriate authorities determine that it is economically and financially feasible to provide public services and facilities. It is also intended that the status of all areas in this district be reviewed by the appropriate authorities periodically in order to determine whether, in light of current land development trends, there should be a transfer of all or any part of those areas to some other appropriate use district. Any such review will consider local and regional land use plans. Existing homes are grandfathered as are existing house lots. No new house lots can be created without rezoning. 
(b)  CO Conservancy District. The Conservancy District is established to preserve and perpetuate in an open and natural state certain areas such as lakeshores and waterways, wetlands and marshes, floodplains and stream beds, woods, slopes, Indian antiquity areas and other areas of aesthetic or historic value which, because of their unique physical and topographical features, are deemed desirable and functional as natural drainageways and water retention areas, natural habitat for plant and animal life, green belts and other multi-purpose uses beneficial to the community.

Sec. 62-73. - Terminal and Triangle Design Overlay (TTDO) Zoning District. 
(a)  Designation of TTDO boundaries. All properties within the mapped planning area boundaries of the Terminal and Triangle District Neighborhood Plan, as may be from time to time amended, shall be subject to the requirements of this Section. 
(b)  Scope of design review. 
(1)  The provisions of this Section shall supplement the regulations applicable in the base zoning district covering lands also mapped within the TTDO District and those regulations generally applicable within all zoning districts, including, but not limited to, the design review provisions in Section 62-310. 
(2)  The provisions of this Section shall apply to all new construction, any total redevelopment of an existing developed site, and any additions that result in a total expansion of at least 50 percent in building floor area, or 25 percent in outdoor storage area or parking lot area, over that existing as of October 24, 2005. When such an addition is proposed, the entire site and all improvements thereon shall comply with the provisions of this Section, to the extent determined practical by the Plan Commission, given existing site and building conditions. 
(3)  The provisions of this Section shall apply only to development projects requiring site/design review under Section 62-310(c)(1), as well as any project within a Planned Unit Development District. This Section shall not apply to single-family and two-family residences; however, additions and alterations to such a residence may first require a variance if the residence is a nonconforming use or structure under the base zoning district in which the residence is located. 
(c)  Design standards. 
(1)  In the preparation of site and related plans required for design review under Section 62-310, all projects to which this Section is made applicable under Subsection (b) of this Section shall be required to meet the design guidelines within the Terminal and Triangle District Neighborhood Plan, as from time to time amended, unless the Plan Commission waives compliance under the provisions of Subsection (c)(3) of this Section. 
(2)  To the extent that the design guidelines included within the Terminal and Triangle District Neighborhood Plan shall control. This provision does not apply to land use types, which shall be controlled by the permitted and conditional use lists in this Chapter. 
(3)  The Plan Commission may waive or alter any of the design guidelines in the Terminal and Triangle District Neighborhood Plan as they apply to a particular development project, but only if all of the following criteria are met: 
a.  Such a waiver or alteration is approved by at least a three-quarters vote of Commissioners in attendance. 
b.  The waiver or alteration may be attributed to unique characteristics of the project or site rather than general characteristics applicable across various projects or the district. 
c.  Supplemental design elements or improvements are incorporated into the project that compensate for the waiver or alteration of the particular guideline. 
d.  The design guideline is not also an ordinance requirement included in this Chapter, in which case a variance would also be required under Section 62-366. 
(d)  Design review process. The design review process for projects within the TTDO District shall be generally similar to that required for design review throughout the Village, as described in Section 62-310(e). Prior to Plan Commission design review, the Zoning Administrator may require that the petitioner submit a concept plan for review and advice from the Community Development Authority, Village Board, or both, particularly when the project may involve public financial participation. Any such concept plan submittal shall, at a minimum, include conceptual architectural elevations and a conceptual site/landscape plan, drawn to sufficient detail to determine the general character and quality of the project. 
(e)  Appeals. Any action of the Plan Commission in granting or denying approval of site/design review within the Terminal and Triangle Design Overlay Zoning District may be appealed to the Village Board, if a written request for an appeal is filed within ten working days after the date of the Plan Commission action.

Sec. 62-105. - Statement of purpose; conditional uses; definitions. 
(a)  The development and execution of this Article is based upon the division of the Village into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings, and bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform. However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular district, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public need for the particular use of a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district, provided that due consideration is given to location, development and operation of such uses. Such uses are classified as conditional uses. 
(b)  As used in this Subdivision, the term "substantial evidence" means facts and information, other than merely personal preferences or speculation, directly pertaining to the requirements and conditions an applicant must meet to obtain a conditional use permit and that reasonable persons would accept in support of a conclusion. 
(Code 1998, § 13-1-60; Ord. No. 2003-03, § 1(13-1-60), 3-24-2003; Ord. No. 2019-08 , § 1, 5-28-2019)  
Sec. 62-106. - Authority of the plan commission; requirements. 
(a)  The Plan Commission may authorize the Zoning Administrator to issue a conditional use permit for either regular or limited conditional use after review and public hearing, provided that such conditional use and involved structures are found to be in accordance with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and are further found to be not hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment or the value of the neighborhood or the community. In the instance of the granting of a limited conditional use, the Plan Commission in its findings shall further specify the delimiting reasons or factors which resulted in issuing limited rather than regular conditional use. Such Plan Commission resolution, and the resulting conditional use permit, when, for limited conditional use, shall specify the period of time for which effective, if specified, the name of the permittee, the location and legal description of the affected premises. Prior to the granting of a conditional use, the Plan Commission shall make findings based upon the evidence presented that the standards herein prescribed are being complied with. The Plan Commission's findings and decision to approve or deny a conditional use permit must be supported by substantial evidence. 
(b)  Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, sureties, lighting, fencing, planting screens, operation control, hours of operation, improved traffic circulation, deed restrictions, highway access restrictions, increased yards or parking requirements may be required by the Plan Commission upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this Chapter. 
(c)  Compliance with all other provisions of this Chapter, such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking, loading, traffic, highway access and performance standards shall be required of all conditional uses. No conditional use permit shall be issued unless the applicant provides a detailed written description and proof that all of the standards set forth in Sec. 62-111 shall be met, to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission.

Sec. 62-107. - Initiation of conditional use; burden. 
(a)  Any person, firm, corporation or organization having a freehold interest or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest that may become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest, and which is specifically enforceable in the land for which a conditional use is sought may file an application to use such land for one or more of the conditional uses in the zoning district in which such land is located. 
(b)  An applicant for a conditional use permit must demonstrate and prove, by substantial evidence, that the application and all requirements and conditions established by the Village relating to the conditional use are or shall be satisfied.

Sec. 62-109. - Hearing on application. 
All requests for conditional uses shall be to the Plan Commission or the Plan Commission can, on its own motion, apply conditional uses when applications for rezoning come before it. Upon receipt of the complete application and statement referred to in Section 62-108, the Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing on each application for a conditional use at such time and place as shall be established by the Plan Commission. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner and according to such procedures as the Plan Commission shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time. The Plan Commission may inform the applicant and members of the public attending the hearing of the substantial evidence standard and that statements and information will be considered subject to that standard. This may include examples that speculative opinions not based on reliable evidence or knowledge do not meet the evidentiary standard (such as a potential loss in value of a neighboring property based on pure speculation and not an appraisal, market analysis or other reliable information).

Sec. 62-115. - Validity of conditional use permit. 
Where the Plan Commission has approved or conditionally approved an application for a conditional use, such approval shall become null and void within 12 months of the date of the Plan Commission's action unless the use is commenced, construction is underway or the current owner possesses a valid building permit under which construction is commenced within six months of the date of issuance and which shall not be renewed unless construction has commenced and is being diligently prosecuted. Approximately 45 days prior to the automatic revocation of such permit, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the holder by certified mail of such revocation.

Sec. 62-116. - Complaints regarding conditional uses. 
The Plan Commission shall retain continuing jurisdiction over all conditional uses for the purpose of resolving complaints against all previously approved conditional uses. Such authority shall be in addition to the enforcement authority of the Zoning Administrator to order the removal or discontinuance of any unauthorized alterations of an approved conditional use, and the elimination, removal or discontinuance of any violation of a condition imposed prior to or after approval or violation of any other provision of this Code. Upon written complaint by any citizen or official, the Plan Commission shall initially determine whether said complaint indicates a reasonable probability that the subject conditional use is in violation of either one or more of the standards set forth in Section 62-111, a condition of approval or other requirement imposed hereunder. Upon reaching a positive initial determination, a hearing shall be held upon notice as provided in Section 62-110. Any person may appear at such hearing and testify in person or represented by an agent or attorney. The Plan Commission may, in order to bring the subject conditional use into compliance with the standards set forth in Section 62-111 or conditions previously imposed by the Plan Commission, modifying existing conditions upon such use and impose additional reasonable conditions upon the subject conditional use. Additionally, the offending party may be subjected to a forfeiture as set forth in this Chapter and Section 1-16. In the event that no reasonable modification of such conditional use can be made in order to assure that Section 62-111 will be met, the Plan Commission may revoke the subject conditional approval and direct the Zoning Administrator and the Village Attorney to seek elimination of the subject use. Following any such hearing, the decision of the Plan Commission shall be furnished to the current owner of the conditional use in writing stating the reasons therefor. An appeal from a decision of the Plan Commission under this Section may be taken to the Village Board.

Subdivision III. - Nonconforming Buildings, Structures and Uses 
 
Sec. 62-148. - Statement of purpose. 
The purpose of this Subdivision is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses, and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures and uses which adversely affect the maintenance, development, use or taxable value of other property in the district in which they are located shall be permitted to continue or shall be discontinued.

Sec. 62-170. - Off-street parking and loading facilities; statement of purpose. 
The purpose of these regulations on off-street parking is to provide for the regulation of accessory off-street parking and loading facilities and to specify the requirements for off-street parking and loading facilities for different uses. The regulations and requirements that follow are established to promote the safety and general welfare of the community by: 
(a)  Increasing the safety and capacity of public streets by requiring off-street parking or off-street loading facilities to be provided; 
(b)  Minimizing adverse effects of off-street parking and off-street loading facilities on adjacent properties through the requirement of design and maintenance standards; and 
(c)  Lessening congestion and preventing the overtaxing of public streets by regulating the location and capacity of accessory off-street parking or off-street loading facilities.

Sec. 62-171. - General regulation of off-street parking and loading facilities. 
(a)  Scope of off-street parking and loading regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of this Article shall apply as follows: 
(1)  For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established after the effective date of the ordinance from which this Zoning Code is derived, accessory parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the districts in which such building or uses are located. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this Chapter is derived and provided that construction is begun within 90 days of such effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any different amounts required by this Chapter. 
(2)  When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein, parking or loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. 
(3)  Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereinafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. However, if the said building or structure was erected prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this Chapter is derived, additional parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to the parking and loading provisions of this Chapter. 
(b)  Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking or loading facilities in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this Chapter is derived and located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not hereafter be reduced below or, if already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this Chapter. 
(c)  Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of accessory off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided that there is adherence to all regulations herein governing the location, capacity, design and operation of such facilities. 
(d)  Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which is in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this Chapter is derived, which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that off-street parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation and shall comply with the provisions set forth in Section 62-172(h) and Section 62-173(e) hereinafter. However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this Chapter for equivalent new uses or construction. 
(e)  Control of off-street parking facilities. In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. Such possession shall be by deed whereby the owner of the land on which the parking facilities are to be located shall be bound by a covenant filed and recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of Dane County, requiring such owner, heirs or assigns to maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served. 
(f)  Submission of plot plan. Any application for a building permit or for a certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this Article and any additional information as may be required by the Zoning Administrator.

Off-street parking facilities accessory to uses allowed by this Chapter shall be provided in accordance with the regulations set forth below as well as in Section 62-171: 
(a)  Utilization. 
(1)  In the residence districts, required accessory off-street parking facilities provided for uses listed herein shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants or employees and not more than one truck limited to three-quarter ton capacity. 
(2)  In the special districts, required accessory off-street parking facilities provided for uses listed herein shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles or trucks not over 1½ ton capacity of patrons, occupants or employees of such uses. 
(b)  Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this Article results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space. 
(c)  Mixed uses. Where two or more uses are located on the same zoning lot or within the same building, parking spaces equal in number to the sum of the separate requirements for each such use shall be provided. No parking spaces or portion thereof shall serve as a required space for more than one use unless otherwise authorized by the Plan Commission. 
(d)  Collective provision. Accessory off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use and provided that all regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served are adhered to. 
(e)  Access. Adequate access to a public street shall be provided for each parking space. 
(f)  Design standards. Each required off-street parking space shall have a stall width of at least eight feet and a stall length of at least 19 feet. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven feet. Minimum width of aisles providing access to stalls for one-way traffic shall be as follows: Aisles shall not be less than 24 feet wide for 90 degree parking, 18 feet wide for 60 degree parking, 15 feet wide for 45 degree parking (angle shall be measured between centerline of parking space and centerline of aisle), and 12 feet wide for parallel parking. For parallel parking the minimum length of the parking space shall be increased to 23 feet. No parking area of more than two spaces shall be designed as to require any vehicle to back into a public street. Those parking areas for three or more vehicles, if adjoining a residential use, shall be screened from such use by a solid wall, fence, evergreen planting of equivalent visual density, or other effective means, built and maintained at a minimum height of six to eight feet. Large expanses of unchanneled parking areas shall be avoided by interior landscaping and safety islands.

Sec. 62-206. - Telecommunications facilities and antennas. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose and intent of this Section shall be to: 
(1)  Provide uniform regulation of all signal receiving antenna devices; 
(2)  Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to residents and businesses within the corporate boundaries of the Village of McFarland; 
(3)  To protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community, public and private property, community aesthetics and to minimize the impact on the natural environment including hazards to migratory birds; 
(4)  To minimize the visual impacts of towers, antennas and associated buildings through design and siting requirements; 
(5)  Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the number of visible towers needed to serve the community; and 
(6)  Avoid damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Antenna. Any transmitting or receiving device mounted on a tower, building, or structure and used in communications that radiate or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio frequencies, radar signals, wireless telecommunications signals, including but not limited to, directional antennas, such as panels, microwave dishes, and satellite dishes, and omni-directional antennas, such as whip antennas. 
(2)  Available site. Any existing telecommunications facility which has fewer current users than it was designed or intended to accommodate. 
(3)  Co-location. The mounting or installation of an antenna on an existing tower, building or structure for the purpose of transmitting or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes and, if mounted or installed on a tower, does not result in a substantial increase in the size of the tower. 
(4)  Commercial. Relating to or for the purpose of engaging in commerce or business activity. 
(5)  Concealed site. Any site in which a tower and antenna are completely hidden from view, such as a church steeple, a building cupola, or other structure. 
(6)  Equipment building, shelter, or cabinet. A cabinet or building used by telecommunication providers to house equipment at a facility. 
(7)  Guyed tower. A tower that is supported in whole or in part by wires or cables and ground anchors. 
(8)  Height of an antenna or tower. The height of a communication antenna or tower is determined as the distance from ground level to the highest point on the tower, including the antenna and lightning rod. 
(9)  Monopole. A tower consisting of a single pole constructed without guy wires and anchors. 
(10)  Substantial increase in size of the tower. In the context of co-location means: 
a.  The mounting of the proposed antenna on a tower, would increase the existing height of the tower by more than ten percent, or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater, except this limit may be exceeded and not be considered a substantial increase in the size of the tower if the exceedence is necessary to avoid interference with existing antennas; or 
b.  The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve the installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four, or more than one new equipment shelter; or 
c.  The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater, except that the mounting or installation may be exceeded and not be considered a substantial increase in the size of the tower if necessary to shelter the antenna from inclement weather or to connect the antenna to the tower via cable; or 
d.  The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve excavation outside the current tower site, defined as the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site. 
(11)  Telecommunication facility. Any plant or equipment used to carry wireless telecommunications services by radio signal or other electromagnetic waves or optical signals, including towers, antennas, equipment buildings, parking areas, and other accessory development. 
(12)  Telecommunication site. A parcel of land or any building which contains, houses, or supports an antenna, tower, or facility used for telecommunications. 
(13)  Tower. A mast pole, spire, monopole, guyed communication tower, lattice tower, free-standing tower, other structure, or combination thereof, including supporting lines, cables, wires, braces, and masts, designed and primarily used to support antennas above grade. 
(14)  Unused telecommunication facilities. Telecommunication facilities corresponding with a tower which has not carried a telecommunications signal for a period of 90 days. 
(15)  Village-owned site. Any property owned by the Village of McFarland which the Plan Commission has designated as a potential telecommunications site. 
(16)  Wireless telecommunication service provider. Licensed wireless telecommunication services including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized radio (ESMR), paging, and similar services that are marketed to the general public or used within a private system. 
(c)  Existing antennas and towers. All telecommunication facilities approved after March 28, 2011, shall conform to this Section. Telecommunications facilities in existence as of March 28, 2011, which do not conform to or comply with this Section, are subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Telecommunications facilities may continue in use for the purpose now used and as now existing but may not be replaced or materially altered without complying in all respects with this Chapter. 
(2)  If such telecommunications facilities are hereafter damaged or destroyed due to any reason or cause whatsoever, the tower and corresponding telecommunications facilities may be repaired and restored to its former use, location, and physical dimensions upon obtaining a building and zoning permit therefore without otherwise complying with this Section, provided, however, that such repair is fully completed within 12 months of the date of damage. However, if the cost of repairing the tower to its former use, physical dimensions, and location would exceed 50 percent of the cost of a new tower of like kind and quality, then the tower may not be repaired or restored except in full compliance with this Section. 
(3)  An additional equipment building or cabinet may be approved at an existing site if additional antennas can be accommodated on the tower. Such buildings or cabinets will be subject to Site/Design review, and will require the approval of the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission may require design alterations, landscaping improvements, and other improvements as conditions of approval. 
(4)  If an applicant desires to reestablish an unused telecommunication antenna, or establish an antenna not previously permitted on an existing tower with at least one user, Subsection (c)(3) shall apply. 
(d)  Minor alterations. Replacement of previously approved antennas affixed to an existing telecommunications facility or repairs to an existing telecommunications facility not subject to Subsection (c) shall be considered a minor alteration to an existing telecommunications facilities permit. Such a minor alteration may be approved by the Building Inspector. If the Building Inspector does not approve the alteration, or does not approve the alteration within 30 days of filing an application, the applicant may apply to the Plan Commission in accordance with the telecommunications facilities permit standards contained herein. If such replacement is not fully accomplished within one year of the date of damage then the antenna shall be treated as a new antenna. 
(e)  Exempt facilities. The following facilities shall be exempt from this Section. 
(1)  Non-commercial telecommunications facilities designed for reception of television and reception of radio signals which are less than 40 feet in height if free-standing, and less than eight feet in height if roof-mounted.

Sec. 62-310. - Site/design review. 
(a)  Purpose. Site/design review is implemented under municipal authority to promote the public health, safety and welfare and under municipal zoning authority by the Plan Commission.

(3)  Development. Any new construction or exterior improvement to real property for which application for a building permit may be required by this Code. 
(4)  Village planning consultant. Any Village planning consultant appointed by the Village Board.

(3)  When the Zoning Administrator deems the application to be complete, review by the Plan Commission shall be scheduled. 
(4)  The Plan Commission's determination of compliance or noncompliance with this Section shall be issued by the Zoning Administrator, in writing, within ten business days of the determination and sent to the applicant via U.S. Mail. The written determination shall specifically describe all areas of noncompliance and shall identify changes necessary to bring the proposed development into compliance. 
(5)  No building permit shall be issued for any development until the Plan Commission has determined that the development is in compliance with site/design review standards. All construction and improvement subject to site/design review shall conform with approved site/design plans. 
(6)  The determinations of the Plan Commission on site/design plan applications shall be appealable to the Village Board pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 62-113. 
(e)  Site/design standards. In reviewing plans for development the Plan Commission shall determine that the following standards are met: 
(1)  Grading. Grading shall insure a positive drainage consistent with established water runoff patterns in the area. All grading shall allow for the installation and maintenance of appropriate landscape materials. Respect for the natural topography in site development will be recommended as a means of capitalizing on the sloping terrain, and earth berms are required to screen out unpleasant views and accentuate pleasant views. 
(2)  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be required to be installed in accordance with an approved landscaping plan as a component of site and design review. The requirements for landscaping plans are set forth in Appendix B to this Chapter [Code], Village of McFarland Landscaping Standards. All references to the Village Forester shall have the same meaning as referenced in Section 59-20(d). 
(3)  Building relationships. 
a.  The structures shall be related to the site to enhance or maintain current contours. New development shall consider activities on adjacent properties with relation to access from abutting streets, parking areas, service areas, building setbacks, height of structures, and color and materials of adjacent or nearby buildings. 
b.  In the development of the site, the existing quality vegetation should ordinarily be maintained in accordance with Section 59-29. 
(4)  Lighting. The functions of exterior lighting on private property shall be: 
a.  To illuminate building facades, especially those bearing business identification signs. Architectural lighting should be free from glare and of a type to complement the existing development in the district. 
b.  To illuminate pedestrian walks and spaces. Security lighting should provide necessary levels of illumination to insure safety of the property and its residents, while not reflecting direct rays of light into adjacent property. 
c.  To illuminate parking and service areas. Off-street parking area lighting should be so arranged as to conform with applicable provisions of Section 62-172. (The choice of equipment, design, quantity, and placement of on-site lighting shall relate to these functions. Lighting shall be adequate but not excessive. The height and number of lighting standards shall be appropriate to the building and its function and to the neighborhood.) 
(5)  Utility service. It shall be a goal of the Village to eliminate overhead wiring within the Village. To this end, owners of property within the Village, working with the utilities servicing the Village shall, in all new development and major additions, make provision for underground service. This shall be accomplished during building development and construction. Sanitary sewer and water utility services shall comply with Village Standard Specifications. 
(6)  Building design. Buildings shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Materials shall be of a durable, low-maintenance type. The colors shall be harmonious with other buildings in the neighborhood. 
b.  Mechanical elements on the roof or ground shall be screened from the view of adjacent properties and roadways. 
c.  Buildings shall be designed with an architectural flavor that will complement and enrich the character of the Village. 
d.  The overall design of the building shall be of high quality, considering the importance of the particular zoning district. 
e.  With the exception of the M-IC Zoning District, the front, sides, and rear of all commercial and industrial buildings shall be entirely faced with nonmetallic or wood material. In the M-IC District, a minimum of 15 vertical feet of the front of all buildings shall be faced with nonmetallic or wood material extending across the full front of the building, and also extending a distance of not less than 20 feet on each side of the building. The portion of any building facing or backing onto public streets, or abutting a Residential Zoning District, shall be held to the same requirements as that of the front. These requirements may be waived in whole or in part by the Plan Commission. 
f.  An addition shall relate to the existing building in terms of scale, materials and color. 
g.  Structures should be designed to be compatible with the structures that are adjacent to them. 
h.  Unbroken exterior facades exceeding 70 feet in length shall be avoided. 
i.  All building elevations are of importance and should be carefully designed. Building should avoid blank facades. 
(f)  Recommendation of Village Plan Commission. The Village Plan Commission may, during the site/design review process, suggest features of site/design, and construction, building and structural design, that are not a part of site/design standards but that, in the opinion of the Village Plan Commission, would be desirable to make the development a positive asset to the visual appearance of the community and a positive contribution to the growth and stability of the community tax base. Compliance with such recommendations shall not be required of the developer. 
(g)  Validity of site/design approval. Where the Plan Commission has approved or conditionally approved an application for site/design approval, such approval shall become null and void within 12 months of the date of the Plan Commission's action unless construction is commenced or the current owner possesses a valid building permit under which construction is commenced within six months of the date of issuance and which shall not be renewed unless construction has commenced and is diligently pursued. No sooner than 60 days nor less than 45 days prior to the automatic revocation of such site/design approval, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the property owner by certified mail of such revocation. Extensions of up to one year each may be granted by the Plan Commission for just cause, if application is made to the Village at least 30 days before the expiration of said permit. 
(h)  Fees. The fee for review of a site/design review application shall be the fee established by the Village Board from time to time and provided in Appendix A to this Code, to be paid at the time of submission of the application. 
(i)  Penalties. Violations of this Section shall be subject to Section 62-311, except that each day a violation continues shall not be deemed a separate violation until the 30 day notice period expires. Nothing herein shall preclude the Village from maintaining a separate action to prevent or abate or remove violations.

State Law reference Board of appeals, Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7)(e).  
Sec. 62-366. - Variances. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  A request for a variance may be made when an aggrieved party can submit proof that strict adherence to the provisions of this Zoning Code would cause the aggrieved party undue hardship or create conditions causing greater harmful effects than the initial condition. A variance granted to a nonconforming use brings that use into conformance with the district and zoning requirements. 
(2)  Persons requesting a variance shall submit such request to the Board of Zoning Appeals, who shall make a determination on the request following notice and hearing. 
(3)  The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal, in specific cases, such variance from the terms of the Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Zoning Code will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of the Zoning Code shall be observed and substantial justice done. No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district, permit a lower degree of flood protection that the flood protection elevation for the particular area or permit standards lower than those required by state law. 
(b)  Application for variances. The application for a variance shall be filed pursuant to Section 62-363. 
(c)  Public hearing of application. The public hearing for a variance shall be conducted pursuant to Section 62-364. 
(d)  Prohibited variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant use variances in Floodplain or Wetland and Conservancy Districts. In all other districts, no use variance shall be granted unless the applicant has first petitioned for a zoning amendment or a conditional use permit, if applicable, and upon a showing that no lawful and feasible use of the subject property can be made in the absence of such variance. Any use variance granted shall be limited to the specific use described in the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision and shall not permit variances in yard, area or other requirements of the district in which located. 
(e)  Standards for granting variances. 
(1)  Unnecessary hardship. Variances shall be granted only where the applicant demonstrates the existence of an unnecessary hardship. An unnecessary hardship exists where compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing the property would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. When considering any variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine whether the particular restriction in question is unnecessarily burdensome in light of the underlying purpose of that restriction. The purpose of the regulation shall be the primary concern, not the burden upon the property owner. Variances may not be granted where they are contrary to the public interest or where granting the variance would violate the spirit of the regulation. A use variance may not be granted unless it is proved that there can be no reasonable use of the property absent a variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the following factors to determine whether an unnecessary hardship exists to justify issuance of an area variance: 
a.  The purpose of the zoning restriction in question; 
b.  The effect of the restriction on the property; and 
c.  The effect of a variance on the neighborhood and the larger public interest. 
(2)  Hardship may not be self-imposed. Variances may not be granted to remedy self-imposed hardships. 
(3)  Hardships must be unique to the property. Where the same hardship is imposed upon other properties in the zoning district, a variance shall not be granted. 
(Code 1998, § 13-1-264; Ord. No. 2003-03, § 1(13-1-264), 3-24-2003; Ord. No. 2006-08, § 7, 4-24-2006)  
Sec. 62-367. - Review by court of record. 
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the offices of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

Sec. 62-395. - Landmarks Commission powers and duties. 
(a)  Designation. The Landmarks Commission may, subject to Subsection (c) of this Section, recommend that the Village Board designate historic structures, historic sites, and Historic Districts within the Village limits, based on the criteria of Section 62-394. Once so designated, such historic structures, sites and districts shall be subject to all the provisions of this Article. 
(b)  Regulation of construction, reconstruction and exterior alteration. 
(1)  Any person filing an application for a building permit involving the exterior of a designated historic structure, or structure within a Historic District shall also file such application with the Landmarks Commission. 
(2)  No person in charge of a historic structure, historic site or structure within a Historic District shall reconstruct or alter any part of the exterior of such structure or construct any improvement upon such designated historic site or improvement parcel within an Historic District or cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the Landmarks Commission. Unless such certificate has been granted by the Landmarks Commission, the Building Inspector shall not issue a permit for such work. 
(3)  Upon receiving an application, the Landmarks Commission shall determine whether or not: 
a.  The proposed work would destroy, detrimentally change or adversely affect any existing exterior architectural feature of the improvement upon which said work is to be done; and 
b.  The exterior of any proposed new improvement would fail to harmonize with the external appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site; or 
c.  As to any property in a designated Historic District, construction, reconstruction or exterior alteration fails to conform to the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for said district as duly adopted by the Village Board.

(b)  Second exit platforms. Second exit platforms shall not be added to the front or sides of a structure unless not visible from the street. 
(c)  Solar collectors. Passive and active solar collectors will be allowed only if they do not detract from the architectural integrity of the structure and are as unobtrusive as possible. Solar collectors will not be permitted if they hide from street view significant architectural features of the building or neighboring buildings, if their installation requires the loss of significant architectural features, or if they are of such a large scale that they become a major feature of the design. 
(d)  Repairs. Repairs in materials that exactly duplicate the original in composition, texture and appearance are encouraged. Repairs in new materials that duplicate the original in texture and appearance are also permitted. Repairs in materials that do not duplicate the original in appearance will be permitted on an individual basis if the repairs are compatible with the character and materials of the existing building and if repairs that duplicate the original in appearance are prohibitively expensive. 
(e)  Restoration. Projects that will return the appearance are encouraged and will be permitted if such projects are documented by photographs, architectural or archeological research, or other suitable evidence. 
(f)  Aluminum or vinyl siding. 
(1)  Residing with aluminum or vinyl that replaces clapboards or nonoriginal siding on buildings originally sided with clapboards will be permitted only if the new siding imitates the width of the original siding within one inch, and provided that all architectural details (such as window trim, wood cornices, and ornament) either remain uncovered or are duplicated exactly in appearance. 
(2)  Siding that imitates wood graining will not be permitted. 
(3)  If the alteration adds additional layers of siding or insulation on the building, the new siding may be applied over it if the trim is also built up to project from the siding as in the original. 
(g)  Storm windows, screens and storm doors. The repair and retention of original storm windows, screens and storm doors, or their replacement with new units that duplicate the original in materials and appearance, is encouraged. Replacements with nonoriginal materials, such as combination metal components, may also be permitted. If metal components are used, owners are encouraged to use metal components which have been factory-enameled. Painting of raw aluminum storm windows after a year of weathering of the finish is encouraged. Storm doors that imitate a specific style shall be permitted only if the style matches the style of the house. 
(h)  Additions and alterations to street facades. The appearance of all street facades of a structure shall not be altered unless the design is sensitive to the historic character of the building. Specifically, the design shall be compatible with the existing building scale, color, texture and the proportion of solids to voids. Materials and architectural details used in such alterations and additions shall match those on the existing building. 
(i)  Additions and alterations not visible from the street. Additions and alterations not visible from streets contiguous to the lot lines are permitted if their design is compatible with the scale of the existing building and the materials used are compatible with the existing materials in texture, color and architectural details. Alterations shall harmonize with the architectural design of the building, rather than contrast with it. 
(j)  Side alterations. Side additions shall be set back from the front wall of the structure. 
(k)  Roof alteration. 
(1)  Roof alterations, creating increased building volume, additional windows, headroom or area are not permitted unless approved as a variance by the Plan Commission. In addition, the roof shape of the front of the building shall remain the same unless the owner wishes to restore an earlier, documentable appearance. 
(2)  If the existing roofing material is the same as the original, changes in the appearance of roofing materials (excluding color) are prohibited except when the repair of the existing roof is unfeasible and the cost of replacing it in kind is prohibitive. The new roof shall match the original in appearance (excluding color), as closely as is economically feasible. 
(3)  If the existing roofing material is not original to the house, the new roofing materials shall harmonize in color with the house. Thick wood shakes, rolled roofing and hexagonal shingles are prohibited. Restoration to a documentable earlier appearance is encouraged.

Sec. 62-397. - Regulation of demolition. 
(a)  Procedures. No permit to demolish all or part of an historic structure, or improvement in an Historic District, shall be granted by the Building Inspector except as follows: 
(1)  No person in charge of an historic structure or improvement in an Historic District shall be granted a permit to demolish such property under any circumstances without first receiving the written approval of the Landmarks Commission. 
(2)  When a person applies for a permit to demolish such property, such application shall be filed with the Landmarks Commission. Upon such application, the Landmarks Commission may refuse to grant such written approval for up to ten months from the date of such application, during which time the Landmarks Commission and the application shall undertake serious, continuing discussion to try to find a method to save such property. During such period, the applicant and the Landmarks Commission shall cooperate to try to avoid demolition of the property. At the end of the ten months, if no mutually agreeable method of saving the property bearing a reasonable prospect of eventual success is underway, or if no formal application for funds from any governmental unit or nonprofit organization to preserve the property bearing a reasonable prospect of eventual success is underway, or if no formal application for funds from any governmental unit or nonprofit organization to preserve the property is pending, the Building Inspector may issue the permit to demolish the property without the approval of the Landmarks Commission. If a mutually agreeable method for saving the subject property is pending at the end of such ten-month period, the Building Inspector shall delay the issuance of the permit to demolish the subject property for up to two months more. If the plan to save the property is not consummated by the end of the additional two months, the Building Inspector may issue the demolition permit without the approval of the Landmarks Commission. 
(b)  Standard for review of demolition applications. In determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness for any demolition, the Landmarks Commission shall consider all of the following standards: 
(1)  Whether the structure is of such architectural or historic significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the Village and the State; 
(2)  Whether the structure, although not itself a designated historic structure, contributes to the distinctive architectural or historic character of an Historic District as a whole and should be preserved for the benefit of the people of the Village and the State; 
(3)  Whether the demolition of the structure would be contrary to the purpose and intent of this Section and to the objectives of the historic preservation plan for an Historic District as duly adopted by the Village Board; 
(4)  Whether the structure is of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and/or material that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense; 
(5)  Whether retention of the structure would promote the general welfare of the people of the Village and the state by encouraging understanding of American culture and heritage; 
(6)  Whether the structure is in such a deteriorated condition that it is not structurally or economically feasible to preserve or restore it, provided that any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner, which is self-created or which is the result of any failure to maintain the property in good repair cannot qualify as a basis for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness; 
(7)  Whether any new structure proposed to be constructed or change in use proposed to be made is compatible with the buildings and environment of the district in which the subject property is located. 
(Code 1998, § 13-1-284; Ord. No. 2003-03, § 1(13-1-284), 3-24-2003)  
Sec. 62-398. - Appeals of Landmarks Commission actions. 
A decision by the Landmarks Commission to deny a certificate of appropriateness may be appealed to the Village Board. The appeal shall be initiated by filing a petition, specifying the grounds therefor, with the Village Clerk-Treasurer within ten days of the date the decision of the Landmarks Commission is made. After a public hearing, the Village Board may, by vote of a majority of its members, reverse or modify the decision of the Landmarks Commission if, after balancing the interest of the public in preserving the subject property and the interest of the owner in using it for such owner's own purposes, the Village Board finds that, owing to special conditions pertaining to the specific piece of property, demolition will preclude any and all reasonable use of the property and/or will cause serious hardship for the owner, provided that any self-created hardship shall not be a basis for reversal or modification of the Landmarks Commission's decision. 
(Code 1998, § 13-1-285; Ord. No. 2003-03, § 1(13-1-285), 3-24-2003; Ord. No. 2017-13 , § 36, 7-24-2017; Ord. No. 2018-15 , § 2, 11-26-2018)  
Sec. 62-399. - Recognition of historic structures and historic sites. 
After an historic structure or site has been so designated by the Landmarks Commission, the Landmarks Commission shall cause to be placed on such property, at Village expense, a suitable plaque declaring that such property is an historic structure or site. Such plaque shall be placed for ease of pedestrian visibility. The plaque shall contain all information deemed appropriate by the Landmarks Commission. 
(Code 1998, § 13-1-286; Ord. No. 2003-03, § 1(13-1-286), 3-24-2003)  
Sec. 62-400. - Rescission of historic structure of site designation; sale. 
Any owner of record of an historic structure or site who wishes to sell said historic structure but is unable to find a buyer willing to preserve such an historic structure or site, may petition the Landmarks Commission for a rescission of its designation. Such petition shall contain a verified statement that the owner has made reasonable attempts in good faith to find and attract such a buyer and such other information deemed reasonably necessary by the Landmarks Commission. Following the filing of such petition: 
(a)  The owner and the Landmarks Commission shall work together in good faith to locate a buyer for the subject property who is willing to abide by its designation. 
(b)  If, at the end of a period not exceeding 12 months from the date of such petition, no such buyer can be found and if the owner still desires to obtain such a rescission, the Landmarks Commission shall rescind its designation of the subject property. 
(c)  In the event of such rescission, the Landmarks Commission shall notify the Village Clerk-Treasurer, the Building Inspector and the Village Assessor of same, and shall cause the rescission to be recorded at Village expense in the Dane County Register of Deeds. 
(d)  Following any such rescission, the Landmarks Commission may not redesignate the subject property as an historic structure or site for at least two years from the date of rescission. 
(Code 1998, § 13-1-287; Ord. No. 2003-03, § 1(13-1-287), 3-24-2003; Ord. No. 2017-13 , § 37, 7-24-2017)  
Sec. 62-401. - Historic designation procedures. 
(a)  Recommendations; notice; public hearing; independent investigation; designation. The Landmarks Commission may, after notice and public hearing, recommend that the Village Board establish historic structures, sites and historic districts. At least ten days prior to such hearing, the Landmarks Commission shall give written notice to the owners of record, listed in the Village Assessor's records, of the affected property and other property situated within 200 feet of the affected property. The Landmarks Commission shall also give notice of such hearing to the Director of Public Works, Parks and Recreation Committee, Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, Police Department, Building Inspector and Plan Commission. Each may respond to the proposed designation or rescission in writing or by appearance. The Landmarks Commission shall then conduct such public hearing and may hear expert witnesses and may subpoena such witnesses and records as it deems necessary. The Landmarks Commission may conduct an independent investigation into the proposed designation or rescission. Within ten days after the public hearing, the Landmarks Commission may recommend to the Village Board the designation of the property as an historic structure, an historic site, or recommend to the Village Board the designation of the property as an historic structure, an historic site, or recommend its inclusion in an historic district, or may rescind the designation. The Village Board may hold a separate public hearing on the owner's or its own request before designation. After the designation or rescission of designation has occurred, notification shall be sent to the property owner and to the persons who appeared at the public hearing. The Landmarks Commission shall cause the designation or rescission to be recorded, at Village expense, in the Dane County Register of Deeds. 
(b)  Voluntary restrictive covenants. The owner of any historic structure or site may, at any time following such designation, enter into restrictive covenants on the subject property after negotiation with the Landmarks Commission. The Landmarks Commission may assist the owner in preparing such covenants in the interest of preserving the historic property. The owner shall record such covenants in the Dane County Register of Deeds, and shall notify the Village Assessor of such covenants and the conditions thereof. 
(c)  Creation of Historic District. 
(1)  The Landmarks Commission may select geographically defined areas within the Village for designation by the Village Board as Historic Districts and shall prepare a historic preservation and land use plan in ordinance form for each area. An Historic District may be designated for any geographic area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the Village that: 
a.  Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, state or community; 
b.  Is identified with historic persons or with important events in national, state or local history; or 
c.  Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of architectural type specimens inherently valuable for study of a period, style, method, or construction, indigenous materials or craftsmanship; or 
d.  Is representative of the notable works of master builders, designers, or architects who influenced their age. 
(2)  Each historic preservation plan prepared for by the Landmarks Commission shall include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development and a statement of preservation objectives. 
(d)  Criteria for the review of alterations in Historic Districts. 
(1)  Height. All additions shall be no higher than the existing structure. 
(2)  Second exit platforms. Second exit platforms shall not be added to the front or sides of a structure unless not visible from the street. 
(3)  Solar collectors. Passive and active solar collectors will be allowed only if they do not detract from the architectural integrity of the structure and are as unobtrusive as possible. Solar collectors will not be permitted if they hide from street view significant architectural features of the building or neighboring buildings, if their installation requires the loss of significant architectural features, or if they are of such a large scale that they become a major feature of the design. 
(4)  Repairs. Repairs in materials that exactly duplicate the original in composition, texture and appearance are encouraged. Repairs in new materials that duplicate the original in texture and appearance are also permitted. Repairs in materials that do not duplicate the original in appearance will be permitted on an individual basis if the repairs are compatible with the character and materials of the existing building and if repairs that duplicate the original in appearance are prohibitively expensive. 
(5)  Restoration. Projects that will return the appearance of the building to an earlier appearance are encouraged and will be permitted if such projects are documented by photographs, architectural or archeological research, or other suitable evidence. 
(6)  Aluminum or vinyl siding. 
a.  Residing with aluminum or vinyl that replaces clapboards will be permitted, only if the new siding imitates the width of the original siding within one inch, and provided that all architectural details (such as window trim, wood cornices, and ornament) either remain uncovered or are duplicated exactly in appearance. 
b.  Siding that imitates wood graining will not be permitted. 
c.  If the alteration adds additional layers of siding or insulation on the building, the new siding may be applied over it if the trim is also built up to project from the siding as in the original. 
(7)  Storm windows, screens and storm doors. The repair and retention of original storm windows, screens and storm doors, or their replacement with new units that duplicate the original in materials and appearance is encouraged. Replacements with nonoriginal materials, such as combination metal components, may also be permitted. Painting of raw aluminum storm windows after a year of weathering of the finish is encouraged. Storm doors that imitate a specific style shall be permitted only if the style matches the style of the house. 
(8)  Additions and alterations to street facades. The appearance of all street facades of a structure shall not be altered unless the design is sensitive to the historic character of the building. Specifically, the design shall be compatible with the existing building in scale, color, texture and the proportion of solids to voids. Materials and architectural details used in such alterations and additions shall either match those on the existing building or shall be materials and details used for the original construction of other buildings in the historic district of similar materials, age, and architectural style. 
(9)  Additions and alterations not visible from the street. Additions and alterations not visible from streets contiguous to the lot lines are permitted if their design is compatible with the scale of the existing building and, the materials used are compatible with the existing materials in texture, color and architectural details. Alterations shall harmonize with the architectural design of the building, rather than contrast with it. 
(10)  Side additions. Side additions shall be set back from the front wall of the structure. 
(11)  Roof alterations. 
a.  Roof alterations creating increased building volume, additional windows, headroom, or area are not permitted unless approved as a variance by the Plan Commission. In addition, the roof shape of the front of the building shall remain the same unless the owner wishes to restore an earlier, documentable appearance. 
b.  If the existing roofing material is the same as the original, changes in the appearance of roofing materials (excluding color) are prohibited except when the repair of the existing roof is unfeasible and the cost of replacing it in kind is prohibitive. The new roof shall match the original in appearance (excluding color), as closely as is economically feasible. 
c.  If the existing roofing material is not original to the house, the new roofing materials shall harmonize in color with the house. Thick wood shakes, rolled roofing and hexagonal shingles are prohibited. Restoration to a documentable earlier appearance is encouraged. 
(e)  Criteria for the review of new construction in Historic Districts. 
(1)  Primary buildings. 
a.  Height. The maximum height for new buildings in the R-1, R-1A, R-1B, R-2 and R-3 zoning districts shall be 35 feet. Conditional use permits may be granted by the Plan Commission for three story buildings of exceptional design in the R-3 zoning district. The maximum height for new buildings in the C-G zoning district shall be 40 feet, and the C-P, C-H, C-L and C-C zoning districts shall have a 35 foot height limit. Maximum heights for buildings for all commercial districts may be increased upon issuance of a conditional use permit by the Plan Commission. 
b.  Roofs. The following roof shapes are encouraged: hipped, gable, gambrel, shed. Roof shapes will be considered on an individual basis, but must be compatible with the building in the visually related area. 
c.  Materials. Materials for the exterior walls of new buildings shall be the same or similar to the materials prevalent in the district. The following materials will be permitted: brick, narrow gauge horizontal clapboards under four inches in exposed width, stone, stucco, smooth shingles, or any combination of the above. The following materials are prohibited: concrete block, asbestos, wide clapboards over four inches in exposed width, diagonal boards, vertical boards, rough sawn wood, rough split shingles, shakes, and sheet metal. Other materials will be considered on an individual basis. 
d.  Visual size. The gross area of the front facade (all walls facing the street) of a single-family, two unit or commercial building shall be no greater than 125 percent of the gross area of the front facades of buildings in the visually related area. The gross area of the front facade of a multiple-family building should be no more than 125 percent of the average gross area of the front facades of all buildings within the visually related area. If this is not possible, changes in the setback should be designed in the front facade of the building to repeat the rhythm and proportions of buildings verses space between them within the visually related area. 
e.  Solar collectors. Solar collectors will be permitted on new buildings, including the front facades. Solar collectors are prohibited if such devices hide from street view significant architectural features of neighboring buildings, or are of such a large scale that they become a major feature of the design. 
f.  Parking lots. No new surface parking lots will be allowed in the R-1, R-1A or R-2 districts. In the other zoning districts, no new parking lots will be allowed unless accessory to and on the same zoning lot as a multiple unit residential building. 
(2)  Accessory buildings. Accessory buildings shall be compatible with the design of the existing buildings on the zoning lot and as unobtrusive as possible. Exterior wall materials permitted are the same as for construction of new primary buildings, but should be the same as the exterior materials of existing buildings on the same zoning lot wherever possible.

Sec. 62-402. - Historic District review and adoption procedures. 
(a)  The Landmarks Commission shall hold a public hearing when considering the plan for an Historic District. Notice of the time, place, and purpose of such hearing shall be made by First Class Mail to the owners of the places, structures or objects of the determination, and as otherwise provided by law. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the public hearing shall also be sent by the Village Clerk-Treasurer to the owners of record, as listed in the assessment records, who are owners of property situated within the district or within 200 feet of the boundaries of the proposed district at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. Following the public hearing, the Landmarks Commission shall vote to recommend, reject or withhold action on the plan. The recommendation, if any, shall be forwarded to the Village Board. 
(b)  Upon receipt of the recommendations of the Landmarks Commission, the Village Board shall hold a public hearing, notice to be given as noted in Subsection (a) of this Section, and shall, following the public hearing, either designate or reject the Historic District. Designation of the Historic District shall constitute adoption of the plan in Article form prepared for that district directing implementation of said plan.

Discrepancies between boundaries on Official Floodplain Zoning Maps and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsections (1) or (2) of this Section. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Division 8. The Zoning Administrator may rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this Section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to Section 62-577(e) and the criteria in Subsections (1) and (2) of this Section. 
(a)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(b)  Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information provided by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
(c)  Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment pursuant to Section 62-609(6).

iii.  Minimum four-foot contour data in the overbanks shall be used for the development of cross section over bank and floodplain mapping. 
iv.  Maximum distance of 500 feet between cross sections is allowed in developed areas with additional intermediate cross sections required at transitions in channel bottom slope including a survey of the channel of each location. 
v.  The most current version of HEC-RAS shall be used. 
vi.  A survey of bridge and culvert openings in the top of road is required at each structure. 
vii.  Additional cross sections are required at the downstream and upstream limits of the proposed development and any necessary intermediate locations based on the length of the reach if greater than 500 feet. 
viii.  Standard accepting engineering practices shall be used when assigning parameters for the base model such as flow, Manning's N values, expansion and contraction coefficients or effective low limits. The base model shall be calibrated to past flooding data such as high water marks to determine the reasonableness of the model results. If no historical data is available, adequate justification shall be provided for any parameters outside standard accepted engineering practices. 
ix.  The model must extend past the upstream limit of the difference in the existing and proposed flood profiles in order to provide a tie-in to existing studies. The height difference between the proposed flood profile and the existing study profiles shall be no more than 0.00 feet. 
3.  Mapping. A work map of the reach studied shall be provided, showing all cross section locations, floodway/floodplain limits based on best available topographic data, geographic limits of the proposed development and whether the proposed development is located in the floodway. 
i.  If the proposed development is located outside of the floodway, then it is determined to have no impact on the regional flood elevation. 
ii.  If any part of the proposed development is in the floodway, it must be analyzed within the base model to show the difference between existing and proposed conditions. The study shall insure that all coefficients remain the same as in the existing model, unless adequate justification based on standard accepted engineering practices is provided. 
b.  Zone AE Floodplains. 
1.  Hydrology. If the proposed hydrology will change the existing study, the appropriate method to be used shall be based on Wis. Admin. Code § NR 116.07(3). 
2.  Hydraulic Model. The regional flood elevation shall be based on the standards in Wis. Admin. Code § 116.07(4), and the following: 
i.  Duplicate Effective Model. The Effective Model shall be reproduced to insure correct transference of the model data and to allow integration of the revised data to provide a continuous Flood Insurance Study model upstream and downstream of the revised reach. If data from the Effective Model is available, models shall be generated the duplicate the Flood Insurance Study profiles and the elevations shown in the Floodway Data Table in the Flood Insurance Study report to within 0.1 foot. 
ii.  Corrected Effective Model. The Corrected Effective Model shall not include any man-made physical changes occurring after the Effective Model date, but shall import the model into the most current version of HEC-RAS for Department review. 
iii.  Existing (Pre-Project Conditions) Model. The Existing Model shall be required to support conclusions about actual impacts of the project associated with the Revised (Post-Project) Model or to establish more up-to-date models on which to base the Revised (Post-Project) Model. 
iv.  Revised (Post-Project Conditions) Model. The Revised (Post-Project) Model shall incorporate the Existing Model and any proposed changes to the topography caused by the proposed development. This model shall reflect proposed conditions. 
v.  All changes to the Duplicate Effective Model and subsequent models shall be supported by certified topographic information, bridge plans, construction plans and survey notes. 
vi.  Changes to the Hydraulic Models shall be limited to the stream reach for which the revision is being requested. Cross sections upstream and downstream of the revised reach shall be identical to those in the Effective Model and result in water surface elevations and top-widths computed by the revised models matching those in the Effective Model upstream and downstream of the revised reach as required. The Effective Model shall not be truncated. 
3.  Mapping. Maps and associated engineering data shall be submitted to the Department for review which meets the following conditions:

ii.  Certified topographic map of suitable scale, contour interval and a planinemptric map showing the applicable items. If the digital version of the map is available, it may be submitted in order that the Flood Insurance Rate Map may be more easily revised. 
iii.  Annotated Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel showing the revised one percent and 0.2 percent annual chance floodplains and floodway boundaries. 
iv.  If an annotated Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Boundary Floodway Map and digital mapping data (either GIS or CADD) are used, then all supporting documentation or metadata must be included with the data submission along with the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection and State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with FEMA mapping specifications. 
v.  The revised floodplain boundaries shall tie into the effective floodplain boundaries. 
vi.  All cross sections from the effective model shall be labeled in accordance with the effective map and a cross section look up table shall be included to relate to the model input numbering scheme. 
vii.  Both the current and proposed floodways shall be visible on the map. 
viii.  The stream centerline or profile baseline used to measure street distance in the model shall be visible on the map. 
(4)  Expiration. All permits issued under the authority of this Article shall expire one year after issuance. 
(b)  Certificate of compliance.

(a)  The Shoreland-Wetland Zoning District includes all wetlands in the Village, which are five acres or more and are shown on the final Wetland Inventory Map that has been adopted and made a part of this Chapter in Section 62-705 and which are: 
(1)  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages in the Village shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps, which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this Chapter in Section 62-705. 
(2)  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base maps, which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this Chapter in Section 62-705. Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps, County Soil Survey Maps or other existing community floodplain Zoning Maps used to delineate floodplain area, which have been adopted by the Village shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas in the Village. 
(b)  Determinations of navigability and ordinary high-water mark shall initially be made by the Zoning Administrator. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for the final determination of navigability or ordinary high-water mark. 
(c)  When an apparent discrepancy exists between the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary shown on the Official Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps and the actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Zoning Administrator shall contact the appropriate district office of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to determine if the shoreland-wetland district boundary as mapped is in error. If the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources staff concurs with the Zoning Administrator that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a land use or building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors shown on the Official Shoreland-Wetland Zoning Maps, the Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for initiating a shoreland-wetland map amendment within a reasonable period.

Appendix B - VILLAGE OF MCFARLAND LANDSCAPING STANDARDS 
Introduction. The purpose and intent of these requirements are to assemble the minimum landscaping standards into one publication which is easy for individuals involved in the landscaping and design portion of a development project to follow. These requirements establish the minimum standards for landscaping of new/expanding commercial and multi-family structures, and parking areas requiring review under Sec. 62-310(c)(1) of the McFarland Municipal Code. Worksheets needed to submit with landscaping plans are provided at the end of the Appendix. 
1.  Definitions As Used In This Section. For the purpose of these Standards, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
(a)  CALIPER: A measurement of a tree equal to the diameter of its trunk measured six (6) inches above natural grade for trees less than or equal to four (4) inches in diameter at such point; and measured twelve (12) inches above grade for all other trees. 
(b)  DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT OR D.B.H.: The diameter of a tree measured at four and one-half (4½) feet above the existing grade at the base of the tree. 
(c)  LANDSCAPING: The process by which an area is planted in vegetation including grasses, groundcover, shrubs, bushes and trees. 
(d)  NONCONTRIBUTORY PLANTS: Plants that are not assigned points. 
(e)  OPAQUE: When describing a landscape buffer means a dense, solid mass of plantings completely obstructing the view of uses on the other side of the buffer. 
(f)  PLANT HEIGHT: The height of a tree or shrub shall be measured from the root collar to the top of the stem. 
(g)  ROOT COLLAR: That part of a plant where the stem and root system meet. 
(h)  SHRUB: Deciduous or evergreen woody plant with an expected mature height of generally not more than fifteen (15) feet, with single or multiple trunks or multiple leaders. 
(i)  TREE: Any woody plant, normally having one dominant stem or trunk, bearing its foliage or crown well above ground level to heights of fifteen (15) feet or more. 
(j)  WOODLAND: An area or stand of trees not being grown for commercial purposes whose total combined canopy covers an area of one-half (½) acre or more and at least fifty (50) percent of which is composed of canopies of trees having a caliper of at least eight (8) inches, or any grove consisting of eight (8) or more individual trees having a caliper of at least ten (10) inches whose combined canopies cover at least fifty (50) percent of the area encompassed by the grove. 
2.  Submittal Requirements. Projects requiring site/design review under Sec. 62-310(c)(1) of the McFarland Municipal Code shall provide landscaping plans. All plans shall be titled in the form of: "Landscape Plan, [name and location of project]" or shown on the "Site Development Plan" and shall be drawn at a scale not smaller than 1?60' and shall include the following information: 
(a)  The name and address of the project developer, the location and names of abutting streets and rights of way, a graphic and written scale, the date of the plan and any subsequent revision; 
(b)  The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed property lines, buildings, structures, parking lots and driveways, roadways and rights-of-way, easements, stormwater control features, sidewalks, bicycle paths, refuse disposal areas, fences, light fixtures, other surface utility structures, signs and other freestanding structural features, recreational facilities, setbacks and easements. 
(c)  The location, quantity, installation size, mature size, both scientific and common names, and all applicable landscaping points (refer to Secs. 62-70 and 62-72 of the McFarland Municipal Code) of all proposed plant materials. 
(d)  Plant List and Landscape Point Calculations. 
(e)  The designation, location, species and size of all existing trees eight (8) inches and larger in diameter measured four (4) feet above natural grade with any trees to be removed clearly identified. In the event a significant number of trees exist in concentrated areas on the site, with the exception of Heritage Trees (refer to Sec. 59-20(g) of the McFarland Municipal Code), only the boundaries of the tree, grove, forest or woodland area need be shown. (Refer to Sec. 59-29(d) of the McFarland Municipal Code for additional requirements.) 
3.  Landscape Improvement Standards. The following standards shall be used in determining landscaping improvements required to be installed as part of site/design plan approval: 
(a)  The development, redevelopment, expansion, or substantial modification of buildings or site improvements or substantial changes in use shall include at least the minimum amount of landscaping described in this section and in the district regulations. Landscaping materials which meet the minimum installation sizes shown below shall earn landscaping points per plant as indicated in the following table. Non-contributory plants do not earn points. The classifications of individual plant species corresponds to the classification used in the publication entitled A Guide To Selecting Landscape Plants For Wisconsin, E.R. Hasselkus, U.W. Extension Publication: A2865.

4.  General Design Criteria 
(a)  Selection of Plant Species. Plant material shall be selected for its form, texture, color, and concern for its ultimate size and shape. 
(1)  While many trees and shrubs are desirable as street plantings, some species and cultivars are unsuitable because they are prone to wind and weather damage, produce troublesome seeds or fruit, harbor insect pests, are disease susceptible, considered an invasive species via Administrative Code 40 Wisconsin's Invasive Species Identification, Classification and Control Rule September 2009 or revised version thereof, or block sight and clearance requirements. (Refer to Secs. 59-35 and 59-36 for trees and shrubs permitted or not permitted within the public right-of-way of the McFarland Municipal Code.) 
(2)  Shrubs and trees, which are not native to Wisconsin, have an established history of spreading to nearby parks and conservancy areas. These non-native plants tend to become overlay abundant and ultimately eliminate many desirable native species. The control and eradication of these unsuitable plants create a costly management problem. The following lists identify species of landscape plants that are prohibited for use on private property:

[b]  Preservation of Existing Plantings. Upon consultation with the Village Forester (refer to Sec. 59-20(d) of the McFarland Municipal Code), existing trees, plants and other landscape features, which do not excessively interfere with installation of infrastructure, shall be incorporated into the landscaping plan of a site and be protected from damage during development activities. (Refer to Sec. 59-29(d) of the McFarland Municipal Code for additional requirements.) 
[c]  Berming. Earthen berms and existing topography may, wherever practical, be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site, and be varied in height to avoid a monotonous "walled" effect. The maximum slope for any berm constructed on a site shall be three (3) foot run: one (1) foot rise. Berming should not interfere with stormwater control features. 
5.  Selection, Installation, Maintenance and Certification of Plant Materials 
(a)  Plant Quality 
(1)  Planting materials used to comply with this section are to be high quality nursery stock, have been grown in zone four, and are capable of withstanding extremes of individual site microclimates. 
(2)  Trees selected for planting shall be healthy, free of insects, diseases and damage that would threaten the viability of the plant. Parkway trees and parking lot trees, at the time of planting, shall have a minimum branching height of six (6) feet above the ground to allow adequate visual and physical clearance. (Refer to Sec. 7 - Off Street Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements (2).) 
(b)  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed according to the following requirements (Refer to Secs. 59-25, 59-27, 59-30 and 59-34 of the McFarland Municipal Code for additional requirements): 
(1)  All plantings shall be installed in accordance with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction. 
(2)  All unpaved areas within a street right-of-way and all swales forming the drainage system for a parcel shall be sodded or a seeded erosion mat, or rain garden, shall be installed. Upon recommendation of the Village Engineer, the Plan Commission may require additional sodding or seeded erosion mats for a lot to prevent soil erosion and blockage of draining systems. 
(3)  Select and locate landscape materials so as to avoid obstructing visual or physical access to fire hydrants. Canopy and medium trees and shrubs shall not be located closer than six (6) feet to fire hydrants, twenty-five (25) feet to utility, or street lighting poles, and fifteen (15) feet for low trees; fifteen (15) feet to driveways or alleys and twenty-five (25) feet to the intersection of two (2) streets from either corner measured on the property line. 
(4)  Locate trees and shrubs in such a way that they do not obstruct views of vehicle operators and pedestrians at intersections, alleys, driveways, parking lots and sidewalks. 
(5)  Trees and shrubs located within fifteen (15) feet of overhead utility wires are to be limited to those with a mature height that is at least five (5) feet less than the height of the wires. 
(6)  Deciduous trees are encouraged on the south, southwest and east sides of buildings to provide shade from the summer sun, and evergreens are encouraged on the north and northwest sides of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds where practical. 
(c)  Maintenance 
(1)  Responsibility of Owner. Owner(s) of any property subject to an approved landscaping plan are responsible for the continuous maintenance, repair and replacement of all landscaping materials and barriers as specified under their approved landscape plan. All plant materials shall be maintained in a healthy, vigorous growing condition, and a neat and orderly appearance. Plants shall be replaced as deemed by the Village Forester (refer to Sec. 59-20(d) of the McFarland Municipal Code), and shall be kept free of refuse and debris. Initial installation of plantings shall be warranted for a period of two years. (Refer to Secs. 8-61(b)(2), 59-31 and 59-34 of the McFarland Municipal Code.] 
(d)  Certification. Following the installation of all plantings, the developer shall request that the building inspector certify that all plantings have been completed in accordance with the approved landscaping plan. In the event that the plantings are not in compliance with the approved landscaping plan, the building inspector shall specify the necessary additional plantings or revisions of the plan that are necessary in order to comply with the approved landscaping plan. If any security was required for the landscaping plan it shall not be released by the Village until the building inspector has certified compliance with the approved landscaping plan. 
6.  Multi-Family Residential Landscaping Requirements. All multi-family residential sites shall comply with this subsection. The requirements of this subsection are in addition to the minimum landscape points required by the district regulations. 
(a)  All yards shall be seeded or sodded. 
(b)  Street yards on corner lots and all front yards shall contain a minimum of one (1) canopy tree per fifty (50) lineal feet of street frontage. 
(c)  Rear yards and interior side yards shall contain a mix of canopy, evergreen and other trees equivalent to at least one (1) per fifty (50) lineal feet, and including large shrubs along at least thirty (30) percent of the interior side and rear property lines. The trees and shrubs may be clustered. 
7.  Non-Residential Landscaping Requirements. All non-residential sites shall comply with this subsection. The requirements of this subsection are in addition to the minimum landscape points required by the district regulations. 
(a)  Foundation plantings shall be provided on those sides of a building that face a public right-of-way in a planting bed with a minimum width of five (5) feet adjacent to the entire building length. The planting area shall be free of all paving except where sidewalks and driveways leading directly into the building are necessary for access. In no case shall the foundation planting area be reduced to extend across less than fifty (50) percent of the building face due to said sidewalks or driveways. 
(b)  Service yards, loading docks and exterior work areas on lots adjacent to non-industrial uses shall be screened from view from adjacent properties and the public right-of-way. The screening shall consist of any one or any combination of: 
(1)  Solid fencing constructed of commercial-grade wood or plastic composite (refer to Secs. 8-366 to 8-370 of the McFarland Municipal Code]; 
(2)  A masonry wall, of a design approved by the Plan Commission with a height not exceeding eight (8) feet; 
(3)  Plantings, at the time of installation, of not less than six (6) feet in height. 
(c)  Open storage yards if allowed, shall be screened from public streets at a height at least equal to the height of material to be stored or eight (8) feet, whichever is greater. Where stored materials exceed eight (8) feet in height, plantings shall be provided along the outside perimeter of all portions of the fence or wall visible from an adjacent property or public right-of-way. The effective growth of the plantings after three (3) years shall be not less than the height of the materials being screened. The Plan Commission may; however, require more mature plantings at the time of initial installation, due to the nature of the material to be screened. 
8.  Off-Street Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements. All required off-street parking areas designed to accommodate five (5) or more vehicles in any zone, shall be landscaped according to the standards in this subsection. The requirements of this subsection are in addition to the minimum landscape points required by district regulations. 
(a)  Landscaping Objectives. The specific requirements of this subsection are intended to recognize both the functional importance of parking areas and the public benefits associated with well-designed landscaped areas which enhance the visual environment, promote public safety, moderate the microclimate, facilitate stormwater control and other environmental impacts and reduce nuisances, such as noise and glare. The standards are designed to soften the visual and other sensory impacts of parking areas through the use of large canopy trees and well-designed clustered plantings; as opposed to screening the entire perimeter with a hedge or fence. All landscape plans for parking areas shall be designed to promote these objectives. 
(b)  Canopy Tree and Curbed Island and Peninsula Requirements. All off-street vehicular parking areas designed for more than five (5) vehicles shall be provided with canopy trees as provided in this paragraph. 
(1)  Canopy Trees. Canopy trees shall be located in curbed islands or within ten (10) feet of the periphery of the parking area surface. All newly planted canopy trees shall have a minimum caliper of two (2) inches and a height of not less than six (6) feet. Existing mature trees with a caliper of at least two (2) inches meeting the location requirements of this paragraph may be applied toward the canopy tree requirements. 
(2)  Curbed Islands and Peninsulas. Parking spaces shall be separated by a curbed island or peninsulas at the rate of one (1) curbed island or peninsula for each linear row of twelve (12) parking spaces for single row configurations, or for each twenty-four (24) parking spaces in double row configurations. All curbed islands or peninsulas shall have a minimum width of ten (10) feet as measured from the inside of the curb and a minimum length of ten (10) feet. 
(3)  Number. The minimum number of curbed islands or peninsulas shall be as provided in the following table: 
CURBED ISLAND AND PENINSULA STANDARDS
NUMBER OF STALLS	ISLANDS OR PENINSULAS REQUIRED BY ZONING DISTRICT
	R-3, C-G, C-P, C-H, C-L, C-C, M-IC
1 to 11 	none 
12 to 21 	(24 stalls double row configuration) 1 island or peninsula 
22 to 34 	2 islands or peninsulas 
35 to 46 	3 islands or peninsulas 
47 to 58 	4 islands or peninsulas 
59 to 70 	5 islands or peninsulas 
69 to 74 	6 islands or peninsulas 
75 to 94 	7 islands or peninsulas 
95 to 96 	8 islands or peninsulas 
97 to 118 	9 islands or peninsulas 
Over 119 	9 islands or peninsulas plus 1 island for each 12 spaces or fraction thereof 
 
(c)  Parking Area Screening. Where any part of an off-street parking area designed for five (5) or more vehicles is located within twenty-five (25) feet of a residentially zoned parcel, or is located such that a nearby residentially zoned property would be affected by noise or headlight glare, an opaque screening barrier is required on the parcel where the parking area is located. The effective height of the barrier shall be at least five (5) feet above the parking surface. The barrier may consist of wood or masonry fencing, walls, berms, or plant material. Where plant materials are used for screening, they shall be of suitable size and density to accomplish the screening objective within three (3) years from the time of planting. 
(d)  Minimum Dimensions for Planted Areas (other than curbed islands). All landscaped areas with trees shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in all dimensions as measured from the inside of any frame. All landscape areas without trees, but planted with shrubs, shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in all dimensions as measured from inside the frame. 
(e)  Alternative Screening of Industrial Parking Areas. The Plan Commission may approve a landscaping plan, or portion thereof, for a parking area within an industrial or commercially zoned site, which provides for effective screening of the entire parking area from public view and grant a general exemption from the requirements of 8.(b) and 8.(c) of these standards. The exemption shall be granted only where all the following conditions are satisfied: 
(1)  The plan provides for effective screening of the entire parking area from view from all public rights-of-way, public recreation areas and all residentially zoned properties; 
(2)  Where screening is accomplished by the use of plant materials, they are of a suitable size and density to accomplish complete visual screening during the leaf-on season within three (3) years after planting; however, more mature plantings may be required by the Plan Commission; 
(3)  The effective height of the screening is not less than six (6) feet; 
(4)  The plan provides for diversity in the types of plant species or a combination of various plant species and other types of barriers to afford an aesthetically pleasing character to the parking area perimeter; 
(5)  Any portion of the parking area used for visitor parking meets all of the requirements of pars. (b) and (d) and is visually separated from all other parking areas by curbed islands/peninsulas or landscaped planting areas of not less than ten (10) feet wide and ten (10) feet long;
