(e)  Appeal. A Hearing Board's decision rendered may be appealed by the police officer adversely affected by the order or by the department chief if he believes that the department would be adversely affected by the Hearing Board's order.

A law enforcement officer who is directing that a secondary chemical test be conducted has the authority to transport the person arrested to where the secondary chemical testing device is located.

(c)  A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of damages; provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct an in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party's failure to wear a safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of. Upon such a finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trail, by special interrogatory to the jury, determine: 
(1)  That the injured party failed to wear a safety belt; and 
(2)  That the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a failure to mitigate damages. 
The trier of fact may reduce the injured party's recovery for medical damages by an amount not to exceed five percent thereof. In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of five percent of medical damages, the court shall make the calculations and the issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a safety belt shall not be presented to the jury. In all cases, the actual computation of the dollar amount reduction shall be determined by the court.

(2)  For purposes of this section, nondivisible load means any load exceeding applicable length or weight limits which, if separated into smaller loads or vehicles, would: 
a.  Compromise the intended use of the vehicle, to the extent that the separation would make it unable to perform the function for which it was intended; 
b.  Destroy the value of the load or vehicle, to the extent that the separation would make it unusable for its intended purpose; or 
c.  Require more than eight workhours to dismantle using appropriate equipment. Provided, that the applicant for a nondivisible load permit has the burden of proof as to the number of workhours required to dismantle the load. 
(c)  The application for any permit other than a special annual permit shall specifically describe the vehicle or vehicles and load to be operated or moved along or across the highway and the particular highway or crossing of the highway for which the permit to operate is requested, and whether the permit is requested for a single trip or for a continuous operation. 
(d)  The Public Service Commission is authorized to issue or withhold a permit at his discretion; or, if the permit is issued, to limit the number of trips, or to establish seasonal or other time limitations within which the vehicles described may be operated on or across the highways indicated, or otherwise to limit or prescribe conditions of operation of the vehicle or vehicles, when necessary to assure against undue damage to the road foundations, surface, or structures, and may require the undertaking, bond or other security considered necessary to compensate for any injury to any roadway structure and to specify the type, number and the location for escort vehicles for any vehicle. Provided, that in establishing limitations on permits issued under this section, the Public Service Commission shall consult with the Commissioner of Highways, and may not issue, limit or condition a permit in a manner inconsistent with the authority of the Commissioner of Highways.

(6)  Unmetered rate. A flat fee of $49.17, based on 4,500 gallons of water usage per month, will be charged for all unmetered water customers. 
(7)  Service connection charge. [Service connection charge shall be] $500.00. A tap fee of $500.00, or the actual cost of the connection (solely determined by the City), whichever is greater, will be charged to all customers who apply for service outside of a certificate proceeding before the Commission for each new tap to the system. 
(8)  Delayed payment penalty. The above tariff is net. On all current usage billings not paid within 20 days, ten percent will be added to the net current amount unpaid. This delayed payment penalty is not interest and is to be collected only once for each bill where it is appropriate. 
(9)  Water disconnect-reconnect-administrative fees. Whenever water service has been disconnected for non-payment of sewer bills, a disconnection fee of $25.00 shall be charged; or in the event the delinquent sewer bill is collected by the City in the field, an administrative fee of $25.00 shall be charged. A $25.00 reconnection fee will be assessed for each occurrence where water service to sewer customers is restored, after water service has been terminated for non-payment of sewer bills. 
(10)  Returned check charge. If a check received is returned by the bank for any reason, the bank's charge to the City shall be the City's charge to the customer for such returned check and under no circumstances shall the fee collected by the City exceed $25.00. 
(11)  Incremental costs. An amount not to exceed $3.40 per 1,000 gallons is to be used when a bill reflects unusual consumption which can be attributed to eligible leakage on the customer's side of the meter. This rate shall be applied to all such consumption above the customer's historical usage. The Hurricane Water Board shall establish a non-discriminatory policy regarding this provision for leak adjustments. 
(b)  Schedule II. 
(1)  Surcharge formula to be applied in cases where surface drainage is connected to the City's sanitary sewer system. Where the City has discovered that a customer's roof drain, down spouts, storm sewer or other similar facilities conducting surface water have been connected to the City's sewer system, and such customer has failed to take appropriate action, within 30 days of receipt of a demand by the City in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission, to eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer calculated on the basis of the following formula: 
S = A x R x 0.0006233 x C 
S - The surcharge in dollars 
A - The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet 
R - The measured monthly rainfall, in inches 
.0006233 - A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of surface to thousands of gallons of water 
C - The City's approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water usage 
Surcharge formula to be applied where surface drainage has been connected to the City's sewer system. The City shall not impose the surcharge unless and until the customer has been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery, that it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing, or on-site inspection that rain or other surface water is being introduced into the sanitary sewer system at the customer's location, and that the customer has not acted within 30 days from receipt of such notice to divert the water from the sanitary sewer system. 
Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said condition continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the situation shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission of West Virginia. 
(c)  SCHEDULE III 
(1)  Surcharge formula to be applied in the case of users producing unusual waste. The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on the basis of the following formula: 
Ci = VoVi + BoBi + SoSi 
Ci = charge to unusual users per year 
Vo = average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume, in dollars per gallon 
Vi = volume of waste water from unusual users, in gallons per year 
Bo = average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in dollars per year 
Bi = weight of BOD from unusual users, in pounds per year 
So = average unit costs of treatment (including sludge treatment chargeable to total solids, in dollars per pound 
Si = weight of total solids from unusual users, in pounds per year 
When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made. Waste containing material which, in the judgment of the Hurricane Sanitary and Water Pollution Control Board, should not be introduced into the sewer system need not be handled by it. The results of this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed sewer service and the charge thereof, based upon the formula set out above. 
Thereafter, unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and audit of the Hurricane Sanitary Board and Water Pollution Control Board records, new cost figures will be calculated for use in the above formula. The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall be paid by the unusual user. Based on these audited figures, additional billings covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual user, or refund given by the Hurricane Sanitary and Water Pollution Control Board, as the case may be. Such audited figures will then be used for the preliminary billing for the next fiscal year, at the end of which an adjustment will be made as aforesaid. 
(d)  Schedule IV. 
(1)  Applicable inside and outside of the corporate limits of the City of Hurricane. Where the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the Hurricane wastewater collection and/or transmission and/or treatment system by certain industrial plant or plants cannot be accurately determined by the use of the plant's water meter or meters, and said plant cannot install a flow meter to measure such waste, a special formula will be used whereby such plant or plants will pay to the Hurricane Sanitary and Water Pollution Control Board a sewer charge calculated at 50 gallons of water per each employee at the plant each working day. 
(e)  Schedule V. 
(1)  Applicability. Applicable in entire territory served. 
(2)  Availability of service. Available for wastewater and leachate haulers. 
(3)  Rates. Commodity charge - Each hauler shall pay a commodity charge of $40.00 per 1,000 gallons per load. Load will be two times the actual capacity of the truck or other transport method delivering wastewater and leachate. Actual capacity shall be determined or verified by the City. 
(4)  Delayed payment penalty. The above tariff is net. On all current usage billings not paid within 20 days, ten percent will be added to the net current amount unpaid. This delayed payment penalty is not interest and is to be collected only once for each bill where it is appropriate. 
(5)  Returned check charge. If a check received is returned by the bank for any reason, the bank's charge to the City shall be the City's charge to the customer for such returned check and under no circumstances shall the fee collected by the City exceed $25.00. 
(f)  Schedule VI. 
(1)  Applicability. Applicable in entire territory served. 
(2)  Availability of service. Available for landfills. 
(3)  Rates. Commodity charge. Per contract. 
(4)  Delayed payment penalty. The above tariff is net. On all current usage billings not paid within 20 days, ten percent will be added to the net current amount unpaid. This delayed payment penalty is not interest and is to be collected only once for each bill where it is appropriate.

(a)  The purpose of this Article is to establish minimum water pollution control management and sediment and erosion control requirements to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in the Hurricane watershed; to satisfy the requirements set forth by the State of West Virginia; and to prevent the pollution, impairment, and destruction of the natural resources and public trusts in the Hurricane watershed. 
(b)  This Article establishes minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse or negative impacts from land development and erosion associated with water pollution control runoff and the increase in flood events and the subsequent impacts to life, property and stream quality. Proper management of land development, with water pollution control management systems and structures, and pre-development and post-development and construction erosion control "best management practices," can minimize damage to public and private property; reduce the negative or adverse effects of development on land, drinking water sources, control stream channel erosion; reduce the frequency of local flooding and maintain after-development, as nearly as possible, pre-development watercourse and water pollution control runoff characteristics. 
(c)  The Water Pollution Control Management and Erosion Control Article provides minimum content and guidance. All water pollution control management and erosion control sections and design standards within West Virginia are subject to the State of West Virginia NPDES Water Pollution Control Management Program review, approval and/or modification. Individual applications for land development or disturbance, or stream or watercourse disturbance are subject to the City of Hurricane review, approval, modification or rejection. Compliance with this Article is not to be interpreted as approval by other agencies, which may also have jurisdiction over items covered by this Article. 
(d)  The intent of this Article is: 
(1)  To control non-water pollution control discharges to storm drain systems. 
(2)  To reduce pollutants in water pollution control discharges. 
(3)  To control water pollution control runoff by providing design, construction and maintenance criteria for permanent and temporary water pollution control facilities. 
(4)  To maintain and improve the water pollution control collection system in order to protect and improve water quality in the receiving streams and to reduce or eliminate local flooding resulting from water pollution control accumulation. 
(5)  To fully comply with Federal and State statutory and regulatory requirements and schedules regarding water pollution control management and the water quality of the receiving streams.

The Designated Manager, with approval of the Board, may not waive the minimum for water pollution control management of water quality protection as described in subsection (i) of this section. 
(3)  Any requirements beyond those described in subsection (i) of this section may be waived by the Designated Manager, with approval of the Board, if the Designated Manager finds that meeting the minimum on-site water pollution control management requirements is not feasible due to the unique natural or existing physical characteristics of a site or that the property owner would suffer an undue hardship if required to meet the full requirements of this regulation. To be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Designated Manager and the Board that the waiver will not result in any of the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
a.  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
b.  Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
c.  Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or 
d.  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and/or property. 
(4)  Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site water pollution control management is waived, the applicant shall satisfy water pollution control management requirements by accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the Designated Manager. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Alternative means for on-site management of water pollution control discharges that have been established in a water pollution control management plan that has been approved by the Designated Manager. 
b.  The creation of appropriately designed and constructed water pollution control management facility or drainage improvements on other properties, public or private that currently lack water pollution control management facilities. This alternative facility must provide a level of water pollution control control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices and there must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site practice. The Designated Manager shall, to the maximum extent practical, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site practice shall be realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management practice. 
c.  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City of Hurricane or the grant of an easement to the City of Hurricane, to be dedicated to preservation, reforestation, and/or the creation of green space, wetlands, or permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. Any mitigation measure shall provide a level of environmental protection and/or improvement that is, in the sole discretion of the Designated Manager, approximately equal to or greater than that which would have been provided by the waived practice.

c.  An act or omission of a third party other than an employee or agent of the liable party or potentially liable party, or other than by one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship, existing directly or indirectly, with the liable party or potentially liable party if the liable party or potentially liable party establishes by clear and convincing evidence that:

2.  He took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions; or

(d)  Scope of liability. When two or more persons liable for a nuisance pursuant to State or Municipal law, which nuisance presents or imminently threatens to present a single indivisible harm to public health, safety, welfare or the environment for which there is no reasonable and reliable basis for apportioning among those persons the harm to the public health, safety, welfare or to the environment presented or imminently threatened by the nuisance, each such person shall be jointly and severally liable for appropriate abatement of the nuisance, reimbursement to the City of all abatement action cost incurred and to be incurred by the City with respect to such nuisance, and for all damages to which the City may be entitled by law arising out of or related directly or indirectly to the nuisance act(s) or condition(s).

(e)  Civil liability for and recovery of future abatement action costs. In any action by the City to recover abatement action costs from a liable party in which the City has prevailed or substantially prevailed, the court shall enter a declaratory judgment on liability for abatement action costs with respect to the nuisance to be incurred by the City that will be binding on any subsequent action or actions to recover further abatement action costs or damages, unless all abatement actions with respect to the nuisance have been completed and all related abatement actions costs have been presented to the Court or their recovery expressly waived by the City.

(1)  Contribution protection. A person who has resolved its liability to the City in an effective settlement approved by the Council after public notice and an opportunity for public comment or in a judicially approved effective settlement shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement. Such settlement does not discharge any of the other potentially liable persons unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the potential liability of the others by the amount of the settlement. 
(2)  Rights of settling party. A person who has resolved its liability to the City for some or all of an abatement action or for some or all of the abatement action costs with respect to the nuisance in an administrative effective settlement approved by the City Council after public notice and an opportunity for public comment, or in a judicially approved effective settlement may seek contribution from any person who is not party to a settlement referred to in subsection (f)(1) of this Section 1135.05.

Any person required to submit information pursuant to this Article 1135, which information such person believes in good faith to constitute confidential information, may assert a confidentiality claim in accordance with this Section 1135.10. Such claim must be made as soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten days from the date the information was submitted. If a claim of confidentiality is not made within ten days of submission, the City Manager may make the information available to the public without further notice. 
(b)  Submission of information claimed to be confidential. 
(1)  Confidential information - hardcopy submissions. All information that is claimed to be confidential and which is submitted to the City Manager pursuant to the requirements of this Municipal Code in hardcopy form must be submitted on colored paper in order to readily identify such information.

The claimant must clearly underscore or highlight by shading the text of all information in the confidential copy that the claimant asserts to be confidential in a manner that will be clearly visible on photocopies of the confidential copy. 
(2)  Redacted submission of information claimed to be confidential for public disclosure. For each hardcopy submission of information, any portion of which is claimed to be confidential, a complete set of the information must be submitted simultaneously on uncolored paper with the information claimed to be confidential redacted, and with the words "REDACTED COPY" marked clearly on each page, so that a set of information is suitable for public disclosure and provides notice to the public that a claim of confidentiality has been made. 
(3)  Confidential information - electronics submissions. For electronic submissions containing information claimed to be confidential, the claimant must submit a cover document and the written justification as required under Section 1135.10(c), regardless of whether that document is submitted in electronic or hardcopy form. Upon the request of the City Manager, the claimant must submit a redacted form of the information. 
(4)  The claimant may assert that multiple pieces of data, which do not individually qualify as confidential information, could be pieced together to form confidential information if made publicly available. The City Manager shall assess such "mosaic effect" claims on a case-by-case basis, and take such action, if any, as is appropriate to effect the protections intended by this Section 1135.10.

c.  A detailed justification for each segment of information that is claimed confidential. The justification must address the criteria set forth in subsection (e)(1) of this Section 1135.10 and must include the following information: 
1.  If the reason for the claim of confidentiality is that the information would reveal a trade secret, a description of the substantial harmful effects which disclosure of the confidential information would have upon the claimant's competitive position, an explanation of why such harmful effects are substantial, and an explanation of the causal relationship between disclosure and such harmful effects; 
2.  If the confidential information consists of information other than trade secrets, the claimant must provide a description of the information and an explanation as to how it meets the definition of confidential information set forth in subsection 2(e) of this Article 1135; and 
3.  Any other substantiation that is relevant in establishing that the asserted confidential information is confidential. 
(3)  Redacted version. If the cover document contains confidential information, the claimant must provide a redacted version, which will be available for public disclosure. 
(4)  Cover document as basis for review. The cover document justifying the claim of confidentiality will form the basis for the City Manager's review of the confidentiality claim. If the claimant submits additional information to support the confidentiality claim pursuant to subsection (f)(3) of this Section 1135.10, the additional submission will also be considered. 
(d)  Formal submission to City Manager. 
(1)  Confidential copy. The claimant must seal the confidential copy in an envelope displaying the word "CONFIDENTIAL" in bold type or stamp on both sides. This envelope must be enclosed in another envelope for transmittal to the City Manager. The outer envelope must bear no markings indicating the confidential nature of the contents.

(2)  The claimant has satisfactorily shown that it has taken reasonable measures, and intends to continue taking such measures, to prevent disclosure of the information to others; 
(3)  The information claimed to be confidential is not, and has not been, reasonably obtainable without the claimant's consent by other persons (other than by lawful means available to governmental bodies) by use of legitimate means; for example, the information is not contained in materials which are routinely available to the general public, including without limitation material in administrative or judicial proceedings/decisions, press releases, copies of speeches, pamphlets and educational materials; 
(4)  The extent to which the information has been disclosed to others and whether it was disclosed to other persons either by the claimant (except in a manner which protects the confidentiality of the information)or without the consent of the claimant (other than by subpoena or by discovery based on a showing of special need in a judicial proceeding, arbitration, or other proceeding in which the claimant was required to disclose the information to such other persons, as long as the information has not become available to persons not involved in the proceeding), and the precautions taken to prevent further disclosure; 
(5)  If the United States Environmental Protection Agency, any department, agency or instrumentality of the State of West Virginia or of any other state, or any other department, agency or instrumentality of the United States has previously made a confidentiality determination relevant to the pending confidentiality claim, copies of all such confidentiality determinations; and 
(6)  No law, regulation or order by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction specifically requires disclosure of the information or provides that the information is not confidential information. 
(e)  Notice of determination by the City Manager. 
(1)  If, after review of all the information submitted, the City Manager determines that the information is not confidential, the City Manager will notify the claimant by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will state the basis for the determination and that it constitutes the final decision of the City Manager concerning the confidentiality claim. 
(2)  If, after review of all the information submitted, the City Manager determines that the information is confidential, the City Manager will treat such information as confidential in accordance with the provisions set out in subsection (e)(6) of this Section 1135.10. The City Manager will send written notice of the determination to the claimant. This notice will state the basis for the determination and that it constitutes the final decision of the City Manager. The City Manager shall send the notice of its decision to the claimant by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(3)  If a determination has not been made prior to the time that a request for information is received from the public, the City Manager will, after allowing the claimant up to ten days to claim the information as confidential in accordance with this Section 1135.10, proceed expeditiously to make a final determination in accordance with this section. Before making such determination, the City Manager will provide notice to the claimant that a request for the confidential information has been received and provide the claimant a period of five days to submit a written response to that request to the City Manager. 
(4)  All requests to inspect or copy documents submitted under the Article must state with reasonable specificity the documents or type of documents sought to be inspected or copied. Within ten business days of the receipt of a request, the City Manager will:

(f)  Appeal of confidentiality determination. Any person adversely affected by a determination regarding confidential information under this Section 1135.10 may appeal the determination of the City Manager to the City Council. An appeal to the City Council of the final determination of the City Manager must be filed with City Clerk within 15 days after the date upon which the aggrieved person received notice of the final decision of the City Manager. The filing of a timely notice of appeal will stay any determination to disclose confidential information pending a final decision on the City Council on appeal. Upon the timely filing of a notice of appeal the City Manager shall compile a record of all documents and other information considered and all documents and other information submitted City by the claimant with respect to the decision that is the subject of the appeal. The City Manager shall forthwith transmit the compiled record to the City Council. The scope of review on appeal to the City Council is limited to the question of whether the portion of the records, reports, data or other information sought to be deemed confidential, inspected or copied is entitled to be treated as confidential under this Article. The City Manager and the City Council will take all measures to afford evidentiary protection in appeals as necessary to protect the confidentiality of the information at issue, including the use of in-camera proceedings before the City Council and the sealing of records when appropriate. 
(g)  Treatment of confidential and asserted confidential information. 
(1)  Handling of confidential information by authorized personnel : Only those authorized City employees under the supervision and control of the City Manager and attorneys representing the City and authorized by the City Solicitor or City Council, or authorized employees of the Office of the City Clerk whose activities necessitate access to information for which a confidentiality claim has been made may open and handle any envelope or file which is marked "CONFIDENTIAL."

With regard to confidential electronic data, the City Manager will take every reasonable precaution to safeguard the integrity of the data.

Any governmental entity or person receiving information designated confidential will take appropriate measures to safeguard such information and to protect against its improper disclosure. 
(i)  Use of confidential material by the City Manager.

(Ord. of 9-2-2014(4))

(a)  General nuisance abatement response authorities. Whenever the City Council or any court determines that there is an existing or imminently threatened nuisance in the City or within the area surrounding the City and within one mile of the city boundary, or that there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health, safety, to the healthfulness of the environment or to any natural resources held in trust for public arising out of or resulting from, in whole or in part, an existing or imminently threatened nuisance in the City, the City Manager, City Council or the Court shall require the liable parties to undertake, in full compliance with the requirements of this Municipal Code an abatement action that will: 
(1)  Provide timely and effective abatement of the nuisance; 
(2)  Provide timely and appropriate protection of the public health, safety, welfare, and healthfulness of the environment or adequate protection of natural resources held in trust for public from any imminent and substantial endangerment that may be presented by the existing or imminently threatened nuisance; 
(3)  Utilize permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable; and 
(4)  Provided it first meets the requirement of subsection (1), (2) and (3) of this Section 1135.12(a), be "cost-effective," as that term is in defined in the NCP. 
(b)  Additional requirements applicable to abatement action for certain environmental nuisances. Whenever the City Council or any court determines that a nuisance as defined and declared in Section 1135.04(b)(13), (14), or (15) exists or is imminently threatened to be created within the City or within the area surrounding the City and within one mile of the City boundary, the City Council or the court shall require the liable parties, to undertake abatement action consistent with and in full compliance with the requirements of NCP, as those requirements are modified pursuant to the provisions of Section 1135.12(a), (d) and (e). 
(c)  Abatement enforcement procedures. In addition to any other action taken by Federal, State, or other local government, whenever the City Manager determines that there is an existing or threatened nuisance in [the] City or within the area surrounding the City and within one mile of the City boundary, or that there may be an endangerment to the public health, safety, healthfulness of the environment or to the adequate protection of natural resources held in trust for public arising out of, in whole or in part, an existing or threatened nuisance, the City Manager shall proceed in any of the following ways: 
(1)  In accord with the provisions of this Article 1135 of this Municipal Code, file with the City Council and serve on such liable parties as the City Manager deems appropriate a complaint in the form of a proposed nuisance abatement order that would, if it became final and binding, require the named responsible party(ies) to undertake partial or comprehensive abatement actions consistent with the requirements of Section 1135.12(a) and (b), as modified, if at all, by the City Manager pursuant to subsections (c) or (d) of this Section 1135.12, so as to provide adequate protection of public health, safety, healthfulness of the Environment, and natural resources held in trust for the public; or 
(2)  Request that the City Solicitor, pursuant to the authority conveyed by this Article 1135 of this Municipal Code, promptly seek such relief with respect to the existing or threatened nuisance as is authorized by this Municipal Code from a court of competent jurisdiction; or 
(3)  At the discretion of the City Manager and with the advice and consent of the City Solicitor, both file and serve a complaint/proposed nuisance abatement action order and request that the City Solicitor seek the judicial relief authorized by this Article 1135 of this Municipal Code. 
(d)  When abatement action required under this Article 1135 may be more stringent than the response action required by the NCP. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this Section 1135.12, the City Manager may seek, and the City Council or court may order, additional or more stringent requirements for an abatement action required by this Article 1135 than those response actions that would or might apply under the NCP whenever the City Manager or the Court determines that there is or may be an endangerment to the public health, welfare, the environment or natural resources arising out of or resulting from, in whole or in part, an existing or threatened nuisance, and further determines that such additional or more stringent requirements are necessary or appropriate to secure adequate protection against, or appropriate abatement of, such nuisance, or are necessary or appropriate to protect or restore approved land uses consistent with the applicable City land use and development plans. 
(e)  Waiver of strict NCP compliance. On his own initiative or upon appropriately supported application for waiver by a liable or potentially liable party, the City Manager may agree to, or the City Council or court upon either consent of the City Manager or upon a timely and appropriately supported application for waiver by a liable or potentially liable party, may order, less stringent requirements for abatement action than those that would or might apply under the NCP, whenever the City Manager, City Council, or court determines that the requested waiver, if granted as requested or as modified by the City Manager, City Council or court, would result in an abatement action that will provide timely, adequate and reliable protection of the public health, safety, healthfulness of the environment and natural resources held in trust for the public, after considering the following factors: 
(1)  Adequate protection of the public health, welfare, the environment or natural resources in light of the existing or threatened endangerments presented and the public and private resources that are, or are likely to be, available to meaningfully and appropriately respond to such endangerments; 
(2)  Restoration of, to the fullest extent practicable, the free use and enjoyment of land within the City of Hurricane, consistent with its general plan, including but not limited to commercial, industrial and residential use and development;

(5)  Preservation and restoration of the safety and healthfulness of the environment so as to preserve and expand the aesthetic interests and the appropriate development of social, recreational, residential and employment opportunities within the City. 
(f)  Right to appeal denial of waiver application. Any liable or potentially liable party whose application for a waiver of strict NCP compliance pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section 1135.12 has been denied in whole or in any significant part by the City Manager, may seek review by the City Council of the decision of the City Manager by filing with the City Clerk a petition for review within ten days of receipt of the decision of the City Manager for which review is sought. Any such petition must set forth in detail the grounds supporting the challenge of the decision of the City Manager and must be served on the City Manager and the City Solicitor. Following its review of the filed petition for review of the decision of the City Manager, the City Council will, by order, schedule such further briefings, hearings, or other proceedings, if any, with respect to the appeal as the City Council deems necessary and proper to the just resolution of the appeal. The City Council will issue a final written decision on any petition for review filed pursuant to this subsection (e). 
(g)  Exhaustion of municipal remedies required. Any liable party or potentially liable party seeking a waiver of any of the requirements for an abatement action set forth in Section 1135.12(a) or (b) of this Municipal Code, or seeking to have any abatement action imposed or to be imposed pursuant to this Municipal Code by the City Manager, the City Council, or by any court, regardless of by whom the action before any court was commenced, incorporate any standard or requirement less stringent than, or not consistent with, the NCP, must first raise the request of such liable party or potentially liable party for such relief by filing with the City Manager a request for waiver pursuant to Section 1135.12(d) of this Municipal Code, and thereafter exhaust all of the remedies provided by Sections 9(e) and 17 of this Municipal Code with respect to such a request for waiver. Failure of any liable party or potentially liable party under this Municipal Code to exhaust the municipal remedies available pursuant to Sections 1135.12(d) and 17 of this Municipal Code shall bar any request to any court or agency for imposition of any abatement action that does not at a minimum comply with the requirements of Section 1135.12(a) and (b) of this Municipal Code.

The complaint shall state the findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended final order that the City Manager seeks to have the City Council enter as a final order in the matter.

Every temporary nuisance abatement action order granted without notice shall be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance; shall be filed forthwith in the City Clerk's office and entered of record; shall define the injury and state why it may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health, safety, or to the healthfulness of the environment, or presents an imminent hazard to the health or safety of any person or persons within or near the premises upon which such nuisance exists or where the nuisance activity is occurring, and why the order was granted without notice; and shall expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 20 days, as the City Council fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The reasons for the extension shall be entered of record. In case a temporary nuisance abatement action order is granted without notice, the City Manager's motion for a preliminary nuisance abatement action order shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence of all matters except older matters of the same character; and when the motion comes on for hearing the City Manager shall proceed with the application for a preliminary nuisance abatement action order and, if the City Manager does not do so, the City Council shall dissolve the temporary nuisance abatement action order. On two days' notice to the party(ies) alleged to be liable, to the City Manager and to the City Solicitor or on such shorter notice as the City Council may prescribe, the party(ies) alleged to be liable may appear and move for the dissolution or modification of the temporary nuisance abatement action order, and in that event the City Council shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the protection of the public health, safety, welfare and the environment and the ends of justice require. 
(d)  Preliminary nuisance abatement action order. 
(1)  Notice. No preliminary nuisance abatement action order shall be issued without notice to the alleged liable party(ies). 
(2)  Consolidation of hearing with trial on merits. Before or after the commencement of the hearing of the City Manager's application for a preliminary nuisance abatement action order, the City Council may order the hearing of the action on the merits of the City Manager's complaint to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application for a preliminary nuisance abatement action order. Even when this consolidation is not ordered, any evidence received upon an application for a for a preliminary nuisance abatement action order which would be admissible upon the trial on the merits of the City Manager's complaint becomes part of the record on the hearing and need not be repeated upon the hearing.

Sec. 1135.15. - Who may request a public hearing on a nuisance abatement action order, effect of timely request. 
(a)  Request for a hearing on City Manager's complaint. Any person alleged to be liable for a nuisance to whom a complaint/proposed nuisance abatement action order has been issued, and any owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises upon which a nuisance addressed by an nuisance abatement action order exists who is not named as a liable person in the nuisance abatement action order may, within three days from the receipt of service thereof, apply in writing to the City Manager for a public hearing on the matter. To be effective, any request for a public hearing must be received by the Office of the City Manager no later than the close of regular business hours for the City three business days after receipt of service of the nuisance abatement action order upon the requesting party, and must set forth in writing with reasonable particularity all of the following: 
(1)  If the applicant intends to contest liability for the nuisance at the public hearing, and if the applicant intends to contest liability, all facts upon which the applicant will rely at the public to contest liability under the complaint/proposed nuisance abatement action order, or any part thereof; 
(2)  If the proposed nuisance abatement action order imposes joint and several liability upon the applicant that the applicant intends to contest at the public hearing as inappropriate because the harm presented by the nuisance is properly divisible pursuant to the provisions of Section 1135.05(d), all facts upon which the applicant intends to rely to establish that the harm is divisible; and 
(3)  If the applicant intends to assert at the public hearing that an alternative abatement action, removal action or remedial action is more appropriate than action required under the proposed nuisance abatement action order, all facts supporting the adequacy, appropriateness, and costs of any alternative remedial action to be presented at the public hearing. 
(b)  Effect of timely request for hearing on a proposed nuisance abatement action order. Whenever a timely request for a public hearing on a nuisance abatement action order that complies with the requirements of this subsection (a) of Section 1135.15 is received by the City Manager from a person authorized to request such a hearing, the terms of such proposed nuisance abatement action order shall be stayed pending action by Council at or following the public hearing. Unless earlier altered by order of the City Council, such stay will remain in full force and effect unless and until the person who requested the hearing fails to file a timely and compliant answer to the City Manager's complaint as required by Section 1135.17 at which point the proposed nuisance abatement action order will be and become a fully effective, final and binding order. 
(c)  Temporary and preliminary nuisance abatement orders unaffected. The provisions of Section 1135.15(b) do not apply to any temporary or preliminary nuisance abatement order obtained pursuant to Section 1135.14 of this Municipal Code, which temporary or preliminary nuisance abatement order shall not be stayed except upon order of the City Council that by its express terms applies to such temporary or preliminary nuisance abatement order. 
(d)  Effect of failure to timely and properly request a public hearing. If a respondent properly served with a complaint/proposed nuisance abatement action order by the City Manager pursuant to this Article 1135 fails to timely file a request for a public hearing that complies with the requirements of Section 1135.15(a) of this Municipal Code, such proposed nuisance abatement action order will immediately be and become a final, binding and enforceable order, subject only to such modification or revocation, if any, that the City Council sua sponte may order pursuant to Section 1135.16 of this Municipal Code, if and only if the respondent is eligible for the discretionary relief authorized by Section 1135.16 of this Municipal Code.

(1)  Summarily deny the request as untimely; 
(2)  For good cause shown, grant the request, with or without a stay of all or any portion of the provisions of the proposed nuisance abatement action order pending Council's decision at or following the public hearing on the proposed nuisance abatement action order; or 
(3)  For good cause shown, grant the request in part, with or without a stay of all or any portion of the provisions of the proposed nuisance abatement action order, pending Council's decision following the public hearing, limiting the scope of the public hearing to specific issues identified by Council.

(a)  Required answer to complaint of City Manager. Any person who has timely filed a request for hearing that complies with the requirements of Section 1134.15 of this Municipal Code, and who seeks to contest all or any part of the liability asserted in the complaint, or seeks to challenge any findings of fact or conclusions of law, or abatement action sought in the complaint must file a timely answer to the complaint that complies with the requirements of this Section 1135.17. An answer must be in writing, filed with the City Clerk, and served on the City Manager and the Office of the City Solicitor on or before the end of regular business hours on the tenth day following service of the City Manager's complaint/proposed order. Any answer must state both the legal and factual bases in support thereof, and must include at a minimum a summary of the issues, facts, and legal authorities to be raised at the hearing. 
(b)  Required contents of answer. The answer required by Section 1135.17(a) shall set forth in short and plain terms the respondent's defenses to each claim asserted in the complaint of the City Manager, and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the City Manager relies. If the respondent is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment, the respondent shall so state and this has the effect of a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the averments denied. When a respondent intends in good faith to deny only a part or a qualification of an averment, the respondent shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder. Unless the respondent intends in good faith to controvert all the averments of the City Manager's complaint/proposed nuisance abatement action order, the pleader may make denials as specific denials of designated averments or paragraphs, or may generally deny all the averments except such designated averments or paragraphs as the respondent expressly admits; but, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all its averments, the pleader may do so by general denial, subject to the provisions of Section 1135.17(f) of this Municipal Code.

(1)  If the respondent intends to contest liability, all facts upon which the respondent will rely at the public hearing to contest liability; 
(2)  If the complaint of the City Manager seeks to imposes joint and several liability upon the respondent, and the respondent intends to assert at the public hearing that the imposition of joint and several liability is inappropriate because the harm(s) presented by the nuisance is properly divisible pursuant to the provisions of Section 1135.05(d) of this Municipal Code, all facts upon which the respondent intends to rely to establish that the harm is divisible; and 
(3)  If the respondent intends to assert at the public hearing that an alternative abatement action, removal action or remedial action is more appropriate than the abatement action sought in the City Manager's complaint/proposed order, all facts supporting the adequacy, appropriateness, and costs of any alternative remedial action(s) the respondent intends to be present at the public hearing. 
(e)  Hearing before City Council upon timely request. Upon timely receipt of a request for hearing filed in compliance with the requirement of Section 1135.15 and timely filing of an answer compliant with the requirements of this Section 1135.17, the City Council shall issue an order setting the matter down for hearing within 30 days. The City Manager shall give prompt, written notice thereof to all parties having an interest therein; and further, he shall, at the expense of the applicant, publish an appropriate notice of such hearing in two newspapers of general circulation in the City. Hearings shall be recorded by electronic device or by court reporter.

If warranted, the City Council may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees. 
b.  Initiated on instance of the City Council : On its own initiative, the City Council may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subparagraph (2) of this Section 1135.17(f) and directing an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why it has not violated subparagraph (2) of this Section 1135.17(f) with respect thereto.

In determining the amount of any civil penalty to be imposed under this Section 1135.26, the Court shall, at a minimum, impose a penalty amount which eliminates, to the maximum extent allowed by the limits set forth in Section 1135.26(a), all economic benefit which has accrued to and which is accruing, or will accrue to the liable party by reason of the nuisance giving rise to his liability or other non-compliance and which compensates the public for the harm and damage done to the public health, safety, welfare and to the healthfulness of the environment, if any, as a result of the liable party's maintenance of the nuisance or other non-compliance. Impossibility of substantial compliance, or the impossibility of quantifying the harm to the environment, does not bar the assessment of a civil penalty under this Section 1135.26. In addition, in determining the proper civil penalty to be imposed, the court shall consider the liable party's degree of recalcitrance, the absence of good faith cooperation with the City officers and the City Manager, and any other governmental entities responding to the nuisance, the liable party's defiance of or indifference to requirements of the law, and any unusual or extraordinary burdens imposed on the public health or welfare or the public fisc as a result of the creation or maintenance of the nuisance or other non-compliance as factors requiring enhancement of the minimum penalty amount. The court may mitigate the total amount of civil penalty calculated under the first sentence of this subsection (c) to reflect any part of the liable party's maintenance of the nuisance or other non-compliance caused by the existence of extenuating circumstances that were wholly beyond the liable party's control or to recognize bona fide efforts by the liable party to timely comply with the requirements of the law and to extend significant and meaningful cooperation to the City officers, the City Manager or the City Council, and to other governmental enforcing agencies with jurisdiction.

(2)  The variance is necessary for the preservation of a property right of the applicant substantially the same as owners of other property in the same zone or vicinity possess. 
(3)  The variance would not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this Ordinance, or to property in the same zone or vicinity in which the property is located, or otherwise conflict with the objectives of any City plan or policy. 
(4)  The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the hardship. 
(d)  Construction approved prior to ordinance.

Freeboard tends to compensate for unknown factors that may contribute uncertainty to flood heights of any given flood and floodway condition, such as wave action, blockage at stream crossings, and increased runoff from urbanization of the watershed. Freeboard also tends to lower the cost of flood insurance. 
    Highest adjacent grade (HAG) means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface immediately adjacent to the development or structure foundation. This is primarily used during insurance rating in approximated floodplains. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is:

The primary use of the LAG is to determine whether the structure is located within a special flood hazard area by comparing it to the base flood elevation. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished enclosure constructed with flood-resistant materials as defined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 and usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure has proper flood openings and is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this Article.

    Remedy a violation means to bring a structure or other development into compliance with the requirements of this Article, or, if full compliance is not possible, to reduce the adverse impacts of the non-compliance to the greatest extent feasible. 
    Reasonably safe from flooding means that during the base flood, water should not damage structures and any subsurface waters related to the base flood should not damage existing or proposed structures. 
    Special flood hazard area means the land in the floodplain subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in flood insurance studies and on flood insurance rate maps as zones A, AE, AO, A1-30, and A99. This term shall also include areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically listed or otherwise described in this Article. 
    Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    State coordinating office means the West Virginia Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. 
    Stream, as defined in W. Va. Code § 7-1-3U, means any watercourse, whether natural or manmade, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of their size, through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of its volume. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. See "substantial improvement." 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. 
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or the State inventory of historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
For the purpose of this definition, improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
    Top of bank means the lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the first significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is followed by at least 50 feet of relatively flat land. 
    Violation means the failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant with all the requirements of this Article. Any structure or other development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this Article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(2)  A City of Hurricane's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the City of Hurricane shall notify the NFIP Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. 
(3)  The City of Hurricane may identify and regulate new local flood hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "local flood hazard map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies. 
(d)  Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning the location of proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Hurricane. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant/applicant. 
(e)  Elevations prevail. Elevation data certified by a licensed professional surveyor or registered professional engineer shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. 
(1)  The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood damage reduction requirements of this Article if the natural lowest adjacent grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The applicant shall be advised to apply for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or excavation and information concerning the preferred risk policy should be provided. 
(2)  The proposed development shall be considered to be within the special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is below either: 1. The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance study, or 2. The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the City of Hurricane in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall then be required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of this Article. 
(Ord. of 1-3-2012) 
Sec. 1361.04. - Utilization of the special flood hazard area. 
(a)  Floodway. Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the City of Hurricane during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator. 
(1)  Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters, the floodway shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible. 
a.  New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued. 
b.  When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to accomplish the project. 
c.  All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the floodproofing and related provisions contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations. 
d.  In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the City of Hurricane, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the one-percent annual chance special flood hazard area boundary. 
(b)  Floodway fringe. Within any floodway fringe area any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the floodproofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations. 
(c)  AE without floodway. Within any AE without floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one foot at any point. This requirement can be satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined. 
(d)  Approximated floodplain (zone A). 
(1)  Within any approximated floodplain: 
a.  The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
b.  When data from an acceptable source is not available, the Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all proposed development to determine; 1. The amount being invested, and 2. The specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development will be reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator. 
c.  Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the floodproofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations. 
See appendix 4.4 for sample "approximated floodplain (zone A) techniques." 
(e)  Alteration or relocation of a stream. 
(1)  Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail, the City of Hurricane, the Floodplain Administrator, the State Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition, prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State law requires approval. 
See appendix 4.5 for sample "stream alteration process and contact sheet." 
(2)  The developer shall also assure the City of Hurricane in writing that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator. 
(3)  Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights. 
(4)  All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this Article. 
(5)  The developer is required to provide the City of Hurricane a legal agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section 1361.08(c) of this Article. 
(6)  The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, when notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this purpose.

1.  Flood-resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation and that all utilities are located at least two feet above the base flood elevation. 
2.  Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement shall either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
i.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
ii.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
iii.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
c.  In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section 1361.08(c) of this Article. 
(d)  Site plan criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
    The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information: 
(1)  A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and fills. 
(2)  Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information required in this section. 
(3)  Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at intervals of two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor shall certify the site plan. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated floodplain and which are greater than ten lots or two acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator. 
a.  When a flood insurance study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood. 
b.  If a FEMA flood insurance study is not available, the required data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or State and local water resource department. 
c.  If the required data is not available from other sources the applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a flood insurance study. This data shall be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. 
(5)  Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the approximated floodplain area (zone "A") boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed base flood elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases, the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two or five feet, depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor shall certify the site plan. 
(e)  Restrictions to subdivision of land in special flood hazard areas. Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower than one foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.

The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the City of Hurricane. During permit review the City of Hurricane shall consider the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent properties: 
i.  Unacceptable increases in flood heights. 
ii.  Blocking drainage from adjacent property. 
iii.  Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures. 
iv.  Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating erosion problems. 
v.  Other unique site conditions may be considered when determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel. 
2.  Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system. 
3.  Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding). 
4.  Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend laterally 15 feet beyond the building line from all points before the start of sloping required in following subsection. For non-residential structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use. At grade access, with fill extending laterally 15 feet beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of 25 percent of the perimeter of a non-residential structure. 
5.  Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on site. 
6.  Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure. 
7.  Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator. 
8.  Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.

ii.  Fill slopes exposed to floodwaters with expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope protection. 
9.  All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall obtain a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued. 
10.  The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, when notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this purpose. 
(6)  Placement of structures and other development. 
a.  All structures and other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater. 
1.  Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow, and 
2.  So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures or development. 
(7)  Anchoring. 
a.  All structures and other development including stream crossings shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse. 
b.  All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks located at or below the base flood elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation. 
(8)  Flood protection setback. 
a.  A flood protection setback equal to twice the width of the watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance flood protection and benefit aquatic resources. 
b.  Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted from this subsection. 
c.  The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the flood protection setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the flood protection setback area.

(9)  Storage. 
a.  No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored below base flood elevation. 
b.  Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning. 
c.  Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it more difficult to enforce this Article, material that resembles "fill" material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this subsection. 
(10)  Utility and facility requirements. 
a.  All new or replacement water systems whether public or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems. 
b.  All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
c.  All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
d.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(11)  Drainage. 
a.  Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazard. 
b.  Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

ARTICLE 1379. - CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 1379.01. - Legislative intent. 
    The purposes of cluster development are to provide a method of development for land that permits variation in lot sizes without an increase in the density of population or development, that allows subdivisions with varying lot sizes so as to allow home buyers a choice of lot sizes according to their needs, that preserves open space, tree cover, scenic vistas, natural drainageways and outstanding natural topography, that prevents soil erosion by permitting lot sizes according to the nature of the terrain within the development, that provides larger open areas with greater utility for rest and recreation, and that encourages the development of more attractive and economic and less monotonous building forms, by providing freedom of architectural and site design. In order to achieve these purposes, the Municipal Planning Commission shall have the same administrative authority as in Article 1373.

Square footage of the proposed constructed multiplied by 80 percent of (2012) International Code Council's Square Foot Construction Costs (Table 1) as it relates to the specified type of construction (Type IA through VB) and building (Group A-1 through U). This value multiplied by the permit per thousand, which is: 
$0.00 to $1,000.00\$20.00 
Each additional $1,000.00\4.00 
Example: 
2,200 square-foot home (Group R-3, Type VB) 
80 percent of ICC square footage cost is $88.23 
2,200 x $88.23 = $194,106.00 
$20.00 for the first $1.000.00 = $20.00
