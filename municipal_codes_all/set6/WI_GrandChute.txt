file an annual report based on either the calendar year or its fiscal year.
Such annual report shall be filed within 90 days after the close of each
such calendar or fiscal year. The annual report shall summarize the
quarterly reports, shall reconcile and adjust for errors in the quarterly
reports, and shall contain such additional information as the Town
requires. Such annual reports shall be signed by a representative of the
operator or its duly authorized agent, but need not be verified by oath.

prescribed by the Town and shall set forth the name under which the
operator transacts or intends to transact business, the location of its
place of business, and such other information as the Town requires. The
application shall be signed by the owner or the operator if a sole
proprietor and, if not a sole proprietor, by an authorized representative
of such operator. Together with the permit application, each operator
shall pay the Town an initial fee of $20 for each permit. A permit issued
hereunder is nontransferable.
H. Penalty for violations. In addition to the Schedule of Forfeiture
described in Subsection J hereof, any operator in violation of the terms
of this section by failing to obtain a permit shall be subject to a penalty
not to exceed $200 for each violation. Each room or unit separately
rented or offered for rent, and each day of such rental or offer for rental
§ 57-4 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 57-4
1:30
of such unit, shall be a separate violation. In addition, injunctive relief
is hereby authorized to discontinue any violation of this section. Any
operator deemed to have violated any of the provisions of this section
shall be obligated to pay the costs of prosecution, in addition to actual
attorney fees expended in the course of said enforcement. The Town
may revoke or suspend any permit issued hereunder for failure to
comply with the provisions hereof.
I. Liability for room tax on sale or transfer of business. If any operator
sells or transfers all or substantially all of its interest in its hotel, motel
or other lodging accommodation, its successors or assigns shall
withhold sufficient amounts from the purchase price to pay any amount
of room tax liability due through the sale or transfer date until the
operator produces a receipt from the Town Treasurer that its liability
has been paid in full or a certificate stating that no room tax amount is
due. If a successor operator fails to withhold such amount from the
purchase price as required, such successor operator shall become
liable for payment of the room tax amount it is required to withhold.
J. Schedule of forfeiture. In addition to paying the room taxes due
hereunder, any operator that has failed to pay any room tax when due
shall be required to pay a forfeiture in an amount equal to 25% of the
room tax due from the operator to the Town for the previous year and
unpaid or $5,000, whichever is less, for failure to pay the room tax due
hereunder.
K. Confidentiality of information. To the extent permitted under the law,
the information provided to the Town under § 66.0615(2), Wis. Stats.,
shall remain confidential; provided, however, that the Town or any
employee thereof may use such information in the discharge of duties
imposed by law or of the duties of their office or by order of a court.
Persons violating the provisions of this subsection may be required to
forfeit not less than $100 nor more than $500.

§ 57-20. Recapturing of special assessments for completed work.
[Added 5-20-2003; amended 7-15-2003]
B. The Town Board may, without notice or hearing, levy and assess all or
any part of the cost of any work or improvement upon property
benefitted if notice and hearing are specifically waived in writing by the
property owner(s) affected.
A. Purpose. The Town of Grand Chute often imposes on private developers
requirements to install public streets and/or utilities as a condition for
developing property in the Town. It has been determined by the Grand
Chute Town Board that there is a need for procedures enabling the
Town of Grand Chute to make special assessments to benefited
property for installing or constructing public works or improvements,
pertaining to those installed by private developers, such as roads and
utilities, which are then dedicated to the public upon completion. This is
partially justified when such public works and improvements are
designed or engineered to specially benefit other private properties, in
addition to those owned by the developer, when such work is required

§ 57-15 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 57-20
1:36
by the Town and the developer is required to dedicate the
improvements to the Town as public facilities upon completion. The
Town Board finds that it is reasonable, necessary, and justifiable to
make special assessments against properties benefited by such public
works and improvements and to collect such assessments and
distribute all or a portion of the assessments so collected to the
developer initially incurring the cost for such improvements. There is
also a need to make special assessments, in certain circumstances,
after work has started or after improvements have been completed,
under either § 66.0701 or 66.0703, Wis. Stats., whether the work is
undertaken by the Town or by the developer.
B. Exclusions. Nothing herein shall preempt the rights of a developer to
receive cost recovery for sewer main extension contributions to the
extent allowed under Ch. PSC 187, Wis. Adm. Code, involving
connections to property outside of a development within three years
after the date of completion of sewer main installation under § PSC
187.05(3), Wis. Adm. Code.
C. Special assessment under § 66.0701, Wis. Stats. The Town of Grand
Chute is hereby authorized by action of the Town Board to make special
assessments pursuant to § 66.0701, Wis. Stats., for benefited property
for public work or improvements constructed or installed by private
developers which have been or will be dedicated to the Town for public
purposes upon completion. Such assessments will be made in
accordance with the police powers of the Town of Grand Chute.
D. Amount of assessment. The amount of assessment to be determined due
from property benefited shall be in such amounts and assessed on a
reasonable basis in accordance with those standards generally
established as a reasonable basis for assessments as set forth in
§ 66.0703(1)(b), Wis. Stats., which standard is hereby adopted by
reference.
E. Notice and hearing. Prior to the imposition of any assessment pursuant
to this section, all property owners to be assessed shall be given written
notice of the time and place at which a public hearing will be held
before the Town Board. Any property owner so notified of the public
hearing who does not appear shall be deemed to have waived his rights
to be heard; however, objections or comments pertaining to the special
assessment proposed may be submitted by affected property owners to
the Board in advance of the hearing in writing.
F. Form of notice. The notice to be given for purposes of the public hearing
required under this section shall include a description of the work or
improvement and/or the location of the work or improvement, the total
actual or estimated cost of the work or improvement, the total portion
or fraction of the estimated or actual cost of the work or improvement
which will be assessed, a listing of all properties to be assessed for the
specific work or improvement involved, a declaration that the
properties being assessed are benefited in whatever manner
§ 57-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 57-20
1:37
determined by the Town Board, and the amount of dollars to be
assessed in terms of payment for each property against which the
assessments will be imposed. Publication in a newspaper is not
required for assessments under this notice. Such notice of public
hearing shall be mailed by regular mail to the property owner affected
to the address to which real estate tax bills are mailed by the Town for
the properties affected.
G. Levy. Following the public hearing, the Town may levy the special
assessments against the property affected on a reasonable basis. This
levy shall be imposed by action of the Town Board approving the
amount of assessment to be levied to each property. Upon such action,
which shall be deemed the final determination of the Board, this levy
shall be deemed to have been made. Notice of the Board's
determination of the final levy shall be mailed to each property owner
affected by first-class mail to the address to which real estate tax bills
for the property being assessed are mailed by the Town. This
determination shall be made in the form of a final assessment resolution
passed by the Town Board.
H. Appeal. Within 40 days of the date of the final determination of the
governing body of the amount of levy to be imposed, any person against
whose land a special assessment is levied under this section may appeal
in the manner prescribed in § 66.0703(12), Wis. Stats., by filing a
written petition with the Circuit Court and bond for costs within 40 days
of the date of the final determination of the governing body.
I. Disbursement of assessment proceeds. The Town Board, as part of its
final determination to levy assessments for public improvements made
by private developers pursuant to this section, may also determine at
the time of the final determination or thereafter the persons or entities
to whom or to which such collected special assessments shall be
distributed for purposes of equitably reducing the costs incurred for the
construction of the public work or improvement by such person or
entity as thereafter dedicated to the Town upon completion.
J. Special assessments under § 66.0703, Wis. Stats. The Town, in its
discretion, may also make assessments against benefited property in its
discretion under § 66.0703, Wis. Stats., procedures whenever deemed
appropriate for public improvements constructed or installed by the
Town.
K. Time of assessment proceedings. Special assessments and proceedings
under this section may be made either prior to or subsequent to
completion of the public work or improvement for which assessments
hereunder are being imposed. Such assessments and proceedings may
be made either pursuant to § 66.0701, Wis. Stats, and this section or
under § 66.0703, Wis. Stats.
L. Lien. Special assessments imposed by this section shall constitute a lien
against the property from the date of the levy.

examinations of all the electrical wires and appliances installed
within the Town, and when such wires or appliances are found to be
in a dangerous or unsafe condition he shall notify the person

safe condition. Any person failing or refusing to make the
necessary repairs or changes and have such completed within 15

Inspector) after the receipt of such notice shall forfeit and pay into
the Town treasury the prescribed sum for each day which shall
elapse after the expiration of said period, and the Inspector may

said work on property or premises of others, except when
making service connections and installing and testing
transformers, meters and other equipment ordinarily furnished
by and remaining the property of the utility, they shall be
licensed in the same manner provided for in this article.
(b) The operating engineers and their assistants in charge of

The Town Address Coordinator, hereafter referred to as "Coordinator," shall
be the GIS Technician in the Department of Community Development.
§ 224-3. Assigning address numbers.

be assigned a separate number.
(2) Duplex or similar residential structure: each dwelling unit shall be
assigned a separate number.

assigned a separate number. For structures divided into individual
unit spaces available for rent or purchase, each unit with a ground

even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other to avoid a
mid-block change.
C. In unique situations where numbering will not conform, in practicality,
with the specifications of this chapter, the Coordinator shall coordinate
the addressing in a manner that maintains the intent and purpose of
this chapter.
A. The Coordinator shall have the authority to change an address number
of a structure if it is out of sequence, does not run consecutively with
adjacent structures, or otherwise conflicts with the Outagamie County
grid system.
B. The Coordinator shall have the authority to change an address number
of a structure adjoining a public right-of-way where a new road is
constructed or an existing easement is named and the most appropriate
address number is on the newly named road.
C. The Coordinator shall notify, in writing, the resident or property owner
of a structure that must change its address number.
D. After a resident or property owner has changed the address number of
a structure, the Coordinator shall inform the appropriate parties of the
new address number.
A. Each principal building shall display its assigned number along the
street frontage on which the address is assigned.
(1) When a duplex or similar residential structure is located on a
corner lot, each dwelling unit shall display its assigned number

the view of the structure is obstructed by trees, shrubs, fences, or other
structures, the address number shall be displayed on a freestanding
post, mailbox, or other structure on the property as close as possible to
the public right-of-way.
A. Should any resident or property owner violate the provisions of this
chapter, the Coordinator shall notify said resident or property owner in
writing, either by certified mail or hand delivery to a competent adult
currently residing on the property. The notice shall indicate the nature
of the violation and the action necessary to correct it.

person contracted or obligated by other agreement with the
landowner to implement and maintain construction site BMPs, is a
responsible party and shall comply with the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) Requirements. At each site where land disturbing construction
activity is to occur, BMPs shall be used to prevent or reduce all of
the following:
(a) The deposition of soil from being tracked onto streets by
vehicles.
(b) The discharge of sediment from disturbed areas into

footings or BMP installations, are not prohibited by this
chapter.
(3) Location. BMPs shall be located so that treatment occurs before
runoff enters waters of the state and off-site separate storm sewers.
However, projects that require BMP placement in waters of the
state, such as a turbidity barrier, are not prohibited by this chapter.
(4) Implementation. The BMPs used to comply with the requirements
of this chapter shall be implemented as follows:
(a) Erosion and sediment control practices shall be constructed or
installed before land disturbing construction activities begin.
(b) Erosion and sediment control practices shall be maintained
until final stabilization.
(c) Final stabilization activity shall commence when land
disturbing construction activities cease and final grade has
been reached on any portion of the site.
(d) Temporary stabilization activity shall commence when land
disturbing construction activities have temporarily ceased and
will not resume for a period exceeding 14 calendar days.
(e) BMPs that are no longer necessary for erosion and sediment
control shall be removed by the responsible party.
(5) Alternate requirements. The administering authority may establish

of the following:
(a) The plan shall use BMPs to prevent or reduce all of the
following:
[1] The deposition of soil from being tracked onto streets by
vehicles.
[2] The discharge of sediment from disturbed areas into
stormwater inlets.
[3] The discharge of sediment from disturbed areas into
adjacent waters of the state.
[4] The discharge of sediment from drainageways that flow off
the site.
[5] The discharge of sediment by dewatering activities.
[6] The discharge of sediment eroding from soil stockpiles
existing for more than seven days.
[7] The discharge of sediment from erosive flows at outlets
and in downstream channels.
[8] The discharge of on-site chemicals, cement and other
building compounds and materials into waters of the state

1:141
sediment load carried in runoff from initial grading to final
stabilization.
[2] Except as provided in § 275-7B(6), the administering
authority may not require any person to employ more
BMPs than are needed to meet the five-tons-per-acre-peryear
sediment performance standard in order to comply
with the maximum extent practicable. Erosion and
sediment control BMPs may be combined to meet the
sediment performance standard. The administering
authority may give credit toward meeting the sediment
performance standard for limiting the duration and/or
area of land disturbing construction activity or for other
appropriate mechanisms.
[3] Notwithstanding the provisions in § 275-7B(3)(b)[1] and
[2], if BMPs cannot be designed and implemented to meet
the five-tons-per-acre-per-year sediment performance
standard, the plan shall include a written, site-specific
explanation of why the sediment performance standard
cannot be met and how the sediment load will be reduced
to the maximum extent practicable.
(c) The plan shall incorporate all of the following preventative
measures:

§ 310-1. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CLEANUP  An operation where any solid, liquid, vaporous, or gaseous
substance that creates a known, potential or suspected material, safety or
health hazard, public nuisance, or a deleterious effect upon the environment
is removed, contained, incinerated, neutralized, stabilized, cleared up, or
in any manner processed, handled or disposed of with the primary goal of
restoring the site to its pre-incident condition or, secondarily, to make the
site harmless to people and the environment. This language is consistent
with the definition of "cleanup operation" in 29 CFR 1910.120.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE  A response effort by trained employees from
outside the immediate incident area or by other designated responders to
a known, potential or suspected substance release that results, or is likely
to result, in an uncontrolled release of a known, potential or suspected
material, safety, health or environmental hazard. The intent of defining
"emergency response" in this chapter is to allow trained personnel to
implement and coordinate assessment, containment, cleanup and
restoration operations of substance releases within an incident command
system in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.
ENTITY  Each and every individual, agent, firm, company, partnership,
corporation, business establishment, or other enterprise.
STRICT LIABILITY  Liability without fault. Specifically, each and every
entity responsible for containment of a solid, liquid, vaporous or gaseous
substance at the point of release into the ecosystem of the Town of Grand
Chute, including owners, controllers, and possessors of those substances,
shall assume joint and several responsibility for pecuniary liabilities of those
releases for containment, cleanup, restoration expenses and associated
administrative fees, legal fees, and court costs. The intent of incorporating
strict liability in this chapter is to reject matters of care, negligence,
knowledge, ignorance, good faith, bad faith, or any other justification as
a cause or reason for being a responsible entity in a substance release
incident.
§ 310-2. Emergency response.
The release into the ecosystem of the Town of Grand Chute of any solid,
liquid, vaporous, or gaseous substance that creates a known, potential
or suspected material, safety, health or environmental hazard or public
nuisance within the Town of Grand Chute, except those occurring during
sanctioned waste disposal, hazardous material collection or landfill
activities, shall be considered such a hazard, unless determined otherwise
by the on-scene incident commander, and be a condition that warrants an
emergency response.
§ 295-5 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 310-3
1:180
§ 310-3. Containment, cleanup and restoration.
The entity responsible for containment of a solid, liquid, vaporous or
gaseous substance at the point of release into the ecosystem of the Town
of Grand Chute, including owners, controllers, and possessors of those
substances, except those specifically sanctioned to perform waste disposal,
hazardous material collection or landfill activities, which presents a known,
potential or suspected material, safety, health, or environmental hazard
or public nuisance shall begin immediate actions to clean and clean up
the offending substance and restore the site to its original condition upon
direction of any emergency management, law enforcement or Fire
Department representative having jurisdictional authority. Should an entity
fail to comply for any reason or be incapable of completing the requirements
of this section in a time frame that is acceptable to the incident commander,
emergency management, law enforcement or Fire Department
representative having jurisdictional authority, such public official(s) may
order containment, cleanup, and site restoration actions to be taken by
public or private agencies.
§ 310-4. Strict liability.
No person or entity shall release into the ecosystem of the Town of Grand
Chute any solid, liquid, vaporous or gaseous substance that creates a
known, potential or suspected material, safety, health or environmental
hazard or public nuisance within the Town of Grand Chute, except those
occurring during sanctioned waste disposal, hazardous material collection
or landfill activities. The entity responsible for containment of a solid,
liquid, vaporous or gaseous substance at the point of release into the
ecosystem of the Town of Grand Chute, including owners, controllers, and
possessors of those substances, shall be strictly liable, jointly and severally,
for all reasonable and necessary expenses, as determined by the Town of
Grand Chute Fire Department or the Outagamie County Local Emergency
Planning Committee (LEPC), for those releases, per § 310-3, plus legal fees
and court costs associated with enforcement and collection activities under
this chapter.
§ 310-5. Reimbursement.
A. Agencies involved in the containment, cleanup and restoration of
substance releases shall be allowed to recoup reasonable and necessary
expenses for those activities, including but not limited to personnel
hours, equipment hours, supplies, equipment losses, administrative
costs, legal fees and court costs, per § 310-3. Agencies seeking
reimbursement under this section shall develop charge-back criteria for
substance release response operations and submit that criteria to the
Outagamie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for
claims review determinations. Agencies seeking reimbursement under

which would otherwise be levied in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.

The fees imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be listed on the Impact Fees
Schedule and approved by the Town Board on an annual basis as a part
of the fiscal year annual fee list. The amount of the impact fees imposed

following schedule, subject to the exception that for violations
under §§ 125.07(1)(a) and 125.04(5)(a)1, Wis. Stats.; such

revocation shall then take effect beginning on the fifth day following the

§ 335-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 335-21
1:227
(1) Excluded from application of the provisions of this section are the
following licensed establishments: wherever performances of
serious artistic merit, theaters, performing arts center, civic
centers, and dinner theaters, where live dance, ballet, or music, of
serious artistic merit, are offered, or legitimate educational,
medical or health-related programs are offered, and in which the
predominant business or attraction is not the offering to customers
of entertainment which is intended for the sexual interests or
titillation of customers, and where the licensed establishment is not
distinguished by an emphasis on, or the advertising or promotion
of, live nude or live semi-nude performances, or live specified
sexual activities take place. Also excluded from application of this
section are such establishments as hotels, motels, and restaurants
which are licensed establishments but which do not operate
sexually oriented businesses.
(2) Also excluded from application of this section are sexually oriented
businesses, which are not licensed establishments.
B. Intent. It is the intent of this section to promote the health, safety,
welfare, and morals of the citizens of the Town of Grand Chute by
establishing reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious secondary effects associated with licensed establishments
that operate sexually oriented businesses. The provisions of this section
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative or expressive materials
or acts, including sexually oriented materials or acts. Similarly, it is not
the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults
to sexually oriented materials or acts protected by the First Amendment
or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene materials as regulated by state law.
C. Authority.
(1) The Town Board of the Town of Grand Chute has explicit authority
under § 125.10, Wis. Stats., to adopt regulations governing the sale
of alcoholic beverages.
(2) Under Wisconsin Statutes §§ 60.10(2)(c), 60.22(3), and 61.34, and
its police powers, respectively, the Town Board has authority to act
for the good order of the Town of Grand Chute and for the health,
safety and welfare of the public and may carry out its powers by
ordinances and enforcement.
(3) The Town Board recognizes it lacks authority to regulate obscenity,
to the extent preempted by State of Wisconsin Statutes, and does
not intend by adopting this section to regulate or to condone
obscenity.
§ 335-21 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 335-21
1:228
(4) The Town Board recognizes that the authority to adopt zoning
ordinances applicable to the Town falls under the jurisdiction of
Outagamie County, and the Town Board does not by adoption of this
section create a zoning regulation.
(5) The Town Board recognizes that the U.S. Supreme Court has held
that nude or semi-nude dancing is expressive conduct within the
outer parameters of the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution and therefore is entitled to protection under the First
Amendment, and the Town Board further recognizes that freedom
of speech and expression are among our most precious and highly
protected rights and wishes to act consistently with the full
protection of these rights.
D. Findings.
(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Town Board has become aware,
based upon its own observations and experiences, as well as
testimony before the Board by legal counsel for the Town, and also
the experiences of other communities, that sexually oriented
businesses may and do generate secondary effects which the
governing body believes are detrimental to the public health,
safety, welfare, and morals of the citizens of the Town of Grand
Chute.
(2) Specifically, the Town Board has reviewed evidence concerning
adverse secondary effects on other communities found in, but not
limited to, the cases of Ben's Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316
F3d 702 (2003); City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S.
41 (1986); Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); Arcara
v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697 (1986); California v. LaRue, 409
U.S. 109 (1972); City of Newport, KY v. lacobucci, 479 U.S. 92
(1986); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v.
City of Chattanooga, 107 F3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap
County, 793 F2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of
Arlington, 65 F3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995); South Florida Free
Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984); New
York State Liquor Auth. v. Bellanca, 452 US 714 (1981); Blue
Canary Corp. v. City of Milwaukee, 251 F3d 1121; MDK, Inc. v.
Village of Grafton, 345 F. Supp 2d 952 at page 957; Daytona Grand,
Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, Florida, 490 F3d 860 (11th Cir. 2007);
and a compilation of studies on various municipalities regarding
the impact of adult-oriented business, and reports of harmful
secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented
businesses, including a publication of the American Planning
Association compiled by Eric Damian Kelly and Connie Cooper
entitled "everything you always wanted to know about regulating
sex businesses xxx," Report of the Attorney General's Working
Group on the Regulation of sexually oriented businesses, June 6,
1989, reports from studies in Phoenix, Arizona-1984 and
1995-1998; Minneapolis, Minnesota-1980; Houston, Texas-1997;
§ 335-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 335-21
1:229
Indianapolis, Indiana-1984; Amarillo, Texas-1977; Garden Grove,
California-1991; Los Angeles, California-1977; Whittier,
California-1978; Austin, Texas-1986; Seattle, Washington-1989;
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-1986; Cleveland, Ohio-1977; Dallas,
Texas-1997; St. Croix County, Wisconsin-1993; Bellevue,
Washington-1998; Newport News, Virginia-1996; and New York
Times Square study-1994.
(3) Based upon the foregoing evidence as well as Town Board
members' own individual experiences, observations and reasoning,
the Town Board finds that:
(a) Crime statistics show that many types of crimes, especially sexrelated
crimes, such as prostitution, occur with more
frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented
businesses are located.
(b) Studies of the relationship between sexually oriented
businesses and neighborhood property values have found a
negative impact on both residential and commercial property
values.
(c) Sexually oriented businesses will probably contribute to an
increased public health risk through the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases.
(d) Areas with sexually oriented businesses exhibit an increased
potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of
unlawful conduct.
(e) The consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of a
sexually oriented business exacerbates the deleterious
secondary effects of such businesses on the community.
(f) That restricting performers and entertainers only to a
requirement of wearing minimal coverings such as pasties or
G-strings alone will not avoid undesirable secondary effects in
licensed establishments.
(g) Some persons frequent sexually oriented businesses for the
purpose of engaging in illicit sexual behavior on the premises.
(4) The Town Board desires to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the citizens of the Town by preventing and controlling the
secondary adverse effects associated with licensed establishments
that operate sexually oriented businesses.
(5) The Town Board has determined that the enactment of an
ordinance prohibiting licensed establishments from operating
sexually oriented businesses promotes the goal of minimizing,
preventing, and controlling the above-referenced adverse
§ 335-21 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 335-21
1:230
secondary effects and thereby protects the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens of the Town of Grand Chute.
E. Grounds for nonissuance, suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of
alcohol beverage license issued under Chapter 125, Wisconsin Statutes.
The following shall constitute grounds for nonissuance, suspension,
revocation or nonrenewal, in accordance with notice and hearing
procedures under Ch. 125, Wis. Stats., of a license applied for, or

(1) Conviction of an offense, contrary to § 944.21, Wis. Stats., or any
successor statute or later amended version.
(2) A finding by the Town Board that the operation of the licensed

(3) A finding by the Town Board that any of the following have
occurred on the proposed or existing licensed establishment's
premises:

entertainers or performers, provided or performed, and
directed at a proposed or existing licensed establishment's
patrons or customers, or the general public.
(b) An instance of live public display of specified sexual activities
involving any entertainer or performer.
(c) An instance of live display of prohibited sexual contact
involving an entertainer or performer.
(d) Operation of a sexually oriented business.
F. Penalties. In alternative to, or in conjunction with, action the Town may
take, described in Subsection E above, with respect to licenses, the
Town may impose a forfeiture for each violation as determined by the
Town Board or Municipal Court Judge taking into account the number
of past and present violations proven, and the severity of the current
offense, pursuant to issuance of a summons and complaint to the
operator of the licensed establishment followed by a hearing with
respect to the charges in accordance with Municipal Court procedures
of the Town of Grand Chute.
(1) Any person, partnership, or corporation who is found to have
violated this section shall be punished by a forfeiture of not less
than $500 nor more than $5,000 for each offense, together with the
cost thereof, as determined by the Municipal Court Judge, in
accordance with the following schedule:

1:232
(1) Any person intending to be employed or work in any capacity as a
nude/semi-nude entertainer, as defined in § 335-20, in any licensed
establishment, adult entertainment tavern or sexually oriented
business, as defined § 335-20, within the Town of Grand Chute
shall, before engaging in such employment or work, register with,
and obtain a license from, the Grand Chute Police Department by
completing and filing a registration statement on the form provided
by the Department and paying the required fee as established in
the fee schedule maintained by the Grand Chute Town Clerk.
(2) No licensed establishment, adult entertainment tavern or sexually
oriented business shall allow services or performances by any
nude/semi-nude entertainer who is not registered with and has not
obtained a license from the Grand Chute Police Department as
required above.
B. Application.
(1) This section shall only apply to nude/semi-nude entertainers
employed or desiring to work, entertain or perform in a licensed
establishment, adult entertainment tavern or sexually oriented
business and to the licensed establishments, adult entertainment
taverns or sexually oriented businesses which allow services or
performances by such entertainers, as defined in § 335-20, subject
to the excluded categories of businesses described as follows.
(2) Excluded from application of the provisions of this section are the
following establishments: wherever performances of serious
artistic merit, theaters, performing arts centers, civic centers, and
dinner theaters, where live dance, ballet, or music, of serious
artistic merit, are offered, or legitimate educational, medical or
health-related programs are offered, and in which the predominant
business or attraction is not the offering to customers of
entertainment which is intended for the sexual interests or
titillation of customers, and where the establishment is not
distinguished by an emphasis on, or the advertising or promotion
of, live nude or live semi-nude performances, or live specified
sexual activities take place. Also excluded from application of this
section are such establishments as hotels, motels and restaurants
which are licensed establishments but which do not operate adult
entertainment taverns or sexually oriented businesses.
C. Intent. It is the intent of this section to promote the health, safety,
welfare, and morals of the citizens of the Town of Grand Chute by
establishing reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious secondary effects associated with the operation of licensed
establishments, adult entertainment taverns and sexually oriented
businesses. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor
the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative or expressive materials or acts, including sexually
oriented materials or acts. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this
§ 335-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 335-23
1:233
section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
materials or acts protected by the First Amendment or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment
to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this
section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials
as regulated by state law.
D. Authority.
(1) The Town Board of the Town of Grand Chute has explicit authority
under § 125.10, Wis. Stats., to adopt regulations governing the sale
of alcoholic beverages.
(2) Under §§ 60.10(2)(c), 60.22(3), and 61.34, Wis. Stats., and its police
powers, respectively, the Town Board has authority to act for the
good order of the Town of Grand Chute and for the health, safety
and welfare of the public and may carry out its powers by
ordinances and enforcement.
(3) The Town Board recognizes it lacks authority to regulate obscenity,
to the extent preempted by State of Wisconsin Statutes, and does
not intend by adopting this section to regulate or to condone
obscenity.
(4) The Town Board recognizes that the United States Supreme Court
has held that nude or semi-nude dancing is expressive conduct
within the outer parameters of the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution and therefore is entitled to certain protections
under the First Amendment, and the Town Board further
recognizes that freedom of speech and expression are among our
most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act
consistently with the full protection of these rights.
E. Findings.
(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Town Board has become aware,
based upon its own observations and experiences, as well as
testimony before the Board by legal counsel for the Town, and also
the experiences of other communities, that licensed
establishments, adult entertainment taverns and sexually oriented
businesses may and do generate secondary effects which the
governing body believes are detrimental to the public health,
safety, welfare, and morals of the citizens of the Town of Grand
Chute.
(2) Specifically, the Town Board has reviewed evidence concerning
adverse secondary effects on other communities found in, but not
limited to, the cases of Ben's Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316
F3d 702 (2003); City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S.
41 (1986); Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); Arcara
v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697 (1986); California v. LaRue, 409
U.S. 109 (1972); City of Newport, KY v. lacobucci, 479 U.S. 92

v. Kitsap County, 793 F2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc.

Village of Grafton, 345 F. Supp 2d 952 at page 957; Daytona Grand,
Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, Florida, 490 F3d 860 (11th Cir. 2007);
and a compilation of studies on various municipalities regarding
the impact of adult and sexually oriented businesses, and reports
of harmful secondary effects occurring in and around sexually
oriented businesses, including a publication of the American
Planning Association compiled by Eric Damian Kelly and Connie
Cooper entitled "everything you always wanted to know about
regulating sex businesses xxx," Report of the Attorney General's
Working Group on the Regulation of sexually oriented businesses,
June 6, 1989, reports from studies in Phoenix, Arizona-1984 and
1995-1998; Minneapolis, Minnesota-1980; Houston, Texas-1997;
Indianapolis, Indiana-1984; Amarillo, Texas-1977; Garden Grove,
California-1991; Los Angeles, California-1977; Whittier,
California-1978; Austin, Texas-1986; Seattle, Washington-1989;
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-1986; Cleveland, Ohio-1977; Dallas,
Texas-1997; St. Croix County, Wisconsin-1993; Bellevue,
Washington-1998; Newport News, Virginia-1996; and New York
Times Square study-1994.
(3) Based upon the foregoing evidence as well as Town Board
members' own individual experiences, observations and reasoning,
the Town Board finds that:
(a) Crime statistics show that many types of crimes, especially sexrelated
crimes, such as prostitution, occur with more
frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented
businesses are located.
(b) Studies of the relationship between sexually oriented
businesses and neighborhood property values have found a
negative impact on both residential and commercial property
values.
(c) Sexually oriented businesses will probably contribute to an
increased public health risk through the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases.
(d) Areas with sexually oriented businesses exhibit an increased
potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of
unlawful conduct.
§ 335-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 335-23
1:235
(e) The consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of a
sexually oriented business exacerbates the deleterious
secondary effects of such businesses on the community.
(f) That restricting performers and entertainers only to a
requirement of wearing minimal coverings such as pasties or
G-strings alone will not avoid undesirable secondary effects in
licensed establishments.
(g) Some persons frequent sexually oriented businesses for the
purpose of engaging in illicit sexual behavior on the premises.
(4) The Town Board desires to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the citizens of the Town by preventing and controlling the
secondary adverse effects associated with licensed establishments
or other businesses operating as adult entertainment taverns or
sexually oriented businesses.
(5) The Town Board has determined that the enactment of an
ordinance prohibiting licensed establishments from operating
sexually oriented businesses and mandating that nude/semi-nude
entertainers register through the Town promotes the goal of
minimizing, preventing, and controlling the above-referenced
adverse secondary effects and thereby protects the health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of the Town of Grand Chute.
F. Annual licensing of nude/semi-nude entertainers. Licensing shall be
required on an annual basis from July 1 to June 30. The registration
period shall terminate on June 30 and require renewal for each
separate year thereafter, beginning July 1 of each year.
G. Grounds for nonissuance, suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of
license issued to nude/semi-nude entertainers. The following, among
others as determined appropriate by the Town, shall constitute grounds
for nonissuance, suspension, revocation or nonrenewal of a license
issued to a nude/semi-nude entertainer.
(1) Conviction of a sexually related offense, offenses of moral
turpitude, prostitution, obscenity or an offense contrary to
§§ 944.01 through 944.36, Wis. Stats., or any successor statutes or
later amended versions.
H. Procedure for nonissuance, suspension, revocation, or nonrenewal of
license. The Town Clerk shall give written notice of any decision by the
Town Police Department or Town Board to nonissue, suspend, revoke,
or nonrenew a license for any nude/semi-nude entertainer by regular
mail to the last known address shown on the application or license
previously issued. The decision of the Police Department or Town Board
shall become final unless the nude/semi-nude entertainer requests a
hearing before the Town Board, in writing, submitted to the Town Clerk,
which request shall be received by the Town Clerk within 15 days of the
postmark mailing of the notice of the Town Board decision. The Town
§ 335-23 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 335-23
1:236
hearing shall be conducted on the next regularly scheduled Town Board
meeting, providing at least 72 hours' advance notice of the request for
hearing is received prior to the Town Board meeting; otherwise, the
hearing shall be at the next regularly scheduled Town Board meeting.
The Town Board at such hearing may affirm, reverse, or modify its
decision following the hearing, and written notice thereof shall be
mailed by the Town Clerk to the nude/semi-nude entertainer.
I. Penalties.
(1) In alternative to, or in conjunction with, any action the Town may
take in order to enforce this section, any nude/semi-nude
entertainer failing to comply with the provision of this section shall
be punished upon conviction thereof by a fine as prescribed in the
Uniform Forfeiture and Bond Schedules for each separate offense.
Each day an unregistered adult nude/semi-nude entertainer is
performing, dancing or otherwise entertaining shall be considered
and charged as a separate offense punishable by a separate fine.
(2) Any licensed establishment, sexually oriented business or adult
entertainment tavern employing an unregistered nude/semi-nude
entertainer or otherwise permitting an unregistered nude/seminude
entertainer to perform, dance or otherwise entertain shall be
punished, upon conviction, by fine as prescribed in the Uniform
Forfeiture and Bond Schedule. Each day an unregistered adult
nude/semi-nude entertainer is employed, or permitted to perform,
dance or otherwise entertain by any licensee or any licensed
establishments, adult entertainment taverns or sexually oriented
businesses shall constitute a separate offense punishable by a
separate fine.

§ 398-17. Smoking ban. [Added 6-15-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-07;

the property or business or to the last known address of the owner
or operator, based upon tax billing records in the Town offices or the
address shown on the permit or license application.
A. Purpose. The Town Board recognizes that smoking of cigarettes and
other tobacco products and inhaling vapors from an electronic delivery
device are hazardous to an individual's health and may affect the health
of nonsmokers/smokers when they are involuntarily in the presence of
smoking. Reliable scientific studies assessed by credible health officials
have found that secondhand tobacco smoke and the vapors exhaled by
users of an electronic delivery device are significant health hazards for
children, elderly people, and individuals with cardiovascular disease or
impaired respiratory function. Air pollution caused by smoking is an
offensive annoyance and irritant. Smoking results in serious and
significant physical discomfort to nonsmokers. This article is adopted
for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, comfort and
general welfare of the people of the Town of Grand Chute, especially
recognizing the health interests of nonsmokers, who constitute a
majority of the population.
B. Smoking ban adopted. The Town hereby adopts, by reference, the
provisions of § 101.123, Smoking prohibited, Wis. Stats., pertaining to
the statewide smoking ban as of July 5, 2010.
C. Use of electronic delivery devices.
(1) Definitions. The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in
this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except
where the context indicates a different meaning:
ELECTRONIC DELIVERY DEVICE  Any product containing or
delivering nicotine, lobelia, or any other substance intended for
human consumption that can be used by a person to simulate
smoking in the delivery of nicotine or any other substance through
inhalation of aerosol, mist, or vapor from the product. The term
includes, but is not limited to, devices manufactured, distributed,
marketed, or sold as electronic cigarettes or cigars, electronic

pipes, personal vaporizers, electronic nicotine delivery systems,
vape pens, or electronic hookahs.
An electronic cigarette (e-cig or e-cigarette), personal vaporizer
(PV), or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) is a batterypowered
vaporizer which has the feel of tobacco smoking. They

element vaporizes a liquid solution known as "e-liquid." E-liquids
usually contain a mixture of propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine,
and flavorings.
SMOKING  Burning or holding or inhaling or exhaling smoke,
mist, or vapor from any of the following items containing tobacco
or nicotine products:
(a) A lighted cigar.
(b) A lighted cigarette.
(c) A lighted pipe.
(d) An electronic delivery device.
(e) Any other lighted smoking equipment.
(2) Prohibition. The prohibition against smoking established in
§ 101.123, Wis. Stats., and adopted in Subsection B, above, shall be
expanded to include the use of an electronic delivery device.
D. Inspection and enforcement. The Town of Grand Chute Police
Department shall have the power to enter any premises subject to the
smoking ban established by this section to ascertain whether the
premises is in compliance with, and to take appropriate enforcement
action pursuant to, this section.
E. Violations and penalties. Any person found to have violated any
provision of this section shall be subject to a forfeiture as prescribed in
the Uniform Forfeiture and Bond Schedule.
A. No person who is required to hold a license, certificate of registration
or other credential pursuant to Chapter 460, Wis. Stats., Massage

the Town of Grand Chute unless that person holds a valid, unexpired

460, Wis. Stats.

§ 423-2. Authority; findings; purpose.
Pursuant to its authority granted by the broad powers under §§ 60.10(2)(c)
and 60.22, Wis. Stats., and village powers under 61.34, Wis. Stats., which
confers the power to act for the government and good order of the Town, for
its commercial benefit and for the health, safety, welfare and convenience
of the public, the Town Board has found that maintenance of buildings,
structures and premises in the Town of Grand Chute affects the health,
safety, and general welfare of the residents of the community. The general
purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards governing the
maintenance, appearance and condition of residential and nonresidential
premises and to set certain responsibilities and duties upon owners and
operators and distinct and separate responsibilities and duties upon
occupants. The Town recognizes that there may presently be or in the
future be structures, yards and vacant lots, or unimproved areas, or any
combination thereof, in the Town which are dilapidated, unsafe, dangerous,
unhygienic, or inadequately maintained so as to constitute a threat to
the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the Town. The
establishment and enforcement of minimum property maintenance
standards are necessary to preserve both private and public interests,
with the overall purpose being to benefit the health, safety, welfare and
convenience of the public.
§ 423-3. Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply uniformly to all land, buildings and
structures and surrounding areas within the Town, without regard to their
class, date of construction, alteration or repair.

M. Natural landscaping. The purpose of this subsection is to promote the
planting and maintenance of natural landscaping. It is in the public's
interest to encourage diverse landscaping practices, particularly those
that promote native plantings and natural landscapes. When properly
implemented and managed, these treatments can increase biodiversity,
have a positive effect on soil and water conservation, and be an
economical and low maintenance landscaping option. Native plants also
provide habitat, food, and shelter for native pollinators. Nothing in this
subsection is intended to promote the rank growth of vegetation or
noxious weeds. Rank growth of vegetation and noxious weeds adversely
impact public health and safety, and can decrease adjacent property
values. Planned natural landscaping is not intended to allow property
owners to ignore proper maintenance duties. It is also not acceptable
for property owners to simply stop maintaining the existing turf grass
on their property. Implementation of natural landscaping does not
preclude the requirements to provide landscaping as identified in
§ 535-52 of the Town of Grand Chute Municipal Code. In such instances,
natural landscaping may be implemented in addition to those
requirements. [Added 11-1-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-08]
(1) Establishing natural landscaping. A natural landscaping permit
application must be received and approved by the Town before a
property owner can implement natural landscaping. Natural
landscaping elements are to be planted through transplanting or
seeding. Prior to implementing natural landscaping, turf grass and
any noxious weeds are to be eliminated.
(2) Required setback. A setback area, consisting of regularly cut turf
grass, trees, shrubs, mulch, wood chips or landscape stone must be
maintained between the natural landscaping area and an abutting
property line. The minimum setback distances are defined as:
(a) Three feet from any adjoining side and rear lot lines. No
setback is required on side or rear lot lines if any of the
following conditions exist:
[1] There is a sight-tight boundary fence in accordance with
§ 535-53 of the Town of Grand Chute Municipal Code.
[2] The natural landscaping area abuts a neighboring planned
natural landscaping area.
[3] The natural landscaping area abuts an environmentally
sensitive area.
(b) On corner lots, the vision triangle area, as defined in
§ 535-47A(1) of the Town of Grand Chute Municipal Code, must
be maintained.
§ 423-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 423-7
1:297
§ 423-8. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
(3) Maintenance. Natural landscaping must be maintained throughout
the growing season and remain free of noxious weeds. If prescribed
burning techniques are used for maintenance, the requirements
outlined in § 291-5M of the Town of Grand Chute Municipal Code
must be followed.
A. Inspection by officers. All officers are authorized to administer and
enforce the provisions of this chapter. Said officers shall enforce the
provisions of this chapter and are authorized and directed to make
inspections in response to a complaint or when they have good reason
to believe a violation is being committed.
B. Entrance into property. For the purpose of making an inspection,
officers are authorized to enter, examine and survey at all reasonable
times the exterior portions of all buildings, structures and/or premises.
If an officer is denied access to a building, structure or premises he or
she may apply to the courts for a special inspection warrant.
C. Notice of violation. [Amended 4-23-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-06]
(1) In the event that an officer determines that a building, structure
and/or exterior area, excluding rank growth of vegetation and
noxious weeds, violates or fails to meet the requirements of this
chapter, he or she shall issue a notice in writing setting forth the
alleged failures or violations and advising the owner, occupant or
agent that such failures or violations must be corrected within 30
days of the date of the written notice of violation, unless a written
extension is granted by the officer. In determining whether or not
to grant an extension, the officer may consider the health of the
owner/occupant as it relates to his or her ability to correct the
violation in a timely manner, the length of time required to correct
the violation, the weather conditions and any other factors which
relate to the ability of the owner/occupant to correct the violation
within 30 days.
(2) In the event that an officer determines that rank growth of
vegetation or noxious weeds violates or fails to meet the
requirements of this chapter, he or she shall request that the Weed
Commissioner or his designee issue a written notice to the property
owner via first-class United States Mail. The property owner or
current occupant shall have three days to comply with this chapter.
Failure to comply will result in the Town performing the necessary
services to bring the property within compliance. The cost of
property maintenance services and equipment shall be in
accordance with the Town's current fee schedule and equipment
charge out rates. All costs of such service and equipment used will
be borne by the property owner and may be placed as a lien on the
property for a lack of payment.

permit, the permit fee shall then be double the amount stated in the
Fee Schedule. All fees shall be paid to the Town at the time the
application is filed.
C. All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection,
maintenance and repair of the building sewers from the main, including
the riser and connection thereto, to the building shall be borne by the
owner(s). Costs and expenses shall include any damage caused by the
owner and/or any agent or contractor of the owner either to the Town of
Grand Chute, the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2, or any
third party where said damages result from said installation,
connection, maintenance or repair or result from the negligent
construction, negligent installation or negligent connection of building
sewers by the owner and/or any agent or contractor of the owner. The
owner and any agent/contractor of the owner shall indemnify the Town
for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by
the installation, connection, maintenance or repair of the building
sewer, including any damages resulting from trenching, open cutting or
tunneling. To assure compliance by the owner and his agents/
contractors with this section and this article in general, the owner and
his agents/contractors shall post a bond with the Town as a guarantee
and indemnity that any and all damages the owner or his agents/
§ 440-4 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 440-5
1:306
contractors cause to the public sewer or any appurtenances thereto or
any abutting property thereto shall be repaired at the expense of the
owner and/or his agent or contractor, all to the complete satisfaction
of the Town. This bond shall be in the amount of $3,000 and may be
combined by the owner or his agent and contractors with the bond
requirement of $2,000 in § 523-33. Therefore, in all cases where the
owner employs an agent and/or contractor to install, connect, maintain
or repair sewers, the agent and/or contractor shall meet all of these
bond requirements. In all cases where the installation, connection,
maintenance or repair of building sewers shall include any construction
within a federal highway, state highway, or county highway right-ofway,
or any trenching, open cutting or tunneling of any federal highway,
state highway, or county highway, then the owner or any agent/
contractor hired by the owner to accomplish the project shall post a
bond with the Town as a guarantee and indemnity that any and all
damage caused to federal, state or county right-of-way, or any federal
highway, state or county highway, or any and all appurtenances thereto,
shall be repaired at the sole expense of owner or the agent/contractor
of the owner, all to the complete satisfaction of the Town. This bond
shall be in the amount of $50,000 when the installation, connection,
maintenance or repair of building sewers includes any trenching, open
cutting or tunneling within any federal, state or county highway or
federal, state, or county highway right-of-way. The combined bond
under this subsection and § 523-33 shall be in the amount of $50,000.
Damages are defined hereunder to include all damages resulting from
said installation, connection, maintenance or repair or negligent
construction. The term "damages" as utilized herein shall further
include any legal expenses incurred by the Town of Grand Chute or the
Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2 as a result of damages
sustained during said installation, connection, maintenance or repair.
The bond required under this subsection shall include, within its terms
and conditions, that the bond shall remain in full force and effect for
one year after the date of completion of the installation and connection
of building sewers. [Amended 10-20-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-16106]
D. A separate and independent building sanitary sewer shall be provided
for every building; except that where one building stands at the rear of
another on an interior lot and no private sanitary sewer is available or
can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley,
court, yard, or driveway, the building sanitary sewer from the front
building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered
as one building sanitary sewer, and except when specific written
permission to include more than one building on a sanitary sewer is
granted the Utility Superintendent, based upon exigencies of the
situation and when not contrary to the interest of the public. In any
event, when more than one building is included on a sanitary sewer

§ 440-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 440-9
1:311
A. The Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2 hereby requires all
private wells serving residential, commercial or industrial properties,
and where located within the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No.
2 (Sewer Utility), to have a municipal water meter placed upon said
private wells. The municipal boundaries for the Town of Grand Chute
Sanitary District No. 1 (water service) and Town of Grand Chute
Sanitary District No. 2 (sewer service) are not similar. Therefore, in
those parts of the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2, property
owners receiving sewer service who have private wells used for either
residential, commercial or industrial purposes shall be required to
conform to all terms and conditions of this article. In the Town of Grand
Chute Sanitary District No. 1 (water services), where properties are
connected for water service to a municipal water main but have
retained a private well for outside use, there will be no requirement of
metering of these types of private wells.
(1) The Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2 shall furnish the
water meter and shall place the same no further than six inches
after outlet of the private well pressure tank for each residential,
commercial or industrial private well user. It is the intention of the
Sanitary District that all water used within each structure shall be
metered. The cost of the water meter will be funded and paid for by
the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 1 and/or No. 2. An
outside reader will be required.
(2) All such water meters as furnished and placed by the Town of
Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2 shall be required to be
installed by each private well owner on or before the 30th day of
August 1989. Should any private well owner not comply with this
section by August 30, 1989, then the Sanitary District shall cause
such meter to be installed; any and all charges associated with said
installation of meter shall be charged directly to the respective
customer.
(3) The water meters as installed and operating upon private wells, as
defined above, will be read by Sanitary District No. 2.
(4) Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2 sewer users, including
those with municipal water service or private wells, shall be
metered as hereinbefore provided and shall be charged a sewer
user charge based upon water consumption and meter size. User
rates shall be established and may be amended from time to time
by the Sanitary District No. 2 Commission at a regularly scheduled
meeting. Such rates shall be referred to as the "Grand Chute
Sanitary District No 2 Sewer User Rates," a schedule of which shall
be signed and dated upon approval by the Commission. A copy of
such rate schedule shall be filed with the Town Clerk.
(5) Inspections.
§ 440-9 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 440-9
1:312
(a) Each property owner having a private well and receiving sewer
service from the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2
(Sewer Utility) shall be required to open his, her or its
premises for inspection by the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary
District No. 2 and for the installation of the water meter by the
Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2, all as above
provided.
(b) Any property owner not allowing the Town of Grand Chute
Sanitary District No. 2 to inspect said premises and to install
said water meter upon and to a private well service shall be
issued a summons and complaint, returnable to the Municipal
Court of the Town of Grand Chute, as a violation of this article.
Any elected or appointed official of the Town of Grand Chute
Sanitary District No. 2, including the Utility Superintendent,
may issue said summons and complaint. The summons and
complaint shall be served by the Town of Grand Chute Police
Department upon the person violating this article. Upon
conviction thereof, the violator shall pay a forfeiture in the
amount as prescribed in the Uniform Forfeiture and Bond
Schedules for each violation, together with the costs of
prosecution, and in the event of default of payment of such
forfeiture and the costs of prosecution shall be imprisoned in
the county jail until such forfeiture and costs of prosecution are
paid, for a period not to exceed 90 days. Each day that a
property owner refuses to permit the Town of Grand Chute
Sanitary District No. 2 utility personnel to view the premises
and/or to install the water meter upon the private well shall be
considered a separate violation under this article.
B. Initial user service connection charge. As a fair and equitable charge
towards the capital costs of the sewer system, every user at the time of
initial hookup shall be charged an initial user service connection charge
as prescribed in the Town Fee Schedule.
C. Sewer connection charge. The sewer connection charge shall be as
follows:
(1) Users supplied by sewers installed by a private concern as part of a
subdivision development approved by the Town of Grand Chute
Board of Supervisors and/or Board of Commissioners of the Town of
Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2 shall not be subject to a sewer
connection charge; however, the initial user service connection
charge under Subsection B above shall be paid.
(2) When connection to a sewer is part of a District-sponsored sewer
connection project, the sewer connection charge shall be as
prescribed in the Town Fee Schedule, and the initial user service
connection charge under Subsection B above shall be paid in
addition thereto.111
§ 440-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 440-9
1:313
D. The Sanitary District shall levy a charge upon all sewer users within its
jurisdiction, defined herein as the sewer user charge. The sewer user
charge will commence from the time the connection is made to the
main, regardless of when actual connection is made to the building, and
regardless of when actual use commences. No charge shall be made to
an industrial user for costs which are charged directly to that user
under a contract between that user and the Grand Chute - Menasha
West Sewerage Commission. The sewer user charge shall be adequate
to defray operation and maintenance charges made by the Grand Chute
- Menasha West Sewerage Commission to the Sanitary District and to
defray operation and maintenance costs of the Sanitary District's sewer
system. The Sanitary District shall levy those charges on its customers
in a manner so as nearly proportionate to their actual use as is
practical.
E. Upon receipt of notice from the Grand Chute - Menasha West Sewerage
Commission as to the estimated operation and maintenance charges for
the next succeeding fiscal year, the Sanitary Commission shall adopt by
resolution a schedule of sewer user charges according to the following
methodology:
(1) Industrial wastes.
(a) When industrial wastes exceed 200 milligrams per liter
average concentration of either BOD or suspended solids (SS)
or five milligrams per liter of phosphorus (P) during a billing
period, that excess shall be subject to a surcharge equal to the
unit operation and maintenance costs of the Grand Chute -
Menasha West Sewerage Commission for treating that waste
component. In addition to these surcharges, the discharger of
industrial wastes shall be subject to the volume charge as
computed in Subsection E(2).
(b) The rate of surcharge for BOD in excess of 200 milligrams per
liter, SS in excess of 200 milligrams per liter, and P in excess of
five milligrams per liter shall be determined annually by the
Grand Chute - Menasha West Sewerage Commission. A copy of
these surcharges is on file at Grand Chute Sanitary District No.
2 offices.
(2) Nonindustrial wastes. The total annual operation and maintenance
charges estimated by the Grand Chute - Menasha West Sewerage
Commission for the Sanitary District [less estimated revenue from
surcharges calculated in Subsection E(1)] shall be divided by the
estimated volume of sanitary sewage discharged by all sewer users.
The resulting rate, expressed in dollars per 1,000 gallons, rounded
up to the nearest whole cent, shall be the volume charge.
111. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 440-9 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 440-9
1:314
(3) Demand and billing charge. The annual costs of the operation and
maintenance of the sewer system of the Sanitary District shall be
divided by the number of residential equivalent meters and the
resulting quotient shall be the annual demand and billing charge.
(4) Any excess (or deficit) in sewer user charges collected by the
Sanitary District shall be credited (or debited) against the
estimated operation and maintenance charges for the remainder of
the current and/or the next succeeding fiscal year, at the discretion
of the Sanitary Commission.
(5) The Sanitary District shall notify its sewer users of the rate and
amount of the sewer user charge no less than annually in
conjunction with a regular bill for sewer user charges.
(6) Restaurant users. The sewer user charge for restaurant users shall
be as prescribed in the Town Fee Schedule. Restaurant users that
utilize water for other purposes besides restaurant use may install
a deduct meter at their expense to segregate other uses. If a deduct
meter is not feasible, a residential equivalency unit determination
may be made by the Utility Superintendent. Restaurant users may
monitor their wastes to determine their characteristics and pay the
rates established for industrial wastes, provided that:
(a) The wastewater is metered and sampled flow proportionately
for seven consecutive days each year. Sampling and metering
procedures shall be approved by the Utility Superintendent
prior to proceeding pursuant to this subsection. The annual
rate will be based on the average of the seven-day results.
(b) The wastewater shall be tested for BOD, SS and P by a certified
laboratory. Results shall be furnished to the Utility
Superintendent.
F. The sewer usage of a customer discharging nonindustrial waste shall be
charged using water meter readings and private well meters.
G. The sewer usage of a customer discharging industrial wastes shall be
charged using water meter readings and private well meters together
with the results of wastewater sampling and testing. The Utility
Superintendent shall decide upon the type of metering and frequency of
sampling which may be needed to adequately characterize industrial
wastes which are to be discharged.
H. The Sanitary Commission may, from time to time, recover other costs
along with the sewer user charge as long as those costs are reasonably
related to sanitary sewer services and are not applied in such a way to
offset the sewer user charge levied to defray operation and
maintenance costs.
I. It shall be the policy of the Sanitary District, until repealed or amended
hereafter, to obtain sufficient revenue to pay the actual costs of
§ 440-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 440-9
1:315
§ 440-10. Violations and penalties.112
constructing, installing and operating the sewage system through a
combination of system user charges, as defined herein, coupled with
a combination of Sanitary District utility assessment costs policies and
procedures. If at any time debt charges exist, it is the policy of the
Sanitary District that any such debt costs, to the extent not defrayed
by tax levies, shall be added to the operation and maintenance charges
established by the Commission in an amount sufficient and adequate to
retire any such debt obligations.
A. Any person found to be in violation of any provision of this article,
except § 440-7, shall be served by the Town with written notice stating
the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the
satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the time
period stated within such notice, permanently cease all violations.
B. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided for in Subsection A above shall, upon conviction thereof,
forfeit an amount as prescribed in the Uniform Forfeiture and Bond
Schedules for each violation, together with the costs of prosecution,
and in default of payment of such forfeiture and costs of prosecution
shall be imprisoned in the county jail until such forfeiture and costs of
prosecution are paid, not to exceed 90 days.
C. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become
liable to the Town of Grand Chute for any expenses, losses, or damages
occasioned to the Town by reason of such violation, which shall be
recovered by a civil action by the Attorney for the Town of Grand Chute.
D. Any person violating § 440-7 of this article and/or § 440-6 of this article
shall bear all costs and expenses incident to repairs, corrections and
installation of sewers upon property owned by the Town, and said
owner shall reimburse and/or indemnify the Town for any loss or
damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the person's
violation of said section. Said violator shall be liable to the Town of
Grand Chute for any expenses, losses, or damages occasioned by or to
the Town by reason of such violation, and any such expenses, losses or
damages shall be recovered, if unpaid or not indemnified by the owner,
by a civil action by the Attorney for the Town of Grand Chute.
E. Any person who shall violate § 440-3D shall be served by the Town of
Grand Chute or the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2 with a
summons and complaint, returnable to the Municipal Court of the Town
of Grand Chute, for a violation of said subsection. Any elected or
appointed official of the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2,
including the Utility Superintendent of the Town of Grand Chute
Sanitary District No. 2, may issue the summons and complaint. The

summons and complaint shall be served by the Town of Grand Chute
Police Department upon the person violating said subsection. Upon
conviction thereof, the violator shall pay a forfeiture in the amount
as prescribed in the Uniform Forfeiture and Bond Schedules for each
violation, together with the costs of prosecution, and in the event of
default of payment of such forfeiture and the costs of prosecution
shall be imprisoned in the county jail until such forfeiture and costs of
prosecution are paid, for a period not to exceed 90 days.
(1) Where any person, whether the owner of the real estate or a
general contractor or subcontractor to the owner thereof, is
convicted of a violation more than two times within one calendar
year, the owner and contractor/subcontractor involved with the
violation shall be prohibited from obtaining from the Town of Grand
Chute any building permits for a period of one year following the
second conviction within a calendar year. This will include the loss
of the right to receive sanitary and sewer permits for contractors
and subcontractors having violated this article.
(2) By creation of this article, it is understood and agreed by the Town
of Grand Chute and the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No.
2 that § 440-3D shall be construed to prohibit the owner of any real
estate or his or her agents, contractors or subcontractors from
allowing clear water and stormwater to enter the Town of Grand
Chute Sanitary District No. 2 sanitary sewers. For example, it has
come to the attention of the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District
No. 2 that owners and their contractors, when constructing new
homes and buildings within the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary
District No. 2, at the time that the foundation is being constructed,
allow stormwaters accumulated within the excavation area and
foundation area to flow into the Sanitary District sewers by way of
removal, knocking off of or other methods allowing such storm
drainage to enter the capped or uncapped sanitary sewer which
has been brought into and through the foundation but which is
required to remain capped and unavailable for use until power is
available to the construction premises and any sump pump for
stormwater drainage is available and functioning.
F. Any person violating § 440-3, Use of public sewers required, shall be
subject to a forfeiture as set forth in the immediately preceding
subsections. Therefore, it is understood that § 440-3, Use of public
sewers required, is amended to provide that a violation of said § 440-3,
or any part thereof, shall be subject to a forfeiture as set forth above. In
addition, any violation of § 440-3, Use of public sewers required, or any
violation of the aforementioned ordinances requiring a municipal water
meter to be installed and utilized upon all private wells may be further
enforced through a Circuit Court order for mandamus petitioned for
and obtained by the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2. In
addition, the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2 shall have the
right to seek any court order and/or injunctive relief so as to enforce all

1:317
§ 440-11. Service outside municipal boundaries.
ordinances amended hereunder and/or all ordinances created
hereunder. All costs of the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 2,

shall limit the authority of the authorized enforcement agency to take
action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a warning notice.

or to the environment, the authorized enforcement agency may
issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:

as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4
or waters of the United States and/or endangerment to persons
or to the environment, including immediate termination of a
facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal

whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the

against the violator.118

prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United
States or to minimize danger to persons.

hearing.

ARTICLE II
Stormwater Management
[Adopted 9-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-14123]
§ 463-13. Authority; effect on other laws.
§ 463-14. Findings of fact.
The Town of Grand Chute Board finds that uncontrolled post-construction
stormwater runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the
health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the
public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled
post-construction runoff can:
A. This article is adopted by the Town of Grand Chute Board under the
authority granted by § 60.627, Wis. Stats. This article supersedes all
provisions of an ordinance previously enacted in accordance with
§ 60.62, Wis. Stats., that relate to post-construction stormwater
management regulations. Except as otherwise specified in § 60.627,
Wis. Stats., the provisions in § 60.62, Wis. Stats., apply to this article
and to any amendments to this article.
B. The provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful
regulatory powers of the same governing body.
C. The Town of Grand Chute Board hereby designates the Plan
Commission and the Community Development Department to
administer and enforce the provisions of this article.
D. The requirements of this article do not preempt more stringent
stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of
the following:
(1) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources administrative rules,
permits or approvals, including those authorized under §§ 281.16
and 283.33, Wis. Stats.
(2) Targeted performance standards promulgated in rules by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources under § NR 151.004,
Wis. Adm. Code.
A. Degrade physical stream habitats by increasing stream bank erosion,
increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge,
diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature.
B. Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life,
recreational uses, and water supplies by increasing pollutant loading of
sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria,
pathogens and other urban pollutants.
123. Editors Note: This ordinance also repealed former Art. II, Stormwater Management,
adopted 1-7-1997 as Ch. 26 of the 1997 Code, as amended.
§ 463-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 463-14
1:355
§ 463-15. Purpose and intent.
C. Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and
increasing pollutant loads.
D. Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading.
E. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
overtaxing storm sewers, drainageways, and other minor drainage
facilities.
F. Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by
increasing major flood peaks and volumes.
G. Undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence
and levels of flooding.
A. Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish long-term,
post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish
the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic
environment. Specific purposes are to:
(1) Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions.
(2) Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and
control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect
spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites,
placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and
scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth.
(3) Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage
facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel
erosion; control increases in the scouring and transportation of
particulate matter; and prevent conditions that endanger
downstream property.
B. Intent. It is the intent of the Town of Grand Chute Board that this article
regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the
state. This article may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The Town of
Grand Chute Board recognizes, however, that the preferred method of
achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this
article is through the preparation and implementation of
comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that
cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional
scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices
or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more
than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans
are in conformance with the performance standards developed under
§ 281.16, Wis. Stats., for regional stormwater management measures
and have been approved by the Town of Grand Chute Board, it is the
intent of this article that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction
management measures acceptable for the community.

(b) Nonpoint discharges from agricultural activity areas.
(c) Nonpoint discharges from silviculture activities.
(d) Mill and crush operations.
(3) Notwithstanding the applicability requirements in § 463-16A(1),
this article applies to post-construction sites of any size that, in the
opinion of the administering authority, are likely to result in runoff
that exceeds the safe capacity of the existing drainage facilities or
receiving body of water, that causes undue channel erosion, that
increases water pollution by scouring or the transportation of
particulate matter, or that endangers property or public safety.
B. Jurisdiction. This article applies to post-construction sites within the

one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour design storms.
[2] Peak discharge control is not required for routine
maintenance areas, except when runoff from the routine
maintenance area discharges into a proposed peak flow
control facility.
[3] Peak discharge calculations shall use TR-55 methodology.
Atlas 14 rainfall depths and the MSE4 rainfall distribution
shall be used unless the site is to be served by a previously
constructed peak discharge facility. At the permittee's
discretion, the TP-40 rainfall depths and the Type II
rainfall distribution can be used for sites that are to be
served by a previously constructed peak discharge facility.
The meaning of "hydrologic soil group" and "runoff curve
number" are as determined in TR-55. Unless the site is
currently woodland, peak pre-development discharge
rates shall be determined using the following runoff curve

the site shall not be reduced as a result of the proposed
development or disturbance.
§ 463-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 463-19
1:369
(d) When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP from off-site
areas shall be taken into account in determining the
performance of the practice. Any impact on the BMP
performance shall be compensated for by increasing the size of
the BMP accordingly. The peak discharge reduction provided
by the BMP for an off-site area shall not be used to satisfy the
required on-site peak discharge reduction unless otherwise
approved by the administering authority in accordance with
§ 463-19E of this article.
(e) An adequate outfall shall be provided for each point of
concentrated discharge from the post-construction site and
shall consist of:

outfall may be permitted if it diffuses the discharge within
the site boundary in accordance with the Town of Grand
Chute Stormwater Reference Guide.
(f) New buildings with basements shall be designed to provide a
minimum one foot of vertical separation between the lowest
floor surface and the estimated high groundwater level. If less
than one foot of vertical separation is provided, groundwater
flow shall be estimated for each basement during site or
subdivision design. In addition, the on-site stormwater systems
shall be designed to accommodate the additional water flow
and volume from groundwater.

groundwater shall be designed in conformance with Chapter
38 of the Outagamie County Code of Ordinances.
(h) New development sites located near a closed depression and/
or flood-prone area shall be designed to provide a minimum
one foot of vertical separation between the lowest ground
surface elevation at the building's perimeter and the overland
relief elevation for the flood-prone area. Outagamie County
and the Town of Grand Chute maintain a flood-prone area map
to assist with identifying higher risk areas. If less than one foot
of vertical separation is provided, a detailed stormwater
analysis shall be performed to identify and reasonably manage
one-hundred-year flooding risks for buildings or structures
located within the flood-prone area.
(i) Agricultural production areas shall meet the intent of this
article by following the BMPs listed in the Town of Grand Chute
Stormwater Reference Guide.

acre or more of land disturbance:
[1] Low imperviousness. For development with up to 40%
connected imperviousness, such as parks, cemeteries, and
low-density residential development, infiltrate sufficient
runoff volume so that the post-development infiltration
volume shall be at least 90% of the pre-development
infiltration volume, based on an average annual rainfall.
However, when designing appropriate infiltration systems
to meet this requirement, no more than 1% of the postconstruction
site is required as an effective infiltration
area.
[2] Moderate imperviousness. For development with more
than 40% and up to 80% connected imperviousness, such
as medium- and high-density residential, multifamily
development, industrial and institutional development,
and office parks, infiltrate sufficient runoff volume so that
the post-development infiltration volume shall be at least
75% of the pre-development infiltration volume, based on
an average annual rainfall. However, when designing
appropriate infiltration systems to meet this requirement,
no more than 2% of the post-construction site is required
as an effective infiltration area.
[3] High imperviousness. For development with more than
80% connected imperviousness, such as commercial
districts and retail centers, infiltrate sufficient runoff
volume so that the post-development infiltration volume
shall be at least 60% of the pre-development infiltration
volume, based on an average annual rainfall. However,
when designing appropriate infiltration systems to meet
this requirement, no more than 2% of the post-
§ 463-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 463-19

using BMPs from the Town of Grand Chute Stormwater
Reference Guide.
(f) When designing BMPs, runoff draining to the BMP from off-site
areas shall be taken into account in determining the
performance of the practice. Any impact on the BMP
performance shall be compensated for by increasing the size of
the BMP accordingly. The runoff volume reduction provided by
the BMP for an off-site area shall not be used to satisfy the
required on-site runoff volume reduction unless otherwise
approved by the administering authority, in accordance with
§ 463-19E of this article.
(g) Pretreatment. Before infiltrating runoff, pretreatment shall be
required for parking lot runoff and for runoff from road
construction in commercial, industrial and institutional areas
that will enter an infiltration system. The pretreatment shall be
designed to protect the infiltration system from clogging prior
to scheduled maintenance and to protect groundwater quality
in accordance with § 463-19C(3)(n). Pretreatment options may

green roofs where an equivalent portion of the runoff is
captured permanently by rooftop vegetation, such alternate
use shall be given equal credit toward the infiltration volume
required in § 463-19C(3) of this article.
(n) Groundwater standards.
[1] Infiltration systems designed in accordance with
§ 463-19C(3) shall, to the extent technically and
economically feasible, minimize the level of pollutants
infiltrating to groundwater and shall maintain compliance
with the preventive action limit at a point of standards
application in accordance with Ch. NR 140, Wis. Adm.
Code. However, if site-specific information indicates that
compliance with a preventive action limit is not
achievable, the infiltration BMP may not be installed or
shall be modified to prevent infiltration to the maximum
extent practicable.
[2] Notwithstanding the provisions in § 463-19C(3)(n)[1], the
discharge from BMPs shall remain below the enforcement
standard at the point of standards application.
(o) Where the requirements in § 463-19C(3)(h) through (l) limit or

topographic map, or a county soil survey map, whichever
is more current: 50 feet.
[3] For lakes: 50 feet.
[4] For highly susceptible wetlands: 75 feet. Highly
susceptible wetlands include the following types:
calcareous fens, sedge meadows, open and coniferous
bogs, low prairies, coniferous swamps, lowland hardwood
swamps, and ephemeral ponds.
[5] For less susceptible wetlands: 10% of the average wetland
width, but no less than 10 feet nor more than 30 feet. Less
susceptible wetlands include: degraded wetlands
dominated by invasive species such as reed canary grass;
cultivated hydric soils; and any gravel pits, or dredged
material or fill material disposal sites that take on the
attributes of a wetland.
[6] For all other wetlands not subject to the characterization
in § 463-19C(4)(a)[4] or [5]: 50 feet.
[7] For concentrated flow channels with drainage areas
greater than 130 acres: 10 feet.
[8] Notwithstanding the provisions in § 463-19C(4)(a)[1]
through [7], the greatest protective area width shall apply
where rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands are contiguous.
(b) Wetlands shall be delineated. Wetland boundary delineations
shall be made in accordance with § NR 103.08(1m), Wis. Adm.
Code. The wetland delineator shall be approved by the
administering authority. The requirements in § 463-19C(4) do
not apply to wetlands that have been completely filled in
compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations.
The protective area for wetlands that have been partially filled
in compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations
shall be measured from the wetland boundary delineation after
fill has been placed. Where there is a legally authorized
wetland fill, the protective area standard need not be met in
that location.
(c) Determinations of the extent of the protective area adjacent to
wetlands shall be made on the basis of the sensitivity and
runoff susceptibility of the wetland, in accordance with the
standards and criteria in § NR 103.03, Wis. Adm. Code.
(d) The requirements in § 463-19C(4) apply to all postconstruction
sites located within a protective area, except

area entirely or to the maximum extent practicable. If
there is no practical alternative to locating an impervious
surface in the protective area, the stormwater
management plan shall contain a written, site-specific
explanation.
[2] Where land disturbing construction activity occurs within
a protective area, adequate sod or self-sustaining
vegetative cover of 70% or greater shall be established
and maintained in areas where no impervious surface is
present. The adequate sod or self-sustaining vegetative
cover shall be sufficient to provide for bank stability,
maintenance of fish habitat, and filtering of pollutants
from upslope overland flow areas under sheet flow
conditions. Nonvegetative materials, such as rock riprap,
may be employed on the bank as necessary to prevent
erosion, such as on steep slopes or where high velocity
flows occur.
[3] BMPs such as filter strips, swales, or wet detention ponds,
which are designed to control pollutants from nonpoint
sources, may be located in the protective area.
(f) A protective area established or created after January 1, 2005,
shall not be eliminated or reduced, except as allowed in
§ 463-19C(4)(g)[2], [3], or [4] in this article.
(g) Exemptions. The following areas are not required to meet the
protective area requirements in § 463-19C(4):

of a fence on a property zoned or used for single-family
residential or two-family residential purposes is not
required to meet the protective area requirements in
§ 463-19C(4)(a)[4] through [6]; however, any such fence
shall be constructed and placed a minimum distance of one
foot from any wetland boundary delineation.
(5) Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas. Fueling and vehicle
maintenance areas shall have BMPs designed, installed and
maintained to reduce petroleum within runoff, so that the runoff
that enters waters of the state contains no visible petroleum sheen,
or to the maximum extent practicable.
(6) Swale treatment for transportation facilities. Except for
transportation facilities that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale, the following requirements shall be met:
(a) Requirement. Except as provided in § 463-19C(6)(b),
transportation facilities that use swales for runoff conveyance
and pollutant removal are exempt from the requirements of
§ 463-19C(1) through (3), if the swales are designed to do all of
the following, or to the maximum extent practicable:
[1] Swales shall be vegetated. However, where appropriate,
nonvegetative measures may be employed to prevent
erosion or provide for runoff treatment, such as rock
riprap stabilization or check dams.
[2] Swales shall comply with the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources Technical Standard 1005, Vegetated
Infiltration Swale, except as otherwise authorized in
writing by the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources.
(b) Other requirements. Notwithstanding the requirements in
§ 463-19C(6)(a), the administering authority may, consistent
with water quality standards, determine that other
requirements, in addition to swale treatment, be met on a
transportation facility with an average daily traffic rate greater
than 2,500 and where the initial surface water of the state at
which the runoff directly enters is any of the following:
[1] An outstanding resource water.
[2] An exceptional resource water.
[3] Waters listed in Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water
Act that are identified as impaired in whole or in part, due
to nonpoint source impacts.

B. Specifications for driveway construction. [Amended 12-20-2011 by
Ord. No. 2011-30; 3-5-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-05]
(1) No driveway shall exceed 30 feet in width at the outer or road edge
of the driveway unless special permission is obtained from the
Director of Public Works.
(2) At road intersections, a driveway shall not provide direct ingress or
egress to or from the road intersection area and shall not occupy
areas of the roadway deemed necessary by the Town Board for
effective traffic control or for highway signs or signals.
(3) No driveway apron shall extend out into the road further than the

B. For the purpose of this section the public roads and alleys are construed
to be the areas as designated by the Town of Grand Chute and recorded
as such in the Town records.
C. The Town Board may prescribe the conditions under which the
excavation shall be made, and it shall be the duty of the Director of
Public Works, under the direction of the Town Board, to see that the
person doing the excavating complies with such conditions. The Town
Board may, in its discretion, require a performance bond from the
excavator conditioned upon his faithfully carrying out the terms under

imposed upon him for any violation of any rule, regulation or ordinance
governing road openings or drain laying adopted by the Town Board
and will repair any damage done to existing improvements during the
progress of the excavation in accordance with the ordinances, rules
and regulations of the Town. Such bond shall also guarantee that if
the Town shall elect to make the road repair, the person opening the
road will pay all costs of making such repair and of maintaining the
same for one year. Recovery on such bond for any accident, injury, or
violation of law, ordinance, rule or regulation shall not exhaust the bond
but it shall cover any and all accidents, injuries or violations during
the period of excavation for which it is given. An annual bond may
be given under this section covering all excavation work done by the
principal for one year beginning January 1, which shall be conditioned
as specified above and in the amount determined by the Town Board as
necessary to adequately protect the public and the Town.

where necessary as determined by the Director of Public Works.
(2) Removal of paving. In opening any road or other public way, all
paving or blasting materials shall be removed with the least
possible loss of or damage to surfacing material and together with
the excavated material from trenches shall be placed so as to cause
the least practicable inconvenience to the public and permit free
flow of water along gutters and ditches.
(3) Protection of public. Each excavation shall be enclosed with
sufficient barriers to alert and protect the public from this hazard
in the roads or public ways of the Town. All machinery and
equipment shall be locked or otherwise effectively safeguarded
from unauthorized use when not being used by the permittee, his
agents or employees. Warning lights shall be kept burning from
sunset to sunrise, one warning light to be placed at each end of the
opening in the road or public way and other warning lights in a
number approved by the Director of Public Works and properly
spaced to give adequate advance warning. Except by special
permission from the Director of Public Works, no trench shall be

§ 468-3. Excavation in new road limited; emergency excavations.128
Whenever the Town Board determines to provide for the permanent
improvement or repaving of any road, such determination shall be made not
less than 30 days before the work of improvement or repaving shall begin.
Immediately after such determination by the Town Board, the Director of
Public Works shall notify in writing each person, utility, Town department,
including sanitary and utility districts, or other agency owning or
controlling any sewer, water main, conduit or other utility in or under said
road or any real property abutting said road that all such excavation work
in such road must be completed within 30 days. After such permanent
improvement or repaving, no permit shall be issued to open, cut or excavate
said road for a period of five years after the date of improvement or
repaving unless, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, an
emergency exists which make it absolutely essential that the permit be
issued. In the event of an emergency, any person owning or controlling
excavated more than 250 feet in advance of pipe laying nor left
unfilled more than 500 feet where pipe has been laid. All necessary
precautions shall be taken to guard the public effectually from
accidents or damage to persons or property through the period of
the work. Each person making such opening shall be held liable for
all damages, including costs incurred by the Town in defending any
action brought against it for damages, as well as cost of any appeal,
that may result from the neglect by such person or his employees
of any necessary precaution against injury or damage to persons,
vehicles or property of any kind.
(4) Replacing road surface. In opening any road or sidewalk, the
paving materials, sand, gravel and earth or other material moved
or penetrated and all surface monuments or hubs must be removed
and replaced as nearly as possible in their original condition or
position and the same relation to the remainder as before. Any
excavated material which, in the opinion of the Director of Public
Works, is not suitable for refilling shall be replaced with approved
backfill material. All rubbish shall be immediately removed, leaving
the street or sidewalk in perfect repair, the same to be so
maintained for a period of one year. In backfilling the opening, the
earth must be placed in layers not more than six inches in depth
and each layer compacted or tamped to prevent after-settling.
When the sides of the trench will not stand perpendicular,
sheathing and braces must be used to prevent caving. No timber,
bracing, lagging, sheathing or other lumber shall be left in any
trench. The Town may elect to have the Town make the pavement
repair for any road or sidewalk opening, in which case the cost of
making such repair and of maintaining it for one year shall be
charged to the person making the road opening.

succeeding business day and shall not make any permanent repairs without
first obtaining permit hereunder.

mailbox and boxes installed for the delivery of newspapers.
B. Obstructions and encroachments.
(1) No person, persons, partnership, company or corporation shall

part thereof, or permit such encroachment or encumbrance to be
placed or remain on any public way adjoining the premises of which
he is the owner or occupant.
(2) Any existing structure, sign, fence, wall, pavement or other
obstruction (including trees) which, in the judgment of the Town,
will prevent proper snow removal from the pavement and
shoulders or mowing of the ditches of the Town roadway shall be
removed by the owner or occupant of the adjacent property within
15 days of receiving written notice from the Town. If the owner or
occupant does not remove said structure or obstruction within the

the duty of every owner of such tree, shrub, bush, hedge or
vegetation to remove such obstruction.
(2) The Town of Grand Chute shall have the right to prune any tree or
shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread
of light along the street from a streetlight, or interferes with
visibility of any traffic control device or sign, or interferes with the
vision of traffic vehicle operators at any street intersection. Any
tree, shrub, bush, hedge or other vegetation of any kind that

or Town law enforcement officers shall take the following action:
(a) Hazardous conditions. If the Street Superintendent or Town
law enforcement officer determines that the failure to remove
the snow and ice from the sidewalk creates an immediate
danger to the public health and/or safety, he/she shall cause
the issuance of a written notice to the owner, occupant or
person in charge of any parcel or lot directing that the snow
and ice be removed within two hours from the delivery of the
notice. In the event that the property owner, occupant or
person in charge of said parcel or lot is unavailable to receive a
written notice, the Street Superintendent or police officer shall
immediately cause the removal of the snow and/or ice. The
Street Superintendent or police officer shall send a written
notice to the last known address of the property owner
§ 468-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 468-7
1:399
notifying the owner that a hazardous condition existed which
required immediate abatement.
(b) Nonhazardous conditions. If the owner, occupant or person in
charge of the subject parcel or lot fails to remove the snow
within the time period established in Subsection A(1), the
Street Superintendent or police officer shall cause the issuance
of a written notice to said owner, occupant or person in charge
of the subject parcel or lot directing the responsible person (as
defined) to remove said snow and ice no later than 12:00 noon
of the day following the issuance of said notice. The written
notice shall be hand delivered when possible or mailed to the
last known address of the owner of the subject property as
identified on the records in the Town Assessor's office.
(c) Snow and ice not to encroach. In accordance with § 398-5, no
person shall push, blow, shove or in any way deposit any snow
or ice onto any public street, alley, sidewalk or public lands
dedicated to public use.
(3) Enforcement. The Street Superintendent, his designees and all
sworn police officers are hereby authorized and directed to enforce
the provisions of this section.
(4) Continued violations. Each twenty-four-hour period where a
violation occurs shall constitute a separate offense under this
section for enforcement purposes. Repeated violations or
subsequent additional accumulations of snow and/or ice shall not
nullify any pending notice issued under this section.
(5) Abatement after notice. Failure of the owner, occupant or person in
charge of any parcel or lot to cause the removal of snow and/or ice
within the time established under Subsection A(2)(a) and (b) after
receiving a written notice shall result in the Street Superintendent
causing the removal of said snow and/or ice.
(6) Expense. An account of the expenses incurred by the Town to abate
the snow and/or ice hazard shall be kept, and such expenses shall
be charged to and paid by the parcel or lot owner. Notice of the bill
for the removal of snow and/or ice shall be mailed to the last known
address of the owner of the parcel or lot and shall be payable within
30 calendar days from the receipt thereof. Any unpaid costs and
expenses that remain after 30 days shall carry an interest charge of
12%. Repeat violations shall be subject to a charge which is double
the actual costs to abate the snow and/or ice hazard. Any costs not
paid by October 1 in any year shall be entered onto the tax roll by
the Town Clerk as a special tax as provided by § 66.0907(5), Wis.

(7) Penalty. In addition to the provisions set forth in this section, any
person, firm or corporation who or which violates the provisions of
this section shall be subject to a penalty as provided in the Uniform
Forfeiture and Bond Schedules.
B. Sidewalk construction.
(1) Purpose. In order to enhance the safety of pedestrian traffic and
provide an alternative mode of transportation along the Town's
traffic corridors, the Town may approve and direct the construction
of sidewalks on the basis of need, safety, available funds, and
maintenance considerations.
(2) Construction of sidewalks.
(a) Petitioned sidewalks. The Town Board may approve the
construction of sidewalks by resolution after a petition of
abutting property owners. The petition must be signed by the
property owners of more than 50% of all parcels of property
abutting the proposed sidewalk improvement or a sufficient
number of property owners accounting for more than 50% of
the frontage of the abutting properties.
(b) Nonpetitioned sidewalks. The Town Board may elect to
construct sidewalks in designated areas without a petition. The
following general criteria will be considered to determine if
sidewalks will be constructed without a petition. Areas meeting
these criteria will generally receive greater consideration for
sidewalks. However, meeting these criteria does not
necessarily mandate the installation of sidewalks.
[1] Adjoining street is an urbanized state or county highway or
an urbanized Town collector street as indicated on the
Town's road designation map.
[2] Pedestrian destinations are located on the adjoining street
or a reasonable distance that would connect a given area
with pedestrian destinations. Pedestrian destinations may
include the following: schools, including private schools
and post-secondary schools; institutions, such as hospitals,
state or local government buildings, etc.; bus stops;
connections to other planned or designated pedestrian
trails; residential zoned areas; or neighborhood
commercial areas.
[3] Parcels have direct access to adjoining street.
(c) Approval of construction. Based on the petitions received, or
the evaluation of the above criteria set forth in Subsection
B(2)(b) above, the Town Board may direct the construction of
sidewalks on one or both sides of a nonpetitioned street. If one
§ 468-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 468-7
1:401
§ 468-8. Parking lot restrictions.
§ 468-9. New Town roads. [Amended 7-15-2003133]
side is selected for construction, it will generally be the side
that would generate the most pedestrian traffic.
(3) Funding of sidewalk construction.
(a) Petitioned sidewalks. One hundred percent of the cost shall be
special assessed in accordance with the Town's special
assessment policy.132
(b) Nonpetitioned sidewalks: In single-family and two-family
residential zoned areas, the Town shall assume 100% of the
costs of sidewalk construction. In commercial, industrial, and
multifamily residential zoned areas, 100% of the cost shall be
special assessed in accordance with the Town's special
assessment policy.
A. Parking of automobiles or other motorized vehicles on private premises
shall be so regulated as not to interfere with the use of any Town road
or public right-of-way. Where parking lots or areas are located
immediately adjacent to a public road or right-of-way, a physical divider
shall be placed at the edge of the parking lot or area adjacent to the
public road to prevent invasion of the public right-of-way. Points of
ingress or egress to private parking areas shall be plainly marked, and
no single parking area shall have more than one point of ingress or
egress per 100 feet along such public road. The physical barriers shall
not be less than two feet above the parking lot surface. Applications for
variations of the number or distance of points of egress or ingress may
be granted in writing by the Town Board. The owner of any such
premises shall be liable hereunder.
B. Violations of this section shall be punishable by the imposition of a fine
or forfeiture as prescribed in the Uniform Forfeiture and Bond
Schedules for each day of violation. Upon a finding of guilty of a
violation hereunder and failure to pay the forfeiture imposed, said
convicted person may be imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10 days
for each violation.
A. General requirements.
(1) In accordance with § 475-15A and B, the developer shall have an
initial consultation with Town staff and submit a conceptual plan
for review and consideration by the Town of Grand Chute Plan
Commission. The developer or the developer's designee shall
attend the meeting and present the concept plan to Town Plan
132. Editor's Note: See Ch. 57, Art. II, Special Assessments and Charges.

(4) The liability for accident or injury occurring on any proposed
roadway shall be the liability of the owner until both dedication and
deeding are completed and accepted by the Town Board.

§ 468-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 468-9
1:403
Grand Chute for the type of work they are qualified. Any
construction contractor not on the Wisconsin Department of
Transportation list can prequalify pursuant to forms supplied by
the Town of Grand Chute.
(8) The Town Engineer shall have the sole discretion to inspect the
installation of all Town roads during any part of the construction

construction contract.
(1) Following receipt of the application, the Town of Grand Chute Town
Board shall refer the application to the Town of Grand Chute's
Engineer for the preparation of bid documents. No advertisement
for bids will be published until the developer has entered into an
escrow agreement with the Town and deposited cash escrow funds
with the Town in an amount equal to 125% of the total estimated
project costs as determined by the Town Engineer. To assure that
the cash escrow is adequate to cover the cost of the bid to be
awarded, all bid documents shall contain notation that the award of
the bid shall be subject to the developer depositing a cash escrow
with the Town of Grand Chute for 125% of the amount of the
awarded bid and that no contract shall be signed until the required
escrow has been received by the Town of Grand Chute.
(2) The Town of Grand Chute Engineer shall prepare bid documents for
construction of the roadway subgrade, aggregate base course, road
drainageways or curb and gutter and storm sewer, municipal
utilities and lower layer asphalt pavement. The installation cost for
streetlights shall be obtained from the appropriate utility prior to
the award of the bid. The cost for furnishing and installing all
required road signs, including but not limited to stop signs, speed
limit signs, and informational signs, shall be obtained from the
Town of Grand Chute.
(3) Upon receipt of the bid, the developer shall amend the cash escrow
deposit with the Town of Grand Chute to equal 125% of the bid plus
the streetlight installation cost, the cost for all required signs and
their installation, and the Town of Grand Chute engineering and
legal costs. Upon deposit in escrow by the developer of all of the
required costs, the Town Board may move to award said bid.
(4) The Town of Grand Chute shall construct the road in stages upon
completion of Subsection B(1) to (3), with the final paving to be
installed when 70% of available abutting property in the
§ 468-9 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 468-9
1:404
subdivision is developed or within two years, whichever comes
first, but in no case until a minimum of 20% of the abutting land is
developed unless approved the Town Board.
(5) Following construction of the roadway subgrade, aggregate base
course, road drainageways or curb and gutter and storm sewer,
municipal utilities and lower layer asphaltic pavement, the actual
construction costs shall be paid from the cash escrow. A financial
security, acceptable to the Town's Attorney, equal to 20% of the
cash escrow furnished by the developer shall be held for a period of
two years after the required improvements for the applicable phase
have been completed and the road accepted by the Town Board.
This financial security is to guarantee all required improvements
against defects in workmanship and materials. If any defects
appear during the period of the guarantee, the developer shall
install replacements or perform acceptable repairs. In the event
that the developer fails to install the required replacements or
perform the repairs within 21 days of written notification by the
Town, the Town may do so and deduct the cost from the security
deposit, unless the Town Administrator has granted an extension in
writing.
(6) The public improvements and right-of-way dedication shall not be
accepted by the Town without a financial security deposit equal to
20% of the cash escrow amount being held by the Town as a
guarantee against defects in workmanship and materials.
(7) Actual costs of final paving shall be assessed to abutting property
owners by waiver of special assessment proceedings, and all
subdividers of final plats or persons offering a certified survey map
for approval shall be required to enter into a subdivision
improvement agreement relating to final paving and waiver of
special assessment proceedings, a specimen copy of which is on file
in the Town Clerk's office.
(8) Final paving shall be done in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection B(4), and the entire actual construction cost shall be
placed as a special assessment on the tax roll in accordance with
the provisions of Chapter 57, Article II of this Code, except that
§§ 57-8 through 57-11 shall be inapplicable thereto. In addition, the
incorporation herein by reference of § 57-16, Method of payment,
the Town of Grand Chute Policy on Special Assessments, is solely
for the purpose of granting to the subdivider/property owners the
right to pay under annual installments and at the interest rate as
set forth specifically under the Town's special assessment
ordinances and policies.
(9) The street shall be considered an official Town of Grand Chute
street following completion of Subsection B(1) to (4), through the
construction of the lower layer of asphalt pavement, and the public
improvements being accepted by resolution of the Town Board.
§ 468-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 468-9
1:405
Upon acceptance by the Town Board, the Town will perform and
pay for all routine maintenance of the street from that time.
Acceptance of the street by the Town Board does not release the
developer from the responsibility to replace or repair defects in
workmanship or materials that may appear during the period of the
guarantee.
C. Construction of new Town public roads and streets under a private
construction contract.
(1) Prior to the private construction of any Town road or street in the

(c) Twenty percent of the financial guarantee furnished by the
developer shall be held for a period of two years after the
required improvements for the applicable phase have been
completed and the road accepted by the Town Board to
guarantee all required improvements against defects in
workmanship and materials. If any defects appear during the
period of the guarantee, the developer shall install
replacements or perform acceptable repairs. In the event that
the developer fails to install the required replacements or
§ 468-9 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 468-9
1:406
perform the repairs within 21 days of written notification by
the Town, the Town may do so and deduct the cost thereof
from the financial guarantee, unless the Town Administrator
has granted an extension in writing.
(d) The agreement shall include detailed construction plans and
specifications for the proposed public improvements. The
construction plans shall meet the Town requirements
contained in the General Specifications, Town of Grand Chute,
that are in effect at the time of application. The plans shall

the plan review and review of the following: conceptual plan,
preliminary plat, final plat, drainage, street plans and all other
plans required by the Town Board.
(b) The developer shall pay the total project costs. Total project

asphaltic paving, engineering and legal fees applicable to the
project and costs for all required roadway signage and
streetlights. The developer shall pay the Town's Engineer
costs, We Energy costs and any other utility costs related to the
construction of the roadway, as required, which said payments
shall be made directly to the appropriate party. Copies
verifying direct payment of construction costs shall be
provided to the Town. Any and all costs incurred by the Town
for the roadway construction, including engineering,
construction inspection, materials testing and legal fees, shall
be billed by the Town to the developer.
(c) Upon completion of specific items listed as required
improvements, submittal of proof to the Town Engineer of
payment to contractors and acceptance of those improvements
by the Town Board, the Town Engineer will release no more
than 80% of the security furnished for the respective
improvements completed. No more than one reduction in the
amount of security shall be granted on a monthly basis. Upon
acceptance of the road by the Town Board, no less than 20% of
the original financial guarantee amount shall be held by the
Town for the purposes stated in Subsection C(1)(c) of this
section.
(3) The private construction of Town roads as described herein shall
comply with all ordinance requirements and resolution
§ 468-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 468-9
1:407
requirements of the Town, including conceptual plan, preliminary
plat approval and final plat approval.
(4) The road shall be constructed as described herein; however, the
final paving shall be installed when 70% of available abutting
property in the subdivision is developed or within two years,
whichever comes first, but in no case until a minimum of 20% of the
abutting land is developed, unless otherwise approved by the Town
Board. Specifically, in the event a minimum of 20% of the abutting
land is not developed and the two-year time frame has lapsed as
described above, the Town Board, at the Town Board's discretion,
may require final paving of the road in conformity with this section.
The developer shall then be required to construct the road in
conformity with all Town ordinances and resolutions as described
herein. However, the roadway development agreement may
provide for an earlier final paving than the time frames described
above. However, the roadway development agreement shall also
include a waiver that the developer and all owners shall accept full
liability for premature failure of the bituminous paving installation.
Premature failure is defined as displacement or breakup of
bituminous pavement within two years of acceptance of roadway
(through the lower layer of asphaltic pavement) by the Town Board.
(5) If the actual construction costs exceed the financial guarantee of
125% to the Town (as described above), the difference shall be
made up in either of the following ways:
(a) On or before 30 days from the date of notice from the Town to
the developer of a shortfall, the developer shall provide an
increase of financial guarantee to cover the increased costs; or
(b) In the event that the developer does not provide the increased
financial guarantee described above, then the increased cost
amount shall be placed on the tax roll as a special assessment,
which said assessment shall be split equally against all lots
within the affected subdivisions.
(6) At the time of the signing of the roadway development agreement,
the developer and all owners of all real estate properties in the
development shall sign a subdivision improvement agreement
relating to final paving and waiver of a special assessment hearing.
A specimen copy of this subdivision improvement agreement is on
file with the Town Clerk's office. The subdivision improvement
agreement shall include, among other items, that the actual costs
of final paving shall be assessed to abutting property owners by
waiver of assessment proceedings. All subdividers of final plats or
persons offering a certified survey map for approval shall be
required to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement
relating to final paving and waiver of special assessment
proceedings.

(7) In the event that during the roadway construction process the
Town Engineer determines there is inadequate construction or
construction not in conformity with the submitted plans or not in
conformity with the Town's standards and general specifications,
then the Town Engineer shall provide written notice to the
developer. Upon receipt of the written notice, the developer shall
cease all future construction of the road until such time as the
deficiencies are satisfied and corrected as determined by the Town
Engineer. In that event, the developer shall have 15 days to correct
all deficiencies as described herein. In the event that the fifteenday
time frame is not met, then the Town, at the Town's discretion,
shall have the authority to make arrangements to have the
deficiencies corrected, have the roadway properly constructed, and
have the financial guarantees applied to the construction costs.
(8) At such time the developer signs the roadway development
agreement, subdivision improvement agreement, detention/
retention pond maintenance agreement and applicable
streetlighting plan agreement, and at such time the developer
provides satisfactory financial guarantee to the Town as described
above and demonstrates that the property is free from all liens and
encumbrances, and at such time that all public improvements are
substantially complete as approved by the Town Engineer, then the
Town shall execute the final plat for recording.
(9) Final paving shall be done in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection C(4), and the entire actual construction cost shall be
placed as a special assessment on the tax roll in accordance with
the provisions of Chapter 57, Article II of this Code, except that
§§ 57-8 through 57-11 shall be inapplicable thereto. In addition, the
incorporation herein by reference of § 57-16, Method of payment,
the Town of Grand Chute Policy on Special Assessments, is solely
for the purpose of granting to the subdivider/property owners the
right to pay under annual installments and at the interest rate as
set forth specifically under the Town's special assessment
ordinances and policies.
(10) Upon completion of all Town Engineer inspections as described
herein, the Town Engineer shall write a letter recommending
acceptance as a Town road to the Town Board.
A. Any utility, including any public or private utility of any kind or nature,
desiring to construct utility improvements within Town Road right-ofway

and shall be handled as follows:
(1) Poor drainage. Land subject to ponding, poor permeability or poor
drainage, or for other causes as determined by the Plan
Commission or its designated agent, and if said land is not zoned as
a conservancy or wetland-floodplain district on an applicable
zoning district map in which buildings are prohibited, shall be
subject to the following requirements:
(a) If said land is designated as park, parkway, other open space,
or other public use on an official plan of the Town, the
developer may dedicate said land to the Town or county but in
any case must reserve said land for not less than two years for
acquisition by the Town or county.
(b) If said land is not designated as a park, parkway, or other
public use on an official plan, then the developer shall cause
said land to be carried in a private easement in the individual
§ 475-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-9
1:415
deeds affected hereby, and no permit shall be issued for a
building therein.
(c) In lieu of the requirements set forth in Subsection B(1)(a)
above, the developer may, at his expense, prepare a
development proposal for the problem area. It shall be
submitted for the Plan Commission's approval and shall be
accompanied by a site plan and adequate engineering data to
ensure that the public health, safety and welfare will not be
violated if approved and provide a performance guarantee to
the Town to insure that such will be done at a specified time if
approved.
(2) Floodable conditions/drainageways.
(a) If floodplains have been determined and are delineated on an
applicable zoning district map or as determined by the Plan
Commission from sources available to it, the plat shall be
designated accordingly so that all building sites have sufficient
area for the efficient operation of a private disposal system and
so that the lowest floor level of a building shall be two feet
above the normal high-water line.
(b) In designing plats, drainage easements shall be shown on the
final plat where conditions warrant and as determined by the
Plan Commission or as determined by sources available to it,
and building permits shall not be issued therein.
(3) Adverse soil and rock formation:
(a) Soil suitability rating for a proposed subdivision shall be
determined by the Plan Commission from sources available to
it. In order to determine the precise location of soil boundaries,
on-site investigation by soil scientists may be necessary at the
expense of the developer. In areas where no public sewer is
available, this investigation is mandatory and shall be made by
a certified soil tester at the expense of the developer and
according to procedures established by the State Department
of Safety and Professional Services. The minimum lot size
determined by this soil investigation shall supersede the
minimum lot size allowed by Town zoning.
(b) Where soil interpretations determine that a tract of land is
unsuitable for development, the developer may submit a
proposal indicating how the soil problem can be overcome. The
proposal shall include a site plan and adequate engineering
data for approval by the Plan Commission. If this proposal is
approved, the developer shall provide a performance
guarantee to the Town, as required by § 475-15E.

1:426
"This final plat is subject to all of the requirements of
§ 475-15E of the Code of the Town of Grand Chute. The
subdivider, for himself and his assigns, shall be responsible for
all municipal improvements, including asphalt surface streets,
graveled road shoulders or curb and gutter, sewer and water,
sewer lift stations, storm sewers, dedicated clear water
drainage easements, and streetlighting. Pursuant to
§ 475-15E of the Code of the Town of Grand Chute, the Town
of Grand Chute reserves the right to withhold building permits
for this subdivision if the above-stated municipal
improvements have not been completed by the subdivider
according to the terms and conditions of § 475-15E. Utility
connection fees (as listed on the Town Fee Schedule) for
sewer, water and storm services shall be payable by each lot
within the platted subdivision to the Town of Grand Chute
Sanitary Districts. Furthermore, a special streetlighting
charge, in accordance with the procedures listed under
§ 57-21, Special charges for current services, shall be
assessed annually to property owners of each buildable lot
within the subdivision for the energy and facility maintenance
costs of streetlighting within the Town. Any costs due to
streetlighting in excess of the standards within the
streetlighting policy, as requested by the subdivider or
property owners, shall be assessed directly to the abutting
property owners."
(g) The Town Board shall require a subdivider to file with the Town
Clerk a performance guarantee prior to final plat approval to
ensure installation and construction of the municipal
improvements set forth above, to the standards and
specifications required of the Town of Grand Chute. The
performance guarantees are as follows: [Amended
12-20-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-30]
[1] Performance bond, certified check, or other satisfactory
security, payable to the Town.
[2] The performance guarantee shall be 125% of the amount
required to complete all municipal improvements.
[3] If the performance guarantee is cash, it shall be held in an
escrow fund by the Town.
(h) When the subdivider has filed a performance guarantee, and
when any required improvements have been completed and
approved, a portion of the security commensurate with the cost
of these improvements may be released and returned by the
Town Board. Requests for release of a portion of the
performance guarantee shall not occur more than once per
month, and no greater than 80% of the original amount shall be
released prior to acceptance of the municipal improvements.
§ 475-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-15

§ 475-16. Replat.
§ 475-17. Certified survey map.
In the event that a subdivider fails to install all required
municipal improvements in accordance with the recorded final
plat and this chapter, then either the security is forfeited to
the Town to be used for completion of improvements or the
Town of Grand Chute has the right to invoke the performance
bond terms and conditions. If the performance guarantee is
insufficient to complete all municipal improvements without
cost to the Town, the Town of Grand Chute retains the right
to pursue the subdivider/owner and/or performance bond
company for that amount of additional moneys the Town has
been required to expend to complete the subdivider's
obligations and responsibilities under this chapter. [Amended
12-20-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-30]
F. Recording the final plat. After the final plat has been approved by the
Town Board and required improvements either installed or a
performance guarantee insuring their installation is filed, the Town
Clerk shall cause the certificate inscribed upon the plat attesting to
such approval to be duly executed and the plat returned to the
subdivider for recording with the County Register of Deeds. The

ARTICLE III
Design Standards
§ 475-20. Location of site.
§ 475-21. Design of site.
A. General plan. The location and design of all divisions of land must
conform to any applicable Comprehensive Plan.
B. Zoning. The use of land in all divisions of land must conform to any
applicable municipal, Town or county zoning ordinances; however,
larger lots and setbacks may be required where conditions warrant.
C. Objectionable areas. Land subject to hazards of life, health, or property
as may arise from fire, floods, disease, noise, or falling aircraft or
considered to be uninhabitable for other reasons may not be subdivided
for building purposes unless the hazard has been eliminated or the
plans show adequate safeguards correcting the hazards have been
approved by the Town.
D. Nearby development. All divisions of land shall be coordinated with
existing nearby development or neighborhoods so that the area as a
whole shall be developed harmoniously.
A. Natural features.
(1) Preservation. In all divisions of land, care shall be taken to preserve
all natural and historic features which will add attractiveness and
value to the remainder of the land being divided (i.e., trees,
watercourses, views, and historic structures).
(2) Hillside development. Where a division of land is on a site that has
a slope of more than 12%, the Plan Commission may require larger
lot sizes than are zoned and may reduce setback requirements
upon proper appeal.
(3) Water frontage and surface drainage.
(a) The damming, filling or relocating or otherwise interfering
with the natural flow of surface water along any surface water
drainage channel or natural watercourse shall not be
permitted except with approval of the Plan Commission or any
other affected agency. Building setback lines shall be
established no less than 75 feet from the high-water line of any
stream, lake or water body to prevent construction of any
structure other than a dam, bridge, boathouse, retaining wall,
bulkhead or revetments in the setback area.
(b) See Outagamie County Shoreland Ordinance requirements for
lot size, setbacks, well location, location of on-site absorption
systems, etc.
§ 475-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-21
1:433
(4) Planting screens. The Town shall require planting or buffering
easements, extra lot depth or width alongside heavily traveled
highways where lots are backed into the roadway; along zoning
district lines; as buffer strips separating residential zoning districts
from commercial or industrial land uses; as buffer zones along
railroad rights-of-way; or for any such use as may be deemed
appropriate and consistent with the total development of the
community.
B. Street arrangement.
(1) Location principles. The streets shall be properly located and
designed with regard to:
(a) Existing and planned streets.
(b) Topographic conditions.
(c) Public convenience and safety, including facilitating fire
protection and pedestrian traffic.
(d) The proposed uses of land to be served by the streets.
(e) Anticipated traffic volumes.
(f) Further subdivision possibilities with suitable access to
abutting properties.
(g) Any other principles as may be deemed significant to protect
the public interest by the Town.
(2) Coordination of existing street pattern. The arrangement,
character, extent, width, grade, location and engineering
specifications of all streets shall conform to the standards of this
chapter, adopted municipal or county plans and any official
highway maps. If there is Comprehensive Plan or Official Map, the
arrangement of streets in a division of land shall provide for the
continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets into
surrounding areas, subject to topographic conditions, public
convenience, safety, and proposed uses of land to be served. Where
a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, the
Commission may require a street approximately parallel with and
on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also
be determined with regard for the requirements of approach
grades and future grade separations.
(3) Subdivision abutting arterials.
(a) Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed street right-of-way as designed on the Official Map of
the Town, or as may be determined by the Commission,
adequate protection of existing or proposed development,
§ 475-21 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 475-21
1:434
limitation of access and separation of through and local traffic
shall be handled as follows:
[1] Reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a
nonaccess reservation along the rear property line;
[2] By frontage streets; or
[3] By having development front on a perpendicular street to
the primary right-of-way.
(b) When lots within the proposed subdivision back upon the rightof-
way of an existing or proposed limited access highway or a
railroad, a planting easement at least 15 feet in width shall be
provided adjacent to normal lot depth. This easement shall be a
part of the platted lots but shall have the following restriction
lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip reserved for the
planting of trees and shrubs, the building of structures hereon
prohibited."
(c) Streets parallel to a limited access highway or railroad right-ofway,
when intersecting a major street and highway, said
intersection shall be located a minimum distance of 250 feet
from said limited access highway or railroad right-of-way. Such
minimum distance shall be determined with due consideration
of the minimum distance required for the future separation of
grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(4) Street design.
(a) Arterial street. An arterial street provides for movement of
through traffic from one area of the community to another.
(b) Collector street. A collector street carries traffic between
minor streets and arterial streets and also provides access to
abutting properties.
(c) Minor street. A minor street primarily provides access to
abutting properties. It does not serve through traffic and does
not intersect with arterial streets.
(d) Cul-de-sac. Culs-de-sac designed as permanent installations
should not be longer than 1,000 feet, except where
topographical and site conditions warrant an extension, and
will be subject to the approval of the Commission. The closed
end shall have a turnaround with an outside roadway diameter
of at least 96 feet and a street property line diameter of 120
feet for a residential area and a diameter of 135 feet with an
outside roadway diameter of 105 feet in a commercial area.
(Refer to the 2009 International Fire Code and evaluate with
the Community Development Department.)153
§ 475-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-21
1:435
(e) Alley. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial
districts, except that the Commission may waive this
requirement where other definite and assured provision is
made for service access, such as off-street loading and parking,
adequate for the uses proposed. Alleys shall be prohibited in
residential areas unless necessary because of topography or
other exceptional circumstances. The width of the alleys shall
not be less than 30 feet. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided
where possible, but if unavoidable shall be provided with
adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as determined
by the Commission.
(f) Half streets. Half streets shall not be permitted except:
[1] To complete a street, the other half of which is already
dedicated and accepted; or
[2] To conform to the major thoroughfare plan or an Official
Map.
(g) Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets
shall be prohibited except where the control is definitely
placed with the Town under conditions approved by the Plan
Commission.
(5) Intersections.
(a) Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect at right angles.
(b) Intersection approach areas should not exceed a grade of 2%
on all approaching streets for a distance of 50 feet from the
intersecting points of the right-of-way lines.
(c) The minimum turning radius at an intersection shall not be less
than 25 feet.
(d) Proper sight line easements, referred to as vision triangle
areas, shall be maintained at all street intersections; measured
along the intersecting right-of-way lines, there shall be a clear
sight triangle easement with two sides as follows: state and
federal highways, as defined by the WDOT Facilities
Development Manual; arterial streets, 60 feet; collector
streets, 60 feet; and minor streets, 25 feet. No visual
obstructions, such as but not limited to structures, parking,
fencing or vegetation, shall be permitted in any district
between the heights of 2 1/2 feet and 10 feet above the mean
edge of pavement grade within the limits of this area. See the
illustration. [Amended 3-5-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-06]
153. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 475-21 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 475-21
1:436
(e) The distance between intersections of minor or collector
streets with arterials should not be less than 800 feet, and they
shall be in alignment with existing and planned streets
entering the arterial from the opposite side, unless approved
by the Town Board. In no case shall intersection center lines be
offset less than 125 feet.
(6) Street grades.
(a) Streets shall have a minimum center-line grade of 0.5% and
shall not exceed grades specified as follows; these figures can
be adjusted where deemed necessary by the Town:
[1] Arterial and collector streets: 6% maximum.
[2] Minor street: 10% maximum.
(b) All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical
curves of minimum length equivalent in feet to 15 times the
algebraic difference in the rates of grade for major streets and
1/2 this minimum for all other streets.
(7) Width. All street rights-of-way shall be the width specified by local
ordinance. Where no local or county ordinance applies, the
provisions of § 236.15(2), Wis. Stats., shall apply and the
Commission shall impose minimum standards as established by
§ 82.50, Wis. Stats., for improvements on Town roads.
(8) Curves. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets and a fiftyfoot
tangent on minor streets. The minimum radii or curvature on
the center line shall be 300 feet minimum radius for arterial
streets, 200 feet minimum radius for collector streets, and 100 feet
minimum radius for minor streets.
C. Easements. Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines
shall be designed for utilities where necessary and shall be at least 15
feet wide. Electric and telephone lines shall be planned along rear lot
lines wherever possible. The Plan Commission shall determine the
feasibility of burying utility lines. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided
a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way not less than 30 feet in
§ 475-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-21
1:437
width, conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourses.
Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.
D. Storm drainage. Storm sewers, culverts and related facilities shall be
designed to permit the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses, ensure
the drainage of all low points along the line of streets, and provide
positive drainage away from on-site sewage disposal facilities. Storm
drainage facilities must be designed not only to handle the anticipated
peak discharge from the property being subdivided but also the
anticipated increase in runoff that will occur when all the property at a
higher elevation in the same drainage basin is fully developed. Where
adequate existing storm sewers are readily accessible, the subdivider
shall connect his stormwater facilities to these existing sewers. In the
design of storm drainage facilities, special consideration shall be given
to preventing excess runoff onto adjacent property. Where a storm
drainage outlet will abut another property, sufficient and adequate
engineering safeguards shall be designed in the plat to prevent damage
to adjoining property. Sloped drainage channels must be protected
against erosion.
(1) Stormwater retention.
(a) Purposes. The intent of this section is to protect property and
structures from damage caused by increased surface water
runoff due to commercial, industrial and residential
development.
(b) Standards. Surface water runoff after development shall not
exceed the peak rate/volume of flow at predevelopment
conditions. The twenty-five-year frequency storm shall be the
basis to determine both preconstruction and post-construction
surface water runoff.
(c) Plan. A stormwater retention plan shall be submitted with the
preliminary plat. The plan shall be designed, stamped and
signed by a registered professional engineer. The plan shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
[1] Soil types, infiltration characteristics of the soil, amount of
available detention area, type of vegetative cover, amount
of impervious cover and time response to runoff.
[2] The plan shall be compatible with natural drainageways
and existing man-made drainageways and easements.
[3] The plan shall identify bridges, regional drainage patterns,
water boundaries, pipes, culverts, catch basins,
waterways, ditches, and detention and retention basins
and indicate respective size, dimensions and grades of
each.
§ 475-21 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 475-21
1:438
[4] All drainageways and associated structures shall lie within
maintenance easements and such easements shall be
shown on the final plat.
[5] The direction of surface water flow shall be shown by
arrows.
[6] The plan shall be designed in accordance with the United
States Department of Agriculture Technical Release No.
55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds.
[7] The plan shall be accompanied by calculations showing
preconstruction and post-construction surface water
runoff.
[8] A statement shall be included indicating how runoff
resulting from construction will affect downstream areas
and adjacent property owners.
[9] The statement shall indicate methods that will be used to
protect downstream areas and adjacent property owners
from damage caused by increased surface water runoff.
[10] A covenant shall be recorded with the final plat or shall be
placed on the final plat. The covenant shall state that:
[a] Maintenance of all drainageways and associated
structures within the subdivision or serving the
subdivision is the sole responsibility of the property
owners of the subdivision, unless noted on the plan.
[b] Upon failure of the property owners to perform
maintenance of the drainageways and associated
structures; the Township retains the right to perform
maintenance and/or repairs. The payment of said
maintenance and/or repairs shall be equally assessed
among the property owners of the subdivision with a
drainage covenant.
(2) Surface water drainage restrictions. No drainageway contained
within a drainage easement shall be disturbed, except as provided
in Subsection A(3), in accordance with the following:
(a) No artificial obstruction may be constructed, planted or
maintained within any man-made or natural drainageway so
that such obstruction impedes the natural flow of water and/or
diminishes the natural esthetic quality of the drainageway.
(b) Lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with new and/or
preexisting man-made and natural drainageways to avoid the
creation of lots that can be built upon by altering such
drainageways.
§ 475-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 475-21
1:439
(c) Exceptions. Surface water shall not be regarded as unduly
retained or diverted if:
[1] The retention or diversion results from a technique,
practice or device deliberately installed as part of an
approved sedimentation or stormwater runoff control plan.
[2] The retention or diversion is not substantially different in
location or degree than that experienced by the
development site in its predevelopment stage, unless such
a retention presents a danger to health or safety.
[3] The retention or diversion results from the actions of
natural obstructions, whereby maintenance shall be
performed by the property owners as described in
Subsection D(1)(c)[10].
[4] The retention or diversion has been allowed or required by
the Plan Commission or the Town Board and noted on the
approved drainage plan.154
E. Sanitary sewers. In areas that have a sanitary sewer system on or near
the proposed subdivision, the Town Sanitary District shall determine
the feasibility of service and the requirements to be followed by the
subdivider. In areas that are not to be served by a sewer system, on-site
subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be permitted only where soil

H. Penalty for violation of this section.
(1) Any person who shall violate any provision of this section shall,

A. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, unless otherwise expressly
stated, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings
respectively ascribed to them as follows:
HIGHWAY  As defined in § 340.01(22), Wis. Stats., all public ways and
thoroughfares and bridges on the same. It includes the entire width
between the boundary lines of every way open to the use of the public
as a matter of right for the purposes of vehicular travel. It includes
those roads or driveways in the state, county or municipal parks and in
state forests which have been opened to the use of the public for the
purpose of vehicular travel and roads or driveways upon the grounds
of public schools, as defined in § 115.01(1), Wis. Stats., and institutions
under the jurisdiction of the County Board of Supervisors, but does
not include private roads or driveways as defined in § 340.01(46), Wis.
Stats.
170. Editors Note: This ordinance also redesignated former Subsection G as Subsection H.
§ 515-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 515-16
1:499
MEDIAN  An area dividing opposing lanes of traffic, excluding turn
lanes. They can be comprised of raised islands or surface level
pavement marking and may also encompass pedestrian safety zones.
PEDESTRIAN  As defined in § 340.01(43), Wis. Stats., any person
afoot or any person in a wheelchair, either manually or mechanically
propelled, or other low-powered, mechanically propelled vehicle
designed specifically for use by a physically disabled person, but does
not include any person using an electric personal assistive mobility
device.
PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ZONE  A raised island or median that divides a
highway at an intersection or pedestrian crosswalk, usually separating
opposing lanes of traffic, and offering refuge to pedestrians attempting
to cross the highway, thereby allowing them to identify adequate gaps
in a single direction of traffic before completing a crossing. Pedestrian
safety zones are typically constructed at locations where speed and/or
volume of traffic make crossing hazardous or the number of traffic lanes
increases a pedestrian's exposure to traffic.
ROADWAY  As defined in § 340.01(54), Wis. Stats., that portion of
a highway between the regularly established curblines or that portion
which is improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel,

(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the
statutory provisions of Ch. 346, Wis. Stats., describing and defining
regulations and responsibilities with respect to presence of
pedestrians on highways, excluding penalties to be imposed, are
hereby adopted and by reference made a part of this section as if
fully stated herein. Any future amendments, revisions, or
modifications of the statutes incorporated herein are intended to be
made part of this section.
C. To minimize the potential for conflict arising from a driver's obligation
to yield to a pedestrian lawfully crossing a highway, which includes
reducing speed or stopping if necessary, to avoid endangering, colliding
with or interfering in any way with pedestrian travel, no pedestrian
shall loiter or be dilatory in crossing the highway once traffic has
yielded the right-of-way.
(1) Pedestrians may pause at a pedestrian safety zone located at an
intersection or crosswalk, or a median being utilized for the same
purpose, but must be expeditious in continuing across the
remaining roadway once they have secured the right-of-way and an
adequate gap exists to complete the crossing.
(2) It shall be deemed a violation of this section if a pedestrian fails to
complete a crossing and remains in a pedestrian safety zone or on a

§ 523-8. Service contract.
(1) The Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 1 is required to own
all water mains on private property which are, or in the future may
become, connected to the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District
No. 1 distribution system at more than one point, thereby allowing
possible backflow through the public water system. See Ch. NR
811, Wis. Adm. Code. An acceptable alternative to this subsection
is the requirement that the private user emplace inspection vaults
and check valves at the locations on the private water distribution
system where the water distribution mains connect to the Town of
Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 1 system. Therefore, any private
distribution system under Ch. NR 811, Wis. Adm. Code, above
referenced, shall require the owner of the private distribution
system to install inspection vaults and check valves that will
prevent backflow to the public distribution system. The private
distribution system shall remain under the ownership of the
nonmunicipal person or entity. All costs applicable to installation
and the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 1 Engineer's
inspection of the vault and check valves, including any engineering
plans, specifications and Department of Natural Resources
approvals (cost associated therewith), will be borne by the owner of
the private distribution system.
(2) The owner or authorized agent of any private water distribution
system within the Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 1 that
serves two or more premises shall perform a full leak detection
survey every four years and submit a report of the findings to the
Sanitary District. Said survey must be performed by a contractor
approved by the Sanitary District and include all, but not limited to,
hydrants, valves and curb stops within the private distribution
system. All existing private water distribution systems within the
Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District No. 1 that serve two or more
premises shall have the survey completed and submit a report
detailing the findings of the survey to the Sanitary District within
nine months of the approval of this subsection and every four years
thereafter. Any leak discovered by the distribution system surveys
shall be repaired within 14 days of its discovery and the repair
inspected by the Towns plumbing inspector. All costs associated
with the survey and/or leak repairs will be borne by the owner of
the private distribution system. Estimated water loss from
discovered leaks shall be charged to the customer in accordance
with § 523-16
(3) Failure to conduct the survey or file reports as required by this
Subsection F is considered a violation of the provisions of this
chapter and shall subject violating property owners to citation and
forfeitures as listed in the Towns Uniform Forfeiture and Bond
Schedule, each day of delinquency constituting a separate offense
subject to citation.
§ 523-7 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 523-8

§ 523-9. Temporary metered supply, meter and deposits.
An applicant for temporary water supply on a metered basis shall make and
maintain a monetary deposit as prescribed in the Town Fee Schedule for
each meter installed as security for payment for use of water and for such
other charges which may arise from the use of the supply. The charge for
setting the valve and furnishing and setting the meter will be as prescribed
in the Town Fee Schedule. Water usage will be billed at present rates.
§ 523-10. Water for construction.
A. The minimum service contract shall be one year unless otherwise
specified by special contract or in the applicable rate schedule. Where a
customer, at his request, has been disconnected prior to expiration of
his minimum contract period and his account is not delinquent and
where thereafter he requests the reconnection of service in the same
location, a reconnection charge as prescribed in the Town Fee
Schedule, payable in advance, shall be collected. The minimum contract
period is renewed with each reconnection.
B. A reconnection charge as prescribed in the Town Fee Schedule shall
also be required from consumers whose services are disconnected
because of nonpayment of bills when due (not including disconnection
for failure to comply with deposit or guarantee rules).
C. A consumer shall be considered as the same consumer provided that
the reconnection is requested for the same location by any member of
the same family or, if a place of business, by any officer of the same
business.
A. When water is wanted for construction purposes, or for filling cisterns,
tanks or tank wagons, steam tractors or rollers, or portable steam
boilers, an application therefor shall be made to the Superintendent, in
writing, upon an application form provided for that purpose in the
Water Department office, giving a statement of the amount of
construction work to be done or the size of the cistern, boiler, tank or
tank wagon to be filled. Payment for the water shall be made in advance
at the scheduled rates. For construction, the service must be drawn. No
temporary connection with the service pipe at the curb stop shall be
made without special permission from the Superintendent.
B. In no case will any employee of the Utility turn on water for
construction work unless the contractor first presents a permit. Upon
completion of the construction work, the contractor must return the
original permit to the Water Department, together with a statement of
the actual amount of construction work performed.
C. Consumers shall not allow contractors, masons or other persons to take
water from their premises without first showing a permit from the
Department. Any consumer failing to comply with this provision is

§ 523-11. Use of hydrants for construction.
§ 523-12. Operation of valves and hydrants; unauthorized use of
water.
Any person who shall, without permission from the Superintendent, allow
contractors, masons, or other unauthorized persons to take water from their
premises, operate any valve connected with the street or supply mains, or
open any fire hydrant connected with the distribution system, except for the
purpose of extinguishing fire, or who shall wantonly injure or impair the
same shall be subject to a fine as prescribed in the Uniform Forfeiture and
Bond Schedules, plus he shall pay for repair of the damage he has caused.
§ 523-13. Refunds of monetary deposits.
All moneys deposited as security for payment of charges arising from the
use of temporary water supply on a metered basis, or for the return of a
sprinkling valve wheel or reducer, if the water is used on an unmetered
subject to having his water service discontinued, fines, and other
penalties.
A. In cases where no other supply is available, permission may be granted
by the Superintendent to use a hydrant. No hydrant shall be used until
it is equipped with a sprinkling valve. A charge as prescribed in the
Town Fee Schedule will be made for setting a valve or for moving it
from one hydrant to another. In no case shall any valve be moved except
by a member of the Water Department.
B. The Water Utility has invested a sum of money in excess of $200 for
purchase of the hydrant, valve and meter. To help assure the Utility that
this valve or meter is not lost while in the possession of a contractor, a
deposit as prescribed in the Town Fee Schedule is requested. If the
meter or valve becomes damaged or lost, the deposit will be used
towards repair or replacement and will cover the insurance deductible.
(See additional charges PSC report.)
C. Before a meter is set, payment must be made for its setting and for the
water to be used at the scheduled rates. When the contractor has
finished using the hydrant, he must notify the Water Department to that
effect. The minimum charge for the use of water from a hydrant will be
as prescribed in the Town Fee Schedule, exclusive of the deposit. (See
additional charges PSC report.)
D. In the use of a fire hydrant supply, the hydrant meter will be set at the
proper opening by the Water Department when the sprinkling valve is
set, and the flow of water must be regulated by means of the sprinkling
valve. If the water is to be used through iron pipe connections, all such
pipe installations shall have the swing joint to facilitate quick
disconnection from the fire hydrant.

basis, will be refunded to the depositor on the termination of the use of
depositor and the return of the wheel and reducer in good condition.
§ 523-14. Service connection or water laterals. [Amended
5-18-1999]
§ 523-15. Replacement and repair of service pipe.
A. No water service shall be laid through any trench having cinders,
rubbish, rock or gravel fill, or any other material which may cause
injury to or disintegration of the service pipe, unless adequate means of
protection are provided by sand filling or such other insulation as may
be approved by the Superintendent. Service pipes passing through
masonry shall be adequately safeguarded by provision of a channel
space or pipe casing not less than twice the diameter of the service
connection. The space between the service pipe and channel or pipe
casing shall be filled and lightly caulked with an oakum, mastic cement,
or other resilient material and made impervious to moisture.
B. In backfilling the pipe trench, the service pipe must be protected
against injury by carefully hand tamping sand fill, free from hard lumps,
rocks, stones, or other injurious material, around and at least six inches
over the pipe.
C. All water supplies shall be of undiminished size from the street main in
to the point of meter placement, unless otherwise approved by the
Superintendent. Beyond the meter outlet valve the piping shall be sized
and proportioned to provide, on all floors, at all times, an equitable
distribution of water supply for the greatest probable number of
fixtures or appliances operating simultaneously.
D. The minimum size water service line hereafter installed shall be one
inch in diameter. Service line sizes over one inch in diameter shall be
according to the State Plumbing Code, unless a variance is approved by
the Board.175
E. No building shall be constructed in the Town of Grand Chute, within the
geographical boundaries of the district, after the effective date of this
chapter, unless water service installation for said building is the
installation of copper service from the water main to the curb stop.
Ductile iron pipe or PVC pipe with tracer wire may be substituted for
copper service with the express permission of the Utility
Superintendent.
A. Where the property owner requests that a large service lateral be
installed to replace an existing smaller diameter pipe, he shall pay the
actual cost of the installation. When replacing a water service, in many
cases the existing material has been damaged or has deteriorated

through natural causes. Thus the salvage value is minimal or
nonexistent. It is extremely difficult to determine what the salvage
value really is. To eliminate any conflict over determining the amount
of the salvage value, the Utility has decided not to take a salvage
value into consideration when replacing a water service. [Amended
12-20-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-30]
B. The service pipe from the main to and through the curb stop will be
maintained and kept in repair and, when worn out, replaced at the
expense of the Water Department. The property owner shall maintain
the service pipe from the curb stop to the point of use and can be billed
for any water which has not passed through the meter and has been
wasted by leakage or defective pipes and fixtures, as estimated by the
Superintendent.
C. If a consumer fails to repair a leaking or broken service pipe from curb
stop to point of metering or use within such time as may appear
reasonable to the Superintendent after notification has been served on
the consumer by the Superintendent, the water will be shut off and will
not be turned on again until the repairs have been completed.
A. Water losses that occur between the main in the street and the curb
stop box are the responsibility of the Utility and may not be charged to
the customer. The property owner has the responsibility for repair or
replacement of the service piping from the curb stop to a point of
metering, and the Utility is responsible for repair and replacement from
the main through the curb stop. Water will be shut off after notification
by the Superintendent that repair is required and will not be turned on
again until repairs have been completed.
B. If a leak is not reported to the Utility, all investigation charges shall be
billed, along with water wasted estimates by Superintendent, to the
contractor who signed the permit.
C. Water losses that occur on the premises which are registered by the
water meter shall be the responsibility of the customer and should be
billed at the filed rate of the Utility. The Water Utility shall inform each
customer at least once each year that it is the sole responsibility of the
customer to prevent leakage in all piping and fixtures on the premises
at and beyond the metering point and that any leaks or other losses of
water registered by the meter will be billed at the filed rate.
D. Water losses from a leak found in a customer's appliance or plumbing
shall be estimated and billed to the customer at a rate not less than the
Utility's cost. [Section PSC 185.35(6), Wis. Adm. Code.] [Amended

1:524
§ 523-18. Stop boxes.
The consumer shall protect the stop box and shall keep the same free from
dirt and other obstructions. The Utility shall not be liable for failure to
locate the stop box and shut off the water in case of a leak on the consumer's
premises.
§ 523-19. Installation of meters. [Amended 7-15-1997]
A. Frozen services shall be thawed by and at the expense of the Water
Department except where the freezing was caused by contributory fault
or negligence on the part of the consumer, such as undue exposure of
the piping in the building or on the consumer's property or failure to
comply with Water Department specifications and requirements as to
depth of service, lack of sufficient backfill, etc.
B. Following the freezing of a service, the Water Department shall take
such steps and issue such instructions as may be necessary to prevent
the refreezing of the same service. No charge will be made for
rethawings if the instructions were followed. In case it is necessary to
allow the water to flow to prevent refreezing, the consumer must make
provision for proper disposal of the wastewater.
C. For the period in which the water is allowed to run, the consumer will
be billed according to his meter readings, but in no event to exceed the
average amount paid in the corresponding billing periods of the
previous two years. A new consumer will be charged the average bill for
other customers of the same class receiving service under comparable
conditions.
A. Meters and outside reading devices will be furnished and placed by the

Schedule176 in addition to reinstallation charges at Wisconsin
Public Service Commission rates.
(3) Where the meter has been removed by someone other than the
Town of Grand Chute Sanitary District personnel, reinstallation
shall also require the payment of a tampering fee as set forth on the
Town of Grand Chute's Bond Schedule and fees for surreptitious
use of water (see § 523-27).
(4) All fees are due prior to reinstallation of the meter.

his work.
§ 523-23. Failure to read meters.
§ 523-24. Complaint meter tests.177
If a customer requests, the Water Department shall promptly make an
accuracy test in addition to the periodic or installation test if 24 months or
more have elapsed since the last complaint test of the same meter in the
same location. If less than 24 months has expired, there will be a charge
as prescribed in the Town Fee Schedule, payable in advance. If the meter
is found fast in excess of 3%, any payment that was made for the test will
be refunded and there will be an adjustment for past billings. See §§ PSC

inches in such pipeline) which may later be removed from the insertion
of the meter into the supply line.
B. No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service.
A. Where the Water Department is unable to read a meter after two
successive attempts, the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and
either an estimated bill will be computed or the minimum charge
applied. The difference will be adjusted when the meter is again read,
that is, the bill for the succeeding quarter will include the previous
quarter. Only in unusual cases or where approval is obtained from the
customer shall more than two consecutive estimated bills be rendered.
B. If the meter is damaged (see § 523-27, Surreptitious use of water) or
fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past
year unless there is some reason why the use is not normal. If the
average use cannot be properly employed, the bill will be estimated by
some equitable method.

§ 523-26. Deposit and guarantee rules.
A. Customer deposits.
(1) New residential service. The Utility may require a cash deposit or
other guarantee as a condition of new residential service if, and
only if, the customer has an outstanding account balance with the
Utility which accrued within the last six years and which at the time
of the request for new service remains outstanding and not in
dispute.
(2) Existing residential service. The Utility may require a cash deposit
or other guarantee as a condition of continued service if, and only
if, either or both the following circumstances apply:
(a) Service has been shut off or discontinued within the last 12
months for violation of these rules and regulations or for
nonpayment of a delinquent bill for service which is not in
dispute.
(b) Credit information obtained by the Utility subsequent to the
initial application indicates that the initial application for
service was falsified or incomplete to the extent that a deposit
would be under these rules and regulations.
(3) Commercial and industrial service. If the credit for an applicant for
commercial or industrial service has not been established to the
satisfaction of the Utility, it may be required to make a deposit or
otherwise guarantee to the Utility payment of bills for service.
(4) Conditions of deposit. The customer shall be advised, in writing if
requested, why a deposit or other guarantee is being required. The
deposit for a new residential service customer, commercial
customer or industrial customer shall not exceed the highest
estimated gross bill for any two consecutive months selected by the
Utility. The deposit for an existing residential customer shall not
exceed the highest actual gross bill for any two consecutive months
selected by the Utility within the preceding twelve-month review
period. Deposits shall bear simple interest at the legal rate, payable
from the date of deposit to the date of refund or discontinuance of
service, whichever is earlier.
(5) Refund of deposits. The Utility shall review the payment record of
each residential customer with a deposit on file at not less than
twelve-month intervals and shall not require or continue to require
a deposit unless a deposit could be required under the conditions
stated above. In the case of a commercial or industrial customer,
§ 523-25 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 523-26
1:528
the Utility shall refund the deposit after 24 consecutive months of
prompt payment if the customer's credit standing is satisfactory to
the Utility. Payment shall be considered "prompt" if it is made prior
to notice of disconnection for nonpayment of a bill not in dispute.
Any deposit or portion thereof refunded to a customer shall be
refunded by check unless both the customer and the Utility agree
to credit the regular bill or unless service is terminated, in which
case the deposit with accrued interest shall be applied to the final
bill and any balance returned to the customer promptly.
(6) Other conditions. A new or additional deposit may be required upon
reasonable written notice of the need therefor if such new or
additional deposit could have been required under the
circumstances when the initial deposit was made. Service may be
refused or disconnected for failure to pay a deposit request as
provided in the rules. When service has been disconnected for
failure to comply with the terms of a deferred payment agreement
and satisfactory arrangements have been made to have service
restored, a reconnection charge as specified elsewhere in these
rules shall be paid by the customer as a condition to restoration of
service.
(7) Guarantee contracts.
(a) The Utility may accept, in lieu of a cash deposit, a contract
signed by a guarantor satisfactory to the Utility whereby
payment of a specified sum not exceeding the cast deposit
requirement is guaranteed. The term of a guarantee contract
shall be two years but shall automatically terminate after the
customer has closed his account or at the guarantor's request
upon 30 days' written notice to the Utility.
(b) Upon termination of a guarantee contract or whenever the
Utility deems the same insufficient as to amount or surety, a
cash deposit or a new additional guarantee may be required
upon reasonable written notice to the customer. Service to any
customer who fails to comply with these requirements may be
refused or, upon eight days' written notice, disconnected.
(c) The Utility shall mail the guarantor copies of all disconnection
notices sent to the customer whose account he has guaranteed
unless the guarantor waives such notice in writing.
(d) In lieu of a cash deposit or guarantee, an applicant for new
service who has an outstanding account accrued within the last
six years with the Utility shall have the right to receive service
from the Utility under a deferred payment agreement as
provided in these rules and regulations for the outstanding
account balance.
(e) In the event that the Water Department is not able to collect
any bill for water service even though deposit and guarantee

When premises are to be vacated, the Water Department shall be notified in
writing at once so that it may remove the meter and shut off the supply at
the curb stop. The owner of the premises shall be liable to prosecution for
any damage to the property of the Water Department by reason of failure to
notify the Water Department of vacancy.
§ 523-29. Repairs to mains.
The Water Department reserves the right to temporarily shut off the water
in the mains to make repairs, alterations or additions to the plat or system.
When circumstances permit, the Water Department will give notification,
by newspaper publication or otherwise, of the discontinuance of the supply.
No rebate will be allowed to customers for such temporary suspension of
supply.
§ 523-30. Protection of public safety.
When the Water Department with its own forces is making repairs or
installing new mains and services, it shall be the duty of the Superintendent
rules are in force, the bill may be put upon the tax roll as
provided in § 66.0809, Wis. Stats.
A. When the Water Department has reasonable evidence that a customer
is obtaining a supply of water, in whole or in part, by means of devices
or methods used to stop or interfere with the proper metering by the
Water Department's equipment, the Water Department reserves the
right to estimate and present immediately a bill for service unmetered
as a result of such interference, and such bill shall be payable subject to
a twenty-four-hour disconnection of service. When the Water
Department shall have disconnected the customer for any such reason,
the Water Department will reconnect the customer upon the following
conditions:
(1) The customer will be required to deposit with the Water
Department an amount sufficient to guarantee the payment of the
customer's bills for water service to the Water Department.
(2) The customer will be required to pay the Water Department for any
and all damages to its equipment on the customer's premises due
to such stoppage or interference with its metering.

(14) Model homes.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to provide for the
erection of model homes in new subdivisions without adversely
affecting the character of surrounding residential
neighborhoods by creating a general nuisance. As model
homes represent a unique temporary commercial use, special
consideration must be given to peculiar problems associated
with them and special standards must be applied to ensure
reasonable compatibility with their surrounding environment.
(b) Procedure. The erection of a model home(s) used as a
temporary real estate or builder's office(s) shall require a
special exception permit.
(c) Requirements.
[1] Model homes with on-site sales staff shall be a special
exception use provided for in the applicable zoning district
in which they are located. Any such model home shall
comply with the Grand Chute Building Code.191

but not be limited to, elimination of temporary parking,
driveway restoration and the removal of signage and
lighting. The restoration of all temporary parking areas
with appropriate landscaping shall be completed by the

Town with a performance bond to insure the residential
conversion upon termination of the use or special
exception permit. The Town shall determine the amount of
the bond.
191. Editor's Note: See Ch. 220, Building Construction.

resulting from extraordinary variations in lot size for singlefamily
residential dwellings that may result from the creation
of new lots which are exceptionally small in relation to existing
adjacent lots. It is recognized that the creation of new small
lots adjacent to larger lots, even if such lots meet other
minimum lot size requirements under Town ordinances, may
be damaging to the values of adjacent residential properties
and result in home sizes out of character with the other
development in the immediate neighborhood. In furtherance of
the purposes of this subsection the following provisions shall
apply: [Amended 4-7-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-09]
[1] The creation of any new lot resulting from creating a
parcel or split of an existing tax parcel creating any new
lot less than 14,400 square feet shall be subject to the

dwelling:
[a] The restrictions herein do not apply to plats consisting
of more than 10 newly created lots filed with the
Register of Deeds after the effective date of this

or landscape buffer from a public street or a residential
district.
(3) Administration. Determinations necessary for the administration
and enforcement of these standards range from those which can be
made by a reasonable person using normal senses and no

competence and complex equipment. It is the intent of this chapter
that the methods to be used in determining compliance shall be the
responsibility of the Building Inspector and Administrator subject
to the following procedure:
(a) Approval of building permits. Prior to approving a building
permit for any industrial use or any change thereof, the
Building Inspector and Administrator shall have received from
the applicant evidence or assurance that the proposed use or
changing use will satisfy all the standards of this chapter.212
(b) Violation of standards. Whenever the Building Inspector or
Administrator has reason to believe the air quality, vibration
and exterior lighting standards of this chapter have been
violated, written notice shall be made by certified mail to the
person or persons responsible for the alleged violation. Such
notice shall describe the alleged violation and shall require an
answer or correction of the alleged violation within 30 days.
Failure to reply or correct the alleged violation within 30 days

A. Purpose. This district is intended to promote large-scale commercial,
industrial, institutional, and mixed-use development that may be built
out in multiple phases in accordance with a master development plan. It
is the intent of this district to assure that development is planned and
accomplished within the Town's goals for the surrounding
neighborhood and the community as a whole; promote flexibility in
design and efficient use of land; provide for architectural unity and
design harmony; preserve, to the greatest extent feasible, existing

in conformance with all municipal, state, and other laws and
regulations. However, in interpreting and applying the provisions of this
section, it shall take precedence and be controlling when there is
conflict between its provisions and those contained elsewhere in this
chapter.
C. Approval procedure. To develop land under this district classification
requires a two-step approval procedure, as described in this section.
The initial step requires the approval by the Town of a master
development plan for the area to be developed and the approval of the
rezoning of said area to PDD Planned Development District. The second
step requires project plan approval, by Town ordinance, before any
phase of development commences within the area zoned PDD Planned
Development District.
D. Permitted uses.
(1) No structure or building shall be erected that is arranged,
intended, or designed to be used for other than those uses that are
specifically approved by the Town in the ordinance authorizing
project approval. In accordance with the adopted master

A. Intent and purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the
general safety and welfare of the public by establishing minimum
regulations and standards for off-street parking according to the use of
the property and by requiring that parking areas be designed and
constructed in a manner that ensures visibility, accessibility and safety.
B. Applicability. Off-street parking regulations described herein shall be
applied to all developments and uses hereafter established, expanded,
or changed, based on the zoning classification of property.
(1) Residential property. At property zoned and used as RSF, RTF, or
R-2, or a property zoned AGD that is used for a single-family
detached residence unrelated to farm operations, the following
regulations shall be met:
(a) All automobiles or recreational/utility vehicles parked or
stored outside must be parked or stored on a gravel or paved
surface if located in the front yard or side yard of a property.
Parking on grass or bare soil surfaces is prohibited. No more
than four vehicles shall be parked or stored in the front yard, of
which no more than one may be a recreational/utility vehicle.
(b) All automobiles or motorized commercial and recreational/
utility vehicles parked or stored outside in the rear yard of a
property must be parked or stored on a gravel or paved
surface.
(c) No commercial vehicle with an actual weight in excess of 8,000
pounds, or over 20 feet in length, or having a height of more
than eight feet, shall be parked or stored, except when
rendering a service at the property on which it is parked. Any
commercial vehicle must be parked or stored on a gravel or
paved surface. A commercial vehicle parked or stored in the
front yard would be counted toward the maximum limit of four
vehicles being allowed.
(d) No person may offer any motor vehicles for sale on a recurrent
basis in any residential district.
(2) Multifamily, commercial, industrial, or institutional property. At
property zoned and used as R-3, R-4, R-5, RMF, C-1, C-2, CL, CR,
CP, IND, or PDD, the following regulations shall be met:217
(a) Changes in buildings or use. Whenever a building or use is
changed, structurally altered or enlarged to create a need for
an increase of 25% or more in the number of existing parking
spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the
enlargement or change. Whenever a building or use is
enlarged to the extent of 50% or more in the floor area, said
217. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 535-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-49
1:625
building or use shall then comply with the parking
requirements set forth in the district in which it is located.
(b) Alteration to existing surfaces. Whenever existing parking
surfaces are altered either by adding asphalt or concrete to a
gravel lot or parking space or by removing existing asphalt or
concrete from a parking lot or parking space and exposing the
gravel course base and then repaving such area, the
regulations and standards set forth in this section shall be met.
(c) Design standards. All off-street parking development or
expansion/alteration of existing parking lots or parking spaces,
in accordance with Subsection B(2)(b), shall be subject to the
following site plan design standards:
[1] Each required off-street parking space shall have a stall
width of at least nine feet and a stall length of at least 18
feet.
[2] Minimum width of aisles providing access to parking
spaces for one-way traffic shall be 11 feet for thirty-degree
parking and 20 feet for ninety-degree parking.
[3] Minimum width of aisles providing access to parking
spaces for two-way traffic shall be 24 feet.
[4] No parking area shall be designed so as to require any
vehicle to back into a public street.
[5] All open, off-street loading and parking spaces shall be
improved with either asphalt or concrete pavement and
stormwater drainage facilities, as approved by the Town.
[6] Concrete curb and gutter shall be installed surrounding all
new driveways, parking lots and landscape islands. This
provision may be waived by the Plan Commission for
additions to existing structures located in areas without a
predominance of curb and gutter, when curb and gutter is
not installed on the adjacent street right-of-way or is not
anticipated to be constructed on the street right-of-way in
a reasonable period of time in the future.
[7] Required concrete curb and gutter for off-street parking
areas shall be installed a minimum of five feet from a
property line (as measured from the back of curb) so as to
prevent parked vehicles from extending over any lot lines.
[8] All driveways shall be a minimum width of 24 feet
measured between face of curbs.
[9] Setbacks for driveways and parking lots from adjoining
property lines shall conform to the standards as set forth
in § 535-52 of this chapter.
§ 535-49 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-49
1:626
[10]Off-street parking spaces shall be marked by painted lines
or other approved material and shall be maintained so as
to be legible at all times.
[11] Street and driveway intersections shall have corners with
a minimum curve radius of 25 feet. The fire truck turning
radius for private roads and parking lots shall be a
minimum of 40 feet. Cul-de-sac driveways or approved
private roadways shall have a turnaround area with
diameter of not less than 90 feet. All driveways or
roadways within a project shall have curbing to define
their limits. When roadways exit to adjacent property
rather than directly to a public street, permanent crosseasement
agreements shall be recorded which adequately
guarantee that such exits may not be closed and that such
roadways will not become a future liability for the Town.
When more than one building is located on a parcel, no
building may be more than 200 feet from a dedicated
public street or approved twenty-six-foot-wide private
roadway, and driveway access to the building must be at
least 24 feet wide.
[12] Stormwater management drainage plans shall provide for
water to be collected and retained on the site, with
controlled discharge into the public drainage system to
minimize flooding.
(d) Mixed uses. In the case of mixed uses on the same property, the
number of parking spaces required shall equal the sum of the
spaces if computed separately for each use.
(e) Joint use. Two or more uses on the same property may provide
parking spaces in an amount less than the sum of the spaces
required for each separate use, provided that such uses are not
operated during the same hours. A written agreement shall
accompany any joint use arrangement.
(f) Off-lot parking. Required off-street parking spaces shall be
developed on the same lot on which the principal use is located
or on a contiguous lot. Parking within 300 feet from the
principal use or building may be approved by the Director of
Community Development upon receiving written
documentation that confirms the off-lot parking property is
held in common ownership with the lot containing the principal
use or building or that the right to use the off-lot parking
property is granted through a written lease or parking
easement.
C. Required parking spaces for specific uses. The table that follows
identifies the minimum number of parking spaces to be provided for the
uses listed. In no case shall the minimum number of spaces be fewer
§ 535-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-49
1:627
than four, regardless of use, with the exception of property zoned and
used as RSF, RTF, or R-2, or a property zoned AGD that is used for a
single-family detached residence unrelated to farm operations. Unless
otherwise indicated, the minimum number of spaces for each use is the
number needed per 1,000 square feet of floor area.

parking space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the
gross leasable horizontal area inside exterior walls of all floors of a
nonresidential building.
(2) Where seating capacity is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean
the number of seating units installed or indicated for, or for each 24
linear inches of seating facilities.
(3) Where the number of employees is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the number of employees
on the largest shift shall be used for calculation purposes.
(4) Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next highest whole
number.
§ 535-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-49
1:629
§ 535-50. Off-street loading.
Off-street loading spaces accessory to designated uses shall be provided as
follows:
(5) Parking space requirements for a use not specified in Subsection C
shall be determined by using the most similar and restrictive
parking space requirement, based on the intended use, the location
of the use, and the expected patronage/use by individuals operating
motor vehicles.
A. Location. All required loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as
the use served. No permitted or required loading space shall be located
within 40 feet of the nearest point of intersection of any two streets. All
loading spaces shall be screened as set forth in § 535-52 of this chapter.
[Amended 4-7-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-09]
B. Access. Each required off-street loading space shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner
which will least interfere with traffic movement. Loading spaces on lots
located adjacent to public ways shall be so situated as to enable the
vehicles to back into the loading dock from areas other than public
ways. The blocking of loading spaces by other loading spaces or
permanent or moveable structures of any type, including trash
receptacles or compactors, shall be prohibited.
C. Surfacing. All open off-street loading spaces shall be improved with
pavement and stormwater drainage facilities.
D. Computation. Where the total floor area of the use being served is less
than 2,000 square feet, the required off-street loading spaces may be
used to satisfy the requirements for any off-street parking spaces.
Employee parking maneuver areas may also be used for access to
loading docks and as truck standing areas.
E. Repair and service. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind
shall be permitted in conjunction with loading facilities provided in any
residential or nonresidential zoning districts.
F. Maneuvering space required to service outdoor loading areas.
Adequate off-street truck maneuvering area shall be provided on site
and not within any public street right-of-way or other public lands.
G. Interference with fire exit or emergency access prohibited. Off-street
loading facilities shall be designed so as not to interfere with any fire
exits or emergency access facilities to either a building or site.
H. Loading space requirements. The loading space requirements specified
in the following table shall apply to all districts:

I. Multiple or mixed uses. Where a building is devoted to more than one
use or for different uses, and where the floor area for each use is below
the minimum required for a loading space but the aggregate floor area
of such uses is above such a minimum, then off-street loading space
shall be provided as if the entire building were devoted to that use in
the building for which the most loading spaces are required.218
J. Design standards. Each off-street loading space shall have a width of at
least 12 feet, a length of at least 45 feet, and a vertical clearance of at
least 14 feet. Dimensions for loading spaces in connection with funeral
homes shall be reduced to 10 feet in width, 25 feet in length, and eight
feet in vertical clearance. Every loading space shall be sufficiently
screened in the form of a solid fence or shrubbery to protect any
neighboring residence.
A. Nature. Common open space shall not include street rights-of-way,
driveways, parking areas or yards required in connection with any
building.
218. Editor's Note: Original § 27.06(9)(j), Location, which immediately followed this
subsection, was repealed at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II). See Subsection A(1), Location.
§ 535-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-51
1:631
§ 535-52. Landscape and screening standards. [Amended 4-7-2011
by Ord. No. 2011-09]
B. Buildings and structures. Common open space areas may contain
complementary buildings and structures appropriate for the
recreational use and enjoyment of the residents of the development for
which it was established.
C. Reservation. When common open space or any portion thereof is to be
reserved for the exclusive use and enjoyment of the residents of the
development from which it was established, the developer shall
establish conditions as to the ownership, maintenance, and use of such
areas as deemed necessary to assure preservation of its intended
purposes. Land designated as common open space shall be restricted
by appropriate legal instrument as open space perpetually or for a
period of not less than 99 years. Such instrument shall be binding upon
the developer, his successors and assigns and shall constitute a
covenant running with the land and be recorded as a condition of
approval.
D. Maintenance. In the event that common open space is improperly
maintained, the Town department may serve written notice upon any
property owner or association setting forth the manner in which such
property owner or association has failed to maintain the common open
space and demand maintenance deficiencies to be corrected in 30 days.
If the deficiencies as originally set forth or subsequently modified are
not corrected within 30 days, the Town may enter upon such common
open space and correct maintenance deficiencies. The cost of such
maintenance shall be assessed ratably against the properties within the
development that have the right to use the area and shall become a tax
lien on said properties. The Town shall file notice of any liens in the
office of the Town Clerk.219
A. Intent and purpose. The purpose of this section is to:
(1) Enhance the appearance of the Town by improving the quality of
landscaping and screening at commercial, industrial and
institutional uses.
(2) Establish standards to ensure that building sites and off-street
parking areas are sufficiently landscaped and screened to minimize
or eliminate adverse impacts of noise, glare of headlights, dust,
litter, visual encroachment and other objectionable impacts to
adjoining properties or public roads.
B. Applicability. Landscape standards shall apply to any developments
allowed as a permitted use or as a special exception use in the R-3, R-4,
R-5, and RMF Residential Districts; the C-1, C-2, CL, CR, and CP
219. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 535-51 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-52
1:632
Commercial Districts; the IND Industrial District; and the PDD Planned
Development District. Additionally, the standards shall apply to any
commercial and institutional developments allowed as a permitted use
or as a special exception use in the AGD Agricultural District and
RSF, RTF, and R-2 Residential Districts. Any developments occurring on
vacant land shall be brought into full compliance with these standards.
Before an existing vacant development can be occupied, these
standards must be met, to the extent that all other standards and
requirements of this chapter can be maintained on the site.220
C. Exceptions and modifications. Existing occupied developments that do
not conform to these standards are not required to come into
compliance until such time that any of the following occur:
(1) Any change is made to the development or use of the property that
requires approval of a site plan, special exception permit, or zoning
change by the Plan Commission, necessitating compliance with the
frontage landscaping requirements;
(2) The gross floor area of the building at the development is increased
by more than 10% or 5,000 square feet, whichever is less,
necessitating compliance with the frontage landscaping standards
and, to the extent applicable, the buffer yard landscaping and
screening requirements; or
(3) Driving, parking or loading spaces at the development are
increased, necessitating compliance with the frontage landscaping,
perimeter landscaping, interior landscaping, buffer yard
landscaping and screening requirements, as applicable, to the area
where such impervious surface is increased.
D. Approval procedure. A landscape plan is required in conjunction with
site plans and as required for any development or use of property as
specified in Subsection B, Applicability, of this section. The landscape
plan shall be filed with the Community Development Department. A
building permit may only be issued after approval of the landscape plan.
For developments or uses of property that do not require Plan
Commission approval, the Community Development Department will
complete the review and approval of the landscape plan. In the event of
an unresolved dispute or in the case of an applicant feeling aggrieved
by a decision to disapprove a landscape plan, said plan shall be
forwarded to the Plan Commission for final action.
E. Landscape plan requirements. Landscape plans submitted for review
and approval shall include the name and address of the owner/
developer, the name of the landscape architect/designer, date of plan
preparation, date and description of all plan revisions, name of the
project or development scale of the plan, and North marker.
Additionally, the plan shall depict the following:

1:633
(1) The location of all lot lines and location of all existing and proposed
easements and rights-of-way.
(2) The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed
structures; building entrances; parking lots, parking spaces
(numbered) and driveways; sidewalks, trails and paths; groundmounted
signs; fences; refusal disposal areas; freestanding
electrical and other utility equipment; recreational facilities; and
other site improvements as deemed necessary by the Community
Development Director.
(3) The location, quantity, caliper size, and name (common and
botanical name) of all proposed plant materials and the location
and description of all ground cover and turf grasses.
(4) The location, caliper size, and type of existing plant materials and
the intended treatment (save, move, or remove).
(5) Existing and proposed grading of the site, including the location
and contours at one-foot intervals of proposed berms; spot
elevations for high and low points; the flow line of drainage swales
and grading features such as retaining walls; and cross-section
detail as determined to be necessary by the Community
Development Director.
(6) Elevations, including dimensions and materials, of all fences and
refuse storage areas proposed for construction on the site.
(7) A schedule of all new plant materials, including size (caliper,
height, container size, etc.), planned installation date, and common
and botanical names.
(8) A schedule itemizing the total square foot area of impervious
surface area in parking lots, the number and square foot area of
each planting island and planting peninsula, and the number of
trees to be planted in parking lots or within 10 feet of the periphery
of parking lots.
F. Landscape standards. Landscaping required under this section shall
consist of five types as specified below, including frontage landscaping,
perimeter landscaping, interior landscaping, buffer yard landscaping,
and screening requirements.
(1) Frontage landscaping. A minimum ten-foot-wide strip, extending
along and directly behind the property line adjacent to all road
right-of-way, shall be landscaped as described below. In designing
and installing frontage landscaping, consideration should be given
to providing safe and convenient pedestrian access to the property
from the road-right-of-way.
(a) Where off-street parking spaces are located between the
frontage landscaping strip and any buildings or structures on
§ 535-52 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-52
1:634
the site, one shade tree or two ornamental trees shall be
planted per 40 linear feet on center, plus a staggered row of
evergreen and/or deciduous shrubs shall be planted to provide
an opaque screen to a height of three feet across 80% of the
frontage of the parking lot, excluding driveways.
(b) Where there are no off-street parking spaces between the
frontage landscaping strip and any buildings or structures on
the site, one shade tree or two ornamental trees shall be
planted per 40 linear feet on center, excluding driveways.
(c) Where it is deemed appropriate or desirable to construct an
earthen berm in the frontage landscaping strip in lieu of a
staggered row of evergreen and/or deciduous shrubs, the Plan
Commission may approve this option. The maximum side slope
of any berm shall be three horizontal to one vertical. The berm
shall be planted with one ornamental tree and three evergreen
or deciduous shrubs per 40 linear feet on center, excluding
driveways, and it shall also be planted with adequate ground
cover to prevent erosion of the earth mound.
(2) Perimeter landscaping. All parking lots that are adjacent to a side
and/or rear property line shall provide a minimum five-foot-wide
perimeter landscape strip, extending along and directly behind the
property line. The perimeter landscape strip shall be planted with
one shade tree or two ornamental trees per 40 linear feet on center.
Trees can be provided in cooperation with adjacent property, as
deemed appropriate.
(a) The requirement to provide a perimeter landscaping strip may
be waived if a cross-access easement agreement between
adjoining property owners is recorded and provided to the
Community Development Director for review and approval.
(b) In those cases where a perimeter landscaping strip and a
buffer yard landscaping strip are required along the same
property line, the more restrictive buffer yard landscaping
requirements shall be met.
(3) Interior landscaping. All parking lots designed for more than 20
spaces shall be landscaped as described below. On smaller parking
lots with fewer than 20 spaces, interior landscaping shall be
provided as deemed practicable and appropriate by the Community
Development Director. In designing and installing interior
landscaping, consideration should be given to including these
green areas in the site drainage plan, to the extent practicable.
(a) Not less than 5% of the impervious surface area of the parking
lot shall be devoted to interior landscaping, to be provided
within planting islands, planting peninsulas, landscaped
boulevards, or within 10 feet of the periphery of the parking
lot.
§ 535-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-52
1:635
(b) The primary plant material for interior landscaping shall be
shade trees, with at least one shade tree planted for every 160
square feet of interior landscaping required.
(c) Planting islands and planting peninsulas shall be a minimum of
160 square feet in area and shall be dispersed throughout the
parking lot, as deemed practicable and appropriate by the
Community Development Director.
(d) One shade tree shall be planted in each parking island and
parking peninsula.
(4) Buffer yard landscaping. Wherever a commercial, industrial, farmrelated
commercial, institutional, multiple-family residential or
attached single-family residential use shares a common side yard
or rear yard lot line with a property zoned RSF, RTF, or R-2, or a
property zoned AGD that is used for a single-family detached
residence unrelated to farm operations, a buffer yard landscaping
strip shall be provided along the full length of the common lot line.
Required buffer yards shall be landscaped as described below.
(a) Buffer yards required for development on properties zoned CL,
CR, CP, IND, or PDD shall be a minimum 15 feet wide and shall
be planted with minimum five-foot-high evergreen trees
staggered to provide a dense, opaque screen within two years
after the date of planting.221
(b) Buffer yards required for development on properties zoned
R-3, R-4, R-5, RMF, C-1, or C-2, or for commercial, farm-related
commercial, or institutional uses on properties zoned AGD,
RSF, RTF, or R-2, shall be a minimum 10 feet wide and shall be
planted with minimum five-foot-high evergreen trees
staggered to provide a dense, opaque screen within two years
after the date of planting.
(c) As an alternative to these requirements, a property owner may
request a waiver from the Plan Commission to reduce the
minimum width of the buffer yard by 50% and to provide a sixfoot-
high, sight-tight, alternating board-on-board fence and to
plant five shrubs per 100 linear feet on center.
(5) Screening requirements. The intent of these requirements is to
provide a visual screen around loading, service, mechanical, utility,
storage, maintenance and refuse collection areas contained within
properties developed for commercial, industrial, institutional,
multiple-family residential, or attached single-family residential
use. All such uses of property shall be screened as described below.

loading docks, vehicular lanes providing access to the same,
and other service, storage, and maintenance areas shall be
screened from view to all adjacent properties and from all
adjacent public road right-of-way. The screening shall consist
of a six-foot-high, sight-tight, alternating board-on-board fence
or masonry wall designed and built to complement the exterior
of the principal structure.
(b) In addition to the screening requirements described in this
subsection, any loading area that is located in a side and/or
rear yard adjacent to a property zoned for residential use, or a
property zoned AGD that is used for a single-family detached
residence unrelated to farm operations, shall also be screened
with minimum five-foot-high evergreen trees staggered to
provide a dense, opaque screen over a minimum 30% of the
enclosed loading area's perimeter.
(c) All exterior storage of refuse and trash shall be located and
oriented to be screened from view to all adjacent properties
and from all adjacent road right-of-way. The screening shall
consist of a six-foot-high, sight-tight, alternating board-onboard
fence or masonry wall designed and built to complement
the exterior of the principal structure. Additionally, minimum
five-foot-high evergreen trees shall be planted in a staggered
pattern to provide a dense, opaque screen over a minimum
30% of the refuse enclosure's perimeter.

triple-strand fences are prohibited, unless specifically permitted by
this section.
E. Exceptions. Protective security fences and boundary fences on
industrial sites, publicly owned lands, or semiprivate lands such as
places of worship, educational institutions, utility substations, etc., are
excluded from the provisions of this section, except that where such
fences incorporate the use of barbed wire, such barbed wire shall not
be less than seven feet above the ground level and shall not extend over
any roadway, sidewalk/trail, or adjoining property. In addition, such
fences otherwise excluded from the provisions of this section shall be a
minimum 2/3 open to vision, equally distributed throughout the fence
length, and shall maintain the height restrictions of this section when
located within the defined vision corner.
A. General. At the time any exterior light is installed or substantially
modified, an exterior lighting plan shall be submitted to the Town in
order to determine whether the requirements of this section have been
met and that adjoining property will not be adversely impacted by the
proposed lighting.
B. Lighting plan elements. A lighting plan submitted pursuant to this
section shall have, at a minimum, the following elements:
(1) A catalog page, cut sheet, or photograph of the luminaire, including
the mounting method.

ARTICLE VII
Special Provisions
§ 535-56. General application.
Requirements for uses and structures specified in this article shall apply
to such uses and structures whether permitted by right or permissible by
special exception.
§ 535-57. Accessory dwellings.
§ 535-58. Resource extraction.
A. Intent. It is the intent of the accessory dwelling provisions to provide for
housing options for the extended family and certain specified segments
of the population. These regulations are established to permit
modification of single-family dwellings to include an accessory dwelling
unit to be occupied by no more than two persons who are handicapped,
over the age of 60 years old, or related to the owner-occupant.
B. Mandatory owner occupancy. The owner of the single-family residence
must occupy either the principal residence or the accessory residence.
C. Nature and scale of accessory unit. An accessory dwelling may be a
separate, complete housekeeping unit; provided, however, that it is
substantially contained within the structure of the single-family
dwelling and clearly a subordinate part thereof. Permissible
modifications to the structure are a limited extension of the structure to
the rear and the creation of a separate entrance at the side or rear. The
accessory apartment shall not exceed 600 square feet of floor area or
25% of the entire floor area of the dwelling, whichever is greater. Any
external modification shall be done with a design and materials similar
in appearance to the principal structure such that, to the maximum
extent possible, the external appearance of the dwelling will remain as
a single-family dwelling.
D. Dimensional requirements. Maximum lot coverage and maximum
height requirements, as well as minimum yard requirements in the RSF
District, shall be met.
A. Intent. It is the intent of these regulations to permit resource extraction
uses in outlying areas as a temporary or transitional use with
assurances that later reuse for other permissible uses and structures is
possible.
B. Existing operations. The requirements of this section shall not apply to
existing operations only where more than 50% of the area (excluding
setbacks required herein) of a parcel of record has been excavated at
the time of adoption of this chapter. Where less than 50% of the area
has been excavated, any extension of operations within the parcel or on
§ 535-56 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-58
1:641
adjacent parcels shall comply with the requirements of this section,
including restoration for the entire parcel(s).
C. Uses and operations. Permitted uses or operations shall include the
removal for sale or processing of timber, natural vegetation, topsoil, fill,
sand, gravel, rock or any mineral. Processing may include crushing,
washing or refining. Storing or stockpiling of such materials on the site
is permissible. Permissible uses may also include concrete or asphalt
manufacturing.
D. Area and setback requirements. The parcel shall consist of a minimum
of five acres with dimensions sufficient to adequately accommodate the
proposed uses with minimum adverse affects on adjacent lands. No
operations shall be permitted within 100 feet of any exterior boundary
of the tract or within 250 feet of any building intended for human
occupancy existing at the time of permit application. For operations
involving blasting, processing or manufacturing, the Plan Commission
may increase required setbacks as a condition of approval.
E. Location. Location shall be appropriate to existing development and
development which may reasonably be expected within the time period
specified herein for permits. The site shall be so located as to make it
unnecessary to conduct trucking operations on any platted street in a
residential subdivision.
F. Plan of operation. Each application for a special exception shall be
accompanied by a plan of operation for the site including the following
information:
(1) Statement of ownership of the parcel and control of the operations.
(2) Extent of the area to be excavated.
(3) Location, width and grade of all easements or rights-of-way on or
abutting the parcel.
(4) Existing topography by five-foot contour intervals, existing
watercourses and drainageways, existing vegetation and soils,
depth to groundwater as indicated by at least four borings, and
existing buildings or structures.
(5) Cross section showing extent of sand or gravel deposits and the
water table.
(6) Estimated type and volume of excavation, method(s) of extracting
and processing, and the sequence of operations.
(7) Proposed equipment and proposed locations of equipment,
proposed areas for ponding, proposed drainage modifications,

1:642
§ 535-59. Planned unit development (PUD). [Amended 9-18-2001]
G. Plan of restoration. Each application for a special exception shall be
accompanied by a plan of restoration for the site including the following
information:
(1) A statement on the planned restoration, including phasing and
timing of the restoration process and reuse of the site.
(2) A plan showing fill methods and materials, final contours of the
site, proposed roads within the site, the location of any water
bodies or watercourses within the restored area, landscaping or
vegetative planting, and areas of cut and fill.
(3) The method of disposing of any materials, equipment or buildings
on the site.
H. Time limitations. No special exception permit shall be issued for a
period exceeding eight years consisting of not more than six years for
the operational phase and not more than two years for the restoration
phase. Upon expiration of the operational phase, the applicant may
request and receive extensions of this phase for three-year periods
unless changing conditions indicate the extension will be detrimental to
the public health, safety and welfare. Any extension shall require the
submission of a new plan of restoration if the operation is extended or
enlarged. If such extension is denied, the applicant shall complete the
restoration phase within the two-year time period specified.
I. Financial assurance. To insure completion of the restoration phase, as
proposed, within the two-year time period, each applicant shall submit
a performance bond or other financial guarantee sufficient in amount to
cover the restoration expense relative to the proposed operation or
extension thereto.
A. Intent. The intent of the planned unit development provisions is to
encourage quality and desirable development by allowing for greater
flexibility and design freedom than that permitted under basic
residential district regulations. These regulations are established to
permit and encourage diversification, variation and imagination in
layout of residential development; to encourage the preservation of
open space; and to encourage more rational, economic development
with respect to the provisions of public services.
B. Unified control. All land included for development as a PUD shall be
under the legal control of the applicant, whether that applicant is an
individual, partnership, or corporation or group of individuals,
partnerships or corporations. Applicants requesting approval of a PUD
shall present firm evidence of unified control of the entire area within
the proposed PUD together with evidence that the developer has the
unrestricted right to impose all of the covenants and conditions upon
the land as are contemplated by the provisions of these regulations. The
§ 535-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-59
1:643
applicant shall state agreement to proceed with the proposed
development according to the provisions of these zoning regulations
and such conditions as may be attached to the special exception for
PUD; provide agreements, contracts and deed restrictions necessary
for completion of the development according to the approved plans;
and bind his or its successors in title to any commitments made in the
approval process.
C. Permitted uses. Any use permitted in the residential multifamily (RMF,
R-3, R-4 and R-5), commercial and industrial districts.
D. General requirements. All permitted uses shall be subject to the
accessory use and structure, sign, height and parking requirements of
the district in which they are located.
E. Area and density requirements. A tract of land proposed for
development as a planned unit development shall contain a minimum
area of two acres and a maximum density equal to the underlying
zoning district.
F. Internal lots and frontage. Within the boundaries of the PUD, no
minimum lot size or minimum yards shall be required; provided,
however, that no structure shall be located closer to any peripheral
property line than a distance equal to the height of such structure.
G. Access. Every dwelling unit shall have access to a public street either
directly or via an approved private road, pedestrianway, court or other
area dedicated to public or private use or common element
guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not required to front on a
dedicated public street. Access to buildings may be by approved private
streets in planned unit developments, provided that such streets are no
further than 200 feet from the building served. Private streets shall be a
minimum of 24 feet wide with curbs and internal drainage (an urban
section design) and pavements equal or better in quality to Town
minimum design standards.
H. Engineering design standards. Normal standards or operational policy
regarding right-of-way widths, provision for sidewalks, streetlighting
and similar environmental design criteria shall not be mandatory in a
planned unit development, but precise standards shall be made a part
of the approved plan and shall be enforceable as a part of this chapter.
I. Procedures for approving planned unit developments.
(1) Development plan. A development plan shall accompany the
application for a special exception permit and contain the following
information:
(a) Names of the owner and developer.

(2) Plan approval. Upon approval of a development plan, a special
exception permit shall be issued. All terms, conditions and
stipulations made at the time of approval shall be binding upon the
applicant or any successors in interest.
(3) Preliminary and final plans. Approval of a development plan for a
special exception does not constitute preliminary or final plat
approval. Preliminary and final plats shall be submitted and
processed in accordance with standard subdivision review
procedures.
(4) Changes in plan. Minor changes in plans shall be made by
application and follow procedures pursuant to Article X. Minor
changes shall not be considered a reapplication for special
exception permit. Substantial changes in plans shall be made by
application and processed as a new application for a special
exception permit.
(5) Deviations from approved plans. Deviations from approved plans or
failure to comply with any requirement, condition or safeguard
during approval or platting procedures shall constitute a violation
of these zoning regulations.
J. Building permits. Final approval does not constitute approval for the
construction of individual buildings or structures in the development.
Application for building permits shall be submitted and processed in
accordance with standard procedures.
A. Intent. The intent of the cluster subdivision provisions is to provide
voluntary alternative zoning provisions which promote ingenuity in
design and preserve the natural features of the site.
§ 535-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-60
1:645
§ 535-61. Small-scale beekeeping.222 [Added 4-23-2015 by Ord. No.
2015-04]
B. Unified control. All land included for development as a cluster
subdivision shall meet the requirements of unified control for planned
unit developments in § 535-59B.
C. Permitted uses. Single-family detached dwellings.
D. General requirements. All permitted uses shall be subject to the
accessory use and structure, sign, height and parking requirements of
the district within which the subdivision is located.
E. Area and density requirements. A tract or parcel of land proposed for
development as a cluster subdivision shall contain a minimum area of
two acres. Maximum density of a cluster subdivision shall be eight
dwelling units per net acre.
F. Minimum lot area requirements. All single-family detached dwellings
shall have a minimum lot area of 3,600 square feet, front yard of 10 feet
and rear yard of 20 feet. There shall be a minimum side yard of two feet
and minimum aggregate side yards of 12 feet; provided, however, that
there shall be a minimum building separation of 10 feet. All lot size
reductions shall be compensated for by a substantially equivalent
amount of land in cluster open space to be preserved and maintained
for its scenic, recreational or conservation value. The maximum extent
practicable, such open space areas shall be directly accessible by all
dwellings.
G. Procedures for approving cluster subdivisions. The procedures for
approving cluster subdivisions shall be the same as provided in
§ 535-59I.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow small-scale beekeeping
on lots with a residential use. A further purpose is to establish certain
requirements for beekeeping within the community to avoid issues that
might otherwise be associated with beekeeping in residential
neighborhoods. Honeybees are critical pollinators for flowers, fruits
and vegetables. Managed colonies of bees help to increase yields and
quality of a large variety of plants commonly found in backyard
gardens, parks, and natural areas. A growing interest in renewable
resources has prompted more people to take up beekeeping as a way to
produce their own honey, beeswax, pollen and other hive products that
are high in nutritional value. Domestic strains of honeybees have been
selectively bred for desirable traits so that they can be kept within
populated areas and in reasonable densities, without causing a
nuisance if the bees are properly located and carefully managed. By
providing a "best practices" ordinance for small-scale ("hobby")
222. Editor's Note: Original § 27.07(6), Industrial development, was repealed at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II.) See § 535-39G, Industrial and
commercial district performance standards.
§ 535-60 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-61
1:646
beekeeping on residential properties, the Town can support a
sustainable activity while setting standards that are practical for
beekeepers and safe for neighbors.
B. Standards and practices. No hives are allowed on any property that is
not in residential use (including property zoned residential), with the
exception that hives are allowed under the General Agricultural District
as a "farm-related" use. The following criteria constitute standards and
practices that, when applied to small-scale beekeeping on residential
lots, protect the health, safety, property and welfare of the general
public.
(1) Number of hives. The maximum number of hives allowed on any lot
zoned and used for residential purposes are based on the size of lot,
as follows:
(a) Lot size of 1/2 acre or smaller: maximum two hives allowed.
(b) Lot size larger than 1/2 acre but smaller than one acre:
maximum four hives allowed.
(c) Lot size of one acre or larger: maximum six hives allowed.
(2) Location. Hives are allowed only within side or rear yards. In all
cases, a minimum setback of 10 feet must be maintained between
any property line and the closest point of any hives. Any hives
located within 25 feet of a property line must be shielded with a
minimum six-foot height flyway barrier installed at the property
line. The flyway barrier may consist of a solid wall, fence, dense
vegetation, or combination thereof that extends 10 feet beyond the
outer edges of the hives in each direction so that all bees are forced
to fly over the material to reach the colony.
(3) Water supply. Every beekeeper shall ensure that a convenient and
constant supply of water is provided near the hives for as long as
colonies remain active outside of the hives.
(4) Best practices. The following best practices are established as
standards of operation for any small-scale beekeeping operation
hereafter licensed by the Town:
(a) Provide screening around hives so colonies are out of sight
from neighboring properties.
(b) Maintain colonies in movable-frame hives mounted on
substantial stands.
(c) Hives and all other beekeeping equipment must be kept in
good and useable condition, including securing unused
equipment from weather, theft, vandalism or occupancy by
swarms of bees.
§ 535-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-61
1:647
§ 535-62. Mobile home parks.223
(d) Leave enough room between any screening and the hives for
ease of working around the colonies.
(e) Limit beekeeping activities to times when it doesn't interfere
with neighbors' outdoor activities.
(f) Inspect and monitor bees on a regular basis for the health of
the hive and to ensure that the colonies are not creating a
nuisance to others.
(g) Prevent swarming or aggressive behavior by re-queening
colonies.
C. Administration and enforcement. A beekeeping license application
must be received and approved by the Town before a property owner or
tenant can begin beekeeping operations at a residential lot. In addition,
beekeeping licenses must be renewed annually, prior to April 1.
(1) Neighbor notification. Prior to Town issuance of a beekeeping
license, the applicant/beekeeper will be required to notify all
neighbors whose properties share a common lot line with the
property where beekeeping will take place.
(2) Town inspections. The Community Development Department is
authorized to make inspections, during reasonable hours, to
investigate any complaints, or to determine continued compliance
with the beekeeping ordinance. The Department may revoke a
license if there have been three or more violations of the ordinance
within any six-month period.
(3) Effect of compliance. Compliance with this section shall not be a
defense to a proceeding alleging that a given bee colony is in
violation of other codes or ordinances governing public nuisances,
or public health and safety. However, compliance with this section
may be offered as evidence of the beekeeper's efforts to abate any
proven nuisance, or as evidence of the beekeeper's compliance
with generally accepted standards of practice among small-scale
hobby beekeepers in the State of Wisconsin.
A. Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to provide limited opportunities for
mobile home parks as a means of providing balance and variety to
housing in the Town of Grand Chute. All mobile home parks are subject
to the site plan requirements of Article X.
B. Character of tract. Each mobile home park tract shall be suitable for the
development proposed, recognizing and preserving to the maximum
extent practicable outstanding natural features. Every mobile home
park shall be located on a well-drained area, and the premises shall be
223. Editor's Note: See also Ch. 382, Mobile Homes and Mobile Home Parks.
§ 535-61 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-62
1:648
properly graded so as to prevent the accumulation of stormwater or
other waters.
C. Access. Access shall be designed for safe and convenient movement of
traffic into and out of the park. All vehicular traffic into and out of the
park shall be through designated entrances and exits.
D. Streets. All sites shall abut upon a street. For a two-way street, the
width must be at least 32 feet if parking is to be permitted on both sides
of the street, 25 feet in width if parking is permitted on only one side, or
18 feet in width if parking on the street is prohibited. A one-way street
must be at least 14 feet in width and parking is prohibited unless the
width is appropriately increased.
E. Sites. Each site shall be clearly defined and delineated. The basic
dwelling unit shall not occupy more than 33% of the site area and the
basic dwelling unit and all accessory buildings shall not occupy more
than 35% of the site area. Each site shall contain a concrete slab not
less than 10 feet by 20 feet in dimension for a carport or patio; such slab
shall not be required until after the mobile home is in position.224
F. Area and density. A tract of land proposed for development as a mobile
home park shall contain a minimum area of three acres and a maximum

Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
Chairperson or, in his or her absence, the Acting Chairperson may
§ 535-92 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-94
1:671
§ 535-95. Appeals.
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings
of the Board shall be open to the public.
C. Records and decisions. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or
failing to vote, indicating such fact and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record.
All actions or decisions shall be taken by resolution in which the
concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Board shall be
necessary. Each resolution shall contain a written statement of the
grounds forming the basis of such resolutions. Notice of filing of all
actions and decisions shall be mailed to the parties in interest as
determined by the Board.
A. Powers. The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision
or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement
of this chapter. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed
from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination
as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the
officer from whom the appeal is taken.
B. Procedures. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, or board or the Building
Inspector or other administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken
within 60 days of the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from by filing with the Zoning Administrator and with the
Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning
Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
The Board may request the applicant to provide additional information
as may be needed to determine the case.
C. Stays. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken shall
certify to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with
him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by
the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
D. Withdrawal or amendment.
(1) If the applicant elects to withdraw the appeal any time before final
determination is made by the Board, this fact shall be noted on the
application, with the signature of the applicant attesting
§ 535-94 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-95
1:672
§ 535-96. Variances.
withdrawal. Copies of the withdrawn application shall be returned
to the files of the Board, to the Building Inspector or officer and to
the applicant.
(2) Amendment of an appeal by the applicant may be permitted at any
time prior to or during the public hearing, provided that no such
amendment shall be such as to make the case different from its
description in the notice of public hearing. If the amendment is
requested by the applicant after public notice of the hearing has
been given and such amendment is at variance with the
information set forth in the public notice, the applicant shall pay an
additional fee to cover the cost of amending the public notice. If the
amended notice can be published within the time frame specified
for the public hearing, the hearing on the amended appeal may be
held on that date, otherwise the Chairperson shall announce that
the hearing originally scheduled on the case will be deferred to a
future meeting, before which appropriate public notice will be
given, and will state the reasons for deferral.
A. Powers. The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in
specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not
be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in
unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed and substantial justice done.
B. Requirements for a variance. In general the power to authorize a
variance from the requirements of this chapter shall be sparingly
exercised and only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances. No
variance shall be granted for actions which require an amendment to
this chapter. Variances shall only be granted when the Board finds that:
(1) The variance is not contrary to the public interest and that such a
variance will be in general harmony with the purposes and intent of
this chapter.
(2) The variance will not permit the establishment of a use which is not
permitted or permissible in the district.
(3) Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district.
(4) The literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district.
(5) The hardship is not shared generally by other land or buildings in
the area.

the Board or any taxpayer or any officer, department, board or bureau of
the municipality may, within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the
office of the Board, commence an action seeking the remedy available by
certiorari.
(6) The hardship results from the strict application of this chapter and
is not the result of self-created or self-imposed circumstances.

variance, the Board shall fix a reasonable time (not more than 60 days
from the filing date) for a public hearing.

§ 535-108. Special exception permit signs.
(2) Prohibited signs.
(Reserved)
E. Standards for lots zoned PDD Planned Development District will be
prescribed in each project approval ordinance.
A. Purpose. To reinforce Zoning Code standards and provide appropriate
regulation of signage for particular types and intensities of land use,
the Town requires approval of a special exception permit for certain
signs.
B. Applicability. The following signs require a special exception permit, in
accordance with the procedures established in Article XI:
(1) All electronic message center signs, as prescribed in § 535-108C.
(2) Multitenant signs that are eligible for a size and height bonus, as
prescribed in § 535-108D.
(3) Roof signs, as prescribed in § 535-108E.
(4) A second freestanding sign on a lot that abuts any accesscontrolled
county, state or federal highway, as prescribed in
§ 535-108F.
(5) Billboards/off-premises advertising signs, as prescribed in
§ 535-109.
C. Electronic message center signs (EMU).
(1) Sign structure. An EMU may constitute one portion of sign area on
an attached or freestanding sign structure, or may comprise the
total sign area of a sign structure. No EMU may exceed the
maximum dimensions of permitted signs for the sign district in
which it is located. No EMU may exceed 144 square feet of size in
any sign district.
(2) Operation. All dynamic frame effects are permitted, except flashing
and animation. All frames must last at least eight seconds.
Transition effects are permitted. All transitions may last no more
than 0.5 second. All EMU signs must be equipped with automatic
light sensors to adjust sign brightness according to the intensity of
ambient light levels and to maintain compliance with the light
trespass standards in this article.
D. Multitenant signs eligible for size and height bonus.
(1) Intent. To provide effective signage for certain large-scale
developments, while preventing visual obstructions caused by an
excessive number and size of signs in the Community Center sign
district, the public interest is better served by allowing a larger and
§ 535-107 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-108
1:693
taller multitenant sign in exchange for reducing the overall
number, size and/or height of other permitted signs on the same lot
or development area.
(2) Eligibility. Multitenant signs are permitted only in the Community
Center sign district. A lot or development area is eligible to seek a
size and/or height bonus for a multitenant sign under the following
standards and requirements:
(a) No other permitted freestanding signs are allowed along the
same public road frontage on which the multitenant sign is to
be located.
(b) If the lot or development area has additional public road
frontage(s) other than the one on which the multitenant sign is
to be located, that frontage(s) is allowed one freestanding sign
with a maximum size of 100 square feet and a maximum height
of 15 feet.
(c) The lot or development area must meet at least three of the
following five criteria:
[1] Minimum lot size is two acres.
[2] Individually, or in combination with other adjoining lots,
the lot is characterized as a development area.
[3] The lot or development area contains at least 330 linear
feet of public road frontage on one or more sides.
[4] The lot or development area has frontage on more than
one public road.
[5] The lot or development area contains more than one
principal building.
(3) General requirements. A multitenant sign eligible for a size and
height bonus is regulated to a maximum size of 324 square feet,
including any EMU portion of the sign, and to a maximum height of
40 feet.
E. Roof signs. Roof signs are permitted only in the Community Center sign
district. A roof sign may extend a maximum of 10 feet above the roof or
parapet to which it is attached, or no more than an amount equal to
20% of the height of the building, whichever is less.
F. Second freestanding sign (Community Center sign district only). A lot
or development area is eligible to seek a special exception permit for a
second freestanding sign along frontage that abuts any accesscontrolled
county, state or federal highway. A second freestanding sign
is subject to a maximum size of 100 square feet and a maximum height
of 15 feet.
§ 535-108 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-109
1:694
§ 535-109. Billboards/off-premises advertising signs.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section of the Sign Code is to provide
minimum standards to protect the life, health, safety, property, welfare,
convenience, and enjoyment of the general public by regulating and
controlling the location, use, lighting, and maintenance of off-premises
advertising signs. The provisions of this section are intended to
promote the development and maintenance of an attractive visual
environment, while facilitating the communication of messages to the
general public. A further purpose of this section is to mitigate the
aesthetic impact of digital multiple message signs on the visual
environment.
B. Permitted locations. Off-premises advertising signs shall be permitted
only on lots or development areas located in the Community Center sign
district.
C. Existing and reserved off-premises advertising signs. Off-premises
advertising signs (21 total) and associated sign faces (37 total) existing
as of January 21, 2020, are subject to characterization as
nonconforming in accordance with the provisions of § 535-104D.
Additionally, as of January 21, 2020, the Town of Grand Chute hereby
reserves three off-premises advertising signs and six associated sign
faces for future approval and permitting, subject to compliance with the
provisions of this chapter. As of January 21, 2020, including existing
and reserved off premises advertising signs, the maximum number of
such signs permitted within the Town of Grand Chute shall be 24 signs
and 43 associated sign faces. [Amended 1-21-2020 by Ord. No.
2020-01]
D. General requirements for off-premises advertising signs.
(1) No more than one sign, including those with back-to-back sign
faces, is permitted on the same lot. In the case of a sign to be wallmounted,
only one sign face is permitted on the same lot.
(2) Maximum sign size is 385 square feet per sign face if located along
any local, county or state roadway, 675 square feet per sign face if
located on a limited access freeway or expressway, and 300 square
feet if wall-mounted.
(3) Maximum sign height is 30 feet, measured as the distance from the
street center line elevation (at a point perpendicular to the sign) to
the top of the highest attached component of the sign structure.
(4) Minimum front yard setback is 15 feet, measured from the property
line to the outermost physical extension of the sign. No sign may be
erected within 100 feet of a signalized intersection or within 50 feet
of all nonsignalized intersections, unless erected on or against an
existing building.
§ 535-109 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-109
1:695
(5) Signs may not be located within 200 feet of any residential zoning
district boundaries.
(6) No sign may be built within 800 feet of an existing sign as viewed
from any main travel direction of the same street, with the
exception that signs located along a limited access freeway or
expressway must be spaced a minimum of 1,000 feet apart.
Spacing will be measured in a lineal direction along or across the
street, freeway or expressway.
E. Digital multiple message sign operation. Digital multiple message signs
must meet all the requirements of this section and applicable State of
Wisconsin regulations, including the following:
(1) The time in which the message remains in a fixed position can be no
less than eight seconds before changing to the next message.
(2) The transition time, or the time it takes to change to the next
message, must be one second or less.
(3) No sign shall interfere with the visibility or the operation of any
traffic signal or railroad control device.
(4) Movement, flashing, blinking, scrolling and/or animation on any
part of the sign is prohibited.
(5) Audio speakers and all forms of pyrotechnics are prohibited.
(6) Signs must be equipped with automatic dimming capability, and
light produced by such signs must not exceed 0.3 footcandle over
ambient light levels.
(7) The Town of Grand Chute Public Works Department will be
provided key access to turn off a sign in the case of hazardous
glare, interference with the visibility or effectiveness of a traffic
signal or railroad control device, or other hazard caused by the
sign.
F. Mitigation of digital multiple message signs. Since the maximum
number of off-premises advertising signs permitted in Town of Grand
Chute is capped and fixed at the number in the current sign inventory at
any point in time, and because digital multiple message signs display
more messages than a traditional static billboard, in order to receive
approval for a new multiple message sign, mitigation through reduction
of sign inventory must be provided, as follows:
(1) The mitigation credit is one new digital multiple message sign
permitted in exchange for the permanent removal of two existing
off-premises advertising signs.
(2) Each sign face is considered to meet the definition of a sign for the
purposes of determining the mitigation credit.
§ 535-109 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-109
1:696
§ 535-110. Administration and enforcement.
§ 535-111. through § 535-114. (Reserved)
(3) An existing off-premises advertising sign must be a minimum 200
square feet in size to qualify for a mitigation credit.
(4) The signs to be removed as part of mitigation must be in locations
acceptable to and approved by the Town of Grand Chute as part of
the special exception permit for the new digital multiple message
sign.
(5) A new digital multiple message sign installed in the same location
as an existing nonconforming static billboard may be allowed, upon
approval of a special exception permit, without the necessity of a
variance that might otherwise be required.
(6) A demolition permit is required for the removal of each sign being
removed in mitigation of a new digital multiple message sign. A
sign permit for the new sign will not be issued until all conditions of
the associated demolition permit(s) have been met.
(7) If the new digital multiple message sign is not installed within one
year after the issuance of a sign permit, said permit will be revoked
and the special exception permit for the sign will automatically
expire.
A. The provisions of this article shall be administered and enforced in
accordance with the procedures established in Chapter 1, Article III,
and Chapter 535, Articles VIII and IX, of the Town of Grand Chute
Municipal Code. Any sign constructed or maintained in violation of the
provisions of this article shall be declared a public nuisance within the
meaning set forth in Chapter 398. In addition to any and all penalty
provisions under applicable law, the Town of Grand Chute may bring
separate action to abate the nuisance in the manner set forth in the
Wisconsin Statutes.

ARTICLE XVI
Telecommunications Antennas and Towers
[Added 7-15-1997]
§ 535-115. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALTERNATIVE TOWER STRUCTURE  Man-made structures such as light
poles, elevated tanks, electric utility transmission line towers,
nonresidential buildings, and similar alternative-design mounting
structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.
ANTENNA  Any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or
television communications through the sending and/or receiving of
electromagnetic waves.
FAA  The Federal Aviation Administration.
FCC  The Federal Communications Commission.
GOVERNING AUTHORITY  The governing authority of the Town of Grand
Chute.
HEIGHT  When referring to a tower or other structure, the distance
measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other
structure, even if said highest point is an antenna.
PREEXISTING TOWERS AND ANTENNAS  The meaning set forth in
§ 535-116D of this article.
TOWER  Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for
the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting
lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and
television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers,
cellular telephone towers, PCS towers, alternative tower structures, and the
like.
§ 535-116. Applicability.
A. District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article
shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are
installed at, a height in excess of the height limitations specified for
each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and
structures shall not apply to towers and antennas; however, in no case
shall any tower (including antennas) exceed a height of 160 feet.
B. Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased,
or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from
the requirements of this article, provided that a license or lease
authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing
authority.
§ 535-115 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-116
1:699
§ 535-117. General guidelines and requirements.
C. Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This article shall not govern any
tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 30 feet in height
and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station
operator or is used exclusively as a receive-only antenna.
D. Preexisting towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a
permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this article
shall not be required to meet the requirements of this article, other
than the requirements of § 535-117E and F, unless a previous permit
was conditioned upon compliance with new regulations. Any such
towers or antennas shall be referred to in this article as "preexisting
towers" or "preexisting antennas."
A. Purpose; goals. The purpose of this article is to establish general
guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article
are to:
(1) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and
minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(2) Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(3) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
(4) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas; and
(5) Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently.
B. Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an
antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the
installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development
regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot
coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions
of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may
be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are
constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the
provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the
expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
C. Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower
shall provide to the Community Development Department an inventory
of all existing towers that are within a three-mile radius of the proposed
§ 535-116 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-117
1:700
site, including specific information about the location, height, and
design of each tower. The Community Development Department may
share such information with other applicants applying for
administrative approvals or special exception permits under this article
or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction
of the governing authority; provided, however, that the Community
Development Department is not, by sharing such information, in any
way representing or warranting that such sites are available or
suitable.232
D. Aesthetics and lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall
govern the location of all towers and the installation of all antennas
governed by this article; provided, however, that the governing
authority may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals
of this article are better served thereby.
(1) Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any
applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to
the natural setting and built environment.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must
be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with,
the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and
related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4) Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA
or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing
authority may review the available lighting alternatives and
approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
(5) Towers and antennas shall not be used for displaying any
advertising. If FCC rules require that the owner's name be shown
on the tower or antenna, it shall be posted no more than six feet
above the ground on a placard no larger than 1 1/2 square feet.
E. Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of
the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and
antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring
such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards
and regulations within six months of the effective date of such
232. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.

standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance
schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring
towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna by the governing authority at the owner's expense.
F. Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with the standards contained in applicable state and local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from
time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that
a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a
danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the
owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower
into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such
tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may
remove such tower at the owner's expense.
A. General. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted uses
and shall not require a special exception permit. Nevertheless, all such
uses shall comply with § 535-117 of this article and all other applicable
articles. All permitted uses shall require staff review prior to issuance
of any permit.
B. Specific permitted uses. The following uses are specifically permitted:
(1) Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower
(such as elevated tanks, electric utility transmission line towers, or
nonresidential buildings), so long as said additional antenna adds
no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing structure; and
(2) Installing an antenna on an existing tower, including a preexisting
tower, and further including the placement of additional buildings
or other supporting equipment used in connection with said
antenna, so long as any accessory building does not exceed 150
square feet per user.
A. General. The following provisions shall govern special exception
permits:
(1) If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under § 535-118 of
this article, then a special exception permit shall be required prior
to construction of any tower or the placement of any antenna.
(2) Towers and antennas may only be located in the Industrial (IND),
General Agricultural (AGD), Local Commercial (CL) and Regional
§ 535-117 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-119
1:702
Commercial (CR) Zoning Districts, except that amateur radio
towers or antennas may be considered in residential districts.
(3) If a special exception permit is granted, the governing authority
may impose conditions to the extent the governing authority
concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse
effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties.
(4) Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant
submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified
by a licensed professional engineer.
B. Information required. Each applicant requesting an special exception
permit under this article shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled
elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other
documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed
professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all
improvements, including information concerning topography,
frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives,
parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information
deemed by the governing authority to be necessary to assess
compliance with this article.
C. Factors considered in granting special exception permits. The
governing authority shall consider the following factors in determining
whether to issue a special exception permit, although the governing
authority may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or
more of these criteria if the governing authority concludes that the
goals of this article are better served thereby:
(1) Height of the proposed tower.
(2) Capacity of the tower structure for additional antenna equipment
to accommodate expansion or to allow for co-location of another
provider's equipment.
(3) Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries.
(4) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties.
(5) Surrounding topography.
(6) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage.
(7) Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness.
(8) Proposed ingress and egress.
(9) Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as
discussed in Subsection D of this section.
§ 535-119 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 535-119
1:703
D. Co-location.
(1) Any proposed telecommunication tower and tower site shall be
designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to
accommodate co-location of both the applicant's antenna(s) and
comparable antenna(s) for at least two additional users. Towers
and tower sites shall be designed to allow for future rearrangement
of antennas upon the tower, to accept antennas mounted at varying
heights, and to accommodate supporting buildings and equipment.
(2) The holder of a permit for a tower, excepting amateur radio towers
and sites, shall allow co-location for at least two additional users
and shall not make access to the tower and tower site for the
additional users economically unfeasible. If additional user(s)
demonstrate(s) (through independent arbitrator or other pertinent
means) that the holder of a tower permit has made access to such
tower and tower site economically unfeasible, then the permit shall
become null and void.
(3) No new tower, excepting amateur radio towers and sites, shall be
permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable
satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or
structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna.
Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or
structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may
consist of any of the following:
(a) No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering
requirements.
(b) Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
(c) Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and
related equipment.
(d) The applicant's proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing
towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or
structures would cause interference with the applicant's
proposed antenna.
(e) The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to
adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are
unreasonable. Costs that would exceed new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.233

II).
§ 535-119 GRAND CHUTE CODE § 535-119
1:704
§ 535-120. Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of six
months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna
or tower shall remove the same within 90 days of receipt of notice from
the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such
antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the governing
authority may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If
there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not
become effective until all users cease using the tower.
(f) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
E. Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation
requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special
exception permit is required; provided, however, that the governing
authority may reduce the standard setbacks and separation
requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby:
(1) Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower
from any off-site residential structure.
(2) Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements.
(3) In zoning districts other than General Agricultural (AGD),
Industrial (IND), Local Commercial (CL) or Regional Commercial
(CR) Districts, towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located
within 1/4 of a mile of any existing tower that is over 90 feet in
height.
F. Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping
surrounding towers for which a special exception permit is required;
provided, however, that the governing authority may waive such
requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby:
(1) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a mixture of deciduous
and evergreen trees and shrubs that effectively screens the view of
the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The
standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet
wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
(2) In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal,
the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
(3) Existing mature trees growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases,
such as towers sited on large wooded lots, natural growth around
the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
