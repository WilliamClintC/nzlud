PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Janesville, Wisconsin. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through May 31, 2019, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1

Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim C. Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and Amanda Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. David Godek, City Clerk-Treasurer, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

In the interpretation and application of any provisions of this Code, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.

d.  That, if the alleged violator does not make a cash deposit and does not appear in court at the time specified, the court may issue a summons or a warrant for the defendant's arrest or consider the nonappearance to be a plea of no contest and enter judgment under Wis.

Stats. § 800.093. 
(8)  A direction that if the alleged violator elects to make a cash deposit, the alleged violator shall sign an appropriate statement which accompanies the citation to indicate that he or she read the statement required under Subsection (7) of this section and shall send the signed statement with the cash deposit;

Sec. 1-18. - Catchlines of sections; history notes and references. 
The catchlines of sections in this Code printed in boldface type, italics or otherwise, are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section, and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted. The history notes appearing in parentheses after each section and the references and editor's notes scattered throughout this Code are for the benefit of the user of the Code and shall have no legal effect.  
Sec. 1-19. - Effect of repeal or expiration of ordinance. 
(a)  The repeal of an ordinance, or its expiration by virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not affect any right accrued or any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred or any proceeding commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired. 
(b)  When an ordinance which repealed another shall itself be repealed, the previous ordinance shall not be revived without express words to that effect.  
Sec. 1-20. - Prior offenses, penalties and rights not affected by adoption of Code. 
(a)  Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty of forfeiture incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of this Code. 
(b)  Nothing contained in this title shall be construed as abating any action pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the City repealed in this title, and all general ordinances contained in this Code shall be deemed to be continuing and not a new enactment of the same ordinance. This title shall not be deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue or as affecting the liability of any person or as waiving any right of the City under any ordinance or section thereof in force at the time of the adoption of this Code.  
Sec. 1-21. - Rates, charges, and fees established. 
(a)  Unless otherwise provided for, all rates, charges, or fees necessary for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this Code shall be as currently established or as hereafter adopted by motion, resolution or ordinance of the City Council, from time to time. Any rates, charges, or fees established by the City pursuant to the regulations or requirements established herein may be changed from time to time by the Council, and such changes shall both be considered an amendment to this Code. 
(b)  Whenever any provision of this Code provides that a rate, charge, or fee shall be established by the City Council, from time to time, and the amount of such rate, charge, or fee is not expressed in this Code in any dollar amount, then the amount of such rate, charge, or fee shall be the most recent and latest amount established, set or fixed by the City Council by ordinance, resolution or motion.  
Sec. 1-22. - Provisions considered continuations of existing ordinances. 
The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as ordinances adopted prior to this Code and included in such Code, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments.  
Sec. 1-23. - Amendments to Code.

(e)  A motion to reconsider, suspend or rescind must be based upon new information or a change in circumstances, which reason must be articulated by the moving Councilmember prior to vote thereon.

To be adopted or enacted, the matter or action must again be voted on and receive the minimum number of votes required by law.

Sec. 2-493. - Public access to records. 
(a)  Except as provided in Section 2-495, any person has a right to inspect a record and to make or receive a copy of any record as provided in Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1).

(Code 1976, § 2.58.040; Ord. No. 83-322, § 1(part), 1983)  
Sec. 2-494. - Access procedures. 
(a)  A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Wis. Stats. § 19.37. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 2-493(e)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require. 
(b)  Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reason therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance. 
(c)  A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 2-495. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Wis. Stats. § 19.37(1), or upon application to the attorney general or the district attorney. 
(Code 1976, § 2.58.050; Ord. No. 83-322, § 1(part), 1983)  
Sec. 2-495. - Limitations on right to access. 
(a)  As provided by Wis. Stats. § 19.36, the records that are exempt from inspection under this chapter include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law; 
(2)  Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state; 
(3)  Computer programs, although the material used as input for a computer program or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection; and 
(4)  A record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret. 
(b)  As provided by Wis. Stats. § 43.30, public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this section. 
(c)  As provided by Wis. Stats. § 70.47(7)(af), as from time to time amended or renumbered, any and all income and expense data, information, forms and records pertaining to income method valuation and assessment of property provided by a property owner or possessor, or persons acting on his or her behalf to the City Assessor shall be kept confidential, except for persons using the information in the discharge of duties imposed by law or of the duties of the office or by order of a court. The information that is provided under this subsection, unless a court determines that it is inaccurate, is not subject to the right of inspection and copying under Wis. Stats. § 19.35(1) or any other City ordinance notwithstanding. In the event that a property owner or his or her agent or representative makes the information public by appearance or use at a Board of Review hearing, or makes the information public at any other time or place, then such information shall cease to be confidential and shall be considered public, in which event, the assessor and/or his or her staff, representatives and agents may use the information publicly for any purposes, including, but not limited to, at the Board of Review hearing and related proceedings without prior notice to the property owner or possessor. 
(d)  In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Records of deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing; 
(2)  Records of deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or discipline of any City officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a City officer or employee, unless the officer or employee consents to such disclosure; 
(3)  Records concerning strategy for crime detection or prevention; 
(4)  Records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase or sale of City property, investing of City funds, or other City business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure; 
(5)  Financial, medical, social or personal histories or disciplinary data of specific persons which, if disclosed, would be likely to have a substantial adverse effect upon the reputation of any person referred to in such history or data; 
(6)  Communications between legal counsel for the City and any officer, agent or employee or the City, when advice is being rendered concerning strategy with respect to current litigation in which the City or any of its officers, agents or employees is or is likely to become involved, or communications which are privileged under Wis. Stats. § 905.03. 
(e)  If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the legal custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The legal custodian shall confer with the City Attorney prior to releasing any such record. If in the judgment of the legal custodian and the City Attorney there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure. 
(f)  There is no right to access to any record which has been legally destroyed pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 2, Article VIII, Division 3. 
(Code 1976, § 2.58.060; Ord. No. 83-322, § 1(part), 1983)

Chapter 4 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS LICENSING, REGULATIONS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
State Law reference Power of municipalities to prohibit criminal conduct, Wis. Stats. § 66.0107; obscene material or performance, Wis. Stats. § 944.21. 
 
Sec. 4-1. - Preamble; purpose. 
(a)  It is a lawful purpose of the City Council for the City of Janesville to enact regulatory ordinances protecting and promoting the general welfare, peace, security, health and safety of its citizens, and good order of the City and its neighborhoods. 
(b)  The City is empowered to enact such ordinances pursuant to Article XI, Section 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution, and Wis. Stats. §§ 62.11(5), 62.23, 66.0101, 66.0107, and other Home Rule, police power and applicable provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes, all as from time to time amended or renumbered, for the public health, welfare, peace, tranquility, good order and public benefit. 
(c)  It is the purpose of this chapter and its component related ordinances herein to regulate public nudity and sexually oriented activities to protect and promote the general welfare, peace, security, health and safety of its citizens, and good order of the City and its neighborhoods; to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City; to reasonably license such activities to facilitate the public welfare; and to limit the negative, adverse and undesirable secondary effects flowing from such establishments. 
(d)  The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials, or adult entertainment; nor is it the intent or effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or adult sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, nor to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment in their intended market; nor is it the intent or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
(e)  The City Council, based upon the actual experience, studies, findings and reports of other cities, communities and local governments from across the United States, including, but not limited to, Erie, Pennsylvania; Seattle and Renton, Washington; Detroit, Michigan; Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; Los Angeles and Whittier California; Times Square, New York, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Austin, Dallas, Houston, El Paso and Amarillo, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota; to name a few, find that: 
(1)  Adult oriented entertainment establishments and public nudity in such establishments by performers, employees and patrons, can and do contribute to the impairment of the character and quality of surrounding residential neighborhoods; 
(2)  Contribute to the decline and the value of surrounding properties; 
(3)  Contribute to physical deterioration and blight of neighborhoods; 
(4)  Have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses around them and surrounding residential areas, including increased transiency, increased levels of criminal activities including prostitution, promotion of prostitution, rape, sexual assaults, other assaults, other sex related crimes; robbery; dissemination of obscenity; sale, distribution or display of harmful material to a minor; sexual performance by a child; possession or distribution of child pornography; public lewdness; indecent exposure; indecency with a child; sexual molestation; molestation of a child; disorderly conduct; disturbances of the peace; drinking in public; littering; and other violations of the law; 
(5)  Contribute to the impairment of the character and quality of a surrounding residential neighborhood; 
(6)  Contribute to a decline in the value of surrounding properties which in turn could and often do have a detrimental effect upon development, growth of nearby development and tax incremental financing districts; 
(7)  Harm the economic welfare of the communities; 
(8)  Negatively and adversely affect the quality of life in the communities; 
(9)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to unhealthy activities that are generally uncontrolled by owners and operators without regulations and that there is presently no mechanism without this chapter to effectively make the owners and operators of such establishments responsible for the activities that occur upon the premises; 
(10)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located; 
(11)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972). See also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377; 
(12)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77; 
(13)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986). See also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77; 
(14)  Many adult entertainment establishments provide live entertainment in which physical contact between performers and customers, often sexual in nature, occurs and can occur, thus facilitating the transmission of various diseases, including AIDS; 
(15)  In Milwaukee and Kenosha Counties, Wisconsin; the City of Waukesha, Wisconsin; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Newport News, Virginia; and Marion County, Indiana, to name a few locales, it has been found that the viewing booths in adult oriented establishment have been and are being used by patrons of said establishments for engaging in sexual acts, particularly between males, including, but not limited to, intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation and masturbation, resulting in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in said booths; 
(16)  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a sexually transmitted disease which destroys the body's immune system, is fatal, and has no known cure; 
(17)  The viral agents responsible for AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases have all been isolated at one time or another from semen; 
(18)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, genital chlamydia trachomatis, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida; 
(19)  As of December, 1996, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 581,429. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov; 
(20)  In 1989, statistics from the State of Wisconsin had indicated that as of July 25, 1986, 96 cases of AIDS were reported in the State including 54 that resulted in death and that Wisconsin could expect a tenfold increase in reported cases between 1986 and 1991; 
(21)  As of January 1, 1995, the State of Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health is projecting between 900 and 1,300 new cases of AIDS during 1995 and 1996; 
(22)  The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 1997 was 526,653, an eight percent increase over the year 1996. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov; 
(23)  The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the 12-year period 1985-1997 was 387,233. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov; 
(24)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,901,365 cases reported during the period 1993 to 1997. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov; 
(25)  The surgeon general of the United States in his or her report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn; 
(26)  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov; 
(27)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's commission on Pornography (1986) at 377; 
(28)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films. See, e.g., Final report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377; 
(29)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583, (1991); 
(30)  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F. 2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986); 
(31)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns; 
(32)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore non-existent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein; 
(33)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments; 
(34)  The disclosure of certain information by those ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity; 
(35)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter; 
(36)  Such secondary effects are detrimental to the public health, safety, peace, tranquility, and general good order of the community and welfare of the citizens. 
(f)  The United States Supreme Court and various Federal and state courts have held that a local unit of government, such as the City of Janesville, may rely upon and incorporate by reference such findings and experiences into its own findings and legitimate concerns about the adverse and undesirable secondary effects arising from and pertaining to adult oriented entertainment establishments, public nudity therein, crime, prostitution, gambling, littering, and the other adverse secondary impacts described in this chapter, and jointly and severally use such findings and determinations of the United States Supreme Court in previous rulings, as well, including, but not limited to, City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 146 L. Ed. 2d 265, 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697 (1986); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres , 426 U.S. 50 (1976); California v. LaRue , 409 U.S. 109 (1972); United States v. O'Brien, 39 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F. 3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Key, Inc. v. Kitsap County , 793 F. 2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995); South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F. 2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984); and N.W. Enterprises v. City of Houston, 27 F. Supp. 2d 754 (S.D. Tex. 1998), as the basis for content neutral regulation of such establishments and the behavior therein without affecting the substance of verbal or non-verbal speech, with the legitimate intent and goal of reducing or eliminating such negative secondary effects to as great a degree as possible. 
(g)  The Janesville City Council believes that the experiences, evidence and studies from the other cities and communities cited, set forth herein, and/or considered by the City Council in whole, part or summary, are relevant and important in understanding and addressing the secondary effects adult entertainment and oriented establishments can and do have upon neighborhoods, persons, economies, the areas surrounding such establishments and the City of Janesville. 
(h)  The City Council of the City of Janesville rely upon the findings, studies, evidence and experiences of such other cities and communities, and previous applicable United States Supreme Court and other Federal and state court holdings, and hereby adopt and incorporate such findings, studies, evidence, experiences and court rulings and holdings herein by reference as if fully set forth verbatim as part of their findings and basis for this chapter and its regulations. 
(i)  Adult oriented establishments in proximity to residential areas, churches, parks, and schools may and do often lead to an increase in criminal activities in the surrounding areas and the City desires to protect the youth of the community from the deleterious effects such businesses can have on adjacent areas by restricting their close proximity to places of worship, schools and residential areas; and protect its citizens and residents from increased crime, ordinance violations, such as, but not limited to, disorderly conduct, drinking in public, possession of intoxicants by underage persons, public disturbances of the peace, littering, illegal drug use and sales, prostitution and gambling. 
(j)  Among these secondary effects described in greater detail above are the potential increase in prostitution and other sex-related offenses, as well as other crimes and offenses, the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist, health risks associated with the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, and the potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct. 
(k)  The City Council of the City of Janesville recognize they lack authority to regulate obscenity in light of Wis. Stats. § 66.0107(3) and do not intend by adopting this chapter to regulate obscenity, since nudity in and of itself is not obscene, and declare their intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live, totally nude, non-obscene, erotic dancing in bars, taverns and other adult oriented establishments. 
(l)  The City Council recognize that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that nude dancing is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and therefore entitled to some limited protection under the First Amendment, and the governing body further recognizes that freedom of speech is among our most precious and highly protected rights, and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights. 
(m)  This governing body desires to minimize, prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Janesville; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; deter the spread of urban blight; and assure and facilitate the health, welfare, peace, tranquility and good order of the City of Janesville and its residents and neighborhoods. 
(n)  The governing body has determined that enactment of this chapter legitimately promotes the valid goals and intent of minimizing, preventing and controlling the negative and adverse secondary effects associated with such activities, and does so in a content neutral manner while preserving numerous other means of free expression while regulating only certain behavior in a uniform yet limited manner. 
(o)  The United States Supreme Court in the case of City of Renton vs. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S. Ct., 925, 89 L. Ed., 2d, 29 (1986) and Young vs. American Mini Theaters, 427 U.S. 50, 96 S. Ct., 2440, 49 L. Ed., 2d, 310 (1976) have approved efforts by local governments to regulate the location of adult oriented establishments through land use plans. 
(p)  A reasonable regulation of the location of adult entertainment establishments will provide for the protection of the image of the community and its property values and protect the residents of the community from the adverse secondary effects of an adult oriented establishment, while providing to those who desire to patronize adult oriented establishments, such an opportunity in areas within the City which are appropriate for a location of adult oriented establishments, while reasonably regulating the disorderly effects of public nudity as herein defined. 
(q)  Pursuant to the City of Janesville's authority, and in furtherance of the legitimate and reasonable health, welfare, peace, tranquility, safety, good order police power interest intent, goals and content neutral objectives of the City Council as set forth in this chapter and related ordinances, that the City Council hereby find compelling and substantial, it is the intent of the City Council to adopt by ordinance reasonable regulations, including the licensing and restricting the location of adult oriented establishments, as defined herein, to promote the City of Janesville's interest in protecting and preserving the quality of its neighborhoods, commercial districts, and quality of urban life through effective land-use planning, as well as the other legitimate governmental goals and objectives articulated and enumerated elsewhere in this chapter, all of regulations are found the least intrusive. 
(r)  Although the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, the City Council deems it to be in the interests of the City of Janesville to provide for licensing, regulation and zoning of adult oriented establishments, including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult mini-motion picture establishments, adult motion picture theaters and adult cabarets to combat and curb the adverse, undesirable and harmful secondary effects of such establishments. 
(s)  The Plan Commission and City Council of the City of Janesville each separately conducted a public hearing in conjunction with and prior to the consideration and adoption of this proposed ordinance and heard testimony from proponents and opponents of the proposed ordinance, with the Plan Commission recommending the adoption of the zoning code provisions of this proposed ordinance as amendments to our existing zoning code. 
(t)  The proposed licensing, regulation and zoning ordinance jointly and severally serve and directly promote substantial and legitimate government interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication. Based upon the above findings and recitals, the City Council of the City of Janesville hereby adopt this chapter and its various reasonable, content-neutral and legitimate governmental interest components, provisions, re-creations, regulations and amendments.

Such charges shall be in writing and shall be signed and dated by the filing complainant who shall legibly provide his or her full name, address, and phone number, and with reasonable particularity describe the violation. A failure by a complainant to provide any of this information renders the complaint insufficient. A determination whether the filed written charges satisfy these requirements shall be made by the City Clerk-Treasurer before proceeding further.

(Code 1976, § 5.06.040; Ord. No. 82-320, § 1(part), 1982)  
Sec. 6-6. - Licenses; granted; issued; issuance extensions; extension fees; payment of license, when. 
(a)  No alcohol beverage license may be granted by the City Council unless the applicant has filed a written application on the required forms showing that the applicant is qualified to be licensed and that the premises may lawfully be used for the purpose intended. No alcohol beverage license may be issued unless the applicant has paid the license fee in an amount as established by the City Council from time to time, and as set out in the fee schedule that appears in this Code. 
(b)  No alcohol beverage license may be issued by the City Clerk until such license is granted by the City Council. No alcohol beverage license, except a temporary special event fermented malt beverage license, may be issued until the City Clerk has been shown proof of application for a federal special tax stamp, and the premises are inspected and approved by the Health Department, the Fire Department and the Building Inspection Department. 
(c)  Each applicant who has been granted a license to sell alcohol by the City Council shall pay the applicable license fee in full to the City Clerk-Treasurer within 15 days of the date the license was granted. The date a granted alcohol license is to be issued shall be deemed no later than the 15th calendar day after the date the license is granted, not counting the date of the grant. Any failure to timely pay the applicable alcohol license fee in full voids the granted license and renders it of no further force or effect, without the necessity of any further action, review or notice by the City Council. Any applicant whose granted license has been voided under the provisions of this section may not rely upon any previously submitted application for the same premises but shall reapply de novo and follow the procedure required for a new license application. 
(d)  Each applicant who has been granted an original license to sell alcohol by the City Council shall have a period of 240 days to open. After the initial 240-day period the licensee may request one or more extensions of time within which to satisfy all conditions precedent and/or subsequent established by statute, ordinance, policy statement, and/or special condition imposed by the alcohol license advisory committee and/or City Council for issuance of the license. Each extension request shall be in writing accompanied by a non-refundable extension request fee which will be in an amount as established by the City Council from time to time and set forth in the fee schedule that appears in this Code. The fee shall be payable to and filed with the City Clerk-Treasurer. No extension request shall be considered or acted upon without a filed written application, payment of the extension fee, and payment in full of all alcohol fee. Granting an extension is completely discretionary, is a privilege, is not a right and may be granted if good cause and reasonable necessity are found by the alcohol license advisory committee, in which body the authority to review and grant extensions shall be vested. An extension may be granted for a period of time not to exceed 90 consecutive days, the exact duration subject to the discretion of the alcohol license advisory committee. A total of three extensions may be requested and granted if the applicant follows the procedure set forth herein and timely applies and pays the fee for consideration no later than the 15th day of the month preceding the current extension's expiration date. The alcohol license advisory committee may grant extensions beyond the total of three if the alcohol license advisory committee finds the precedent or subsequent conditions cannot be met because of a natural disaster. In the event that an applicant fails to comply with any provision of this chapter, or an extension expires without the issuance of a granted license or without a timely applied for and approved subsequent extension, such granted license shall be void and rendered of no further force or effect, without the necessity of any further action, review or notice by the City Council. Any applicant whose granted license has been voided under the provisions of this subsection may not rely upon any previously submitted application for the same premises but shall reapply de novo and follow the procedure required for a new license application. 
(e)  All fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.

Stats. ch. 125 and of any ordinance of the City and law of the state which may in any way relate directly to the business conducted by such licensee.

Such building or structure shall be constructed under the supervision of an architect or engineer who shall be responsible for its erection in accordance with the approved plans. No permit shall be granted for such structure unless such construction will be under the supervision of an architect or engineer, as required by the Wisconsin Statutes. A written statement to this effect shall be filed by the architect or engineer, with the Building Division with the application for permit.

(2)  In case adequate plans are presented, the Building Inspector, at his or her discretion, may issue a permit for a part of the building before receiving the plans and specifications of the entire building. It shall be unlawful to commence work on any building or alteration before the building permit has been issued. The issuance of a permit upon the plans and specifications shall not prevent the Building Inspector from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans and specifications or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of any ordinance of the municipality or laws of the State of Wisconsin or lawful orders issued pursuant thereto. 
(3)  For the construction of buildings requiring approval of the Department of Safety and Professional Services no permit shall be issued until such approved plans are received by the Building Division. 
(4)  A card signed by the Building Inspector indicating the permit has been issued shall be protected from weather conditions and posted at the job site during construction. After issuance of a building permit, the approved plans shall not be altered unless any proposed change is first approved by the Building Inspector as conforming to the provisions of this Code. 
(5)  The building permit shall become void unless operations are commenced within four months from the date thereof, or if the building or work authorized by such permit is suspended at any time after work is commenced, for a period of 60 days. 
(6)  Before any work is commenced or recommenced after the permit has lapsed, a new permit shall be issued at the regular fee rate. In any event, the work required to construct any building shall be completed within 24 months from the date of issuance of the permit.

e.  Whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made in the application for permit, plans, drawings, data specifications, or certified lot or plot plan on which the issuance of the permit or approval was based. 
f.  Whenever there is a violation of any of the conditions of an approval or occupancy given by the Building Inspector for the use of any new materials, equipment, methods of construction, devices, or appliances. 
(2)  The notice revoking a permit, certificate of occupancy, or approval shall be in writing and may be served upon the applicant for the permit, owner of the premises, and his or her agent, if any, and on the person having charge of construction. 
(3)  A revocation placard shall also be posted upon the building, structure, equipment, or premises in question by the Building Inspector. 
(4)  After the notice is served upon the persons as aforesaid and posted, it shall be unlawful for any person to proceed thereafter with any construction operation whatsoever on the premises, and the permit which has been so revoked shall be null and void, and before any construction or operation is again resumed, a new permit, as required by this Code, shall be procured and fees paid therefor, and thereafter the resumption of any construction or operation shall be in compliance with the regulation of this Code.

This requirement shall supersede the regular building permit requirement set forth elsewhere in the City's ordinances requiring that all work should be completed within two years. The compliance agreement is subject to the public safety and danger to the public determination of the Building Official. The City reserves and retains the right to either proceed under the original raze or repair order, condemnation order, otherwise condemn the building or structure and/or order it razed and removed, raze and remove, and/or cause the razing and removal of the building or structure in the event that the property owner at any time breaches or fails to comply with any of the provisions of the compliance agreement. The provisions of Section 10-241 are in addition to and not in lieu of the remedies for condemnation and/or razing/removal of old, unfit, dilapidated, damaged or deteriorated buildings and structures provided by law. 
(c)  Included by reference. Also incorporated into this section by reference is Section 10-241 as if fully set forth verbatim herein. 
(d)  Restrictions. No building or structure shall be moved into or within the City limits and relocated in any district regardless of the present development of the area, which in the opinion of the Building Inspector due to architectural, structural or other characteristics, would tend to substantially depreciate other property in the immediate vicinity immediately or in its development in the future. Any such restrictive ruling of the Building Inspector may be appealed to the Building Zoning Board of Appeals. 
(e)  Bond required. Before a permit to move any building on the streets is granted by the Building Inspector, the party applying for a permit shall first secure and file with the City Clerk public liability insurance protecting the City of Janesville against any claim, suit, or judgment and cost and expenses and agreeing to save the City harmless against all such claims, suits or judgments and cost in the following amounts:

(g)  In addition to the above requirement relative to insurance, any party applying for a permit shall also file a surety bond in the amount of $10,000.00 conditioned on paying for any damage which may be done to any City street or City property of any kind which may be damaged in connection with preparing for or the moving of the building. 
(h)  A one-story building not over 12 feet in width and not to exceed 22 feet in length, which can be moved by placing it on a truck, may have a permit issued for such moving without filing the above required liability insurance or bond, provided the owner of the truck doing the moving has in force adequate liability insurance covering his or her vehicle and bearing an endorsement including the City of Janesville as co-insured.

The Building Inspector is hereby authorized to make his or her approval conditional upon the reduction in size of the building to be moved in every case where, in his or her judgment, such reduction of said building will aid in preserving the condition of the trees or other vegetation. And in every case, such building shall be reduced in size before being placed upon the street. 
(l)  General requirements. Every moving permit hereafter issued shall be construed as demanding the fulfillment of the following requirements whether stated in such permit or not.

Sec. 10-206. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Building official means the Building Director or his or her designee. 
Salvage means to remove salvageable material from a vacated building or structure for other than personal re-use by the owner of the real estate from which it was removed, without immediate functional replacement thereof. The term "immediate functional replacement thereof" includes, without limitation, functional replacement that occurs as a part of a remodeling process over time pursuant to a valid and subsisting building permit. 
Salvageable material. Real or tangible personal property that: 
(1)  Was manmade; 
(2)  Was affixed with respect to real property; 
(3)  Is detachable from real property; and 
(4)  Has a resale value, either for re-use or as scrap. 
Vacated building means a building or structure having occupiable space of over 20,000 square feet commercial and 50,000 square feet industrial that had a principal commercial/industrial use as its most recent use allowed by law, which principal use has ceased. 
(Code 1976, § 15.07.010)  
Sec. 10-207. - Permit. 
(a)  Permit. No person may salvage from a vacated building unless pursuant to a permit therefor granted by the Plan Commission and issued to the applicant. 
(b)  Permit application. 
(1)  The applicant may be the owner of the real estate, or the contractor hired by the owner. Under all circumstances, the applicant, if other than the owner, and the owner, shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the terms of this chapter. 
(2)  Application for a permit, whether initial or renewal, shall be filed with the Building Division on forms created by the Building Official and provided by the City. The application for a permit shall, at a minimum, comply with Article I of this Chapter. The Building Official, Plan Commission, and/or City Council may require, and the applicant shall provide, additional information of a specific applicant prior to consideration and action on the permit. 
(3)  A permit fee must accompany the application. An application fee shall be paid to the City by the applicant when the one-time permit application is filed in an amount as established by the City Council from time to time, and as set out in the fee schedule as appears in this Code. 
(4)  An asbestos-containing material (ACM) inspection must be completed by a certified asbestos inspector separate from and prior to work under salvage permit. All asbestos-containing materials which require removal prior to salvaging will be removed from the building by a certified asbestos abatement contractor separate from and prior to the start of the work under a salvage permit. A Notice of Demolition DNR form #4500-113 must be completed for all commercial buildings or residential buildings of five or more dwelling units if asbestos is being removed prior to salvage. Proof of DNR approval must be submitted prior to issuance of a salvage permit. 
(c)  Permit grant. The Plan Commission shall consider the permit application but only after receiving the recommendation of the Building Official, which recommendation may not be unreasonably withheld. Prior to making its recommendation to grant or deny the application, the Plan Commission shall consider the application; the report, if any, of the Building Official; the expertise of the applicant; the effect of the proposed operation on the surrounding neighborhood; the effect on the City of having a stripped structure remain if the structure is not proposed to be immediately razed or immediately renovated; the presentation, if any, of the applicant; the comments of the public; and such other matters germane to the decision. In making a recommendation to grant, the Plan Commission shall address the following matters: the amount of the irrevocable letter of credit to be required by the permittee as a condition of issuance of the permit and as a requirement of operation; other state or local permits as required by law, rule, or regulation that must be obtained as a condition of issuance of the permit or as a condition of operation; reasonable special operating requirements to be required of the permittee in addition to those listed in Subsection (d) of this section, herein; and such other matters or limitations as the Plan Commission determines is necessary to protect the public interest. After grant and after all conditions of issuance have been satisfied, the Building Official shall issue the permit to the applicant, who may then be referred to herein as permittee or permit holder. 
(d)  Irrevocable letter of credit. As an additional condition of issuance by the Building Official of the permit, the applicant/permittee shall post with the City Clerk-Treasurer a sight-draft irrevocable letter of credit, payable immediately upon presentment, in an amount required by the Plan Commission and in a form approved by the City Attorney. The irrevocable letter of credit shall name the City as the beneficiary thereof and shall guarantee the timely and full lawful performance by the applicant/permittee of the salvage work and all other actions required by this chapter. The irrevocable letter of credit must be issued by a financial institution certified by the state to conduct such business within the State of Wisconsin, allowing for direct draw by the City upon demand without the necessity for any prior court action or approval by permittee, to complete the work or to repair damage that was the obligation of the permittee. The irrevocable letter of credit must contain, as a part of its provisions, that it remains as an obligation in favor of the City for not less than one year after completion of the last act of salvage by the permittee or after the expiration of a permit issued under this section to the permittee, whichever is later. In considering the amount of the irrevocable letter of credit, the Plan Commission shall consider: the recommendation, if any, of the Building Official; the expertise of the applicant; the longevity of the applicant; the capitalization of the applicant; the scope of the proposed project; the possible environmental hazards that could be created; the effect of the proposed operation on the surrounding neighborhood; the cost of remediation on the City should the City need to address any matter due to the unwillingness, failure, or inability of the permittee to complete its salvage and/or related obligations. Under extraordinary circumstances under which the Plan Commission determines that the requirement to obtain a letter of credit is unreasonable, the Plan Commission may, in the exercise of its discretion, authorize alternate security. 
(e)  Permit term. 
(1)  Initial term. The initial term for permits issued under this section shall be valid for a period of 365 days from the date of issue. 
(2)  Renewal term. A permit issued to the applicant is personal to the applicant/permittee and limited to the term granted. The permittee may not have an expectation in the renewal of the permit. The permits may be renewed at the discretion of the Building Official upon application, by a permittee, filed prior to expiration of the initial term or any renewal thereof. Each renewal may be granted for up to 90 additional days; no more than two renewals will be granted. Renewal is discretionary, not a matter of right, and sets no precedent for other cases for the same or any other person.

Permit holders and property owners shall permit authorized representatives of any department of the City having enforcement powers to inspect, from time to time and at any time, the premises permitted and those proposed to be permitted, with or without advance notice, as often as may be required to permit said departments, the Building Official and/or his or her designee to perform his or her, and/or their duties to facilitate compliance with the permittee's requirements under this chapter, without first obtaining a special inspection warrant. Inspections shall be made. The unreasonable or unexcused failure and/or refusal by any person to permit such inspection shall be grounds for permit denial, suspension, revocation, enforcement, the imposition of fee penalties, the imposition of other penalties, the issuance and execution of a special inspection warrant, and/or such other relief as provided in law and equity, all such remedies being cumulative and not exclusive in favor of the City, its Building Official, and/or his or her designee.

Pursuant to such order, the permittee shall forthwith cause such operation, action, failure, refusal, default, and/or violation to cease in the manner as directed in the order. Failure to maintain insurance, as required, failure to maintain the irrevocable letter of credit, as required, or to permit inspection as required are each separate and distinct per se violations implicating imminent danger to the public necessitating an order to cease all operations and/or for the permittee to take one or more other corrective action. In the event that an order to the permittee requiring immediate cessation and/or other action is issued by the Building Official, et al., such order shall be considered by the Plan Commission no later than at its next regular meeting. The Plan Commission, after hearing from the Building Official, the permittee, other person, and the public, shall affirm the order, reverse the order, or modify the order. The decision of the Plan Commission may be appealed to the City Council by either the Building Official or the permittee.

Disciplinary hearings, including nonrenewal, suspension, revocation, modification, and/or other relief/remedy hearings, shall be held before the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall determine whether the arguments shall be presented orally or in writing, or both. If the Plan Commission, after considering the Building Official's report and any arguments presented by the Building Official and permittee, find the complaint to be true, or if there is no objection to a report recommending a suspension, revocation, nonrenewal, modification, and/or other relief/remedy, the permit shall be suspended, revoked, not renewed, modified, and/or other relief and/or remedy as provided by the Plan Commission. If the Plan Commission finds the complaint untrue, the proceedings shall be dismissed without cost to the accused or City. The decision of the Plan Commission may be appealed to the City Council by either the Building Official or the permittee.

Sec. 10-241. - Old, condemned, dangerous, deteriorated, damaged, dilapidated and/or unfit buildings and structures. 
(a)  Raze or repair order for dangerous structures. If all or part of any building or structure (including, among others, a fence, billboard or sign), or the equipment for the operation thereof (including, among others, the heating plants, plumbing, electric wiring, moving stairways, elevators and fire extinguishing apparatus) is found, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, his or her designee and/or other appropriate City Code Official (hereinafter in this section the "Building Official"), to be so old, dilapidated, damaged, deteriorated or has become so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use, or where there has been a cessation of normal construction for a period of more than two years, he or she may proceed to issue a raze or repair order, or, if he or she determines based upon the particular facts and circumstances that it would be unreasonable to repair the same and/or constitute a safety hazard or a danger to the public, (the public safety and danger to the public determination) shall issue a condemnation order against that building and/or structure. If a raze or repair order is issued, and if the property owner desires to repair said building or structure, he or she must provide to City official the following documents:

a.  The compliance agreement shall be signed by, dated, and binding upon the property owner and shall set forth and itemize all the repairs to be performed by the property owner in order to make the building or structure fit for human habitation, compliant and in full conformity with all applicable ordinances and other laws and regulations. The agreement shall provide a detailed schedule of the work to be done and the timeframe in which each item will be completed. The maximum term for a compliance agreement shall be one year from the date the property owner is first notified of the violation. If all repairs are not fully and satisfactorily completed within the scheduled timeframe, the raze or repair order shall also serve as a condemnation order and agreement. In the event that the property owner at any time breaches or fails to comply with any of the provisions of the compliance agreement, the City may, without any further notice, raze and remove and/or cause the razing and removal of the building or structure solely at the cost and expense of the property owner and/or otherwise condemn and/or remove the building or structure as allowed by law. 
b.  Written bids from legitimate contractors or other sources approved by the Building Inspector and/or his or her designee for repairs and an estimated pricing schedule outlining the costs associated with bringing the building or structure to full compliance.

e.  The property owner must provide a fully completed, acceptable and executed written compliance agreement to the Building Official within 30 days of the happening of the event that caused the damage to the building or structure or issuance of the raze or repair order. Failure to do so shall result in a waiver by the property owner of the opportunity to repair the building or structure or avail himself or herself of the repair opportunities set forth in this and related ordinances, and the City shall either proceed under the original raze or repair order or otherwise condemn, raze, remove and/or cause the razing and/or removal of that particular building or structure. The Building Official upon his or her finding of good cause, may extend the 30-day time period, but in no event shall any compliance agreement be approved or accepted by the City if not provided by the property owner in fully completed, acceptable and executed form to the Building Official within 90 days of the happening of the event that damaged the building or structure. 
f.  The one-year time period within which all repairs must be fully and satisfactorily performed by the property owner shall not be extended by the City for any reason whatsoever. 
g.  In the event that any of the requirements set forth in this article and related ordinances are not fully, timely and satisfactorily complied with by the property owner, then the Building Official shall either proceed under the original raze or repair order, otherwise condemn the building or structure in accord with the applicable condemnation and/or provisions of law, raze and remove, and/or cause the razing and removal of the building or structure. 
h.  The compliance agreement is subject to the public safety and danger to the public determination of the Building Official, notwithstanding any provision of this article or any other ordinance to the contrary. 
(2)  If the property owner elects to raze the building or structure, such work shall be solely at the property owner's expense, completed within three months of the date the building or structure was damaged, and the site returned to a dust-free, erosion-free condition by the owner and otherwise according to law.

Such orders shall be issued in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 66.0413, as from time to time amended or renumbered.

Sec. 10-242. - Vacation of unfit buildings; procedure.

Secs. 24-29924-329. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 10. - REGULATION OF SMOKING 
 
Sec. 24-330. - Intent and purpose. 
The City Council hereby find that: 
(1)  It is recognized and found that smoking of cigarettes and tobacco products is hazardous to an individual's health and may affect the health of nonsmokers when they are involuntarily in the presence of smoking. 
(2)  Numerous scientific studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution. 
(3)  Reliable scientific studies, including studies conducted by the Surgeon General of the United States, have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard to nonsmokers; particularly to children, elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. 
(4)  Health hazards induced by breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function, decreased exercise tolerance, bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm. 
(5)  Reliable scientific studies assessed by the California Environmental Protection Agency have found that sidestream and secondhand tobacco smoke is a leading cause of premature death and disability among nonsmokers. 
(6)  Air pollution caused by smoking is an offensive annoyance and irritant. Smoking results in serious and significant physical discomfort to nonsmokers. 
(7)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that hookah smoking has many of the same health risks as tobacco smoking and can be a health risk by producing secondhand smoke. 
(8)  The American Lung Association has stated that marijuana smoke contains many of the same toxins, irritants, and carcinogens as tobacco smoke and secondhand marijuana smoke contains many of the same toxins as directly inhaled marijuana smoke. 
(9)  While electronic delivery devices are currently unregulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the use by and sale to children of electronic delivery devices containing nicotine (nicotine products) is prohibited by Wisconsin law and Janesville ordinance. 
(10)  Several other states, counties, and municipalities have already taken action to prohibit the use of electronic delivery devices in certain locations. 
(11)  The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network advocates for smoke-free-laws, including electronic delivery devices and supposed nicotine-free electronic delivery devices, in all workplaces to protect workers and the public from the harmful effects of secondhand exposure and states that preliminary studies indicate that nonusers can be exposed to the same potentially harmful chemicals as users, including nicotine, ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds, which could be especially problematic for children, pregnant women, and people with heart disease. 
(12)  A 2009 study by the United States Food and Drug Administration found cancer-causing substances in several of the electronic delivery devices tested and found nicotine in some electronic delivery devices that claimed to contain no nicotine. 
(13)  This division incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, verbatim the factual findings in Section 24-617 relating to synthetic cannabinoid, a.k.a., synthetic marijuana. 
(14)  This division incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, verbatim the factual findings of the states, counties, and municipalities that have investigated, documented, and/or made independent findings and conclusions concerning the health effects and concerns arising from and/or pertaining to smoking as defined in this division. 
(15)  This division is adopted for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, comfort and general welfare of the people of the City of Janesville, especially recognizing the rights of nonsmokers who constitute a majority of the population; educating citizens affected by this division; and assisting individuals and persons in charge in maintaining compliance.

DIVISION 10. - POSSESSION, SALE AND USE OF SYNTHETIC CANNABINOID SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED 
 
Sec. 24-617. - Introduction; purpose; definitions; findings. 
(a)  The Janesville Chief of Police and City Council have determined that herbal preparations powdered or sprayed with a chemical synthetic cannabinoid are available for sale within the City of Janesville that claim to produce intoxicating effects similar to THC or marijuana. THC is the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. 
(b)  While synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid substances are not yet categorized as illegal controlled substances under Wisconsin or federal law, several other countries, states, counties, and municipalities have already taken action to prohibit these substances due to increased overdoses and other negative health effects and concerns. 
(c)  This division incorporates by reference, as if fully set forth herein, verbatim the factual findings of the countries, states, counties, and municipalities that have made investigated, documented, and/or made independent findings and conclusions concerning the increased overdoses and/or other negative health effects and concerns arising from and/or pertaining to the use of synthetic cannabinoids and/or synthetic cannabinoid substances. 
(d)  While these synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid substances are often marketed as benign and legal alternatives to marijuana, they are potentially dangerous to users as the substances can create potency from three up to 100 times greater than marijuana, produce severe adverse health conditions, such as, but not limited to, hallucinations, paranoia, seizures, and vomiting based upon reported emergency room experiences in areas of the country where use is more prevalent, and further that long-term health effects of use of these substances are not yet known. 
(e)  Such substances, also known as fake marijuana and fake pot, are being sold at shops, mostly in the Midwest, under the common names K2 and Spice. The states of Kansas and Missouri, and the country of Ireland, Princeton, MN; North Logan, Utah; Poplarville, MS; Wood River, IL; Allen County, IN; Milton, WI; Eau Claire, WI and La Crosse, WI, to name a few, have each adopted legislation to ban the substance for health, welfare, safety, and peace reasons. 
(f)  Often sold in gram packets for $10.00 to $20.00, K2 and other synthetic cannabinoids are said to mimic marijuana's effects. People smoke it in joints, pipes, bongs, and vaporizers, just like marijuana. 
(g)  One general news article states that Dr. John Huffman, professor of organic chemistry at Clemson, created the compound. That recipe found its way to marijuana users who replicated Huffman's work and began spraying it onto dried flowers, herbs, and tobacco. 
(h)  Products that contain (or have contained at one time) synthetic cannabinoids: 
(1)  Spice, Smoke Blend, K2, Genie, Yucatan Fire, Skunk, DaScents, Sence, Smoke, ChillX, Highdi's, Almdröhner, Earth Impact, Gorillaz, Galaxy, Gold Space, Truckin, Solar Flare, Moon, Rocks, Blue Lotus, Aroma, Scope, Sky, OG, and Potpourri. 
(2)  It's also sold under the names Spice Diamond, Spice Gold, Spice Silver, Yucatan Fire, Zoha, and Zohai. 
(3)  It should be noted that the speed of innovation in this area means that any list of products is likely to become quickly outdated. This division incorporates herein without the necessity of amendment additional names as they occur. 
(i)  The ingredients include Baybean, Blue Lotus, Lion's Tail, Lousewort, Indian Warrior, Dwarf Scullcap, Maconha Brava, Pink Lotus, Marshmallow, Red Clover, Rose, Siberian Motherwort, Vanilla, Canavalia Rosea, Clematis Vitalba, Nelumbo Nucifera, and Pedicularis Grandifolia. 
(j)  Synthetic cannabinoid research chemicals. (This is a partial list of the synthetic cannabinoids that have been used illicitly or may have potential for illicit use in the future): JWH-015, JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-081, JWH-133, JWH-200, JWH-250, JWH-398, CP 47,497, CP 55,244, CP 55,940, HU-210, HU-211, and WIN 55,212-2. 
(k)  Other articles and sources indicate that the most prevalent synthetic cannabinoid is JWH-018, a new synthetic cannabinoid created by scientists to test receptor function in the lab. The synthetic cannabinoid binds with the CB1 receptor producing the euphoric effect or high in humans. JWH-018 binds with CB1 receptors at a rate four times greater than THC (natural or synthetic.) 
(l)  The common marijuana drug tests are calibrated to detect THC and THC metabolites, not the synthetics used in Spice or K2. NORML's deputy director and an expert in drug testing, Paul Armentano, says Spice or K2 users would pass a drug test. 
(m)  The Missouri and Kansas efforts to outlaw K2 in some cases lump it in with Salvia, causing confusion about the two separate drugs. Federal authorities are enforcing a new crackdown on shipments of the cannabinoids and the K2 type products, such as two recent seizures of K2 and JWH-018 at the Philadelphia Airport UPS shipping facility in early 2010. 
(n)  Medications currently containing synthetic cannabinoids: 
(1)  Dronabinol (Marinol). 
(2)  Nabilone (Cesamet). 
(3)  Sativex. 
(4)  Rimonabant (SR141716/Acomplia). 
(o)  Based upon all of the above, it is hereby determined by the City Council that the effects of these substances are jointly and severally health, safety, welfare, peace, and good order concerns to the residents, businesses, visitors, taxpayers, and citizens of the City of Janesville.

ARTICLE II. - STORMWATER UTILITY AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
 
Sec. 32-19. - Purpose and necessity; authorization. 
(a)  The City Council hereby find that the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond the Rock River and other bodies of water within the City is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of the City, its citizens and businesses and others in the surrounding area. All real property in the City, including property owned by public and tax-exempt entities contributes runoff and either uses or benefits from the stormwater system. 
(b)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the sanitary sewer utility operations of the City by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. Surface water runoff may cause nonpoint source pollution, erosion of lands, threaten residences and businesses with water damage, and create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the City. A system for the collection, treatment, and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the City of Janesville and surrounding areas, including those properties not currently served by the system. The cost of operating and maintaining the City stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the City Council hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish the rates for stormwater management services. 
(c)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this chapter, the City is acting pursuant to authority granted by Wis. Stats. chs. 62 and 66, including, but not limited to, Wis. Stats. §§ 62.04, 62.11, 62.16(2), 62.18, 66.0101, 66.0621, 66.080, 66.0811, 66.0813, 66.0703, and 66.0627.

(2)  Construction of an improvement on the property is at least 50 percent completed and such construction has ceased for a period of at least three months, whether consecutive or not. 
(Code 1976, § 13.10.040)  
Sec. 32-23. - Income and revenue. 
The stormwater utility finances shall be accounted for in a separate Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund by the City. All income and revenues shall be retained by the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund. The stormwater utility shall prepare an annual budget, which is to include all operation and maintenance costs, debt service and other costs related to the operation of the stormwater utility. The annual budget is subject to approval by the City Council. 
(Code 1976, § 13.10.050)  
Sec. 32-24. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  Every person shall pay the applicable Janesville stormwater service charge when due for each property owned by that person. 
(b)  The basis for computation of the charge for stormwater services to lots and parcels of land within the City is established under this section.

In the case of multipurpose infrastructure those costs shall be prorated. 
(3)  Water quality component. The water quality component shall include the stormwater utility's adopted annual budget costs associated with the construction, inspection, maintenance, repair, and replacement of all stormwater infrastructure associated with the cleaning or treatment stormwater. In the case of multipurpose infrastructure those costs shall be prorated. 
(d)  Credits may be available to multifamily and nonresidential property owners. It shall be the burden of the property owner to demonstrate to a reasonable degree of certainty with evidence that a fee adjustment is warranted. All applications for credit shall be reviewed by the Director. The Director may reduce the stormwater utility after taking into consideration the evidence provided. The base Component shall be charged to all properties regardless of credits. Credits may be applicable to multifamily and nonresidential properties based on three criteria: 
(1)  Non-contributing property. A non-contributing property is a property that does not contribute any runoff into the City's stormwater infrastructure. These properties may either drain directly into the Rock River or drain outside of the City without passing through a City facility. A non-contributing property may receive credit towards the runoff component of the utility fee. A non-contributing property may also be eligible for credit towards the water quality component but this shall be considered independently and shall be based on demonstrated water quality treatment provided by on-site facilities. 
(2)  Runoff control. A property may be eligible for runoff control based on onsite stormwater treatment facilities. Any credit towards the runoff component shall be calculated based on the extent to which the property controls the 100-year design storm beyond the required peak flow control. This credit shall be capped at 80 percent of the total component costs. 
(3)  Water quality treatment. A property may be eligible for water quality treatment based on on-site stormwater treatment facilities. Any credit towards the runoff component shall be calculated based on the extent to which the property treats total suspended solids storm beyond the required treatment level. This credit shall be capped at 80 percent of the total component costs. 
In order for a property to be eligible for a credit, a property shall not be in violation of any other stormwater or erosion control requirements and shall have recorded maintenance agreement. All credits will expire on July 1 of every even numbered year beginning with 2020. In order for a credit to remain in effect, proper maintenance records shall be submitted to and approved by the Director.

(d)  If a charge and/or late penalty remains unpaid for a period of 30 days after the date of the utility bill, such charge and penalty shall become a lien upon the real property to which it applies, as provided in Wis. Stats. §§ 66.0821 and 66.0809, and other applicable provisions of the Wisconsin Statutes, as from time to time amended or renumbered. 
(e)  Delinquent charges and penalties shall be automatically extended upon the next available tax roll as a delinquent tax against the real property, and all proceedings relating to the collection, return and sale of property for delinquent real estate taxes shall apply to such charges.

The written appeal shall specify all grounds for challenge to the amount of the charge and shall state the amount of charge that the appellant considers to be inappropriate. Failure to timely appeal waives all right to later challenge the charge. 
(b)  In considering an appeal, the City Manager shall determine whether the stormwater utility charge is fair and reasonable under the particular facts and circumstances pertaining to that specific property and, in the event the appeal is granted, whether or not a refund is due the appellant and the amount of the refund.

(a)  The City Council acknowledges that uncontrolled, post-construction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health, safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources. Specifically, uncontrolled post-construction runoff can: 
(1)  Degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion, increasing streambed scour, diminishing groundwater recharge, diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature. 
(2)  Diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish, aquatic life, recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment, suspended solids, nutrients, heavy metals, bacteria, pathogens and other urban pollutants. 
(3)  Alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads. 
(4)  Reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading. 
(5)  Threaten public health, safety, property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers, drainage ways, and other minor drainage facilities. 
(b)  The general purpose of this article is to establish long-term, post-construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health, safety, welfare and the aquatic environment. Specific purposes are to: 
(1)  Further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions. 
(2)  Prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater; prevent and control soil erosion; prevent and control water pollution; protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; preserve ground cover and scenic beauty; and promote sound economic growth. 
(3)  Control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion; and control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter. 
(4)  Minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect the waters of the state. 
(c)  It is the intent of the City Council that this article regulates post-construction stormwater discharges to waters of the state. This article may be applied on a site-by-site basis. The City Council recognizes, however, that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is through the preparation and implementation of comprehensive, systems-level stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units, such as watersheds, on a municipal and regional scale. Such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices, practices or systems, any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state. Where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under Wis. Stats. § 281.16, for regional stormwater management measures it is the intent of this article that the approved stormwater management plan be used to identify post-construction management measures acceptable for the community.

Sec. 34-123. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  In the exercise of governmental functions the City has priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The City desires to anticipate and minimize the number of obstructions and excavations taking place therein and to regulate the placement of facilities in the rights-of-way to ensure that the rights-of-way remain available for public services and safe for public use. The taxpayers of the City bear the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way and a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is the frequent excavation by persons who locate facilities therein. 
(b)  The City finds increased use of the public rights-of-way and increased costs to the taxpayers of the City and that these costs are likely to continue into the foreseeable future. 
(c)  The City finds that occupancy and excavation of its property and rights-of-way causes costs to be borne by the City and its taxpayers, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Administrative costs associated with public right-of-way projects such as registration, permitting, inspection and supervision, supplies and materials. 
(2)  Management costs associated with ongoing management activities necessitated by public users. 
(3)  Repair or restoration costs to the public property and/or right-of-way associated with the actual excavation. 
(4)  Degradation costs defined as depreciation caused to the public property and/or rights-of-way in terms of decreased useful life, directly and/or indirectly arising or resulting from such excavations and related activities thereon. 
(d)  In response to the foregoing facts, the City hereby enacts this article relating to administration of and permits to temporarily excavate, obstruct and/or occupy public property and/or the public rights-of-way. This article imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its public property and/or rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. 
(e)  The further purpose of this article is to provide the City a legal, uniform and reasonable framework within which to regulate, manage, inspect, properly maintain, engineer and regulate excavations, repairs, restorations and related effects and aftereffects of and into the City's public properties and rights-of-way, and to provide for recovery of the reasonable associated costs, fees and expenses incurred in doing so. 
(f)  This article provides for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City as they use public properties and the rights-of-way of the City, as well as to ensure the structural integrity of public property and the public rights-of-way.

ARTICLE XI. - STORM SEWERS 
 
Sec. 36-316. - Construction fees. 
(a)  It is found and declared that division and subdivision of land in the City has necessitated and will necessitate the construction of storm sewers to transport stormwater and other surface runoff; requires construction of increasingly larger trunks as runoff is collected from various areas and brought together to be disposed of; that such a plan requires construction in areas removed from the immediate land being divided and served by the storm sewer; that the benefit to each division of land is substantially equal no matter where on the storm sewer system that land happens to exist; that this required construction is specifically and uniquely attributable to the activities of subdividers; that the ordinance codified in this section is enacted in order to facilitate adequate provision for the transportation of this water; that storm sewers are necessary to the public health, safety and welfare; that the cost for storm sewers is one that should be borne by those that create the need for the storm sewers; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions enacted in this section is declared as a matter of legislative determination. 
(b)  (1)  At the time any plat, certified survey or other subdivision is presented for approval, or at the time a building permit is requested for any parcel that has not paid storm sewer assessment, other than for those areas specifically defined or designated elsewhere in this article, the developer shall deposit with the City Clerk-Treasurer a sum of money to be used to pay for the design and construction of storm sewers and storm drainage improvements. Except as set forth elsewhere in this article, the City shall charge and developers shall pay to the City for the design and construction of storm sewers and storm drainage improvements per acre. The charge shall be in an amount as established by the City Council from time to time, and as set out in the fee schedule that appears in this Code. No such money shall be spent for any purpose except to pay for the design and construction of storm sewers and storm drainage improvements. The total cost shall be computed by multiplying the cost per acre by the total number of acres included in the plat, certified survey or other subdivision. The assessment rate will be evaluated annually and a new rate established each year to assure recovery of not less than 100 percent of the cost of storm sewer design and construction. The City Council shall be advised of the new rate and the City Council hereby authorizes the adjustment and assessment of such rates. 
(2)  a.  The northeast drainage basin is a specifically defined area northeast of and including part of the City of Janesville that due to unique topographic, drainage and related characteristics and factors requires a large 60-acre drainage pond and related extensive and expensive stormwater drainage and sewer work specific to that area and not typical for other areas in and immediately surrounding the City at this time. The northeast drainage basin is defined in Subsection (b)(2)b of this section. At the time any plat, certified survey or other subdivision is presented for approval, or at the time a building permit is requested for any parcel in the northeast drainage basin, the developer shall deposit with the City Clerk a sum of money to be used to pay for the design and construction of storm sewers and storm drainage improvements in the northeast drainage basin. For this specifically defined area, the City shall charge and developers shall pay to the City an amount as established by the City Council from time to time, and as set out in the fee schedule that appears in this Code per acre to be used to pay for the design and construction of storm sewers and storm drainage improvements therein. No such money shall be spent for any purpose except to pay for the design and construction of storm sewers and storm drainage improvements. The total cost shall be computed by multiplying the cost per acre by the total number of acres included in the plat, certified survey or other subdivision. The assessment rate will be evaluated annually and a new rate established each year to ensure recovery of not less than 100 percent of the cost of storm sewer design and construction. The City Council shall be advised of the new rate and the City Council hereby authorizes the adjustment and assessment of such rates. 
b.  The term "northeast drainage basin" means and includes the following areas set forth in the attached map labeled Exhibit A, which map is incorporated herein as if fully set forth verbatim. 
c.  Such deposit shall be made before the involved plat, certified survey or other subdivision will be approved by the City. 
d.  Waiver procedure for storm sewer and stormwater facility charges. 
1.  The City Council may, following recommendation by the Plan Commission, accept and approve a waiver of assessment procedure for the cost of storm sewer and stormwater facilities for a particular subdivision plat or certified survey in lieu of a cash payment at the time of land division approval (Ref. Ordinance No. 71-237). This requires that each individual situation be examined upon its own merits as to whether or not such privilege is in the City's best interest. 
2.  The waiver of special assessment procedure must be requested by the owner, subdivider, or developer in writing at least 14 days prior to the scheduled Council meeting at which the final plat, certified survey, or land division is to be approved. 
3.  Upon request for the waiver procedure, the staff shall calculate the total cost of the storm sewer and stormwater charges according to the prevailing rate per acre. This total charge shall be divided equally to each parcel or lot in the subdivision or certified survey or shall be divided according to parcel area if appropriate because of oversized lots or large sites. The waiver document shall be prepared listing both the total cost and the individual lot or parcel cost. 
4.  The owner of each parcel so affected by the storm sewer and stormwater charges shall sign the waiver document which shall be properly notarized as called for in the document. One hundred percent of the individual owners, and developer must sign the waiver document agreeing to the special assessments to be levied. 
5.  The City Council, prior to approving the subdivision plat, certified survey, or land division should review the storm sewer and stormwater charges and determine whether or not they will require the cash deposit or allow the waiver procedure as requested. If the Council, following recommendation of the Plan Commission, allows the waiver procedure, the subdivision plat, certified survey, or land division can be approved. Immediately following such approval, the Council shall approve the waiver of assessment procedure, thereby levying the special assessments for storm sewer as listed thereon. 
6.  Those lands which fall outside or beyond the provisions of said Ordinance No. 71-237 establishing storm sewer charges, are subject to the charges at the same rate per acre to be levied in accordance with Wis. Stats. § 66.60. 
7.  Exception. An exception to this policy may be made relative to the proposed charges, rates, and waiver procedure when in the judgement of the Council there will be a substantial economic gain to the City. 
(c)  No charge shall be made for any plat, certified survey or other subdivision which receives no benefit whatsoever from storm sewers paid for by such deposits. 
(d)  The Plan Commission shall be the agency which shall review any initial determination made pursuant to this section. 
(d)  This article shall take effect upon adoption, the public health, welfare and good order so requiring.

Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting any individual property owner from requesting or effectuating installation of a sidewalk in front of such owner's property. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this article, each and every property owner shall comply with each and every other code provision pertaining to sidewalks, including, but not limited to, maintenance and sidewalk installation. 
(e)  Any plat, certified survey, or other division of land presented to the City for approval, and as a condition of approval, shall be required to contain and construct sidewalks on both sides of each street including cul-de-sacs set forth in and applied to all areas of the proposed plat, certified survey, or other land division. Sidewalk installation on both sides of the street in all new subdivisions is subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  Where an existing street ends at mid-block with no existing or designated sidewalks, and a certified survey map or plat is proposed to extend that street, no sidewalk shall be required for said new street portion to block corner unless authorized by the City Council. 
(2)  The City Council may modify this section where the sidewalk placement is not physically practical.

Sec. 40-25. - Underground work to be done by City; exception. 
(a)  The laying of water mains, the construction of service laterals in connection with water services, and also any and all necessary underground work in connection with the waterworks distribution system may be done directly by the City without submitting the same for bids. This provision shall continue in force, until otherwise provided by the Council by proper ordinance; however, the rules may provide that repairs and replacements of certain types of laterals shall be done by and at the expense of the abutting property owner subject to City supervision. All such work shall be done in accordance with the City and state plumbing codes. 
(b)  To protect the City and property owners, permits for laying of water services will be issued only to plumbers licensed in the State of Wisconsin. It shall be the duty of the Plumbing Inspector to supervise the installation of water services and require said work and materials to be in accordance with SPS 382.40 and City ordinance. 
(c)  In addition to the Public Service Commission (PSC) Water Utility Operating Rules, no extension of the water supply service shall be made from one building to a separate building on the same lot or parcel and no division of water supply service shall be made at the curb to serve a separate building on the same lot or parcel, except as described in the following sentence. Buildings used in the same business, located on the same parcel, and served by a single lateral may have the customer's water supply piping installed to a central point so that volume can be metered in one place. 
(d)  All water service pipe laid underground between stop box and the meter of two inches in diameter or less shall be of the materials listed in SPS 384. All pipe laid underground between main and stop box shall be Type K soft copper. All pipe larger than two inches shall be PVC or ductile iron pipe meeting the standards of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) for water service. 
(e)  In addition to the PSC Water Utility Operating Rules, when the property requires a larger service lateral to replace an existing smaller diameter pipe, the smaller service must be disconnected at the main by removal of the corporation. The utility will remove the existing corporation and plug the main, but the owner is responsible for the excavation of the water main at the existing corporation and the street repair. In addition, the existing curb box (stop box) must be removed by the owner. The owner is also responsible for all costs associated with the installation of the new larger service lateral from the main to, and including, the curb box. Normally, two or more water services may not be connected together for the purpose of increasing the quantity of water available for a single premise. Two services will only be provided to one facility when required by the State Administrative Code (i.e., certain medical facilities). Existing facilities that do have more than one service to a single premises are required to provide adequate backflow prevention to ensure the safety of the public water supply. 
(f)  When the utility discovers two properties, dwellings, etc., which are fed from one service and the City is involved in reconstructing the street in front of these properties, the property owner, who does not have his or her own service, shall be instructed to connect to a new service provided by the water utility. The property owner shall be responsible for the service from the main to the meter. If two property owners share a water service and the property served by the service requests that the adjoining property be separated, the water utility shall provide a water service from the main to the curbline for the adjoining property and order the adjoining property owner to connect to the new water service. In both of the above two cases, the property owner must connect to this new water service within 12 months of being notified by the utility. 
(g)  Prior to razing any building, or portion thereof, the person to whom a razing permit has been issued shall cause all water services to be disconnected and capped at the curb stop if the service is to be reused, and is of copper, PVC or ductile iron, if, however, the service is not scheduled for reuse, or is of wrought iron, lead or cast iron it shall be disconnected at the main by the removal of the corporation stop unless otherwise approved by the Director, the service lateral shall be abandoned. The utility will remove the existing corporation and plug the main, but the owner is responsible for the excavation of the water main at the existing corporation and the street repair. In addition, the existing curb box (stop box) must be removed by the owner. 
(h)  Requests for the insertion of any corporation valve or tapping valve for a service connection to the utility mains, shall be made at least 24-hours in advance. Tapping for the installation of corporations or valves will not be undertaken when temperatures are 32 degrees Fahrenheit, zero degrees centigrade or below. 
(i)  All water service pipes shall be located within extended property lines of the property served, or on street right-of-way, or other public land, and so installed as not to interfere with other utility lines. 
(Code 1976, § 13.04.060)  
Sec. 40-26. - Meters. 
(a)  All services connected to the water system shall be metered except for fire protection services larger than two inches which may be unmetered. 
(b)  In addition to the PSC Water Utility Operating Rules, all metered customers of the Janesville Water Utility shall allow the installation of a radio reading device. The radio reading device will allow the utility to obtain water meter reading on a regular basis without entering the customer's property. 
(c)  Meters shall be the same size as the service lateral; however, the water meter may be downsized in accordance with applicable City and state plumbing codes; if desired by the owner, provided the minimum meter size shall be three-quarter inch. The property owner and the utility shall confer on the type and size for the premises. The selection shall be based on the water use and be in accordance with City and state plumbing codes. 
(d)  In addition to the PSC Water Utility Operating Rules, all meters must be placed in the basement where a basement exists and shall be placed on the service pipe not to exceed two feet from just inside the building wall line nearest the street in which the connection is made to the utility main. When no basement exists the meter shall be placed in such a location as to meet the following requirements for meters in basements, and the meter location shall be as approved by the water utility. 
(e)  A copper meter horn shall be provided to receive the meter on all services up to and including one-inch services. Meters of 1½ inch and larger shall be provided with a bypass of equal size to the meter. No connection or fitting other than those necessary for the connection of the meter and a bypass, when required, shall be inserted between the curb valve and the meter valve. 
(f)  All meters shall have a stop valve on both the inlet and the outlet sides of the meter and all meter installations requiring a bypass shall also have a stop valve on the bypass. It is the customer's responsibility to maintain the valves in proper working order. Water must pass through a meter except as stated in Section 40-27. Diverting water around the meter via bypass constitutes a violation of this article. 
(g)  If a bypass valve is found open, the Director may require the installation of a locking device or other method of restricting unauthorized use of the bypass. If a locking device is not feasible a meter may be required to be installed on the bypass. 
(h)  No permit will be given to change from metered to flat rate service. 
(i)  The City Plumbing Inspector may at any time order the relocation of existing meter located in pits or extremely difficult areas to access. Water meters shall not be installed below plumbing fixtures nor shall any water meter be installed in a toilet room. Water meters shall not be installed below stairways, landings, showrooms, or other platforms. Water meter service to multi-residential building units shall be readily accessible to City personnel during normal working hours. All meters shall be installed in the common portion of the basement or common utility rooms not located in the individual living units. Where individual meters are desired per living units, the meters shall be clustered or banked together in a common accessible location as noted above. 
(Code 1976, § 13.04.070)  
Sec. 40-26.5. - Replacement of lead service pipes. 
(a)  Purpose. Lead service lines have the potential to leach lead into drinking water. Disturbing or reconnecting to an existing lead service line may increase lead levels in drinking water. Elevated lead levels in drinking water have been determined to cause health problems in young children, pregnant women and their unborn children, and are also potentially harmful to adults.

Sec. 40-170. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
(a)  General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(b)  Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; 
(2)  Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 s.u. or more than 10.0 s.u., or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment; 
(3)  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference; but in no case solids greater than one-half inch in any dimension; 
(4)  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW; 
(5)  Wastewater having a temperature greater than 149 degrees Fahrenheit, or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit; 
(6)  Polar FOG, including, but not limited to, petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in concentrations greater than 100 mg/l and in amounts that will cause interference or pass through;

(Code 1976, § 13.16.070)  
Sec. 40-171. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
(a)  Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 to 471 and Wis. Admin. Code chs. NR 221 to 297. 
(1)  Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the effluent from the process regulated by the standard, unless otherwise specified in the standard. 
(2)  Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to waste streams which are transported off-site for disposal as well as those discharged on-site. 
(3)  CIUs shall comply with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, in addition to complying with the general prohibitions established in Section 40-170, unless specifically noted otherwise in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(b)  Compliance dates. 
(1)  All CIUs, except new sources, shall comply with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards within three years from the effective date of the standard, or within a shorter period of time if specified in the applicable standard. 
(2)  A direct discharger which becomes a CIU after promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard may not be considered a new source unless it meets the definition of a new source established in Section 40-143. 
(3)  New sources shall install, have in operating condition and start up all of the pollution control equipment required to meet the applicable pretreatment standards before beginning discharge. Within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed 90 days, new sources shall meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(c)  Conversion to equivalent mass or concentration standards. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant mass per production unit, the control authority may convert the pretreatment standard to equivalent limitations expressed either as pollutant mass discharged per day or effluent concentration. The determination to convert production based limits is at the discretion of the control authority. 
a.  Equivalent mass per day limits shall be calculated by multiplying the categorical pretreatment standard limit by the user's average rate of production. 
1.  This average rate of production shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term daily production, such as average daily production during a representative year. 
2.  For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production. 
b.  Equivalent concentration limits shall be calculated by dividing the mass limits derived according to Subsection (c)(1)a of this section, by the average daily flow rate of the user's process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the same representative year used in Subsection (c)(1)a of this section. 
c.  When pretreatment standards specify both daily and long-term limits, the same production or flow figures shall be used in calculating daily and long-term equivalent limits. 
d.  Any user operating under an individual wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based categorical pretreatment standard shall notify the control authority within two business days after the user has reason to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user which does not notify the control authority of such anticipated change shall meet the mass or concentration limits in their permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
(2)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, a user may request that the control authority convert the pretreatment standard to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is at the discretion of the control authority. 
a.  The control authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the user meets all the following conditions: 
1.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
2.  Uses control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and has not used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
3.  Provides sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
4.  Does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5.  Has consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b.  Upon approval by the control authority a user subject to equivalent mass limits shall: 
1.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
3.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the control authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in Subsection (c)(2)a.3 of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the control authority shall reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
4.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to Subsection (c)(2)a.1 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c.  A control authority which chooses to establish equivalent mass limits: 
1.  Shall calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, shall reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section 40-177. The user must also be in compliance with Section 40-452 regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
d.  A control authority may not express limits in terms of mass for pollutants such as pH, temperature, radiation or other pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass. 
(3)  The control authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455, and Wis. Admin. Code chs. NR 233, 235, 279 to equivalent concentration limits. The determination to convert mass limits to equivalent concentration limits is at the discretion of the control authority. 
a.  The control authority shall use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR 414, 419, and 455, and Wis. Admin. Code chs. NR 233, 235, 279 when converting such limits to concentration limits; and 
b.  The control authority shall document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment pursuant to Section 40-177. 
(4)  The user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in Subsection (c) of this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived once incorporated into its individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(d)  Compensation for pollutants in intake water. 
(1)  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the CIU's intake water if the applicable categorical pretreatment standards specifically provide that they may be applied on a net basis or if the CIU demonstrates to the control authority that: 
a.  The control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters; 
b.  The constituents of non-conventional pollutants, such as BOD, TSS, and FOG, in a CIU's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of a non-conventional pollutants in the intake water; 
c.  The intake water is drawn from the same water body as the water body to which the POTW discharges. 
(2)  The control authority shall grant credits only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards, up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. The control authority may require additional monitoring to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with the adjusted standards. 
(e)  Combined waste stream formula. 
(1)  Where effluent from a process regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be established by the control authority. These alternative limits shall apply to the mixed effluent. 
a.  The control authority shall calculate both an alternative daily maximum and alternative monthly average values using the respective daily maximum or monthly average values specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards. 
b.  The CIU shall comply with the alternative daily maximum and alternative monthly average limits approved by the control authority until the control authority modifies the limits or approves a CIU modification request. 
1.  Modification is authorized whenever there is a material or significant change in the values used in the calculation to fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant. 
2.  The CIU shall immediately report any such material or significant change to the control authority. 
3.  Where appropriate, new alternative categorical limits shall be calculated within 30 days. 
(2)  The alternative limit for a specified pollutant will be derived by use of formulas in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(f)  Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
(g)  Fundamentally different factors variances. 
(1)  Any interested person believing that factors relating to an industrial user are fundamentally different from the factors considered during development of a categorical pretreatment standard applicable to that industrial user, and that the existence of those factors justifies a different discharge limit from that specified in the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, may request a fundamentally different factors variance under this section. Such a variance request may be initiated by the EPA. 
(2)  A request for a fundamentally different factors variance may be approved only if: 
a.  Factors relating to the industrial user which would be affected by the variance are fundamentally different from the factors considered in establishing the applicable categorical pretreatment standard; 
b.  There is an applicable categorical pretreatment standard which specifically controls the pollutant for which alternative limits have been proposed; and 
c.  The procedural requirements of this section have been met. 
(3)  A request for a fundamentally different factors variance to establish limits less stringent than required by the categorical pretreatment standard may be approved only if: 
a.  The alternative limit requested is no less stringent than justified by the fundamental difference; 
b.  The alternative limit will not result in a violation of any prohibited discharge standard set forth in or established under Section 40-170; 
c.  The alternative limit will not result in an environmental impact not related to water quality which would be fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the categorical pretreatment standard; and 
d.  Compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard would result in either a removal cost wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the standard or an environmental impact not related to water quality which would be fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the standard. 
(4)  A request for a fundamentally different factors variance to establish limits more stringent than required by the categorical pretreatment standard may be approved only if: 
a.  The alternative limit requested is no more stringent than justified by the fundamental difference; and 
b.  Compliance with the alternative limit would not result in either a removal cost wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the standard or an environmental impact not related to water quality which would be fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during the development of the standard. 
(5)  Factors considered fundamentally different are: 
a.  The nature or quality of pollutants contained in the industrial user's raw process wastewater; 
b.  The volume of the industrial user's process wastewater and the volume of effluent discharged; 
c.  The environmental impact, other than that related to water quality, of control and treatment of the industrial user's raw process wastewater; 
d.  The energy requirements of the application of control and treatment technology; 
e.  Age, size, and configuration of the industrial user's equipment, facilities, production processes and process changes, availability of land, and engineering aspects of the application of control technology; and 
f.  The cost of compliance with required control technology. 
(6)  Factors which may not be considered fundamentally different are: 
a.  The feasibility of installing the required pretreatment equipment within the time allowed by the categorical pretreatment standard; 
b.  The assertion that the standard cannot be achieved with the appropriate pretreatment equipment installed, if such assertion is not based on factors listed in Subsection (g)(5) of this section; 
c.  The industrial user's ability to pay for the required pretreatment equipment; or 
d.  The impact of a discharge on the quality of the POTW's receiving water. 
(7)  Requests for a variance shall be submitted in writing to the DNR within 180 days after the effective date of the federal categorical pretreatment standard. If the industrial user has requested a categorical determination under Wis. Admin. Code NR 211.33 the request for a fundamentally different factors variance may be delayed to within 30 days after the final decision on the category determination has been made. Variance requests shall include the following: 
a.  The name and address of the person making the request; 
b.  Identification of the interest of the person making the request; 
c.  Identification of the POTW receiving the indirect discharge from the industrial user for which the variance is requested; 
d.  Identification of the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to the industrial user; 
e.  A list of each pollutant for which an alternative discharge limit is sought; 
f.  The alternative discharge limits being proposed for each pollutant identified in Subsection (g)(7)e of this section; 
g.  A description of the industrial user's existing pretreatment equipment; 
h.  A schematic flow chart of the industrial user's water system, including water supply, process wastewater systems, and points of discharge; and 
i.  A statement of facts clearly establishing why the variance request should be approved, including detailed supporting data, documentation and evidence necessary to fully evaluate the merits of the request. 
(8)  The DNR will act only on written requests for variances which contain all of the information required in Subsection (g)(7) of this section. Persons who submit incomplete requests will be notified that the requests are deficient and will be given 30 days to correct the deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within 30 days, or within an extended period if allowed by the DNR, the request for the variance shall be denied. 
(9)  The DNR shall publish a notice of its receipt of a request for a fundamentally different factors variance and shall mail copies of the notice to the affected industrial user and any other interested party. The public notice shall be published as a Class I notice under Wis. Stats. ch. 985, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the industrial user is located. The department shall allow a 30-day period for public review and comment. 
(10)  If the DNR finds that fundamentally different factors do not exist, the DNR shall deny the request. If the DNR finds that fundamentally different factors do exist, the request and findings shall be forwarded to the EPA for the EPA's approval, disapproval, or revision and approval of the variance. A copy of the final determination shall be sent to the person requesting the variance, and to the affected industrial user and POTW. 
(Code 1976, § 13.16.080)  
Sec. 40-172. - State pretreatment standards. 
Users must comply with the Wisconsin general pretreatment requirements codified at Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 211 and any applicable categorical effluent limitations codified at Wis. Admin. Code chs. NR 220 through 299. 
(Code 1976, § 13.16.090)  
Sec. 40-173. - Janesville local limits. 
(a)  The control authority is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c) and Wis. Admin. Code NR 211.10(3). 
(b)  A local limit evaluation is an extensive study conducted to evaluate the impact of nonresidential dischargers in relationship to Janesville POTW plant NPDES requirements. Various potentially limiting environmental criteria were considered relative to the local limits evaluation. These criteria encompassed the NPDES standards, water quality standards, discharge levels causing inhibition, upset, pass through, and sludge disposal standards. Additional criteria considered are worker health and safety issues, air emissions, domestic background levels, operational removal efficiencies, comparison to categorical standards as well as other POTW limits. 
(c)  Local limits are legally enforceable values that when exceeded by a user will result in an administrative enforcement action. 
(d)  The following pollutant guidelines are established generally for the non-toxic or more conventional pollutants. These guidelines are used as benchmarks for nonresidential users because the treatment is more of a loading issue than a toxicity issue. 
(1)  Guideline concentrations may incur or be assessed a surcharge; defined as additional charges to recover the cost associated to treat wastewater concentrations above a defined value, as promulgated in Article VII of this chapter. 
(2)  Should a user continually exceed guideline values and require classification as a SIU, guideline concentrations or alternatives may be incorporated into an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit and shall be enforceable as local limits. 
Janesville local guidelines. 
Pollutant 	Guideline (mg/l) 
Ammonia nitrogen 	Reserved 
BOD 5 	250 
FOG nonpolar 	300 
FOG polar 	100 
Total selenium 	7.8 
Total suspended solids 	300 
 
(e)  The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following the duration: daily maximum limit. 
Janesville local limits 
Pollutant 	Local Limit (mg/l) unless expressed otherwise 
Arsenic 	1.1 
Cadmium 	1.4 
Chromium 	9.5 
Copper 	2.4

(1)  The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The control authority may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations above. 
(2)  Exclusive of the phosphorus daily maximum limit, any user discharging above the normal phosphorus concentration of eight mg/l which causes or significantly contributes to a NPDES permit violation will constitute a local limit violation. The control authority may levy monetary penalties upon any user for additional cost incurred by the POTW to process, treat and remove phosphorus above normal concentration. 
(3)  Users may apply for the phosphorus mass based daily maximum limit in lieu of the concentration based phosphorus daily maximum limit. 
a.  Applicants shall comply with all terms of the pollutant minimization assessment described in Section 40-211. 
b.  Users which do not apply for the phosphorus mass based daily maximum limit remain subject to the phosphorus concentration based daily maximum limit. 
(f)  The control authority may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement local limits.

In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(b)  The control authority may authorize a user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(2)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
(4)  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by the user's authorized representative as defined in Section 40-143, and include the certification statement in Section 40-304(a). 
(5)  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(6)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control authority must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the control authority for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
(7)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the control authority, the user must certify on each report with the statement in Section 40-304(c), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the user. 
(8)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of Subsection (a) of this section, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control authority, and notify the control authority. 
(9)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(c)  The control authority may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by where the user's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:

The control authority may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the control authority and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail at least 14 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user as defined in Section 40-143 and required by Section 40-239(a). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1976, § 13.16.550)  
Sec. 40-358. - Compliance orders. 
When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed, properly operated and maintained. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1976, § 13.16.560)  
Sec. 40-359. - Cease and desist orders. 
(a)  When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the control authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(b)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1976, § 13.16.570)

DIVISION 11. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 
 
Sec. 40-450. - Accidental discharge upset. 
The term "accidental discharge upset" is defined as an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with either categorical or local pretreatment standards and requirements because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An accidental discharge upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(1)  An accidental discharge upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with either categorical or local pretreatment standards if the user demonstrates through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that the following requirements: 
a.  An accidental discharge upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has followed the procedures identified in reporting potential problems as promulgated in Section 40-297 and has submitted the following information to the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the accidental discharge upset or, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(2)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with either categorical or local pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(3)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an accidental discharge upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(Code 1976, § 16.16.690)  
Sec. 40-451. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 40-170(a) or the specific prohibitions in Section 40-170(b)(3) through (8) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City POTW was regularly in compliance with its WPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Code 1976, § 16.16.700)  
Sec. 40-452. - Bypassing. 
(a)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions identified hereafter. 
(b)  Bypass notifications. 
(1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  The user shall follow the procedures identified in reporting potential problems as promulgated in Section 40-297 and shall submit the following information to the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards or, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the bypass discharge and contributing factors causing the bypass; 
b.  The duration of bypass, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the bypassing is expected to continue; 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. 
The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(c)  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage which includes substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production; 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(3)  The user submitted notices as required under Subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed under Subsection (c) of this section.

(2)  Existing installations. The POTW control authority or City Plumbing Inspector may require the installation of a grease or sand interceptor for existing plumbing installations where the waterway of a drain system or sewer system is reduced or filled due to sand or congealed grease, or where sand or congealed grease impairs the proper functioning or the sewer system. 
(3)  Exterior grease interceptors shall receive the entire waste discharge from kitchens or food processing areas. Every exterior interceptor shall be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with the standards contained in the state and City plumbing codes, as from time to time amended or renumbered. 
(4)  No POTW user may intentionally or unintentionally allow the direct or indirect discharge of any FOG of animal or vegetable origin into the POTW system in such amount as to cause interference and/or harm of any kind with or to the City wastewater collection or treatment system, or as to cause one or more pollutants to pass through the treatment works into the environment. 
(5)  All users with a grease and/or sand interceptor must adhere to all the requirements, procedures, and detailed recordkeeping to ensure compliance with the requirements of this article. All users shall maintain such records for not less than seven years and every user shall render the records available for inspection by a representative of the POTW during normal business hours. An accurate, complete, and daily updated maintenance log shall be kept by every user that indicates, at a minimum: 
a.  Date the interceptor was serviced. 
b.  Name of person or company servicing the interceptor. 
c.  Method of cleaning. 
d.  Disposal method of FOG or sand. 
(6)  Cleaning schedules. 
a.  Grease and sand interceptors shall be cleaned as often as necessary to ensure that sediment and floating materials do not accumulate to impair the efficiency of the interceptor; to ensure the discharge is in compliance with local discharge limits as identified in Section 40-173(d)(3); and so that no visible grease is observed in the discharge. 
b.  Grease interceptors shall be completely evacuated at least annually, or more frequently when: 
1.  25 percent or more of wetted height of the grease interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the device to the invert of the outlet pipe, contains floating materials, sediment, fats, oils, or greases; or 
2.  The discharge exceeds BOD, TSS, FOG, PH, or other pollutant levels established by the POTW; or if there is a history of noncompliance. 
(7)  Any person who owns or operates a grease interceptor may submit to the POTW a request in writing for an exception to the 30, day cleaning frequency of their grease interceptor. The POTW may grant an extension for required cleaning frequency on a case-by-case basis when: 
a.  The grease interceptor owner/operator has demonstrated that the specific interceptor shall produce an effluent, based on defensible analytical results, in consistent compliance with established local discharge limits such as BOD, TSS, FOG, and other parameters as determined by the POTW; or 
b.  Less than 25 percent of the wetted height of the grease interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the device to the invert of the outlet pipe, contains floating materials, sediment, fats, oils, or greases. 
(8)  Prohibited practices. No person shall introduce, permit, or cause the introduction of any surfactant, solvent, or emulsifier into a grease interceptor.

(b)  See Section 40-143 for additional definitions. 
(Code 1976, § 13.18.020)  
Sec. 40-534. - Sewer service charges, generally. 
(a)  There is levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building, premises or unit having a connection with the public sewer system, a sewer charge based upon the quantity of wastewater discharged, as measured by the Janesville Water Utility. Unless metered and showing otherwise, it shall be assumed that the quantity of wastewater discharged into the public sewer system is the same as the quantity of water used by the particular lot, parcel of land, building, premises or unit. If any person discharging wastewater into the public sewer system procures any part or all of his or her water from sources other than the City water utility, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall, at his or her expense, provide a suitable location and proper connections for the installation of a water meter provided by the utility, for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. Such sewer service charge for each quarter shall be in an amount as established by the City Council from time to time, and as set out in the fee schedule that appears in this Code. 
(b)  Clear water/deduct meter. The customer may, in an effort to reduce wastewater charges, measure the water supplied by the City water utility which does not enter the sanitary sewer collection system, through the use of an additional clear water meter. The person shall, at his or her own expense, provide a suitable location and proper connections to allow the installation of a water meter and transmitter purchased from, and installed by, the City water utility. Wastewater charges will be reduced by using the volume of flow not entering the sanitary sewer with the current wastewater rates. The cost of testing, maintenance, and replacement of the clear water meter shall be included in the following fixed fees. Meter and transmitter upgrade fee for five-eighths inch and three-quarter inch meters, $156.00. This is a one-time fee to upgrade the meter, if needed, and transmitter to a radio reading system. This fee can be paid in one payment or spread over five years at $10.00/quarter.

Sec. 40-535. - Industrial and commercial surcharge. 
(a)  Imposition. All persons, firms, corporations, institutions, or organizations discharging wastes into the public sewers shall, if their sewage has a concentration greater than "normal" concentrations, be considered an industrial discharger and subject to the requirements of Section 40-208. The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the City in removing the excess biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids. 
(b)  Computation. The excess pounds of BOD and suspended solids will be computed by multiplying the flow volume in million gallons per day (MGD) by the constant 8.345, and then multiplying the product by the difference between the person's concentrations of BOD and suspended solids and the aforementioned normal concentrations in parts per million by weight.

(2)  No alteration of a conditional use shall be permitted unless approved by the Plan Commission, except that the Building Division Director may issue permits for minor alterations or additions which are approved, by the City Planner, and are compatible with the concept approved by the Plan Commission and the standards in Subsection (g) of this section. This subsection shall not apply to additions or alterations to two-family dwellings within an R1 or R2 District if the addition complies with all zoning ordinance standards of the district. 
(i)  Revocation and extension. In any case where a conditional use has not been established within one year after the date of issuance of the permit, then without further action by the Plan Commission and without notice to the applicant, the conditional use permit shall become null and void unless substantial building construction has commenced. However, the permit holder may apply to the Plan Commission for an extension of this time requirement. The Plan Commission may, in its discretion, grant, deny, condition or modify such time extension request, but such extension shall not exceed one year. If a conditional use permit becomes void under the provisions of this section, the City Planner shall remove such permit from the official zoning district map. 
(j)  Applicability. For any use in existence at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, which becomes a conditional use because of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, such use shall be deemed to be a permitted conditional use and shall be granted a conditional use permit by the Plan Commission or, for mobile home courts or travel trailer camps, the City Council. Application for a conditional use permit and a hearing before the Plan Commission for City Council shall not be required for conditional use permits under this subsection and such permit shall be deemed to have been granted upon adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

(c)  Design standards. 
(1)  Parcel size. Planned unit developments shall be established on parcels of land which are suitable for and of sufficient size to allow for a mixture of housing types, adequate open spaces, appropriate recreational facilities, separate vehicular facilities, and pedestrian circulation systems. The contiguous land area of each PUD shall be at least two acres in size except that the Plan Commission may, at its discretion, reduce this requirement to one acre. For a traditional neighborhood planned unit development, the minimum area shall be at least 40 acres in size, except that the Plan Commission may at its determination, reduce this requirement to 20 acres if the site is defined by a significant physical feature including, but not limited to a greenbelt, large park space, woodland area, drainage creek, river or state or federal highway. 
(2)  Green area. 
a.  Green area for residential planned unit developments. The green area requirement for residential planned unit developments shall be the same as that required in the underlying zoning district. Such area shall be used for recreational, park or environmental amenity for collective enjoyment by occupants of the development, but shall not include buildings, public or private streets, off-street parking lots, or drives. However, up to 50 percent of the required green area may be composed of privately owned properties which shall be restricted either on the plat, final development plan, text agreement, or some other appropriate recordable agreement so as to ensure that the green area will be permanent. The requirements of this subsection may be reduced or waived by the Plan Commission for redevelopment programs. 
1.  Dimension. Green area must exist in quantities of not less than 6,000 square feet in area nor less than 50 feet in its smallest dimension. 
2.  Location. Green area shall be reasonably accessible to all the residents of the planned unit development and shall be distributed equitably throughout the project in relation to the dwelling units of the people they are intended to serve. Large open spaces may be enhanced by walkway systems linking them to one another. 
b.  Green area for business, office/residence or industrial planned unit developments. 
1.  Area. Not less than 20 percent of the lot area shall be permanently placed in green area. Green area includes landscaping such as grass, shrubs, bushes, rock gardens, trees, flowers (including the pedestrian mall of a shopping center). Such green area shall be permanently set aside, planted and maintained and not encroached upon. 
2.  Buffer screen planting. A buffer screen planting shall be provided as required in Section 42-442(a)(9) or 42-443(a)(6), as appropriate. 
(3)  Density and uses. 
a.  Permitted uses. Any use or conditional use permitted in the underlying zoning district in which the planned unit development is proposed to be located may be permitted within a planned unit development by means of an approved conditional use permit. 
b.  Density. Lots within a PUD may be permitted a reduction in size or area to permit the clustering of dwelling units for an even exchange for common open spaces; however, the gross project density shall be no greater than permitted in the underlying zoning district regulations. For the purpose of computing the maximum density for a PUD, the minimum lot size requirements in the underlying zoning district, for the size and type of unit desired, shall be divided into the gross project area. 
(4)  Building spacing and yard requirements. There shall be no minimum setback or lot coverage or lot width. Each structure shall be at least 16 feet from any adjoining structure. No building shall be located closer than 25 feet from the boundary of the PUD. 
(5)  Design standards for traditional neighborhood planned unit developments. The design standards for traditional neighborhood planned developments shall follow the principles of a document identified as "A Model Ordinance for Traditional Neighborhood Development," dated December 2000, and published by the University of Wisconsin Extension pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 66.1027(2). Said document shall not be the exclusive guide for consultation regarding this type of development. City staff and the Plan Commission may consult other sources of information, including the City's Zoning and Infrastructure Standards for evaluating this type of development. 
(d)  Environmental design. The location of trees must be considered when planning the green area, open space, location of buildings, underground services, walks, paved areas, playgrounds, parking areas and finished grades. 
(1)  A general landscaping plan shall be required at the time of submission of the preliminary development plan to be followed by a detailed landscaping plan at the time of submission of the final development plan showing the spacing sizes and specific types of landscaping material and treatment of recreational areas. 
(2)  A general grading plan shall be required at the time of submission of the preliminary development plan to be followed by a detailed grading plan at the time of submission of the final development plan showing the earth-moving procedures and other changes to the landscape in order to preserve and prevent despoliation of the character of the area to be retained as green area. 
(e)  Traffic circulation. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to permit smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. The pedestrian circulation system shall be designed so as to be as completely separate as possible from the vehicular street system in order to provide separation of pedestrian and vehicular movement. 
(f)  Private streets. Standards of design and construction for roadways within the planned unit development may be modified as is deemed appropriate by the Plan Commission after receiving a recommendation by the City Engineer. 
(g)  Parking. The provisions of Section 42-360 pertaining to off-street parking shall apply to planned unit developments.

ARTICLE VIII. - SOLAR ACCESS PERMITS 
 
Sec. 42-303. - Statement of findings and purpose. 
(a)  The City Council of the City of Janesville finds that: 
(1)  Diminishing supplies of nonrenewable energy resources threaten physical economic well-being of the residents of this community who presently rely on such resources to maintain their homes, industries, businesses and institutions; 
(2)  Solar energy systems hold great promise for the future energy needs of this community because they use a renewable energy resource; and because they do not pollute the community's water and air; and 
(3)  The successful use of solar energy systems for such purposes as supplying space heating, water heating or the production of electricity is dependent upon sufficient access to direct sunlight. 
(b)  This chapter is adopted under authority contained in Wis. Stats. § 66.0403, for the purpose of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community by: 
(1)  Promoting the use of solar energy systems; 
(2)  Protecting access to sunlight for solar energy systems; and 
(3)  Ensuring that potentially conflicting interests of individual property owners are accommodated to the greatest extent possible, compatible with the overall goal of this article.

(Code 1976, § 18.32.040)  
Sec. 42-358. - Nonconforming buildings, structures and uses. 
(a)  Statement of purposes. This chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of those districts that those nonconforming buildings, structures and uses be discontinued or reduced to conformity as soon as the fair interests of the parties will permit, or be permitted to continue with certain restrictions. The purpose of this section is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures and uses shall be permitted to continue. 
(b)  Authority to continue. Any nonconforming building, structure or use which existed lawfully at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived and which remains nonconforming and any building, structure, use or land which shall become nonconforming upon the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived and any building, structure, use or land which becomes nonconforming upon annexation to the City may be continued subject to the regulations which follow. 
(c)  Change of nonconforming use. The nonconforming use of a building, structure or land may be changed to a use that is permitted in the type of district in which the nonconforming building, structure or use is located. After holding a public hearing in accordance with Section 42-272(e), the Plan Commission may authorize a change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use of the same district classification in which the existing nonconforming use would normally be a permitted use, or change an existing nonconforming use to a use more appropriate in the type of district in which it is located, if the Plan Commission finds that such changed use will not be contrary to the purposes listed in Section 42-273. 
(d)  Repairs, alterations and expansion. 
(1)  Repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming building or structure, provided that no structural alterations are made which increase the bulk of the nonconforming building or structure, unless such a structural alteration and the use thereof, conforms to all the regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located. 
(2)  The nonconforming use of part of a building or structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is located, may be extended throughout the building or structure in which the use is presently located, but no changes or structural alterations which increase the bulk of the nonconforming building or structure shall be made unless such changes or structural alterations and the use thereof, conform to all the regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located. 
(3)  The nonconforming use of part of a building or structure, all or substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a use permitted in the district in which it is located, shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of such building or structure, nor changed to any other nonconforming use. 
(4)  The nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be expanded or extended beyond the area it occupies. 
(5)  Construction, reconstruction, remodeling and expansion of a detached residential garage which is used solely for residential storage is permitted on land whose principal use is residential and nonconforming. The size of such garage may not exceed 24 feet by 24 feet. 
(6)  The expansion of any one-family or two-family dwelling unit which was lawful prior to the adoption of this chapter but which subsequently became a nonconforming use as a direct result of the adoption of this chapter shall be permitted. Only one such expansion shall be allowed over the useful life of the dwelling unit. Such expansion shall be no more than 150 square feet of gross floor area. 
(7)  Subsection (d) of this section shall not limit the repair, reconstruction, renovation, remodeling or expansion of a nonconforming structure on any property within the Shoreland-Wetland Overlay District which existed at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which Article XV of this chapter was derived, or of any environmental control facility in existence on May 7, 1982, related to such a structure. The maintenance and repair of nonconforming boathouses located below the ordinary high water mark of any navigable waters shall comply with the requirements of Wis. Stats. § 30.121, as from time to time amended. 
(e)  Discontinuance. If the nonconforming use of a building, structure, or premises is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, it shall not be renewed and any subsequent use of the building, structure, or premises shall conform to the regulations of the district in which such building, structure or premises is located. Exempt from this section are single- and two-family residential structures used for residential purposes which are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or single- and two-family residential structures used for residential purposes within an Historic Overlay District. 
(f)  Relocation. No building or structure shall be moved in whole or in any part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless every portion of such building or structure which is moved, and the use thereof, is made to conform to all the regulations of the district in which it is to be located. 
(g)  Restoration. If a nonconforming building or structure is destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty or act of God to the extent that the cost of its restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence, together with the cost of the total structural repairs or alterations made during the lifetime of the building or structure exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the building or structure, such nonconforming building may not be restored except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. If the cost of such a restoration of a destroyed or damaged nonconforming building or structure, together with the cost of the total structural repairs or alterations made during the lifetime of the building or structure, is less than 50 percent of the assessed value of the building or structure, no repairs or reconstruction shall be made unless such restoration is started within one year from the date of partial destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion. If the restoration is not started within one year of said calamity and diligently prosecuted to completion, the building or structure shall be removed and the area cleared. 
(h)  Special exception. The owner of any one- or two-family dwelling unit which was used exclusively for residential use on June 15, 1981, which has been continuously used for residential use since June 15, 1981, up to the date of the casualty referred to hereafter, and which has continuously been located in a business or industrial zoning district since June 15, 1981, shall, in the event of destruction of the residence by fire or other casualty in an amount greater than 50 percent of assessed value, be permitted to reconstruct such residence on the lot where originally located. The size and number of units of the reconstructed residence shall be no greater than the size and number of units of the original residence. The burden of proof of establishing continuous residential use, size and number of units shall be on the land owner. If said reconstruction is not commenced within a period of 12 months following the casualty, any subsequent reconstruction and use of the building, structure or premises shall conform to the regulations of the district in which such building, structure or premises is located. 
(i)  Expansion permitted on existing structures. An existing structure within the districts established by this chapter, which was lawful prior to the adoption of the article from which this chapter is derived but which subsequently became nonconforming only as to setbacks and only as the direct result of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, shall be permitted to continue and may be expanded or extended but only: 
(1)  If such building addition shall not extend beyond the established nonconforming setback line; and 
(2)  In no event shall the total setback of the subject structure be reduced to an amount less than 50 percent of the setback required by this Code; and if the resulting building expansion is no greater than the area of the existing building.

(1)  Surfacing. All driveways and open off-street parking areas shall be surfaced with a dustless all-weather material such as bituminous, concrete pavement, or brick. Such parking areas shall be so graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water. Single-family residential properties may have no more than three years from the date of issuance of a building permit for that property within which to complete this surfacing. This section shall not apply to driveways and parking areas which were legally nonconforming prior to November 13, 2000. 
(2)  Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be directed away from residential properties and public streets in such a way as not to create a nuisance. 
(3)  Screening and landscaping. 
a.  Screening of parking lots. For all off-street parking areas containing more than four parking spaces there shall be provided and maintained a permanent screening buffer strip along any boundary of such parking lot which adjoins an R1 or R2 district. Such screening may be accomplished by a wall or fence not less than five feet in height or by a living hedge, shrubs or trees which at the time of planting shall be a minimum of three feet in height and three feet in width and shall within a period of four years attain a height and width of at least five feet. When such screening is within the required front or corner side yard, the maximum height shall be 30 inches.

All parking lots shall have a five-foot-wide landscaping strip along all adjoining property lines. The landscape strip adjoining any public street shall contain at least one tree per each 50 feet of street frontage with the remainder of the area left in grass, ground cover or other natural plantings. The Site Plan Review Coordinator may reduce or waive said five-foot-wide landscape strip where the ability of providing such five-foot-wide landscape strip creates a practical difficulty or causes one of the following: 
1.  The reduction of off-street parking below the ordinance minimum for the use it serves. 
2.  The inability to develop or implement a joint driveway use between properties. 
3.  The five percent landscaping requirement may be used to satisfy a portion of the green area requirement. 
c.  Landscaping of open storage lots. All open storage lots for motor vehicles, and other merchandise, service areas, and loading areas shall have a five-foot-wide landscaped planting strip along all adjoining property lines. The landscape strip adjoining any public street shall contain at least one tree per each 50 feet of street frontage with the remainder of the area left in grass, ground cover or other natural plantings.

(e)  Computation. 
(1)  When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as one parking space. 
(2)  Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one time. Floor area to be used in determining parking requirements shall be the total usable floor area on all floors as determined by the Building Division Director. 
(3)  For business and office establishments constructed with basement or underground floor space, parking shall be provided for such floor space as follows:

Determination of availability of storm sewer shall be the responsibility of the City Engineer, whose decision shall be final. Storm sewers shall be constructed in compliance with the Wisconsin Plumbing Code and other applicable regulations, as from time to time amended. If no storm sewer is available, surface water shall be discharged from or retained on a site in a manner approved by the City Engineer. This section shall not apply to single- and two-family developments.

Sec. 42-362. - Accessory buildings (attached and detached), detached garages, structures, and uses. 
The following regulations shall govern accessory buildings, structures, and uses. 
(1)  Accessory buildings, attached and detached garages, structures, and uses shall be compatible with the principal use and shall not be established prior to the establishment of a principal use on a lot. 
(2)  Except as otherwise regulated herein, any accessory building or structure hereafter erected, altered, enlarged, or moved on a lot shall conform with the following: 
a.  No detached garage or accessory building shall be nearer than five feet from the nearest portion of any other building on the lot. 
b.  All detached garages and accessory buildings must comply with the front yard and corner side yard setback requirements as described within each zoning district. 
c.  No detached garage or accessory building directly adjacent to a principal building shall be less than eight feet from any interior side lot line and ten feet from the principal building. 
d.  When a detached garage or accessory structure is located to the rear of the closest perpendicular line of the principal building, no detached structure shall be less than the distance described in this chapter from the principal structure. 
(3)  No detached garage or accessory building accessory to a residence shall have more than one story or exceed 14 feet in height, measured from floor to peak of roof. The Building Division Director may authorize a greater building height not to exceed 22 feet for detached garages which are located in a district listed on the National Register of Historic Places or in an Historic Overlay District, but only in order to construct a roof pitch to be compatible with the roof pitch of the principal building. 
(4)  Attached garages shall be considered part of a principal building and shall comply with the setbacks for a principal building. 
(5)  Detached garages shall comply with the setbacks for accessory buildings. 
(6)  No accessory building accessory to a one or two family residence shall be greater than 120 square feet in area. No detached garage accessory to a one- or two-family residence shall be greater than 750 square feet in area.

(Code 1976, § 18.34.010)  
Sec. 42-386. - Application of standards. 
(a)  The standards codified and established by this chapter shall apply to the physical development of all vacant land and the redevelopment of all other lands that are zoned O1, O2, O3, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 and BT. For purposes of this chapter, redevelopment is defined as the removal of any building, structure and/or improvement for the purpose or intent of constructing, erecting, creating, or otherwise improving the underlying land area with new buildings, structures, uses and/or improvements. The standards contained herein shall also apply to building additions, which double the gross floor area of any existing building. 
(b)  Compliance with the regulations contained herein shall be determined by the Site Plan Review Coordinator. The Coordinator may, at his or her discretion, consult with the Planning Director, City Engineer, Director of Public Works and Building Director or their designees for their input, information, expertise and opinion regarding the status of compliance with said regulations. Applicants that are in disagreement or aggrieved with the findings of the Site Plan Review Coordinator may request mediation of Coordinator's actions by the Plan Commission as outlined in Section 42-273(f). 
(Code 1976, § 18.34.020)  
Sec. 42-387. - Architectural standards. 
The intent of the following standards is to ensure that development within the district results in the creation of functional and aesthetically pleasing high quality environment. A high quality environment is one that is designed for longevity and flexibility in use, has low or reduced maintenance, is environmentally compatible and pedestrian friendly and will instill pride of use and ownership in those operating and visiting such areas: 
(1)  Maximum building size. In accord with the applicable zoning district standard. 
(2)  The maximum height of any building, structure or use shall be in accord with the applicable zoning district standard. 
(3)  The size, bulk and shape of buildings shall be compatible with those located on parcels in the surrounding neighborhood. When such surrounding buildings consist of dramatically different sizes and styles that may not be compatible with each other, new buildings shall be designed to provide a transition between such other buildings. Where there are few or no surrounding buildings, the size, bulk and shape of buildings shall be consistent with the planned character of what will be the surrounding development as reflected in City's Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans for the area. The character of buildings and structures constructed in the O3 and B1 Districts shall be consistent with residential buildings in the surrounding area. 
(4)  Buildings, particularly large structures, shall be designed to reduce the physical and visual scale and/or appearance of said structures through the use of varied design elements, including, but not limited to, varied setbacks, building height, roof treatments, door and window openings, and other structural and decorative elements. In addition, consideration should be given to varying the vertical walls of buildings with exterior horizontal wall protrusions and recesses and also the tops of walls, roof eaves and parapet walls through the use of varying vertical heights from the ground plane. Buildings and structures located in the O3 and B1 Districts shall have pitched residential styled gabled or hip roofs, except where the character of surrounding buildings suggest that other roof styles are appropriate. 
(5)  All buildings shall have entrances clearly defined with roofs, canopies, porticos, arches or other features that identify them and invite users of the site to them. If appropriate relative to the location of on-site parking, at least one entrance shall be located on the front or sides of buildings so that it is visible from the adjoining public street right-of-way. Buildings larger than 50,000 square feet and single tenants occupying spaces greater than 50,000 square feet in a multitenant building shall provide multiple entrances convenient to parking and pedestrian improvements. Separate entrances shall be provided for each tenant or tenant space within a building where practical. 
(6)  Exterior building materials shall be durable and low maintenance. Buildings must consist primarily of wood, glass, brick, decorative concrete block, stucco and/or similar materials. The Site Plan Review Coordinator may approve the moderate use of vinyl and seamless metal siding, decorative architectural metal siding with concealed fasteners and standing seam or otherwise architecturally unique metal roofing when such items are sensitively incorporated as design elements and not just building skins. 
(7)  Building design and architectural elements shall be applied to all sides of buildings in the O3 and B1 Districts and only those sides and rears of buildings in the remaining office and commercial districts which are clearly visible from public lands, public streets and residential areas. Under said circumstances, all facades of a building shall contain similar building materials and architectural details. 
(8)  Primary building facades shall have storefront windows or window like displays or details in quantities sufficient to create a recognizable architectural element from the adjoining parking lots, pedestrian ways and public streets. Said windows or window like features shall be provided for each individual tenant or tenant space within a building when such tenant space adjoins an exterior wall of the building. 
(9)  In general, colors used on the exteriors of buildings should be non-reflective, subtle or neutral tones. Bright, vibrant or highly reflective colors or surfaces should be used sparingly as accent features and not applied copiously as an attention getting device. 
(10)  The intent of the O3 and B1 Zone Districts is to provide office, commerce and service uses to smaller, local geographic areas and the residents thereof and not necessarily to the community at-large or regional customers. As such uses within the district should be considered as destinations rather than attractions. Thus the use of standard corporate buildings, signage and images may be inappropriate in size, scale, color and image. Any use of such elements must be subtly incorporated into the overall character of the development and the area. 
(11)  All permanent loading facilities and trash/recyclable storage areas shall be completely screened from view by an opaque vertical wall or fence that is a minimum of five feet in height or greater as necessary to adequately screen the trash enclosure. Said wall or fence shall be constructed of the same or complimentary materials as the building that it serves. Loading and trash storage areas shall be designed in consultation with professional service providers in order to accommodate all desired functions within the screened area. Loading and trash storage areas shall be proximal to the building they serve in order to provide convenience in access for employees using such facilities. 
(12)  Roofs and the tops of building walls shall be designed to sufficiently break planes and horizontal lines, reflect sunlight, and add interest to the structures they are a part and to minimize buildings from appearing as big, flat boxes. Pitched roofs are encouraged when overall building sizes allow their use without creating disproportionately large and/or tall roofs and when pitched roofs are the predominate style of surrounding development or when a building will be proximal to residences. 
(13)  Roof mounted mechanical equipment shall be located behind screening walls or covers that are similar or complimentary in material to those used on the facades of the building. Ground or wall mounted mechanical equipment shall be placed out of site from adjoining public streets and screened with landscaping, walls or fences. 
(14)  Buildings designed or converted for multiple tenant occupancy shall be designed with roofs, canopies, trellises and/or other roof like structures intended to provide maximum covered areas over sidewalks connecting the entrances to the multiple-tenant space. 
(15)  Lots, parcels, sites or developments containing multiple buildings shall incorporate varied building setbacks from the property lines adjoining public streets. Said setback variations must generally be no less than 50 feet; however, the Site Plan Review Coordinator may allow less setback to facilitate good site design. 
(Code 1976, § 18.34.030)  
Sec. 42-388. - Landscaping standards. 
The landscaping standards contained herein establish a point system to determine the appropriateness and effectiveness of plant installation. The system recognizes that the installation and maintenance of live plants is essential to creating a healthy, safe and aesthetically pleasing environment. The system places priority on the planting of deciduous shade trees which results in the highest level of environmental impact mitigation. As such all real property proposed for development shall be landscaped as follows: 
(1)  Planting designs shall concentrate on shading building roofs, parking lots, pedestrian facilities and the adjoining public streets. Secondary importance is focused on foundation and screening plantings intended to soften the transition from the ground plane to the vertical plane. 
(2)  Landscaping requirements. Landscaping shall be provided based on the following requirements or point schedules. The term "landscaping" means living plants normally cultivated for use on residential and business sites. These requirements supersede any other landscaping or screening requirements of this chapter. The requirements of each of the following categories are additive and must be satisfied independently except in the following circumstances: on corner lots, one-half of the trees provided to meet the street frontage requirement may be credited toward satisfying the landscape point/tree requirements of the paved areas standard if said street frontage trees meet the location requirements of both the street frontage and paved areas sections the landscape point totals associated with landscaping planted to meet the buffer yard requirements shall be credited toward the point totals required to meet any other landscape requirement provided the buffer yard plants meet the location requirements of both the buffer yard section and the section for which credit is requested. 
a.  Street frontages. One large deciduous tree shall be planted for each 50 feet of property line along a public street right-of-way. Said trees shall be planted in the public terrace equidistant from the curb and the normal sidewalk line or on the private site and within ten feet of the property line adjoining the public right-of-way. The preference for tree locations is on private property. The trees should be planted as near as possible at intervals of 50 feet on center although the clustering of trees for valid design purposes may be allowed. 
b.  Paved areas. One hundred fifty points of landscaping shall be planted for each 3,000 square feet of paving. At least one-half of the landscape points required shall be satisfied by the planting of large deciduous trees. Paving is defined as all hard-surfaced areas within the ground plane, including, but not limited to, parking stalls, driveways, trash enclosure pads, loading docks, sidewalks, plazas and patios. Plants required by this section shall be installed in landscape islands within or extending into the paved area or generally within 15 feet of the perimeter of the edges of the paved area. Parking lots containing more than 75 stalls shall incorporate at least one-third of the required landscaping within planting islands that are located within the interior of the parking lot. Such islands shall be a minimum of ten feet wide and 360 square feet in area and shall contain at least one large deciduous. Said islands should be evenly dispersed throughout the parking lot. Emphasis should be placed on creating islands that function positively with respect to plant physiology, vehicle maneuvering and overall site maintenance. Linear islands located between rows of parking stalls are preferred rather than small islands located at the ends of parking rows. 
c.  Building foundations. Three hundred points of landscaping for each 100 linear feet of exterior building wall. Plants required by this section must generally be installed within 20 feet of the building foundation. Large deciduous trees should not be used as foundation plantings. 
d.  Buffer yards. There shall be provided and maintained a permanent ten-foot-wide buffer yard screening element along any boundary of an office or business zoned property and any residential zone district including any O1 or O2 Zoned site that is developed with a residential use or is vacant. Said buffer yard screening element is intended to visually screen the office or business use from the adjoining residential district. The buffer yard screen shall be located within 25 feet of the common property line between the office or business use and residential property. A buffer yard screen shall consist of any combination of an earthen berm, opaque fence constructed of materials compatible with the materials of buildings within the development and/or landscape plantings and shall be designed to provide a permanent, all-season visual screen that will be a minimum of five feet tall. If plantings are used, such elements must be a minimum of three feet high and wide at the time of planting and of a species that will attain a height and width of at least five feet within four years following planting. When such buffer yard planting is located within the required building setback from a public street right-of-way, the height of the plants within that setback area must be maintained at 30 inches or less. The location of the buffer yard planting should be offset from the property line a distance equal to any utility easement of any nature that may be located along and encompassing said line. 
e.  Development sites. Development sites shall satisfy the street frontage landscaping requirements and shall be graded to a mowable condition and seeded with an acceptable lawn mix. The term "development sites" means any land area that is a separate site, lot, parcel or a vacant portion of a larger site that is included within a development, but which is intended to be developed in the future for building, parking or other physical improvement purposes. 
(3)  Landscaping point credits. Credit for landscaping will be granted based on the following schedule: 
a.  Large deciduous tree: 150 points per tree. 
b.  Small deciduous tree: 60 points per tree. 
c.  Evergreen or conifer tree: 60 points tree. 
d.  Shrub: 20 points per shrub. 
e.  Annual/perennial bed: 20 points per 20 square feet of planted bed. 
(4)  Landscaping elements are defined as follows: 
a.  Large deciduous tree. A large deciduous tree is any deciduous tree that will attain a mature height exceeding 25 feet, is classified as having a hardiness zone standard of two to five and is at least 2½ inches in diameter at the time of planting. Large deciduous trees planted within the public street right-of-way shall be a species normally classified as street trees. Trees will be downsized appropriately when overhead utility lines exist within the terrace area. 
b.  Small deciduous tree. A small deciduous tree is any deciduous tree that will attain a mature height less than 25 feet, is classified as having a hardiness zone standard of two to five and is at least one inch in diameter at the time of planting. 
c.  Evergreen or conifer tree. Evergreen or conifer trees are any upright conifer that will attain a mature height exceeding 12 feet, is classified as having a hardiness zone standard of two to five and is at least four feet tall at the time of planting. 
d.  Shrubs. Shrubs are plants that are both deciduous or evergreen in character, attain mature heights between two and eight or more feet, are classified as having hardiness zone standards of two to five and that are at least 18 inches in height at the time of planting. 
e.  Annual/perennial beds. Annual/perennial beds are any planting area containing annual and perennial bedding plants or other ground covers such as creeping evergreens, that are intensively planted to form a continuous planting mass and are at least 20 contiguous square feet in area. 
(5)  Green areas of the site not used for landscaping shall be seeded or sodded with an acceptable maintainable lawn seed mix. Mulch of plantings or planting beds is acceptable, provided that such mulching consists of organic or natural materials. Mulches shall be installed so that they will not erode, fall, be plowed or otherwise transported into walks, drives, streets or other hard-surfaced portions of the site. Functional weed barriers will be installed in all areas to be mulched. 
(6)  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed consistent with industry accepted standards. Installation shall occur prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the site unless such occupancy occurs during winter, in which case the landscaping shall be completed by July 1 of the next summer. 
(7)  Maintenance. Landscaping required by this article is intended to be a permanent site improvement just as any other building, structure or infrastructure that is necessary to facilitate the intended use of the site. As such, all landscaping shall be continually maintained in a live state. Maintenance shall include periodic and timely watering, fertilizing, pruning and any other such normally required horticulture activity necessary to keep all landscaping in a healthy, safe and aesthetically pleasing state. Recognizing that, over time, plants may mature and die or otherwise expire because of natural or unnatural causes, maintenance shall include the removal and replacement of dead or dying plants. Such replacement shall occur within the same year in which a plant dies or in the spring planting season of the following year. 
(8)  Utility easements. Planting in utility easements should be avoided. If such planting does occur, it is at the risk of the property owner. Any plants that must be removed because of utility work within such easements shall be replaced by the property owner at their cost. Replacement landscaping shall satisfy the minimum standards of this chapter. 
(Code 1976, § 18.34.040)  
Sec. 42-389. - Exterior lighting and illumination standards. 
The intent of the following standards is to mitigate the impact of exterior illumination related to development on surrounding properties, particularly in areas proximal to residential uses, while providing safe, healthy and visually attractive nighttime environments. In order to achieve said environments, good lighting design shall be practiced. Good lighting design is characterized by: 
(1)  Illumination levels appropriate for the visual task. 
(2)  Reasonably uniform illumination levels on adjoining sites. 
(3)  An absence of glare. 
(4)  Consideration of the compatibility and aesthetics of illumination and the mechanical improvements that create it as those relate to surrounding properties and the character of the community. 
(5)  In order to ensure that proper lighting design occurs, the following standards shall apply to all development within the district. 
a.  All exterior lighting fixtures shall be full cut-off fixtures as defined by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). All lighting shall be designed and fixtures selected to prevent glare. The Site Plan Review Coordinator may modify the cutoff fixture requirement for security lighting in areas where the exterior lights are not visible from a residential area or a public street. 
b.  Illumination of sites and improvements thereon shall be designed to avoid competition with illumination on adjoining or neighboring properties. 
c.  Illumination levels shall be appropriate for the intended improvement, area and/or function to be illuminated. In general, illumination levels should follow the guidelines and recommendations of the IESNA. 
d.  In no event shall any exterior illumination exceed an average illumination level of 20 footcandles for the surface to be illuminated unless approved otherwise by the Plan Commission as part of a conditional use permit. 
e.  The illumination uniformity ratio (the ratio of the average illumination to the minimum illumination) for the surface to be illuminated shall not exceed 4:1. 
f.  The illumination level at any property line shall not exceed 0.5 footcandle above the ambient lighting conditions on a cloudless night. 
g.  In no instance shall an outdoor lighting fixture be mounted or oriented such that the lighting element is visible from any residence located in a residential zone district. 
h.  The following shall be the maximum mounting height for the respective lighting fixture. The mounting height shall be measured from the surface to be illuminated to the bottom of the light fixture. 
1.  Parking lot light fixtures in lots containing 100 or fewer stalls: 18 feet. 
2.  Parking lot light fixtures in lots containing more than 100 stalls: 25 feet. 
3.  Building or security lighting: ten feet. 
4.  Any other site-lighting fixture 18 feet or as determined appropriate and consistent with the intent of this article by the Site Plan Review Coordinator. 
i.  Hours of operation. When a use is not in operation, only building mounted security lighting and up to 25 percent of all other outdoor lighting fixtures may remain illuminated. 
j.  Exterior illumination of wall-mounted, building-mounted or ground-mounted signs, architecture, landscaping, site amenities or other specialty illumination of any kind shall be designed consistent with the intent of this article. The provisions of Subsection (k) of this section shall apply to any such lighting. 
k.  Alternatives. Alternatives to these standards may be proposed to incorporate the use of a particular architectural style or theme or to incorporate innovative or unique illumination techniques. Such alternatives shall be presented to the Site Plan Review Coordinator with supportive evidence sufficient to determine that the proposal is consistent with intent of the heretofore-established standards. Approval of an alternative illumination plan is at the discretion of the Site Plan Review Coordinator. 
l.  A lighting plan, specifications for all proposed fixtures and photometric plan or other plans delineating illuminance levels that evidence compliance with the established standards are required for all developments in order to determine compliance with these standards. 
(Code 1976, § 18.34.050)  
Sec. 42-390. - Pedestrian and site amenity standards. 
The intent of the following regulations is to further the goal of providing and promoting alternative methods of access and travel to uses established within large-scale developments. Creating developments that provide ease of pedestrian or bicycle access is paramount. As such, the following development standards shall apply. 
(1)  At least one five-foot-wide sidewalk shall be provided between the primary entrance to any building and existing or planned public sidewalks, mid-block walkways and bike trails. 
(2)  If more than one building is proposed on a site or multiple adjoining sites are proposed for building development, on-site sidewalk links shall be provided between buildings. Said sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet wide and designed to provide convenient pedestrian access. Public sidewalks may satisfy this requirement if deemed appropriate by the Site Plan Review Coordinator. 
(3)  All parking, sidewalks, plazas, patios, and any other hard-surfaced site improvement shall comply with the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Site design shall place a priority of convenience on pedestrian movements rather than motor vehicle movements. 
(4)  Accommodations shall be made for bicycle access and parking. 
(5)  If more than one building is proposed on a site or multiple adjoining sites are proposed for building development, the site plan shall be reviewed by the Janesville Transit System (JTS) for consideration of creating a transit stop. If deemed necessary by JTS, a transit stop shall be constructed as part of the development or within the adjoining public right-of-way. Any such transit stop shall be connected to the development or site by an appropriate sidewalk. The cost of any such transit stop shall be paid for by the developer. 
(6)  If more than one building is proposed on a site or multiple adjoining sites are proposed for building development, site improvements shall include appropriate amenities for employees and patrons. The design of any such amenities shall be functional, inviting and compatible with the adjoining structures and uses. Such items may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Receptacles for refuse and recyclables. 
b.  Benches. 
c.  Information kiosks. 
d.  Potable water fountains. 
e.  Comprehensively designed newspaper boxes. 
f.  Employee lunch areas. 
g.  Flower beds, boxes or hanging baskets. 
h.  Works of art. 
i.  Smoking shelters. 
(Code 1976, § 18.34.060)  
Sec. 42-391. - Motor vehicle standards. 
Motor vehicles, their associated movement and parking represent one of the primary sources of impact from development on surrounding properties, especially residences. In order to reduce the impact associated with motor vehicles, the following standards shall apply to development within the district: 
(1)  Vehicle access for nonresidential development is prohibited from a local residential street unless said point of access is within 500 feet of a through or connecting arterial street as enumerated in Chapter 38, or in the opinion of the City Engineer, said local street will eventually be classified as a through or connecting arterial street. 
(2)  The parking of trucks, trailers of any motor vehicle weighing in excess of 1½ tons for more than a 24 hour period is prohibited. 
(3)  Off-street parking and loading shall be as provided in Sections 42-360 and 42-361. No more than 110 percent of the minimum number of parking stalls required by the aforesaid sections may be provided unless determined appropriate by the Site Plan Review Coordinator. 
(4)  No more than one-half of the parking stalls provided on a site shall be located between the front of the principal building or buildings and public street frontages unless, in the opinion of the Site Plan Review Coordinator, specific site limitations or adjoining land use considerations render such placement impractical or undesirable. The remaining parking shall be located in the side, corner side or rear yards of the site. Within the O3 District, all parking shall be placed in the interior side yard or rear yard unless, in the opinion of the Site Plan Review Coordinator, specific site limitations or adjoining land use considerations render such placement impractical or undesirable. 
(5)  Consideration shall be given to the use of nonreflective parking lot surfacing materials. 
(6)  All parking lots, driveways and other paved surfaces shall be properly striped, marked and signed to adequately define parking stalls, drive lanes, turning movements, fire lanes, prohibited movements or parking and any other such instructions necessary to facilitate safe pedestrian and motor vehicle movement. All such markings shall be designed and installed to place priority on pedestrian movements rather than motor vehicle movement. 
(7)  All pavement stripping, markings and signage shall be permanently maintained in order to provide for continual and safe pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle movements. 
(8)  Consideration shall be given to the use of best management practices for stormwater run-off. The use of on-site retention, rainwater gardens and other mitigation methods or strategies designed to reduce off-site stormwater run-off shall be incorporated into site development plans. All such proposals shall include management plans for any on-site water storage. 
(9)  For parking lots containing more than 25 stalls, poured in place concrete or equivalent curbing shall be installed in all high vehicle volume areas of the lot in order to define traffic movements, protect pavement edges and prevent disturbance or destruction of green areas and landscaping, to prevent erosion and to protect pedestrians. Said curbing shall be six inches tall and shall contain barrier-free design facilities where necessary and appropriate. 
(Code 1976, § 18.34.070)  
Sec. 42-392. - Streets, highway and traffic standards. 
Large developments generally involve significant land area and/or building area. As such they typically generate significant traffic and thus they often negatively impact existing street, highway and traffic improvements. In order to determine the impact from any such development on existing and planned streets, highways and traffic facilities, and to determine what, if any, new improvements are necessary to mitigate such impacts, a traffic study must be completed and submitted with each development proposal. Said study shall comply with the following standards: 
(1)  A traffic impact study shall be completed for every large development as defined by the applicable zoning district regulations if determined necessary by the City Engineer. Said study shall be completed by a qualified engineer or equivalent professional or firm having past experience and expertise in completing such studies. 
(2)  The cost of the study shall be paid for by the applicant. 
(3)  The study shall analyze the existing transportation network in the area surrounding the large development site. This would entail identifying or collecting traffic volumes for all arterial, collector, and nonresidential local streets, conducting turning counts at major intersections, and a review of all planned transportation system improvements within an area surrounding the large development site as determined appropriate by the City Engineer. 
(4)  The study shall identify existing and projected traffic volumes and turning movements for the aforesaid transportation network components. Traffic projections should be based on the full build-out of all lands within the study area using City land use plans for those areas that are undeveloped. 
(5)  The study shall determine the existing and project the anticipated levels of service for all components of the transportation network within the study area as such levels of service are defined in the most recent edition of the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual. 
(6)  The study shall make recommendations for all improvements that may be necessary to maintain a level of service of D or better for all components of the transportation network. The Plan Commission may modify this requirement if they find that the construction of such improvements are impractical or excessive. 
(7)  The study shall prorate on a percentage basis the portion of the need for any such improvements that can be attributed to the proposed large development covered by the study. 
(8)  The applicant may be responsible for the installation costs of any improvements necessary to maintain a level of service of D or better on the transportation network components that would be adversely affected by the proposed development. The Plan Commission may modify this requirement if they find that the construction of such improvements are impractical or excessive.

For purposes of this chapter, redevelopment is defined as the removal of any building, structure and/or improvement for the purpose or intent of constructing, erecting, creating, or otherwise improving the underlying land area with new buildings, structures, uses and/or improvements. The standards contained herein shall also apply to multifamily residential building additions which double the gross floor area or number of units of any existing multifamily residential building. 
(b)  Compliance with the regulations contained herein shall be determined by the Site Plan Review Coordinator. The Coordinator may, at his or her discretion, consult with the Planning Director, City Engineer, Director of Public Works, Chief Building Division Director and Fire Inspector or their designees for their input, information, expertise and opinion regarding the status of compliance with said regulations. Applicants that are in disagreement or aggrieved with the findings of the Site Plan Review Coordinator may request mediation of Coordinator's actions by the Plan Commission as outlined in Section 42-273(f). 
(Code 1976, § 18.35.020)  
Sec. 42-415. - Architectural standards. 
The intent of the following standards is to ensure that multifamily residential development results in the creation of functional, safe and aesthetically pleasing high quality, living environment. A high quality living environment is one that is designed to create living arrangements which meet the needs of the residents with high-quality, long lasting building construction and minimum standards for safety in the design of the built and site environment. It should also provide an environmentally compatible and pedestrian friendly environment, which harmoniously co-exists with lower density residential development and commercial development, which may be located nearby. 
(1)  Maximum building size: in accord with the applicable zoning district standard. 
(2)  The maximum height of any building, structure or use shall be in accord with the applicable zoning district standard. 
(3)  The size, bulk and shape of buildings shall be compatible with the shape and size of the parcel of land which it is located upon. Also the building massing shall be compatible with the buildings located on parcels in the surrounding neighborhood. When such surrounding buildings consist of dramatically different sizes and styles that may not be compatible with each other, new buildings shall be designed to provide a transition between such other buildings. Where there are few or no surrounding buildings, the size, bulk and shape of buildings shall be consistent with the planned character of what will be the surrounding development as reflected in City's Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans for the area. 
(4)  When a single building is constructed on an individual lot, the front facade of the structure shall be oriented towards the street frontage of the site. 
(5)  Front building facades shall not utilize a garage as the most predominant architectural element visible from the street, depending upon the overall layout of the site. When attached individual garages are constructed, the garage should be connected to the residential unit through the rear or side, in a manner that de-emphasizes the garage. Detached garages shall also be located in a manner which does not make it a predominant architectural element. 
(6)  Buildings, particularly large structures, shall be designed to reduce the physical and visual scale and/or appearance through the use of varied design elements, including, but not limited to, varied setbacks, building height, roof treatments, multiple gables, door and window openings, balconies and patios, and other structural and decorative elements. In addition, consideration should be given to varying the vertical walls of buildings with exterior horizontal wall protrusions and recesses and also the tops of walls and roof eaves through the use of varying vertical heights from the ground plane. Multifamily residential buildings shall have residential-styled gabled or hip roofs, except where the character of surrounding buildings suggest that other roof styles are appropriate. 
(7)  All buildings shall have structure or dwelling unit entrances clearly visible from parking areas and defined with varied facade materials, roofs, canopies, porticos or other features that identify them and invite residents and visitors to them. Large buildings with central doors/hallways to individual units shall provide multiple entrances convenient to parking and pedestrian improvements. Separate entrances shall be provided for each residential unit for smaller buildings, where practical. 
(8)  Exterior building materials shall be durable and low maintenance. Buildings must consist primarily of wood, brick, stucco and/or similar materials. The Site Plan Review Coordinator may approve the moderate use of residential character vinyl and seamless metal siding, when the building incorporates architectural features which limit long sections of siding along any elevation. 
(9)  Building design and architectural elements shall be applied to all sides of buildings with particular attention to elevations that face lower density residential uses and public streets. 
(10)  Multiple buildings on one lot or multiple buildings constructed in a single development on individual lots shall include consistent architectural design elements which create a unified development pattern. 
(11)  Roof materials shall be consistent with that of Section 42-440(a)(11)(f), unless an alternative roof material is architecturally appropriate in a particular location as determined by the Site Plan Review Coordinator. 
(12)  In general, colors used on the exteriors of buildings should be nonreflective, subtle or neutral tones. Bright, vibrant or highly reflective colors or surfaces shall not be used. 
(13)  All permanent trash/recyclable storage areas shall be completely screened from view by an opaque vertical wall or fence that is a minimum of five feet in height or greater as necessary to adequately screen the trash enclosure. Said wall or fence shall be constructed of the same or complimentary materials as the building that it serves. Loading and trash storage areas shall be designed in consultation with professional service providers in order to accommodate all desired functions within the screened area. Loading and trash storage areas shall be proximal to the building they serve in order to provide convenience in access for residents using such facilities. 
(14)  Ground mounted mechanical equipment shall be located out of site from adjoining public streets and screened with landscaping, walls which are incorporated into the facade by the same or similar building material or fences. 
(15)  Site layouts shall be done in a manner which maximizes open space on a site. This is particularly important for sites which have multiple buildings. Surface parking shall be prohibited in front and corner side yard setback areas. Methods to maximize open space include, but are not limited to, promoting multiple-story buildings, utilizing underground parking and clustering of buildings on a development site. Buildings which incorporate 30 or more units shall be constructed with secure, underground parking. 
(Code 1976, § 18.35.030)  
Sec. 42-416. - Landscaping standards. 
The landscaping standards contained herein establish a point system to determine the appropriateness and effectiveness of plant installation. The system recognizes that the installation and maintenance of live plants is essential to creating a healthy, safe and aesthetically pleasing environment. The system places priority on the planting of deciduous shade trees, which results in the highest level of environmental impact mitigation. As such all real property proposed for multifamily development shall be landscaped as follows: 
(1)  Planting designs. Planting designs shall concentrate on shading building roofs, parking lots, pedestrian facilities and the adjoining public streets. Secondary importance is focused on foundation and screening plantings intended to soften the transition from the ground plane to the vertical plane. 
(2)  Landscaping requirements. Landscaping shall be provided based on the following requirements or point schedules. Landscaping is defined as living plants normally selected for use on residential sites. These requirements supersede any other landscaping or screening requirements of the zoning ordinance. The requirements of each of the following categories are additive and must be satisfied independently, including buffer yard requirements. 
a.  Street frontages. One large deciduous tree shall be planted for each 50 feet of property line along a public street right-of-way. Said trees shall be planted in the public terrace equidistant from the curb and the normal sidewalk line or on the private site and within ten feet of the property line adjoining the public right-of-way. The preference for tree locations is on private property. The trees should be planted as near as possible at intervals of 50 feet on center although the clustering of trees for valid design purposes may be allowed. 
b.  Paved areas. One hundred fifty points of landscaping shall be planted for each 3,000 square feet of paving. At least one-half of the landscape points required shall be satisfied by the planting of large deciduous trees. Paving is defined as all hard-surfaced areas within the ground plane, including, but not limited to, parking stalls, driveways, trash enclosure pads, sidewalks, plazas and patios. Paving areas shall not include pools or playgrounds. Plants required by this section shall be installed in landscape islands within or extending into the paved area or generally within 15 feet of the perimeter of the edges of the paved area. Parking lots containing more than 25 stalls shall incorporate at least one-third of the required landscaping within planting islands that are located within the interior of the parking lot. Such islands shall be a minimum of ten feet wide and 360 square feet in area and shall contain at least one large deciduous. Said islands should be evenly dispersed throughout the parking lot. Emphasis should be placed creating islands that function positively with respect to plant physiology, vehicle maneuvering and overall site maintenance. Linear islands located between rows of parking stalls are preferred rather than small islands located at the ends of parking rows. 
c.  Building foundations. Three hundred points of landscaping for each 100 linear feet of exterior building wall. Plants required by this section must generally be installed within 20 feet of the building foundation. Large deciduous trees shall not be used as foundation plantings. Foundation plantings should be concentrated along the front elevation of the building. 
d.  Large open spaces. Where large open spaces are created by the layout of a multifamily development that exceeds one acre in area, the large open space shall include large deciduous trees to create shade within the open space. A large open space is an area of at least 3,000 square feet and shall include at least one large deciduous tree, in addition to other planting requirements found in this section. 
e.  Buffer yards. There shall be provided and maintained a permanent 25-foot-wide buffer yard screening element along any boundary of a multifamily residential development or building and any single- or two-family residential district. Said buffer yard screening element is intended to visually screen the multifamily structure from the adjoining low-density residential development. The buffer yard screen shall be located along the common property line between the multifamily residential development and the single- or two-family residential district. A buffer yard screen shall consist of any combination of an earthen berm, opaque fence constructed of materials compatible with the materials of buildings within the development and/or landscape plantings and shall be designed to provide a permanent all-season visual screen that will be a minimum of five feet tall. If plantings are used, such elements must be a minimum of three feet high and wide at the time of planting and of a species that will attain a height and width of at least five feet within four years following planting. When such buffer yard planting is located within the required building setback from a public street right-of-way the height of the plants within that setback area must be maintained at 30 inches or less. The location of the buffer yard planting should be offset from the property line a distance equal to any utility easement of any nature that may be located along and encompassing said line. 
f.  Development sites. Development sites shall satisfy the street frontage landscaping requirements and shall be graded to a mowable condition and seeded with an acceptable lawn mix. Development sites are defined as any land area that is a separate site, lot, parcel or a vacant portion of a larger site that is included within a development but which is intended to be developed in the future for building, parking or other physical improvement purposes. 
(3)  Landscaping point credits. Credit for landscaping will be granted based on the following schedule: 
a.  Large deciduous tree: 150 points per tree. 
b.  Small deciduous tree: 60 points per tree. 
c.  Evergreen or conifer tree: 60 points tree. 
d.  Shrub: 20 points per shrub. 
e.  Annual/perennial bed: 20 points per 20 square feet of planted bed. 
(4)  Landscaping elements are defined as follows: 
Evergreen or conifer tree means any upright conifer that will attain a mature height exceeding 12 feet, is classified as having a hardiness zone standard of two to five and is at least four feet tall at the time of planting. 
Large deciduous tree means any deciduous tree that will attain a mature height exceeding 25 feet, is classified as having a hardiness zone standard of two to five and is at least 2½ inches in diameter at the time of planting. Large deciduous trees planted within the public street right-of-way shall be a species normally classified as street trees. Trees will be downsized appropriately when overhead utility lines exist within the terrace area. 
Shrubs means plants that are both deciduous or evergreen in character, attain mature heights between two to eight or more feet, are classified as having hardiness zone standards of two to five and that are at least 18 inches in height at the time of planting. 
Small deciduous tree means any deciduous tree that will attain a mature height less than 25 feet, is classified as having a hardiness zone standard of two to five and is at least one inch in diameter at the time of planting. 
(5)  Green areas of the site not used for landscaping shall be seeded or sodded with an acceptable maintainable lawn seed mix. Mulch of plantings or planting beds is acceptable, provided that such mulching consists of organic or natural materials. Mulches shall be installed so that they will not erode, fall, be plowed or otherwise transported into walks, drives, streets or other hard surfaced portions of the site. Functional weed barriers will be installed in all areas to be mulched. 
(6)  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed consistent with industry accepted standards. Installation shall occur prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the site unless such occupancy occurs during winter, in which case the landscaping shall be completed by July 1 of the following summer. 
(7)  Maintenance. Landscaping required by this chapter is intended to be a permanent site improvement just as any other building, structure or infrastructure that is necessary to facilitate the intended use of the site. As such, all landscaping shall be continually maintained in a live state. Maintenance shall include periodic and timely watering, fertilizing, pruning and any other such normally required horticulture activity necessary to keep all landscaping in a healthy, safe and aesthetically pleasing state. Recognizing that over time plants may mature and die or otherwise expire because of natural or unnatural causes, maintenance shall include the removal and replacement of dead or dying plants. Such replacement shall occur within the same year in which a plant dies or in the spring planting season of the following year. 
(8)  Utility easements. Planting in utility easements should be avoided. If such planting does occur, it is at the risk of the property owner. Any plants that must be removed because of utility work within such easements shall be replaced by the property owner at their cost. Replacement landscaping shall satisfy the minimum standards of this chapter. 
(Code 1976, § 18.35.040)  
Sec. 42-417. - Safe layout and site design standards. 
(a)  The intent of the following regulations is to promote safe design of multifamily developments by creating safe, defensible living environments through design which creates an environment that limits dark and hidden spaces, provides clear pedestrian connections between buildings and parking areas, allows for residents to take ownership of their living space and to provide an environment which police can adequately patrol. Creating developments where residents are safe is the paramount goal. In order to promote these goals, the following development standards shall apply. 
(b)  Buildings and site layouts shall meet the prescribed building and fire code requirements. 
(c)  Multiple residential buildings on a site shall have a minimum separation of 40 feet. This dimension may be reduced to 20 feet when the narrow side of the buildings adjoin each other, provided that the buildings are oriented in a manner which does not align windows on one building with windows on another. 
(d)  No detached parking garage may be located within 20 feet of a residential structure and may not be located closer to the front property line than the principal building. 
(e)  Buildings with interior corridors shall be constructed with secure entryways. Secured entryways shall require that residents of the structure, either remotely or at the entry door to the building allow persons to enter the structure. 
(f)  Building entrances shall be constructed in a manner that provides a safe, inviting environment. A building entry shall not be hidden from view from the front of the building or from a parking area and shall not create dark, hidden spaces between the entry and a parking area. 
(g)  Each exterior entry for an individual unit or entry into a larger building with corridors to individual units shall be provided with a light with a minimum 60-watt incandescent lamp which shall illuminate automatically at dusk and shall be dark during the daylight hours. Full cutoff fixtures shall be utilized whenever possible. 
(h)  Buildings with garage/underground parking shall provide secured doors allowing only residents of the building to gain entry. 
(i)  Pedestrian sidewalks providing connections (other than parking lots) between multiple buildings and other on-site amenities shall be provided. Said sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet wide and designed to provide convenient pedestrian access. Public sidewalks may satisfy this requirement if deemed appropriate by the Site Plan Review Coordinator. 
(j)  Site layouts should provide a logical system of building/street addressing or numbering to allow for easy access by emergency vehicles as determined by the Chief of Police, Fire Inspector and the Site Plan Review Coordinator, jointly and/or severally. 
(k)  Sites with multiple buildings shall orient facades towards one another or towards common open areas and green spaces. Structures with individual garages for vehicles shall de-emphasize the garage through the building/site layout. 
(l)  Lighting of parking areas shall meet the requirements of Section 42-389 except that the maximum average illumination may not exceed five footcandles and the maximum height for any parking lot light fixture shall be 18 feet. 
(m)  Lighting of major walkways must be provided, either by residential style lights on the front facades, or by residential style and scale yard lamps. If more than one building is proposed on a site or multiple adjoining sites are proposed for building development, on-site sidewalk links shall be provided between buildings. 
(n)  Multiple buildings on a site are to be oriented in a manner which does not align windows on one building with windows on another. 
(o)  Slopes on a site shall not exceed a 4:1 ratio unless the natural topography of the site already exceeds such 4:1 slope. In that case, the slope shall not be disturbed. 
(p)  All parking, sidewalks, plazas, patios, and any other hard-surfaced site improvement shall comply with the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Site design shall place a priority of convenience on pedestrian movements rather than motor vehicle movements. 
(q)  No driveway or paved vehicular surface may be located within ten feet of any multiple-family residential structure or within five feet of any property line. 
(r)  Projects developed as a single, unified project, which requires shared functional elements (drives, parking, pedestrian connections, etc.) shall not be further divided to create separate fee simple ownership, regardless of the ability of the subdivision plat or Certified Survey Map meeting the regulations of the subdivision regulations. Only developments approved as a planned unit development and specifically designed for fee simple ownership shall be permitted to be divided for fee simple ownership. 
(Code 1976, § 18.35.050)  
Sec. 42-418. - Site amenity standards. 
(a)  Purpose. The intent of the following regulations is to further the goal of providing additional amenities for residents within multifamily housing structures and complexes. Creating developments that provide amenities to improve the minimum living standards for those residents who reside in multifamily housing is paramount. As such, the following development standards shall apply. 
(1)  At least one five-foot-wide sidewalk shall be provided between the primary entrance to any building and existing or planned public sidewalks, mid-block walkways, bike trails and parking areas. 
(2)  All residential units shall be provided with a private open space of at least 32 square feet in area. This can be accomplished through construction of a patio space or a balcony for an upper-story unit. 
(3)  If more than one building is proposed on a site or multiple adjoining sites are proposed for building development, on-site sidewalk links shall be provided between buildings and amenities on a site. Said sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet wide and designed to provide convenient pedestrian access. Public sidewalks may satisfy this requirement if deemed appropriate by the Site Plan Review Coordinator.

(Code 1976, § 18.35.060)  
Sec. 42-419. - Motor vehicle standards. 
Impacts from motor vehicles and necessary parking for multifamily residential uses, especially large complexes can create significant impacts on surrounding uses, especially lower density residential housing. In order to address the potential impacts from motor vehicles in multifamily developments, the following standards shall apply to multifamily residential development constructed under these regulations. 
(1)  Vehicle access for large multifamily residential development (over 200 units) is prohibited from a local residential street unless said point of access is within 500 feet of a through or connecting arterial street as enumerated in Chapter 38 or, in the opinion of the City Engineer, said local street will eventually be classified as a through or connecting arterial street. 
(2)  Off-street parking and loading shall be as provided in Sections 42-360 and 42-361. Parking shall be provided for visitors, in excess of the required minimum number of parking spaces. Visitor parking shall be provided at a ratio of one parking space for every eight units. The required visitor parking space cannot be assigned to an individual apartment unit. 
(3)  Parking shall not be located in any front or corner side yard setback area. 
(4)  If a structure includes over 30 units, at least 40 percent of the required parking shall be located within secured, underground parking. Such parking shall be located either underneath the structure or underneath a green area on the site. Building footprints shall not be significantly raised or stilted to accommodate parking underneath the structure. 
(5)  No driveway or paved vehicular surface may be located within ten feet of any multiple-family residential structure or within five feet of any property line. 
(6)  Required parking provided in an enclosed garage cannot be separately leased to tenants. 
(7)  Consideration shall be given to the use of non-reflective parking lot surfacing materials. 
(8)  All parking lots, driveways and other paved surfaces shall be properly striped, marked and signed to adequately define parking stalls, drive lanes, turning movements, fire lanes, prohibited movements or parking and any other such instructions necessary to facilitate safe pedestrian and motor vehicle movement. All such markings shall be designed and installed to place priority on pedestrian movements rather than motor vehicle movement. 
(9)  All pavement stripping, markings and signage shall be permanently maintained in order to provide for continual and safe pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle movements. 
(10)  Consideration shall be given to the use of best management practices for stormwater run-off. The use of on-site retention, rainwater gardens and other mitigation methods or strategies designed to reduce off-site stormwater run-off shall be incorporated into site development plans. All such proposals shall include management plans for any on-site water storage. 
(11)  For parking lots containing more than 25 stalls, poured in place concrete or equivalent curbing shall be installed in all high vehicle volume areas of the lot in order to define traffic movements, protect pavement edges and prevent disturbance or destruction of green areas and landscaping, to prevent erosion and to protect pedestrians. Said curbing shall be six inches tall and shall contain barrier free design facilities where necessary and appropriate. 
(Code 1976, § 18.35.070)

(Code 1976, § 18.36.010)  
Sec. 42-440. - Residence districts. 
(a)  General requirements. 
(1)  A permitted use is a use of land or buildings which is specifically allowed in the regulations applicable to a particular residence district. No land or building shall be devoted to any use other than one listed as a permitted use in the applicable zone with the exception of the following: 
a.  Uses lawfully established on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter; and 
b.  Conditional uses allowed in accordance with the provisions of Section 42-272. 
Uses lawfully established on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and rendered nonconforming by the provisions thereof, shall be subject to those regulations of Section 42-359 governing nonconforming uses. 
(2)  Green area. Green area shall be permanently provided and properly maintained on each lot devoted to any permitted or conditional use as set forth in each residential zoning district. This area shall be unobstructed to the sky and shall not be devoted to service driveways, walks, off-street parking spaces, loading berths, or other similar uses, but shall be usable for greenery, recreational space, and other leisure activities normally carried on outdoors. At least 50 percent of the green area requirement shall be provided in the front or corner side yard between the principal building and the front or corner side property line. In no event shall this requirement necessitate the principal building be set back a distance greater than the minimum front setback of the zoning district in which the property is located.

Open space may be devoted to service driveways, walks, off-street parking space, swimming pools, tennis courts, green area, or other similar uses, but no building or structure shall be permitted within the required open space. The open space requirement specified in the R1 and R2 Districts may include the required green area. 
(4)  Parking of camping and recreational equipment on private residential property. 
a.  Any owner of camping and recreational equipment may park or store such equipment on private residential property subject to the following conditions: 
1.  At no time shall such parked or stored camping and recreational equipment be occupied or used for living or housekeeping purposes. 
2.  If the lot is equipped with a garage of sufficient size, any such camping or recreational equipment shall be parked or stored inside the garage. 
3.  If the camping and recreational equipment is parked or stored outside a garage it shall be parked or stored to the rear of the front building line of the building, providing that there is reasonable access to the rear of said line via an existing driveway to allow such parking or storing. 
4.  If the lot is not equipped with a garage or reasonable access to the rear of the front line of the building via an existing driveway, then the camping and recreational equipment shall be parked or stored in the driveway of the lot, providing that such parking or storage does not interfere with normal use of any public sidewalk. 
5.  No camping and recreational equipment shall be permitted to be parked or stored in the required side yard setback unless it is parked or stored in the driveway. 
6.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (4)a.2 through (4)a.5 of this section, camping and recreational equipment may be parked anywhere on the premises for loading or unloading purposes for a period of time not to exceed 48 hours. 
7.  No more than two camping and recreational equipment vehicles designed for human habitation shall be permitted on any one lot. 
b.  For the purposes of this section, camping and recreational equipment includes, but is not limited to, boats, boat trailers, camping trailers, fifth wheel travel trailers, motor homes, private buses, snowmobiles, travel trailers, and truck campers. Motor-driven cycles and mopeds shall not be considered recreational equipment for purposes of this section. 
(5)  Established setback line. Where at least 50 percent of the three adjacent lots improved with residences on either side of the building lot in question on one side of the street within the same block have a front/corner side setback less than required by this chapter, an average front/corner side setback shall be computed for the defined area. Any new residence and new alteration of any existing residence may conform to that average front/corner side setback. For the purpose of computing such an average front/corner side setback, vacant lots within the defined area shall be considered as having the minimum front/corner side setback required in that zone district. 
(6)  Setbacks for L-shaped, two-family residences. Where a two-family residence is located on a corner lot, is L-shaped, and is addressed on two different streets, the minimum setback requirements shall be as follows: 
a.  Any yard abutting a street: 25 feet; 
b.  Side yard (unattached end of each unit): eight feet; 
c.  Rear yard (area behind each unit): 25 feet. 
(7)  Greater side and rear setbacks required for multiple-family 2½ stories or higher and nonresidential. Where a multiple-family building greater than 2½ stories in height or a nonresidential building is to be constructed on a lot adjoining a residential use in an R1 or R2 District, side and rear yard setback shall be 25 feet or equal in dimension to the height of such multiple-family or nonresidential building as it sits above grade, whichever is greater. 
(8)  Use of trucks, travel trailers or mobile homes.

For uncontrolled intersections, which shall be applied to the following areas of the property: 
A.  All property corners located at street intersections and along all side property lines; and

Such screening shall be a living hedge, shrubs or trees which, at the time of planting, shall be a minimum of three feet in height and three feet in width and shall, within a period of four years, attain a height and width of at least five feet. When such screening is within the required front or corner side yard, the maximum height shall be 30 inches. The Building Division Director may modify the screening requirements when screening exists on adjoining property. 
(10)  Setback. Setbacks shall be as provided in each of the business districts, except where at least 50 percent of the lots improved with buildings on one side of the street within the same block have a front setback less than required by this chapter, an average front setback shall be computed for the block.

(8)  Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners; and 
(9)  Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain. 
(Code 1976, § 18.60.020)  
Sec. 42-477. - Title. 
This article shall be known as the Floodplain Zoning Ordinance for Janesville, Wisconsin. 
(Code 1976, § 18.60.025)  
Sec. 42-478. - General provisions. 
(a)  Areas to be regulated. This article regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood as shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or other maps approved by DNR. Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the flood insurance study (FIS) and are shown as AE, A130, and AH Zones on the FIRM. Other regulatory zones are displayed as A and AO zones. Regional Flood Elevations (RFE) may be derived from other studies. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(b)  Official maps and revisions. The boundaries of all Floodplain Districts are designated as A, AE, AH, AO or A130 on the maps based on the flood insurance study (FIS) listed below. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) or any changes to the boundaries of the floodplain or floodway in the FIS or on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA through the letter of map change process (see Section 42-487) before it is effective. No changes to RFE's on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the Office of the Planning Division, City of Janesville. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply. 
(1)  Official maps. Based on the FIS: flood insurance rate map (FIRM), panel numbers 55105C0090E, 55105C0177E, 55105C0179E, 55105C0181E, 55105C0182E, 55105C0183E, 55105C0184E, 55105C0187E, 55105C0189E, 55105C0191E, 55105C0192E, 55105C0193E, 55105C0194E, 55105C0201E, 55105C0202E, 55105C0203E, 55105C0204E, 55105C0208E, 55105C0211E, 55105C0212E, 55105C0306E, 55105C0307E dated September 16, 2015, with corresponding profiles that are based on the flood insurance study (FIS) dated September 16, 2015 Volume Number 55105CV001B and 55105CV002B. 
(c)  Establishment of floodplain zoning districts. The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows: 
(1)  The Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters and are contained within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM. 
(2)  The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion between the regional flood limits and the floodway and displayed as AE zones on the FIRM. 
(3)  The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that may be covered by floodwater during the regional flood and does not have a BFE or floodway boundary determined, including A, AH and AO zones on the FIRM. 
(d)  Locating floodplain boundaries. Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in Subsections (d)(1) or (2) of this section. If a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Section 42-487. The Zoning Administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to Section 42-486(c) and the criteria in Subsections (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision pursuant to Section 42-486. 
(1)  If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there are any discrepancies. 
(2)  Where flood profiles do not exist for projects, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale. 
(e)  Removal of lands from floodplain. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Section 42-486. 
(f)  Compliance. Any development or use within the areas regulated by this chapter shall be in compliance with the terms of this chapter, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
(g)  Municipalities and state agencies regulated. Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13), applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when Wis. Stats. § 30.2022, applies. 
(h)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(1)  This chapter supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under Wis. Stats. §§ 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; Wis. Stats. § 62.23 for cities; Wis. Stats. § 61.35 for villages; or Wis. Stats. § 87.30, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. 
(2)  This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
(i)  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this chapter, required by Wis. Adm. Code, ch. NR 116, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this chapter or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this chapter. 
(j)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The flood protection standards in this article are based on engineering experience and research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This article does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this article. 
(k)  Severability. Should any portion of this article be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected. 
(l)  Annexed areas for cities and villages. The Rock County Floodplain Zoning Provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location. 
(Code 1976, § 18.60.030)  
Sec. 42-479. - General standards applicable to all Floodplain Districts. 
(a)  The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a floodprone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads; be constructed with flood-resistant materials; be constructed to minimize flood damages and to ensure that utility and mechanical equipment is designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment during conditions of flooding. 
(b)  Subdivisions shall be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this article and all other requirements in Section 42-484(b). Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages. 
(1)  Hydraulic and hydrologic analyses. 
a.  No floodplain development shall: 
1.  Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height; or 
2.  Cause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost. 
b.  The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or cause any increase in the regional flood height, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of Section 42-487 are met. 
(2)  Watercourse alterations. No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and FEMA Regional Offices, and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The standards of Section 42-479(a) must be met and the flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
(3)  As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation and pursuant to Section 42-487, the community shall apply for a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA.

For the purpose of determining flood insurance rates, it includes any structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
Nonconforming structure means an existing lawful structure or building which is not in conformity with the dimensional or structural requirements of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (For example, an existing residential structure in the floodfringe district is a conforming use. However, if the lowest floor is lower than the flood protection elevation, the structure is nonconforming.) 
Nonconforming use means an existing lawful use or accessory use of a structure or building which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter for the area of the floodplain which it occupies. (Such as a residence in the floodway.) 
Obstruction to flow means any development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters such that this development alone or together with any future development will cause an increase in regional flood height. 
Official floodplain zoning map means that map, adopted and made part of this chapter, as described in Section 42-478(b), which has been approved by the Department and FEMA. 
Open space use means those uses having a relatively low flood damage potential and not involving structures. 
Ordinary highwater mark means the point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized characteristic. 
Person means an individual, or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, municipality or state agency. 
Private sewage system means a sewage treatment and disposal system serving one structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure. It also means an alternative sewage system approved by the Department of Safety and Professional Services, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a system located on a different parcel than the structure. 
Public utilities means those utilities using underground or overhead transmission lines such as electric, telephone and telegraph, and distribution and collection systems such as water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer. 
Reasonably safe from flooding means base floodwaters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the floodplain and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings. 
Regional flood means a flood determined to be representative of large floods known to have occurred in Wisconsin. A regional flood is a flood with a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, and if depicted on the FIRM, the RFE is equivalent to the BFE. 
Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means any manmade object with form, shape and utility, either permanently or temporarily attached to, placed upon or set into the ground, stream bed or lake bed, including, but not limited to, roofed and walled buildings, gas or liquid storage tanks, bridges, dams and culverts. 
Subdivision means the same meaning as given in Wis. Stats. § 236.02(12). 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either any project for the improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the Building Division Director and that are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
Unnecessary hardship means where special conditions affecting a particular property, which were not self-created, have made strict conformity with restrictions governing areas, setbacks, frontage, height or density unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of the ordinance. 
Variance means an authorization by the board of adjustment or appeals for the construction or maintenance of a building or structure in a manner which is inconsistent with dimensional standards (not uses) contained in the floodplain zoning ordinance. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the floodplain zoning ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
Water surface profile means a graphical representation showing the elevation of the water surface of a watercourse for each position along a reach of river or stream at a certain flood flow. A water surface profile of the regional flood is used in regulating floodplain areas. 
Watershed means the entire region contributing runoff or surface water to a watercourse or body of water. 
Well means an excavation opening in the ground made by digging, boring, drilling, driving or other methods, to obtain groundwater regardless of its intended use.

ARTICLE XV. - SHORELAND-WETLAND OVERLAY DISTRICT 
 
Sec. 42-517. - Intent; purpose. 
(a)  Uncontrolled use of the shoreland-wetlands and pollution of the navigable waters of the municipality would adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare and impair the tax base. This shoreland-wetland zoning chapter has been established to: 
(1)  Promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare; 
(2)  Maintain the stormwater and floodwater storage capacity of wetlands; 
(3)  Prevent and control water pollution by preserving wetlands which filter or store sediments, nutrients, heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters; 
(4)  Protect fish, their spawning grounds, other aquatic life and wildlife by preserving wetlands and other aquatic habitat; 
(5)  Prohibit certain uses detrimental to the shoreland-wetland area; and 
(6)  Preserve shore cover and natural beauty by restricting the removal of natural shoreland cover and controlling shoreland-wetland excavation, filling and other earth moving activities. 
(b)  This chapter is adopted pursuant to authorization in Wis. Stats. §§ 62.23, 62.231, 87.30 and 144.26.

Stats. § 62.23 or 87.30, which relate to floodplains and shoreland-wetlands, except that where another section of the zoning ordinance is more restrictive than this article, that section shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. 
(c)  Interpretation. Where a provision of this article is required by a standard in NR 117, Wis. Admin. Code, and where the article provision is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of NR 117 standards in effect on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this article or administrative code. 
(d)  Annexed areas. The Rock County shoreland zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be administered by the City for all areas annexed by the City after May 7, 1982, unless any of the changes under Wis. Stats. § 59.692. These annexed lands are described on maps available from the City Planning Division. The Rock County Shoreland Zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the City Planning Division.

(2)  Within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable lakes, ponds or flowages. Lakes, ponds or flowages shall be presumed to be navigable if they are shown on the USGS maps or zoning maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this article; or 
(3)  Within 300 feet of the ordinary high water mark of navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever distance is greater. Rivers and streams shall be presumed to be navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterways on the USGS maps or zoning maps which have been incorporated by reference and made a part of this article. Floodplain zoning maps shall be used to determine the extent of floodplain areas. 
(b)  Determinations. Determinations of navigability and ordinary high water mark location shall initially be made by the Building Division Director, with assistance from the City Planner and City Engineer. When questions arise, the Building Division Director shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department of Natural Resources for a final determination of navigability or ordinary high water mark. 
(c)  Map discrepancies. When an apparent discrepancy exists between the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary shown on final Wisconsin Wetlands Inventory maps and actual field conditions at the time the maps were adopted, the Building Division Director shall contact the appropriate district office of the Department of Natural Resources to determine if the Shoreland-Wetland District boundary as mapped is in error. If department staff concur with the Building Division Director that a particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Building Division Director shall have the authority to immediately grant or deny a building permit in accordance with the regulations applicable to the correct zoning district. In order to correct wetland mapping errors or acknowledge exempted wetlands designated in Subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the Building Division Director shall be responsible for initiating a map amendment within a reasonable period. 
(d)  Filled wetlands. Wetlands filled prior to May 23, 1994, in a manner which affects their wetland characteristics to the extent that the area can no longer be defined as wetland, are not subject to this article. 
(e)  Wetlands landward of a bulkhead line. Wetlands located between the original ordinary high water mark and a bulkhead line established prior to May 7, 1982, under Wis. Stats. § 30.11, are not subject to this chapter.

(2)  To the properties within Rock County, Town of Beloit, City of Janesville, Town of La Prairie, Town of Rock, Town of Turtle, and City of Janesville, all of which lie entirely or partially within the three-mile jurisdictional boundary of the AOZD. 
(3)  To the limits represented by five independent zones which are defined in Section 42-565. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.100)  
Sec. 42-555. - State and local agencies regulated. 
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this chapter and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if Wis. Stats. § 13.48(13), applies. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.110)  
Sec. 42-556. - Disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of protection provided by this article relative to aircraft operation and aircraft overflights is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5300-13, Airport Design Standards and Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace. Therefore, this article does not imply that land uses within the vicinity of the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport will be totally free from aircraft noise impacts, aircraft operations, and aircraft overflights. Nor does this article create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport, Rock County, Town of Beloit, Town of Janesville, Town of La Prairie, Town of Rock, Town of Turtle, City of Janesville, or any officer or employee thereof, for incidents that may result from reliance on this article. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.120)  
Sec. 42-557. - Use restrictions. 
Through the use of the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map, heights of structures and features, both manmade and natural growth, shall be limited. The following uses shall also be restricted and regulated as specified within this article: 
(1)  The following specific use restrictions and regulations shall also apply: 
a.  Existing uses. Nothing contained in this chapter shall require the removal of or any change in the construction, alteration, location, or use of any existing use; this includes the construction, alteration, or use of property or structural improvements lawfully in existence at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or which commenced prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and has been completed or is being diligently pursued. This includes vacant platted lots that were established to accommodate proposed development prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. It is further provided that the height limits of this chapter shall in no event be exceeded. 
1.  Expansion of existing uses. Any existing use, as described in this chapter, may be expanded, altered, or otherwise enlarged as long as the following requirements are met: 
(i)  The expansion, alteration, or enlargement meets the requirements of the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map, the land use restrictions as provided in Tables 4 through 10 (requiring a Zoning/Building Site Permit and Affidavit (applicant's recorded affidavit accepting mitigation responsibilities), when specified), and is not otherwise prohibited by the underlying zoning ordinance of the municipality with jurisdictional authority. 
(ii)  Expansion of any existing use listed as a permitted use in Tables 4 through 10 does not require a zoning/building site permit and affidavit. 
2.  Substantial damage. The owner of any existing use, building, or structure which, as a result of fire, explosion, or other casualty is destroyed or substantially damaged, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the equalized assessed value of the structure before the damage occurred, shall be allowed to rebuild, reconstruct, or rehabilitate the same existing use on the same parcel, only if the following requirements are met: 
(i)  The existing use is reviewed and complies with the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map, the land use restrictions as provided in Tables 4 through 10 (requiring a zoning/building site permit and affidavit (applicant's recorded affidavit accepting mitigation responsibilities), when specified), and is not otherwise prohibited by the underlying zoning ordinance of the municipality with jurisdictional authority. 
(ii)  Permitted uses are those land uses generally considered compatible within a particular zone of the AOZD. Compatible land uses do not impact or create hazardous conditions for aircraft, airport operational areas, or aircraft overflight areas, and are considered reasonably safe for area residents. Permitted uses, however, shall conform to all Height Restrictions within the AOZD, and may be required by the Committee Designee to ensure height compliance. A zoning/building site permit and affidavit (applicant's recorded affidavit accepting mitigation responsibilities), is not required for compliance with this chapter. This includes expansion of any existing use listed as a permitted use in Tables 4 through 10. 
(iii)  Permit required uses are those land uses that shall be permissible following the issuance of a City of Janesville Zoning/Building Site Permit. The permit, which may include development and use related conditions, along with a signed affidavit (applicant's recorded affidavit accepting mitigation responsibilities), notifies applicants of their responsibilities and required mitigation for any construction, alteration, location or use of land to minimize potential hazardous impacts to the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport, aircraft, airport operational areas, and aircraft overflight areas, as well as residents of the area. 
(iv)  Not permitted uses are those land uses generally considered not compatible (incompatible) or not permitted within a particular zone of the AOZD. Incompatible land uses endanger the health, safety, and welfare of area residents and aircraft utilizing the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.130)  
Sec. 42-558. - Penalties. 
Any person, firm, or corporation who fails to comply with or violates the provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, forfeit not less than $500.00 and no more than $5,000.00, plus the costs of prosecution, for each violation.

(b)  Any person, firm, corporation, cooperative or other entity of whatsoever kind or nature who violates any provision of this article shall pay a forfeiture and shall be otherwise penalized as set forth in Section 42-332. 
(c)  Each day's continuance of any violation constitutes a separate violation. 
(d)  In addition to and not in lieu of any forfeiture imposed herein, the City may apply for and the court may grant, from time to time, injunctive relief including, but not limited to, abatement and mandatory performance. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.150)  
Sec. 42-560. - Administration. 
(a)  Designation. The City Council hereby designates the Community Development Director (hereinafter referred to as Director) and/or his or her designee to administer and enforce the provisions of this article. In the event of any conflict, the determination or interpretation of the Community Development Director shall prevail. 
(b)  Responsibilities. The Director is hereby delegated the responsibility and authority to: 
(1)  Approve or conditionally approve Zoning/Building Site Permits that do not exceed required height restrictions; 
(2)  Advise applicants of the provisions of this chapter and assist them in preparing permit applications and appeals; 
(3)  Issue permits and inspect any building site or improvement or use of land as required by this article; 
(4)  Investigate and issue citations for violations of this article; 
(5)  Maintain records of approvals, denials, conditions of approvals, and inspections made, and maintain a complete public record of all proceedings; 
(6)  Maintain on file a list of all documentation of certified elevations; and 
(7)  Review and make recommendations to the County Board of Supervisors on all zoning map changes and amendments to the text of Land Control Ordinances, including the Airport Overlay Zoning District Ordinance. 
(c)  Powers. The Director shall have all the powers necessary to enforce the provisions of this article without limitation by reason of enumeration, including the following: 
(1)  To require complete and accurate information necessary to make reasonable evaluations of applications; 
(2)  To hear and grant applications for unclassified and unspecified uses, provided that such uses are similar in character to the principal uses permitted in the district; and 
(3)  To hear and grant applications for temporary uses in any district, provided that such uses are of a temporary nature, do not involve the erection of a substantial structure, and are compatible with neighboring uses. The permit shall be temporary, revocable, subject to any conditions required by the Director, and shall be issued for a period not to exceed 12 months. Compliance with all other provisions of this article shall be required. 
(d)  Zoning/building site permit. When required by this article, a zoning/building site permit (valid for one year) shall be obtained from the Director and/or his or her designee before the removal of or any change in the construction, alteration, location, or use of any existing use or proposed use. In all cases, the height limits of this chapter shall not be exceeded. The zoning/building site permit (for permit required uses or for existing uses when specified), which may include development and use related conditions, along with a signed affidavit (applicant's recorded affidavit accepting mitigation responsibilities), notifies applicants of their responsibilities and required mitigation for any construction, alteration, location or use of land to minimize potential hazardous impacts to the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport, aircraft, airport operational areas, and aircraft overflight areas, as well as residents of the area. Failure to obtain a zoning/building site permit when required, shall be a violation of this chapter. Application for a permit shall be made to the Director and/or his or her designee upon furnished application forms and shall include the following data: 
(1)  Name and address of the applicant, property owner, and contractor-builder; an accurate properly dimensioned map of the property, in duplicate showing; 
(2)  Legal description of the property, the type of proposed use, and an indication as to whether new construction or a modification to an existing structure is involved; 
(3)  A description of the proposed land use and building materials and landscaping materials; 
(4)  When the Director deems necessary, the elevation of the highest point of the structure, object, or natural vegetation using National Geodetic and Vertical Datum when locating within the individual zone of the AOZD, including existing ground elevations reporting in Mean Sea Level (MSL), height of the structure or object above ground measured in feet (AGL), and top elevation measured in MSL; 
(5)  When the Director deems necessary, evidence of submission for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form 7460-1, Notification of Proposed Construction or Alteration, commonly known as an airspace review. Receipt of final determination letter from the FAA is required prior to final approval or denial of a Zoning/Building Site Permit (as required for Permit Required Uses or for Existing Uses when specified); 
(6)  Applicant's affidavit accepting mitigation responsibilities to ensure that any use, construction or alteration of such use is compatible with this article; and 
(7)  Other permits. It is the responsibility of the applicant to secure all other necessary permits from all appropriate federal, state, and local agencies. 
(e)  Application information. In order to secure evidence upon which to base its determination, the Director may require, in addition to the information required on Permit Application, the submission of plans of buildings; arrangement of operations; plat of grounds showing location and elevation of buildings, stockpiles, wells, septic systems, equipment storage, fences or screens, parking areas, traffic access, fill areas, floodproofing measures, landscaping; and any other pertinent information that may be necessary to determine if the proposed use meets the requirements of this chapter. Plans drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 200 feet showing the location, dimensions, elevations, and contours of the site; elevations of all pertinent structures, fill, or storage areas; size, location, and spatial arrangements of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevations of streets, water supply, and sanitary facilities; and the relationship of the above to the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport, as well as a particular zone of the AOZD. 
(f)  Standards applicable to all permit required uses within the Airport Overlay Zoning District. Upon reviewing a zoning/building site permit application in the AOZD, the Director shall consider the factors listed below. In addition, the Director is not authorized to allow any use to exceed a height limitation in the AOZD. 
(1)  Potential to create an undue concentration of people (density); 
(2)  Potential to cause visual obstructions (through the creation of smoke, steam, dust, lighting or other unspecified obstruction) that would adversely effect aircraft operational areas and airspace, and specifically the proximity to runway ends, runway surfaces and extended runway centerlines; 
(3)  Potential for noise sensitivity, and when necessary, ensuring building construction that reduces airport related noises for proposed uses; 
(4)  Creation of electrical or navigational interference; 
(5)  Creation of standing water areas or detention/retention ponds which may attract wildlife, thus designing or mitigating standing water areas or detention/retention ponds to avoid attracting wildlife; 
(6)  Creation of wildlife attractants other than water; 
(7)  Potential storage of flammable or hazardous materials limits as defined by the Wisconsin Commercial Building Code; 
(8)  At the owner's expense, the technical expertise of a professional surveyor and/or engineer to determine exact locations and elevations. This may be done to confirm the accuracy of information supplied by the applicant. 
(g)  Conditions of approval. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the director may deny or approve the issuance of a zoning/building site permit; any approval may require attached conditions the committee designee deems necessary in furthering the purpose of this chapter. Violation of any of these conditions shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
(h)  Appealing decisions of the Director. If the Director and/or his or her designee denies or conditionally approves a zoning/building site permit and the applicant disagrees with such decision, the applicant may appeal such denial or condition to the Plan Commission. Such an appeal shall be signed and filed in writing with the Planning Division within 30 days following the Committee Designee's determination or be forever barred. The Plan Commission may affirm, overrule or modify a decision of the Director and/or his or her designee. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.160)  
Sec. 42-561. - Board of Adjustment. 
There is hereby established a Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to Wis. Stats. § 62.23(7). As prescribed, Article VI of this chapter, are hereby referenced and made part of this article. 
(1)  Any person, office, or department aggrieved by an order, requirement, interpretation, or determination made by the Director and/or his or her designee may appeal such decision to the City of Janesville Board of Appeals for final judgment. 
(2)  Use variances shall not be granted under the ordinance. 
(3)  Height variances shall not be granted under this article. 
(4)  Where the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that unnecessary hardships or practical difficulty will result from strict compliance with these regulations, they may approve variances so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest is secured. Such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations. The Board of Appeals shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
a.  The proposed variance request is not contrary to the public interest and is consistent with the intent of applicable ordinances and will not compromise public safety and welfare (will not hinder airport operations and/or future growth of the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport); 
b.  The proposed variance will not serve as a special privilege and is justified based on special conditions on the property, which are not shared by other properties in the same locality or district (for example, lot shape, elevation or topography); 
c.  A strict and literal interpretation of the chapter will result in a practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship on the property owner (hardship shall be distinguished from inconvenience); 
d.  The variance is not requested because of a self-imposed hardship; 
e.  Shall not be granted solely on the basis of economic gain or loss; and 
f.  Shall not be granted for actions which require an amendment to this article or the map described in any section of this article. 
(5)  Conditions. In approving variances, the Zoning Board of Appeals may require conditions that will, in its judgment, substantially secure the objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations. 
(6)  Procedures. An appeal or an application for a variance shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals within 30 days of the action of the Director and/or his or her designee. 
(7)  Presenting evidence. In all cases, the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present arguments and technical evidence to the Board of Appeals. Where it is determined that the district boundary is incorrectly mapped, the Board should either inform the Director to proceed to petition Rock County or inform the person contesting the location of the boundary to petition Rock County, for a map amendment pursuant to Chapter 29. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.170)  
Sec. 42-562. - Fees. 
At the time of application, the property owner or his or her agent shall pay the fees established pursuant to Section 42-277. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.180)  
Sec. 42-563. - Applicant's recorded affidavit accepting mitigation responsibilities. 
For all permit required uses or for existing uses when specified, the following information shall be noticed to each applicant indicating the responsibilities of the applicant to mitigate any construction, alteration, location or use of land to minimize potential hazardous impacts to the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport, aircraft, airport operational areas, and aircraft overflight areas, as well as area residents. Failure of applicant to mitigate potential hazardous impacts shall be a violation of the terms and requirement of this chapter. A signed and accepted affidavit must be recorded in the Rock County Register of Deeds. Permitted uses under this chapter are not required to secure a zoning/building site permit or affidavit. Those potential impacting issues are listed below: 
(1)  Site design and physical characteristics. 
a.  Existing topography, drainage patterns, and vegetative cover and the suitability of the proposed use in that regard. 
b.  Proximity of runway environs and extended runway centerline areas. 
c.  Location of any linear roadways, relative to the alignment of the runway or the extended runway centerline. 
(2)  Noise sensitivity. 
a.  Insulate the structure/land use to reduce noise impacts. 
b.  Use airport compatible landscaping material to mitigate noise exposure. 
c.  Shift the structure or land use to allow for a more compatible location. 
(3)  Tall structures. 
a.  Lower the structure or land use to a compatible height. 
b.  Shift the structure or land use to allow for a more compatible location. 
(4)  Visual obstructions. 
a.  Install down-shielded light fixtures. 
b.  Reduce the number of lighting fixtures, while still illuminating the land use area safely. 
c.  Configure lighting so it does not align with a runway or airport facility, making it easier for a pilot to distinguish the airport from the development. 
d.  Limit reflective building materials, such as mirrored/reflective glass, solar panels, metal roofs, etc., within the vicinity of the airport. 
e.  Locate areas of water away from the airport to minimize reflection. 
f.  Shift the structure or land use within the site so that prevailing wind directions carry smoke, steam, or dust away from the airport. 
g.  Change land use activity to reduce or limit emissions of smoke, steam, or dust. 
(5)  Wildlife and bird attractants. 
a.  Select and space vegetative species to minimize habitats and food sources. 
b.  Maintain appropriate grass lengths to minimize wildlife attractants. 
c.  Prohibit certain agricultural crops near the airport. 
d.  Eliminate or mitigate standing water bodies that provide water and habitat. 
e.  Use repellents to disperse wildlife in a humane manner. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.190)  
Sec. 42-564. - Airport Overlay Zoning Districts.

The permitted height shall not exceed the height limitation elevations shown on the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map within the various zones encompassed by this article. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.200)  
Sec. 42-565. - Establishment of Airport Overlay Zoning Districts 
For the purpose of this article, the area of Rock County under the jurisdiction of this article is hereby divided into the following districts and zones: 
(1)  Airport Overlay Zoning District. 
a.  Zone A: Runway protection zone (RPZ). 
b.  Zone B1: Approach surface. 
c.  Zone B2: Approach surface. 
d.  Zone C: Transitional surface. 
e.  Zone D: Three-mile jurisdictional boundary. 
(2)  Airport height zoning district. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.210)  
Sec. 42-566. - Zoning map and district boundaries. 
(a)  The boundaries of each district are established as shown on a map entitled "Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Overlay Zoning District Map, Rock County, Wisconsin," dated April 23, 2009 and the Height Restrictions are established on a map entitled "Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map, Rock County, Wisconsin, dated December 11, 2003," as amended and adopted on April 23, 2009 by the Rock County Board of Supervisors. The Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Overlay Zoning District Map and Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map bear the signature of the County Board Chairman attested by the County Clerk and shall be on file in the County Planning and Development Agency and Janesville Planning Division be readily available to the public. 
(b)  The AOZD, as presented in this section, has been created for the purpose of imposing special regulations in designated areas of Rock County to accomplish specific purposes that are set forth within each individual AOZD. The AOZD shall be in addition to, and shall overlap and overlay, all other zoning districts within the three-mile jurisdictional boundary of the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport. 
(1)  The Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map dated December 11, 2003, as amended, accompanies and is made part of this chapter. The elevation numbers indicated within each cell are established as shown on a map entitled "Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map, Rock County Wisconsin," dated December 11, 2003, as amended. Cell elevation numbers indicated on this map provide the maximum permissible height above mean sea level (MSL), which buildings, structures, objects, or vegetation in that cell shall not exceed. The provisions of the AOZD within this chapter shall apply to all cell areas indicated on this map. 
(2)  The Airport Overlay Zoning Districts are established as shown on the Airport Overlay Zoning District Map entitled "Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Overlay Zoning District Map, Rock County, Wisconsin," dated April 23, 2009, as amended. This Airport Overlay Zoning District Map is to be used in conjunction with the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map, and is made part of this article. Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77 Surfaces and FAA Runway Protection Zones (RPZs) have been utilized to create five individual zones as part of the AOZD associated with compatible land use near the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport. These districts encompass a three-mile radius from the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport property line, as authorized by Wisconsin Statutes. 
(Code 1976, § 18.80.220)  
Sec. 42-567. - Airport Overlay Zoning District. 
(a)  Purpose of Airport Overlay Zoning District. The purpose of the AOZD is to provide a means of attaining the goals and objectives of the Rock County Comprehensive Plan and the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Master Plan, Airport Land Use Plan, and/or Airport Layout Plans, and to protect a public airport from incompatible uses of land, people, and property from encroaching into areas where historical and practical experience indicates that conflict will result. 
(b)  Airport land use zones. The AOZD is comprised of five individual zones, which include A, B1, B2, C, and D. 
(c)  Zones enforced by this article. 
(1)  Primary surface. The primary surface is the only FAR part 77, surface that is not specifically used as a land use compatibility zone due to its proximity to the runway environs. This surface area must be owned and under the control of the airport. The primary surface must be clear of all obstructions except those fixed by their function, such as runway edge lights, navigational aids, or airport signage. The primary surface is currently controlled by the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport. Even though the primary surface is not included as a land use zone, it functions as an important safety area since it is longitudinally centered on a runway and is intended to provide an Object Free Area (OFA) around the runway surface. When a runway has a prepared hard surface, such as those at the Airport, the primary surface will extend 200 feet beyond each individual runway end. The following primary surface widths are applied to the specific Airport runways: 
a.  Runway 14/32: 1,000 feet. 
b.  Runway 04/22: 1,000 feet. 
c.  Runway 18/36: 250 feet. 
Table 1, Figure 1, and Figure 2 depict various dimensional requirements for the primary surface and other FAR part 77, surfaces. A visual approach runway has relatively small surfaces, with approach and horizontal surfaces extending 5,000 feet from the primary surface at an approach slope of 20 feet horizontally for each one foot vertically (20:1). For a non-precision approach runway, both the approach and horizontal surfaces extend either 5,000 or 10,000 feet from the primary surface, depending on the design category of the runway. The approach surfaces for precision approach runways are similar to those for non-precision approach runways, except that the approach surface extends 50,000 feet from the primary surface and the horizontal surface extends 10,000 feet from the primary surface. 
(2)  Zone A runway protection zone (RPZ). The dimensional standards for Zone A are the same as those described in FAA AC 150/5300-13, Airport Design Standards and are illustrated in Table 2 and Figure 3. 
(3)  Zone B approach surface. Zone B is a critical overlay zoning surface that reflects the approach and departure areas for each runway at the airport. The size of Zone B is the combination of Zone B1 and B2 and is predicated on the approach type (visual, non-precision, or precision) at a specific runway and the type/size of aircraft utilizing the runway, as illustrated in Table 3 and Figure 4. A portion of Zone B1 is superseded by Zone A because the approach surface and RPZ overlap the entire length of the RPZ. Consequently, the length of Zone B1 begins at the inner edge of the RPZ and continues to one-half the length of the approach surface beyond Zone A. Zone B2 is also equal to one-half the length of Zone B, beyond Zone B1, and is located at the outer edge of the zone. 
(4)  Zone C transitional surface. The areas within Zone C are those that extend 1,050 feet outward from the edge of the primary surface, paralleling the runway and extended runway centerline with Zone B1, to a length equal to the outer edge of Zone A and then squared to meet Zone A, as shown in the Table 3 and Figure 4. 
(5)  Zone D three-mile jurisdictional boundary. Zone D encompasses the horizontal (innermost area) and conical surface (outermost area) of the FAR part 77, surfaces, all of which represent the three-mile jurisdictional boundary, as provided for within Wisconsin Statutes (Table 3 and Figure 4). Zone D is calculated by intersecting a series of three three-mile arcs drawn from the outermost property boundaries of the airport.

a.  Utility and visual runway. A utility runway is constructed and intended for use by propeller-driven aircraft with maximum gross weight of 12,500 pounds or less. A visual runway is intended for the operation of aircraft using solely visual approach procedures, with no straight-in instrument approach procedure. 
b.  Non-utility and non-precision instrument runway. A non-utility runway is constructed and intended for use by aircraft with a maximum gross weight greater than 12,500 pounds. A non-precision instrument runway has an existing instrument approach procedure that utilizes air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in non-precision instrument approach procedure has been approved. 
PIRPrecision instrument runway has an existing instrument approach procedure that utilizes an Instrument Landing System (ILS) or a Precision Approach Radar (PAR).

(d)  Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Overlay Zoning District Maps. The boundary of the AOZD shall extend three-miles beyond the airport property line. The AOZD utilizes two maps which bear the signature of the County Board Chairman attested by the County Clerk and shall be on file in the office of the County Planning and Development Agency. 
(1)  Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map dated December 11, 2003 as amended, accompanies this chapter and illustrates the allowable heights for structures, objects, and natural vegetation. No trees shall be allowed, nor shall any structure be constructed, altered, located, or permitted which exceeds the height limitations indicated on the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Height Zoning Map. The maximum height elevations, measured above mean sea level (MSL), on said map are shown by topographic lines depicted in relationship to section lines and land subdivision lines on said map. 
(2)  Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Overlay Zoning District Map dated April 23, 2009, accompanies this chapter and illustrates the allowable land uses within a particular zone of the AOZD. No land use should be allowed nor shall any structure be constructed, altered, located, or permitted which encroaches upon the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport creating hazards for aircraft, airport operational area, and aircraft overflight areas, as well as area citizens. The particular zones of the AOZD are illustrated on the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Overlay Zoning District Map. 
a.  Exceptions. The restrictions contained in this section shall not apply to legal fences when located outside the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport property lines. 
b.  Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit may, if such action is deemed advisable by the Community Development Director and the FAA, require the owner of a structure or tree to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers, lights, and navigational aids as may be necessary to indicate to the fliers the presence of an airport hazard, at the owner's expense. 
c.  Prohibited uses in the Airport Overlay Zoning District. 
1.  Any use that would exceed the height restrictions of the AOZD. 
2.  No overhead electric, telephone, telegraph, or cable lines shall be erected within Zone A. 
d.  Land use airport zone charts and restrictions. Tables 4 through 10 shall be utilized for determination of any land use within this AOZD. No construction, alteration, location or use of land shall be inconsistent with the required AOZD as outlined in Tables 4 through 10.

Airport layout plan (ALP) (FAA FAR Sec. 152.3) means the plan of an airport that shows the layout of existing and proposed airport facilities. 
Airport master plan means the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport Master Plan Report, 2009, as updated. 
Airport overlay zones means a zone intended to place additional land use conditions on land impacted by the airport while retaining the existing underlying zone. The FAR part 77 Surfaces and runway protection zones (RPZs) have been combined to create five airport overlay zones. The five specific zones create a comprehensive area focused on maintaining compatible land use around airports. 
(1)  Zone Ais intended to provide a clear area that is free of above ground obstructions and structures. This zone is closest to the individual runway ends. 
(2)  Zone B1 and B2Reflects the approach and departure areas for each runway at an airport. The size of Zone B is predicated upon the type of approach (visual, non-precision, or precision) that a specific runway has and the type/size of aircraft that utilize the runway. 
(3)  Zone CIncludes those areas that are parallel to the runway pavement and extend 1,050 feet from the edge of the primary surface. 
(4)  Zone DEncompasses the horizontal surface (innermost area) and the conical surface (outermost area), which make up the three-mile jurisdictional boundary delineated at the Southern Wisconsin Regional Airport. 
Airport reference code (ARC) (FAA Web site www.faa.gov) means the ARC is an FAA coding system used to relate airport design criteria to the operational and physical characteristics of the airplanes intended to operate at the airport. 
Airport reference point (ARP)(FAA AC 150/5300-13) means the latitude and longitude of the approximate center of the airport. 
Airport zoning permit means a zoning/building site permit that allows new development or alteration or expansion of a permit required use.

(1)  20:1for all utility and visual runways extended from the primary surface a distance of 5,000 feet. 
(2)  34:1for all non-precision instrument runways extended from the primary surface for a distance of 10,000 feet. 
(3)  50:1/40:1for all precision instrument runways extended from the primary surface for a distance of 10,000 feet at an approach slope of 50:1 and an additional 40,000 feet beyond this at a 40:1 approach slope. 
Approach surface (FAA AC 150/5190-4A) means a surface that is longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extends outward and upward from the end of the primary surface at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation slope set forth in this chapter. In plain view, the perimeters of the approach surface and approach zone coincide. 
Aviation easement (FAA Web site www.faa.gov) means a grant of a property interest in land over which a right of unobstructed flight in the airspace is established. 
Building includes a "structure," a "building" or "structure" includes any part thereof. 
Building means any structure used, designed, or intended for the protection, shelter, enclosure, or support of persons, animals, or property. 
Building codes (The Practice of Local Government Planning) means codes, either local or state, that control the functional and structural aspects of buildings and/or structures. Local ordinances typically require proposed buildings to comply with zoning requirements before building permits can be issued under the building codes. 
Building height means the vertical distance from the top of the building roof to the top of the basement or to the foundation, whichever is less. 
Commercial uses means land uses or activities that involve the production, processing, manufacturing, or sale of goods or services for financial gain, including uses that provide merchandise to the general public. Accessory uses may include offices, storage, food service, or other amenities primarily for the use of employees and parking. 
Compatibility means the degree to which land uses or types of development can coexist or integrate. 
Construction means the erection or alteration of any structure or object of either a permanent or temporary nature. 
Density means the number of living units per acre. 
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings, structures, or accessory structures; the construction of additions or substantial improvements to buildings, structures, or accessory structures; the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes); mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations; and the deposition or extraction of materials. 
Easement means authorization by a property owner for the use by another and for specified purpose of any designed part of his or her property. 
Existing use means any use of land lawfully in existence at the time of the effective date of this chapter or amendment thereto becomes effective.

Ordinary maintenance repairs are not considered structural repairs, modifications or additions. Such ordinary maintenance repairs include internal and external painting, decorating, paneling, and the replacement of doors, windows, and other nonstructural components. (For purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.) 
Tree means any object of natural growth that shall not exceed the zoning height restrictions. 
Use means that which is customarily or habitually done, may include seasonal uses, and need not extend to the entire tract of land at the time of the adoption of this chapter. (See also Land use.)

(1)  Area varianceOne which does not involve a use that is prohibited by the Zoning Code. Area variances involve matters such as setback lines, frontage requirements, lot-size restrictions, density, density regulations, and yard requirements. Height limitation variances shall not be granted under this chapter. 
(2)  Use varianceOne which permits a use of land other than what is prescribed by the Zoning Code. It is primarily a grant to erect, alter, or use a structure for a permitted use in a manner other than that prescribed by this chapter. Use variances shall not be granted under this chapter. 
Wetland means those areas where water is at, near, or above the land surface long enough to support aquatic or hydroponic vegetation and which have soils indicative of wet conditions. 
Wildlife attractants means any manmade structure, land use practice, or manmade or natural geographic feature that can attract or sustain hazardous wildlife within the landing or departure airspace or the air operations area of an airport. Attractants include, but are not limited to, architectural features, landscaping, waste disposal sites, wastewater treatment facilities, agricultural or aquaculture activities, surface mining, or wetlands.
