SEC. 3-2-18 POLICIES FOR SPECIAL SITUATIONS. (Amended 4/16/2019 RC-409)
In consideration of specially assessing affected properties for direct and indirect costs of public improvements it is deemed desirable that basic policies be established for application to special and recurring situations, not for rigid application but rather each particular situation to be examined and to ascertain whether such policy operates equitably in that instance. Such policies, as developed, shall be listed as follows:
17
Special Assessments
(a) Sewer or Water, Corner Lots. In the case of a parcel of land against which has been levied a special assessment for sanitary sewer or water main laid in one of the streets upon which it abuts, when special assessment is levied for sanitary sewer or water main laid in the other street(s) upon which such corner lot abuts, the City shall assume the share of costs of the first one hundred (100) feet as it would have otherwise been assessed to such lot for the second and for each additional side along which such main(s) are so laid. This provision shall not apply to utility installations within new subdivisions/developments

21
Public Records
SEC. 3-3-5 ACCESS PROCEDURES.
(a) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be made to the legal custodian. A request shall be deemed sufficient if it reasonably describes the requested record or the information requested. However, a request for a record without a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record does not constitute a sufficient request. A request may be made orally, but a request must be in writing before an action to enforce the request is commenced under Sec. 19.37, Wis. Stats. Except as provided below, no request may be refused because the person making the request is unwilling to be identified or to state the purpose of the request. No request may be refused because the request is received by mail, unless prepayment of a fee is required under Section 3-3-4(f)(6). A requester may be required to show acceptable identification whenever the requested record is kept at a private residence or whenever security reasons or federal law or regulations so require.
(b) Each custodian, upon request for any record, shall, as soon as practicable and without delay, either fill the request or notify the requester of the authority's determination to deny the request in whole or in part and the reasons therefor. If the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, determines that a written request is so general as to be unduly time consuming, the party making the request may first be required to itemize his or her request in a manner which would permit reasonable compliance.
(c) A request for a record may be denied as provided in Section 3-3-6. If a request is made orally, the request may be denied orally unless a demand for a written statement of the reasons denying the request is made by the requester within five business days of the oral denial. If a written request is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall receive a written statement of the reasons for denying the request. Every written denial of a request shall inform the requester that, if the request for the record was made in writing, then the determination is subject to review upon petition for a writ of mandamus under Sec. 19.37(1), Wis. Stats., or upon application to the attorney general or a district attorney.
SEC. 3-3-6 LIMITATIONS ON RIGHT TO ACCESS.
(a) As provided in Sec. 19.36, Wis. Stats., the following records are exempt from inspection under this Chapter.
(1) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal law or authorized to be exempted from disclosure by state law;
(2) Any record relating to investigative information obtained for law enforcement purposes if federal law or regulations require exemption from disclosure or if exemption from disclosure is a condition to receipt of aids by the state;
(3) Computer programs and files, although the material used as input for a computer program/file or the material produced as a product of the computer program is subject to inspection; and
(4) Pursuant to Sec. 905.08, Wis. Stats., a record or any portion of a record containing information qualifying as a common law trade secret. "Trade secrets" are defined as unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plans, appliances, formulas, or processes which are used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles, materials or information which are obtained from a person and which are generally recognized as confidential.
22
Public Records
(b) As provided by Sec. 43.30, Wis. Stats., public library circulation records are exempt from inspection under this Section.
(c) In responding to a request for inspection or copying of a record which is not specifically exempt from disclosure, the legal custodian, after conferring with the City Attorney, may deny the request, in whole or in part, only if he or she determines that the harm to the public interest resulting from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in full access to the requested record. Examples of matters for which disclosure may be refused include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Records obtained under official pledges of confidentiality whichwere necessary and given in order to obtain the information contained in them.
(2) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(a), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations after a quasi-judicial hearing.
(3) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(b) and (c), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations concerning employment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, compensation, performance, or discipline of any City officer or employee, or the investigation of charges against a City officer or employee, unless such officer or employee consents to such disclosure.
(4) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(d), Wis. Stats., records concerning current strategy for crime detection or prevention.
(5) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(e), Wis. Stats., records of current deliberations or negotiations on the purchase of City property, investing of City funds, or other City business whenever competitive or bargaining reasons require nondisclosure.

Stats
(8) Pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(h), Wis. Stats., requests for confidential written advice from an ethics board, and records of advice given by such ethics board on such requests.
(d) If a record contains information that may be made public and information that may not be made public, the custodian of the record shall provide the information that may be made public and delete the information that may not be made public from the record before release. The custodian shall confer with the City Attorney prior to releasing any such record and shall follow the guidance of the City Attorney when separating out the exempt material. If, in the judgment of the custodian and the City Attorney, there is no feasible way to separate the exempt material from the nonexempt material without unreasonably jeopardizing nondisclosure of the exempt material, the entire record shall be withheld from disclosure.

(2) Whenever the fair market value of the item is more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), the Common Council shall determine whether or not the item is surplus City property.

Edges and joints shall be given a finish with a one-quarter (1/4) inch radius edging tool. Dry cement shall not be spread on a wet surface to take up excess water. Finishing operations shall be delayed until water has disappeared. No tool marks shall be left on exposed surfaces.

concrete placed in the forms shall have a temperature between fifty (50) degrees F. and seventy (70)
degrees F. and shall meet the requirements as per Wisconsin Department of Transportation
specifications for cold weather concrete.

Stats., the Common Council may order at any time property owners to repair or remove and replace any sidewalk which is unsafe, defective or insufficient, or which is damaged by the acts of the property owner or his agents.

(a) Purpose. For the safety of the general public, the City shall determine the location, size, construction and number of access points to public roadways within the City limits. It is the City's intent to provide safe access to properties abutting public roadways suitable for the property to be developed to its highest and best use, provided that access is not deficient or dangerous to the general public.
(b) Permit Required to Construct, Reconstruct, Alter or Enlarge. No person, firm or corporation shall construct, reconstruct, alter or enlarge any private driveway within the limits of the dedicated portion of any public street under the control and jurisdiction of the City of Delavan without first obtaining a permit therefor as provided by this Chapter.

Application for such permit shall be made to the City Clerk for referral to the Director of Public Works on a form provided by the City and shall be accompanied by a drawing accurately depicting the portion of the proposed private driveway to be constructed, reconstructed, altered or enlarged lying within the dedicated portion of the public street, the dimensions thereof and a statement of the materials proposed to be used. The applicant shall pay a fee of Five Dollars ($5.00). Upon receipt of the application and the fee if required, unless the proposed private driveway is a part of construction for a building or other structure for which a building permit has been applied for, in which case no additional fee is required, the Director of Public Works shall approve such application if the proposed driveway complies with the terms and conditions of this and any other applicable City ordinance.
(d) Application Provisions. All driveway permit applications shall contain the applicant's statement that:
(1) The applicant represents all parties in interest, and that such proposed driveway is for the bona fide purpose of securing access to his property and not for the purpose of parking or servicing vehicles, advertising, storage or merchandising of goods within the dedicated portion of the City street, or for any other purpose.
(2) The City, notwithstanding the construction of such driveway, reserves the right to make any changes, additions, repairs or relocations within the dedicated portion of the City street at any time, including relocation, reconstruction, widening and maintaining the street without compensating the owner of such private driveway for the damage or destruction of such private roadway.

16
Driveways
their appurtenances are within the limits of the frontage abutting the street of the property served. Driveways shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from any street intersection area and shall not encroach upon or occupy areas of the street right-of-way required for effective traffic control or for street signs or signals. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it shall have adequate sight distance along the street. Driveway approaches shall be at least ten (10) feet apart except by special permission from the Director of Public Works, and driveways shall in all cases be placed wherever possible as not to interfere with utilities in place.
(2) Number. The number of driveways to serve an individual property fronting on a street shall be one (1), except where deemed necessary and feasible by the Director of Public Works for reasonable and adequate service to the property, considering the safety, convenience and utility of the street.
(3) Island Area. The island area in the street right-of-way between successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the highway shoulder and right-of-way shall constitute a restricted area and may be filled in and graded only as provided in Subsection (7).
(4) Drainage. The surface of the driveway connecting with street cross sections shall slope downward and away from the highway shoulder a sufficient distance to preclude ordinary surface water drainage flowing onto the street roadbed. No driveway apron shall extend out into the street further than the face of the curb, and under no circumstances shall such driveway apron extend into the gutter area. All driveway entrances and approaches shall be so constructed that they shall not interfere with the drainage
Of streets, side ditches, or roadside areas or with any existing structure on the right-of-way.
(5) Culverts. Driveways shall not obstruct or impair drainage in street ditches or roadside areas. Driveway culverts, where required by the Director of Public Works, shall be adequate for surface water drainage along the street and shall not be less than the equivalent of a twelve (12) inch diameter pipe. When required by the Director of Public Works to provide for adequate surface water drainage along the street, the property owner shall provide any necessary culvert pipe at his own expense. The distance between culverts under successive driveways shall not be less than ten (10) feet except as such restricted area is permitted to be filled in pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (7) hereof.

The driveway surface shall be connected with the highway pavement and the sidewalk, if any, in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway construction shall include the replacement of such sidewalk areas which are inadequate or which are or may be damaged by means of vehicle travel across the sidewalk. All driveway entrances and approaches that are constructed across sidewalks shall be paved in accordance with the requirements for sidewalk construction in Section 6-2-2 of this Code insofar as such requirements are applicable, including thickness requirements. Standard thickness of residential driveway approaches will be six (6) inches thick.
(7) Restricted Areas. The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in and graded only when the following requirements are complied with:

Where the public sidewalk is remote from the curb, an island of a minimum length of ten (10) feet measured along the right-of-way line shall be maintained along each entrance to the City Street. All flares shall be tangent to the curb line. A curb length of not less than three (3) feet shall be left undisturbed adjacent to each property line to serve as an island area in the event an adjoining property owner applies for a driveway permit to serve his property.
(c) Special Requirements for Residential Driveways. The following regulations are applicable to driveways serving residential property:

(2) The minimum license tax under this Section shall be Five Dollars ($5.00) plus the Walworth County fee for spayed females or neutered males. The minimum fee for unspayed or unneutered animals shall be Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) plus the Walworth County fee. The license year shall commence January 1 and end December 31. (Amended 11-15-2016, Ord RC-374)
(3) Upon payment of the required license tax and upon presentation of evidence that the dog is currently immunized against rabies, as required by Section 7-1-2 of this Chapter, the City Treasurer shall complete and issue to the owner a license for such dog containing all information required by state law. The City Treasurer shall also deliver to the owner, at the time of issuance of the license, a tag of durable material bearing the same serial number as the license, the name of the county in which issued and the license year.
(4) The owner shall securely attach the tag to a collar and the collar with the tag attached shall be kept on the dog for which the license is issued at all times, except as provided in Section 7-1-2(e).
(5) The fact that a dog is without a tag attached to the dog by means of a collar shall be presumptive evidence that the dog is unlicensed. Any City police or humane officer shall seize, impound or restrain any dog for which a dog license is required which is found without such tag attached.
(6) Notwithstanding the foregoing, every dog specifically trained to lead blind or deaf persons is exempt from the dog license tax, and every person owning such a dog shall receive annually a free dog license from the City Treasurer upon application therefor.
b) Kennel Licenses.
(1) Any person who keeps or operates a kennel may, instead of the license tax for each dog required by this Chapter, apply for a kennel license for the keeping or operating of the kennel. Such person shall pay for the license year a license tax of Thirty Dollars ($30.00) for a kennel of twelve (12) or fewer dogs and an additional Ten Dollars ($10.00) for each dog in excess of twelve (12).

These tags may be transferred from one dog to another within the kennel whenever any dog is removed from the kennel. The rabies vaccination tag or substitute tag shall remain attached to the dog for which it is issued at all times but this requirement does not apply to a show dog during competition or to a dog securely confined indoors. No dog bearing a kennel tag shall be permitted to stray or to be taken any where outside the limits of the kennel unless the dog is in leash or temporarily for the purposes of hunting, breeding, trial, training or competition.
(3) A condition of a kennel license shall be that the licensed premises may be entered and inspected at any reasonable hour by the City Health Officer without any warrant, and the application for a license hereunder shall be deemed a consent to this provision. Any refusal to permit such inspection shall automatically operate as a revocation of any license issued hereunder and shall be deemed a violation of this Section. Should any kennel be found to constitute a public nuisance, the license shall be revoked and the nuisance abated pursuant to City ordinances.

The owner shall have the animal vaccinated against rabies between one hundred fifty-five (155) and one hundred sixty-five (165) days after the exposure to a rabid animal.

SEC. 7-2-8 INVESTIGATION.
(a) The City Clerk, on behalf of the Common Council's General Operations Committee, shall notify the Chief of Police, Health Officer, Fire Inspector and Building Inspector of each new and renewal application, and these officials shall inspect or cause to be inspected each application and the premises, together with such other investigation as shall be necessary to determine whether the applicant and the premises sought to be licensed comply with the regulations, ordinances and laws applicable thereto, including those governing sanitation in restaurants, and whether the applicant is a proper recipient of a license. The Police Department shall conduct an investigation of the applicant, including, but not limited to, requesting information from the State,
surrounding municipalities, and/or any community where the applicant has previously resided concerning the applicant's arrest and conviction record. These officials shall furnish to the City Clerk in writing, who shall forward to the General Operations Committee, the information derived from such investigation. The General Operations Committee will make a recommendation as to whether a license should be granted or refused. No license shall be renewed without a re-inspection of the premises and report as originally required.
(b) If the General Operations Committee recommends the denial of the application, the applicant shall be notified by the City Clerk at not less than three (3) nor more than ten (10) days prior to the Council meeting at which the application is to be considered. The notice shall set forth the basis for such recommendation and inform the applicant of the opportunity to appear before the Common Council.
(c) In determining whether to grant such license, consideration shall be given to the arrest and conviction record of the applicant, subject to the limitations imposed by Sections 111.321, 111.322 and 111.335, Wis. Stats., financial responsibility of the applicant, the appropriateness of the location and premises where such licensed business is to be conducted, and generally the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed. An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two (2) offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right
granted solely to the Common Council, the Common Council reserves the right to consider the severity and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the determination to grant, deny or not renew a license. Further, the Council at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two (2) or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one (1) year or more.
(d) (1) If the Common Council denies the license, the applicant shall be notified in writing, by registered mail or personal service, of the reasons for the denial. The notice shall also inform the applicant of the opportunity to appear before the Common Council and to provide evidence as to why the denial should be reversed. In addition, the notice shall inform the applicant that the reconsideration of the application may be held in closed session, pursuant to Sec. 19.85(1)(b), Wis.

SEC. 7-2-34 ISSUANCE OR DENIAL OF OPERATOR'S LICENSES.
(a) After the approval of an operator's license, the City Clerk shall issue the license. Such licenses shall be issued and numbered in the order they are granted and shall give the applicant's name and address and the date of the expiration of such license.
(b) If the application is denied, the City Clerk shall, in writing, inform the applicant of the denial, the reasons therefore, and of the opportunity to request a reconsideration of the application by the General Operations Committee.
(c) (1) Any applicant denied an operator's license by the City Clerk shall have the right to appeal the denial to the General Operations Committee. Such appeal shall be in writing and given to the City Clerk within thirty (30) days of the denial. The City Clerk shall promptly place the matter on the soonest available Committee agenda. The General Operations Committee shall independently review the applicant's request for an operator's license under this Section.
(2) If, upon reconsideration, the General Operations Committee again denies the application, the City Clerk shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons therefore. An applicant who is denied any license upon reconsideration of the matter, may apply to Circuit Court pursuant to Sec. 125.12(2)(d), Wis. Stats., for review.
(d) (1) Consideration for the granting or denial of a license will be based on Sec. 125.04(5), Wis. Stats.:
(2) If a licensee is convicted of an offense substantially related to the licensed activity, the General Operations Committee may act to revoke or suspend the incense.
(e) An application may be denied based upon the applicant's arrest and conviction record if the applicant has been convicted of a felony (unless duly pardoned) or if the applicant has habitually been a law offender. For purposes of this licensing procedure, "habitually been a law offender" is generally considered to be an arrest or conviction of at least two (2) offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding the license application. Because a license is a privilege, the issuance of which is a right granted solely to the General Operations Committee, the General Operations Committee reserves the right
to consider the severity, and facts and circumstances of the offense when making the determination to grant or
deny an original license.
SEC. 7-2-35 DISPLAY OF LICENSE.
Each license issued under the provisions of this Chapter shall be posted on the premises whenever the operator dispenses beverages or be in his possession, or carry a license card. Further, the General Operations Committee, at its discretion, may, based upon an arrest or conviction record of two (2) or more offenses which are substantially related to the licensed activity within the five (5) years immediately preceding, act to suspend such license for a period of one (1) year or more.
SEC. 7-2-36 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF OPERATOR'S LICENSE.
Violation of any of the terms or provisions of the State law or of this Chapter relating to operator's licenses by any person holding such operator's license shall be cause for revocation or suspension of the license. Because a license is a privilege, the General Operations Committee, at its discretion, may act to revoke or suspend a license if the licensee is convicted of an offense substantially related to the licensed activity or if other grounds exist.

7-5-1 Purpose; Definitions
7-5-2 Permit Requirements
SEC. 7-5-1 PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS.
(a) Purpose. The City of Delavan recognizes that City streets and highways are primarily for the use of vehicular travel. It further recognizes a need to use these public streets and highways for processions, parades, runs, walks, bicycle races, marathons, etc., which do not substantially interfere with the public's right to travel on such streets and highways. This Chapter is intended to regulate and control non-vehicular use of the streets and highways and for protecting the general welfare and safety of the persons using the streets and highways within the City. Said authority to regulate is contained in Sec. 349.185, Wis. Stats., and related sections.
(b) Definitions. As used in this Chapter:
(1) "Processions, parades, runs, walks, marathons, bicycle races, or like event," means their usual and customary usage.
(2) "Highways" or "streets" have the meaning set forth in Sec. 340.01, Wis. Stats., and also include areas owned by the City of Delavan which are used for vehicular traffic.
SEC. 7-5-2 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
(a) Permit Required. No person shall form, direct, lead or participate in any procession, parade, run, walk, marathon, bicycle race, or like event, on any street or highway under the jurisdiction of the City unless a permit has been obtained in advance as provided in this Chapter.
(b) Exemptions from Permit Requirement. A permit is not required for assembling or movement of a funeral procession or military convoy. Any other such event sponsored by any agency of the federal, state or municipal government, acting in its governmental capacity within the scope of its authority, shall be required to obtain a permit, however, shall be exempt from the parade permit fee and insurance requirements contained herein.
(c) When Application Must Be Made. A written application for a permit for any above-described function on the streets and highways under the jurisdiction of the City shall be made by one (1) of the organizers or officers to the City Clerk on a form provided by said Clerk no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the usage. Application made less than forty-five (45) days prior to the day of the proposed usage must be made in person. Said time periods may be waived by the Mayor.
(d) Information Required in Application. The application shall set forth the following information regarding the proposed usage:
(1) The name, address and telephone number of the applicant.
(2) If the usage is proposed to be conducted for, on behalf of or by an organization, the name, address and telephone number of the headquarters of the organization and of the authorized and responsible heads of such organization.

(8) Any additional information which the Clerk finds reasonably necessary for a fair determination as to whether a permit should be issued.
(e) Recommendations of Governmental Agencies. The City Clerk shall submit a copy of the application to the Chief of Police and Director of Public Works for their recommendation.
(f) Basis for Discretionary Denial of Permit. The application may be denied:
(1) If it is for a usage that is to be held on a work day during hours when and at places where, in addition to the proposed usage, the flow of vehicular traffic is usually delayed by its own volume.
(2) If it is for a usage that is to be commenced between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and
9:00 a.m.
(3) If sufficient usage marshals are not provided as to reasonably assure the orderly conduct of the usage.
(4) If proposed route for conducting usage involves a street or highway under construction or detour route.
(g) Mandatory Denial of Permit. The application shall be denied:
(1) If it is for a usage that is primarily for private or commercial economic gain; or
(2) If it is for a usage which would involve violation of federal, state or local laws relating to use of highways or of other applicable regulations of the City; or
(3) If the granting of the permit would conflict with another permit already granted or for which application is already pending; or
(4) If the application does not contain the information required by Subsection (d); or
(5) If more than one (1) assembly area or more than one (1) dispersal area is proposed; or
(6) Failure to receive permit under Sec. 84.07(4), Wis. Stats.
(h) Permit Issued Unless Threat to Public Safety. The City Clerk shall issue a permit to the applicant subject to the foregoing requirements of this Chapter, unless the Clerk concludes that
(1) The policing of the usage will require so large a number of persons and vehicles, including ambulances, as to prevent adequate service of the needs of the rest of the municipality; or
(2) The usage will substantially hinder the movement of police and fire and other emergency vehicles as to create a substantial risk to persons and property; or
(3) The conduct of the usage will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route; or
(4) The usage is so poorly organized that participants are likely to engage in aggressive or destructive activity.
(I) Grant or Denial of Permit.
(1) Time When Required. The City Clerk shall act as promptly as he reasonably can on all applications for permits after consulting with other government agencies directly affected and after consulting with the applicant, if necessary. All applications filed forty-five (45) days or more in advance shall be granted or
denied not less than thirty (30) days before the date of the usage stated in the application. Action on applications filed less than forty-five (45) days in advance shall be taken within fifteen (15) days after the application is filed, but in no case later than forty eight (48) hours in advance of the time applied for. The City Clerk shall immediately, by the most reasonable means of communication, notify the applicant of such action and, if the application is denied, the reasons for denial of the permit.
(2) Modification of Requested Permit. In lieu of denying a permit, the Clerk may authorize the changing of assembly areas or dispersal areas or the conducting of the usage at a date or time or over a route different than as applied for in the permit. The applicant or permittee may accept such modification by immediately notifying the Clerk in writing of such acceptance.
40

Bicycle Races and Marathons
(j) Fee. There shall be paid at the time of filing the application for a usage permit a fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00).
(k) Charge for Increased Costs. Were the City Clerk determines that the cost of municipal services incident to the staging of the usage will be increased because of the usage, the Clerk may require the permittee to make an additional payment into the general fund of the City in an amount equal to the increased costs.
(l) Emergency Revocation. The City Clerk, Mayor, City Administrator, or Chief of Police may revoke a permit already issued if the official deems that such action is justified by an actual or potential emergency due to weather, fire, riot, other catastrophe or likelihood of a breach of the peace, or by a major change in the conditions forming the basis of the standards of issuance.

To establish a permitting process that will allow for and encourage the installation of Public Art throughout the community.

It helps a community remember its past, honor an ideal, and express its values and concerns to future generations. Public art makes a community more livable and more visually stimulating.
Specific goals of Public Art are to:
1) Enhance the City’s sense of place in the region by providing unique artwork throughout the community in a manner unlike any other place in the area
2) Celebrate the City’s history and cultural spirit and identity through the creation of art that is accessible to the public
3) Create a recognizable icon
4) Enhance the appearance and livability of public spaces, through the placement of site-specific art projects that respond to the natural and built landscape
5) Enliven public spaces
6) Enhance overall quality and identity of the place and/or building
7) Strengthen community identity, spirit and collective cultural experience through the placement of public art throughout the City
8) Allow local, regional, national and international artists to share their creations with the community
9) Stimulate the economic success of businesses
10) Attract visitors and leave them with a positive impression and a desire to return
11) Create a more livable community by linking arts and everyday life with the objective of making Delavan the place of choice to live, work, recreate and raise a family.
71

SEC. 8-1-8 REGULATION OF LENGTH OF LAWN AND GRASSES. (Amended 2/8/2011, Ordinance RC-298)
(a) Purpose. This Section is adopted due to the unique nature of the problems associated with lawns, grasses and noxious weeds being allowed to grow to excessive length in the City of Delavan on residential properties.
(b) Public Nuisance Declared. The Common Council finds that lawns, grasses and noxious weeds on residential lots or parcels of land which exceed twelve (12) inches in length adversely affect the public health and safety of the public in that they tend to emit pollen and other discomforting bits of plants, constitute a fire hazard and a safety hazard in that debris can be hidden in the grass, interferes with the public convenience and adversely affects property values of other land within the City. For that reason, any lawn, grass or weed on a lot or other parcel of land which exceeds twelve (12) inches in length is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, except where the lawn, grass or weed is part of a natural lawn approved pursuant to Section 8-1-7 above.
(c) Nuisances Prohibited. No person, firm or corporation shall permit any public nuisance as defined in Subsection (b) above to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him within the City.
(d) Inspection. The Director of Public Works, Weed Commissioner, City Administrator, or their respective agents, shall inspect or cause to be inspected all premises and places within the City to determine whether any public nuisance as defined in Subsection (b) above exists.
(e) Abatement of Nuisance.
(1) If the Director of Public Works, Weed Commissioner, City Administrator, or their respective agents, shall determine with reasonable certainty that any public nuisance as defined in Subsection (b) above exists, he shall immediately cause written notice to be served that the City proposes to have the lot grass or lawn cut so as to conform with this Section and Section 8-1-6.
(2) The notice shall be served or mailed at least five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing and shall be mailed or served on the owner of the lot or parcel of land or, if he is not known and there is a tenant
occupying the property, then to the tenant, of the time and place at which the hearing will be held.

(f) Due Process Hearing. If the owner believes that his grasses or weeds are not a nuisance, he may request a hearing before the City Administrator. The request for said hearing must be made in writing to the City Clerk's office within the five (5) days set forth in the Weed Commissioner's notice. Upon application for the hearing, the property owner must deposit a Fifty Dollar ($50.00) bond. If a decision is rendered in the property owner's favor, the Fifty Dollar ($50.00) will be returned to the property owner. If the property owner fails to appear
for the hearing or if the decision is rendered against the property owner, the deposit shall be forfeited and applied to the cost of City personnel abating the nuisance, if necessary. When a hearing is requested by the owner of the property, a hearing by the City Administrator shall be held within five (5) days from the date of the owner's request. The property in question will not be mowed by the City until such time as the hearing is held by the City Administrator. At the hearing, the owner may appear in person or by his attorney, may present witnesses in his own behalf and may cross-examine witnesses presented by the City as well as subpoena witnesses for his own case. At the close of the hearing, the City Administrator shall make his determination in writing specifying his findings, facts, and conclusions. If the City Administrator determines that a public nuisance did exist, the Administrator shall order the Weed Commissioner to mow the property in question unless the property has been mowed by the owner within forty-eight (48) hours of the City Administrator's decision. If the owner does not abate the nuisance within the described forty-eight (48) hours, the Weed Commissioner shall cause the same nuisance to be abated and cost in excess of the forfeited fee assessed accordingly.
(g) City's Option To Abate Nuisance. In any case where the owner, occupant or person in charge of the property shall fail to cut his lawn, grass or weeds as set forth above, then, and in that event, the City may elect to cut said lawn, grass or weeds as follows:
(1) The written notice required in Subsection (e) shall inform said person that in the event of his failure to abate the nuisance within the prescribed time, the City shall abate the same and the cost thereof shall be assessed to the property owner as a special charge.
(2) The City shall cut or cause to be cut all grass and weeds from the subject's property and shall charge the expenses of so doing at a rate as established by resolution by the City administrator. The charges shall be set forth in a statement to the City Clerk who, in turn, shall mail the same to the owner, occupant or person in charge of the subject premises. If said statement is not paid in full within thirty (30) days thereafter, the City Clerk shall enter the charges in the tax roll as a special tax against said lot or parcel of land, and the same shall be collected in all respects like other taxes upon real estate, or as provided under Sec. 66.0627, Wisconsin Statutes.
(3) In addition to these abatement procedures, any person or persons found to be in violation of this Section, on conviction thereof, may be subject to a forfeiture as provided in Section 1-1-7.

The application will contain the legal description of the property to be served, the name of the owner, the exact use to be made of the service, and the size of the service lateral and meter desired. Note particularly any special refrigeration, fire protection, or water-consuming air-conditioning equipment.
(b) Service will be furnished only if (1) the premises have a frontage on a properly platted street or public strip in which a cast iron or other long-life water main has been laid, or where property owner has agreed to and complied with the provisions of the water utility’s filed main extension rule, (2) the property owner has installed or agrees to install a service lateral from the curb stop to the point of use that is not less than 6 feet below the surface of an established or proposed grade and meets the water utility's specification, and (3) the premises have adequate piping beyond the metering point.
(c) The owner of a multi-unit dwelling has the option of being served by individual metered water service to each unit. The owner, by selecting this option, is required to provide interior plumbing and meter settings to enable individual metered service to each unit and individual disconnection without affecting service to other units. Each meter and meter connection will be treated as a separate water utility account for the purpose of the filed rules and regulations.

Except for duplexes, no division of a water service lateral shall be made at the curb for separate supplies for two or more separate premises having frontage on any street or public service strip, whether owned by the same or different parties. Duplexes may be served by one lateral provided (1) individual metered service and disconnection is provided and (2) it is permitted by local ordinance.
(e) Buildings used in the same business, located on the same parcel, and served by a single lateral may have the customer’s water supply piping installed to a central point so that volume can be metered in one place.

(a) See Wis. Admin. Code § PSC 185.35.
(b) Subject to the utility's rules setting forth the method of determining a reduced rate herein authorized, if a leak unknown to the customer is found in an appliance or the plumbing, the utility may estimate the water so wasted and bill for it at a reduced rate not less than the utility's cost thereof. No such adjustment shall be made for water supplied after the customer has been notified and has had an opportunity to correct the condition.
(c) The Water Utility shall inform each customer at least once each year that it is the sole responsibility of the customer to prevent leakage in all piping and fixtures on the premises at and beyond the metering point, and that any leaks or other losses of water, registered by the meter, will be billed at the filed rates. [See, however, Subsection (d) immediately following].
(e) Pursuant to the Wisconsin Administrative Code citation above referenced in Subsection (a) of this Section, should it be determined that a leak unknown to a customer has been found in an appliance or the plumbing, the Utility may make adjustment for the water so wasted by estimating the water so wasted and bill for it at a reduced rate not less than the Utility's cost thereof in accordance with policies and/or rules it may establish therefor.

SEC. 9-1-32 THAWING FROZEN SERVICES
(a) See Wis. Admin. Code § PSC 185.88.
(b) Frozen services shall be thawed by and at the entire expense of the utility except where the customer has been notified in advance of a corrective measure to follow or the freezing was caused by contributory fault or negligence on the part of the customer, such as reduction of the cover or undue exposure of the piping in the building or on the customer's property, or failure to comply with the water department specifications and requirements as to depth of service, sufficient backfill, etc. (See PSC 185.35(7) for adjustment of bill where utility requests customer to permit stream of water to flow to prevent freezing.)
(c) The thawing of frozen services or other underground pipes electrically may introduce hazards if proper precautions are not taken. Damage to buildings and to electrical facilities may result from high current flow in grounding conductors and neutrals. The electric current may reach the grounding conductor and the neutral which may be in parallel with the pipe, or reach the conductor because of physical contact between the interior water piping and the metallic tubing or conduit of the interior wiring.
(d) It is recommended that when service pipes are being thawed electrically, the water meters be removed and that experienced personnel familiar with the above hazards be asked to disconnect the grounding conductors and to suggest a safe place to connect the conductors used for thawing the pipe.

See Wis. Admin. Code § PSC 185.37.
SEC. 9-1-39 FAILURE TO READ METERS
(a) Where the water utility is unable to read a meter, the fact will be plainly indicated on the bill, and either an estimated bill will be computed or the minimum charge applied. The difference shall be adjusted when the meter is again read, that is, the bill for the succeeding billing period will be computed with the gallons or cubic feet in each block of the rate schedule doubled, and credit will be given on that bill for the amount of the bill paid the preceding period. Only in unusual cases shall more than three consecutive estimated or minimum bills be rendered.
(b) If the meter is damaged (see Section 9-1-46 Surreptitious Use of Water) or fails to operate, the bill will be based on the average use during the past year, unless there is some reason why the use is not normal.

e. Reasons why the debt has been outstanding.
f. Any other relevant factors concerning the circumstances of the customer.
(2) In the Deferred Payment Agreement it shall state immediately preceding the space provided for the customer's signature and in boldface print at least two (2) sizes larger than any other used thereon, the following:
"If you are not satisfied with this agreement, do not sign. If you do sign this agreement you give up your right to dispute the amount due under the agreement except for the utility's failure or refusal to follow the terms of this agreement."
(3) A Deferred Payment Agreement shall not include a finance charge.
(4) If an applicant for service has not fulfilled the terms of a Deferred Payment Agreement, the utility shall have the right to disconnect service or refuse service in accordance with these rules and under such circumstances it shall not be required to offer subsequent negotiation of a Deferred Payment Agreement prior to disconnection.
(5) Any payments made by the customer in compliance with a Deferred Payment Agreement, or otherwise, shall be first considered made in payment of the previous account balance with any remainder credited to the current bill.
(d) Dispute Procedures. (See Wis. Admin. Code § PSC 185.39)
(1) Whenever the customer advises the utility's designated office prior to the disconnection of service that all or part of any billing as rendered is in dispute, or that any matter related to the disconnection is in dispute, the utility shall investigate the dispute promptly and completely, advise the customer of the results of the investigation, attempt to resolve the dispute, and provide the opportunity for the customer to enter into a Deferred Payment Agreement when applicable in order to settle the dispute.

(3) Any party to the dispute after informal review may make a written request for a formal review by the Commission. If the Commission decides to conduct a formal hearing on the dispute, the customer must pay fifty percent (50%) of the bill in dispute or post a bond for that amount on or before the hearing date. Failure to pay the amount or post the bond will constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.

SEC. 9-1-51 CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL (Amended 4/16/2019 RC-409)
(a) Purpose. Pursuant to state requirement of protection of the public water system from contaminants due to backflow thereof through water service connections and the further requirement for maintenance of continuing program of cross connection control to prevent the contamination of all the public water system, there is hereby created a program in this City to effectuate the same as hereinafter provided.
(b) Definition. A cross connection shall be defined as any physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water from the City water system, and the other, water from a private source, water of unknown or questionable safety, or steam, gases, or chemicals, whereby there may be a flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two systems.

SEC. 9-1-54 CONNECTION WITHWATER SYSTEM REQUIRED. (Amended 4/16/2019 RC-409)
(a) Purpose. To assure preservation of public health, comfort, and safety, all buildings used for human habitation and located adjacent to the water main, or in a block through which such system extends, shall be required to connect with such system, unless otherwise agreed to in a developer’s agreement, intergovernmental agreement, postponement agreement, or other agreement approved by the Common Council.

SEC. 9-3-57 SEWER SERVICE CHARGE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE (Amended 11/2/2013, RC-334) (amended 03/21/17, Ord. RC-381)
(a) Charges for sewer service set forth under Sections 9-3-50 through 9-3-53 include amounts to reflect charges for sewage treatment provided by the Walworth County Metropolitan Sewerage District (WALCOMET). The charges specified in the above-stated sections shall be reviewed annually and shall be adjusted as necessary to generate revenues sufficient to cover estimated annual costs related to the treatment of sanitary sewage by WALCOMET. (amended 03/21/17, Ord. RC-381)
(b) The City shall use its best efforts to develop a rate structure that will generate the actual revenues needed to cover WalCoMet related costs. Annually in the third quarter of the year, a projection based on actual WalCoMet revenues and expenses through September and projected WalCoMet revenues and expenses through remainder of the year shall be made. Consistent with the objective of Section 9-3-55 to have the rates established for the operations, maintenance and debt service related to collection facilities and the rates established for the operations, maintenance and debt service related to treatment facilities each cover their respective related costs, an adjustment shall be made to City’s proposed WalCoMet charges for the subsequent period to the extent WalCoMet related revenues for the current period exceed or fall short of covering WalCoMet related expenses for the current period.
For purposes of this section, no adjustment shall be made if projected year-end expenses fall within a range of 95% to 105% of projected year-end WalCoMet revenues.
If projected year-end expenses fall below 95% of projected year-end revenues the amount to be recovered by the proposed WalCoMet rates for the subsequent period shall be reduced by the amount expenses fall below this 95% of projected year-end revenue number;
If projected year-end expenses exceed 105% of projected year-end revenues the amount to be recovered by the proposed WalCoMet rates for the subsequent period shall be increased by the amount expenses exceed this 105% of projected year-end revenue number.

SEX OFFENDERS RESIDING WITHIN 1,000 FEET OF SCHOOLS, DAYCARE CENTERS, PARKS AND OTHER SPECIFIED FACILITIES AND USES PROHIBITED; CHILD SAFETY ZONES (Adopted 11-18-2014, RC-347)

11-7-11 Effective .
SEC. 11-7-1 PURPOSE. The Common Council finds that repeat sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children, are sexual offenders who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses: and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
It is not the intent of the Common Council to punish sex offenders, but rather to serve the City’s compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Delavan by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers, wherein, certain sexual offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.
Due to the high rate of recidivism for sexual offenders, and because reducing both opportunity and temptation would help minimize the risk of re-offense, there is a compelling need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places.
SEC. 11-7-2 DEFINITIONS. As used in this Chapter and unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) “Child” means a person under the age of eighteen (18) years.
(b) A "sexually violent offense" shall have the meaning as set forth in §980.01(6), Wis. Stats.

Sec. 971.17(1j), for the following offenses:

and
(25) §975.06 Sex Crimes Law Commitment

(l) The provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted to promote the health, safety, morals, comfort, prosperity and general welfare of the City of Delavan.
(2) This Chapter shall not repeal, impair or modify private covenants or public ordinances, except that it shall apply whenever it imposes stricter restrictions on land use

(c) Intent. It is the general intent of this chapter to regulate the division of land so as:
(1) To lessen congestion in the streets and highways and provide for their appropriate and timely upgrade to serve the needs of the land division;
(2) To further the orderly layout and appropriate use of land; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood, excessive traffic relative to road capacity, and other dangers;

(7) To encourage the orderly and beneficial development of the community through appropriate growth management techniques, infill development in areas with adequate public facilities, and appropriate development phasing that limits land division in areas premature for urban development;
(8) To ensure that public facilities, utilities, and services are available concurrent with land division development, and that they will have sufficient capacity to serve the proposed land division, and that the community will be required to bear no more than its fair share of the cost of providing such facilities, utilities, and services;
(9) To ensure the protection and, where possible, the enhancement of environmental resources, and the preservation of productive farmland and natural beauty to the extent consistent with City plans;
(10) To ensure adequate legal description and proper survey documentation of land divisions;

Subdivision Regulations
SEC. 14-1-2 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall govern.
SEC. 14-1-3 INTERPRETATION.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City of Delavan and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Wisconsin Statutes.
SEC 14-1-4 SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this Chapter is invalid or unconstitutional, or if the application of this Chapter to any person or circumstances is invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the other provisions or applications of this Chapter which can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application.
SEC. 14-1-5 REPEAL.
All other ordinances or parts of ordinances of the City inconsistent or conflicting with this Chapter, to the extent of the inconsistency only, are hereby repealed.
SEC. 14-1-6 TITLE.
This Chapter shall be known as, referred to, or cited as the "City of Delavan Subdivision Chapter," "City of Delavan Subdivision Code" or "City of Delavan Land Division and Subdivision Chapter."
SEC. 14-1-7 CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENTS. (Added 09/14/1999 by RC-71)
(a) Purpose.
(1) The City Council hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium development that requires limited applicability of the City’s Subdivision Ordinance to condominium developments. The State Legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums, but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium.
(2) The City Council hereby finds that condominium developments may impact community resources in the same manner as other developments, which are accomplished by land division. These impacts include:
a. Additional population density;
b. Possibility of particular land use in a manner unsuitable to the land’s characteristics;
c. Additional demands upon City area parks, recreation areas and utility facilities;
d. Additional traffic and street use.
6
Subdivision Regulations
(b) Portions of Ordinance Applicable to Condominium Developments. The following sections of this Subdivision Ordinance shall apply to condominium developments:
(1) Section 14-1-30 through 14-1-32 of Article D, relating to Preliminary Plat approval shall control the procedural aspects of a condominium development. The City may, at it’s discretion, require additional information be included with the application. This stage of approval shall be the only approval required for a condominium development. The technical requirements for preliminary plats set forth herein of this Ordinance shall not apply, since condominiums have separate technical standards set forth in Wis. Stat. Chap. 703.

Grievances Regarding Access to Public Buildings
by Handicapped Persons
(d) Other Remedies. The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of a Section 504 complaint with the Office of Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of the Treasury. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. However, the City believes that resolution of the complaint will be more promptly achieved if the City is able to provide a remedy before the complaint is brought to an external organization.
(e) Due Process. This Section shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure that the City complies with Section 504 regulations.

SEC. 15-7-1 PURPOSE. The City of Delavan recognizes a need for an organized inspection program of residential rental units within the City in order to maintain the condition of such residential rental units so that they meet and comply with all provisions of the City of Delavan Code of Ordinances as well as all applicable safety, health, fire, building and construction requirements promulgated by the State of Wisconsin. The City of Delavan also desires to provide a more efficient system for compelling both absentee and local landlords to correct violations and to maintain, in proper condition, rental property within the City. The City recognizes that the most efficient system to provide for rental inspections is the creation of a program requiring the registration of all residential rental units within the City so that an orderly inspection program in designated areas in which code violations and other related factors are occurring may be established. For this purpose, the City hereby establishes two districts; District 1 being that area of the City that lies North and West of Interstate 43 and District 2 being that area of the City that lies South and East of Interstate 43. A map illustrating these two districts shall be posted in the Public Works Office Area located in the lower level of City Hall. All residential units within District 1 shall be subject to the inspection program as identified herein. (Amended Ord. RC-398, 8-21-2018)

Sec. 15-8-1 Legislative Intent
1. Purpose: The City Council of the City of Delavan, Wisconsin finds that there are now, and may in the future be vacant buildings which are dilapidated, unsafe, unhygienic and inadequately maintained so as to create or contribute to blight and so as to jeopardize the health, safety, prosperity and general welfare, and so as to create a public and/or private nuisance.
2. Intent: The intent of this Code is to establish the measures and requirements reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public from the public nuisances, blight and negative market impact of vacant or abandoned buildings and structures.
Sec. 15-8-2 Public Record
1. Finding: In addition to the purposes in Section 15-8-1, the City finds that vacant buildings are targets for vandalism, arson, and other illegal activities. The City still further finds that the public disclosure of the identification of any or all vacant buildings would provide to persons with criminal intentions a data source to locate vacant buildings in which to carry out illegal activity. While the City acknowledges the requirements of the Wisconsin Public Records Law embodied in Wisconsin States §§ 19.31 through 19.39, and the strong public policy underpinning those statutes that all persons are entitled to the greatest possible information regarding the affairs of government, the City also recognizes that against that strong public policy, records custodians must balance contrary public policy such as that found by the City in this subsection 1, that would weigh against disclosure of a particular document.
2. Policy: Prior to releasing any records that are received, created or maintained pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or are received, created, or maintained to accomplish the purpose of this chapter, the records custodian will consider the intent of the City articulated in this section.

Section 22.105 Purpose and Intent of Standard Zoning Districts
The following subsections specify the purpose and intent of the standard zoning districts established by this Title. References to "development options" refer to conventional, equestrian, and loose cluster development options which are explained in detail in Section 23.206(1).
(1) Agricultural District
(a) Rural Holding (RH-35ac) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit development which is solely of a rural community character. The land use standards for this district permit very low density single-family residential development at a density of 1 dwelling unit for every 35 gross acres, as well as a variety of agricultural and agricultural support land uses. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that development which requires even a minimum of urban services does not occur until such services are available. As such, the Rural Holding (RH-35ac) District shall either serve as a designation which preserves and protects agricultural activities, or as a "holding zone" which provides for an interim land use (agriculture) that will easily permit further development (with rezoning to another district) at the appropriate time.
Rationale: This district is used to provide for the protection of agricultural activities, and a very low density residential area for those who want to live in a rural environment and who retain enough land with their residence to ensure that the rural environment is maintained as long as the Rural Holding (RH-35ac) District designation is retained. In this manner, even if all property were developed in a given area with the Rural Holding (RH-35ac) District designation, the rural community character of that area would still be maintained.

(2) Residential Districts
(a) Residential Estate (RE-5ac) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit development which has a very low density, countryside community character. Unlike the case for the Rural Holding (RH-35ac) District, the land use standards for this district permit primarily single-family detached residential development and a variety of related institutional land uses, and are not oriented to a wide range of agricultural activities. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that the Residential Estate (RE-5ac) District shall serve as a designation which preserves and protects the estate community character of its area. A variety of residential development options are available in this district, with a Maximum Gross Density (MGD) of 1 dwelling unit for every 5 gross acres.
Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of a very low density residential area for those who want to live in a countryside environment and who retain enough land with their residence, or in their development, to ensure that the countryside community character is maintained as long as the Residential Estate (RE-5ac) District designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area.

(e) Residential Mixed (RM-8) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit development which has a moderately high density community character which lies somewhere between suburban and urban. The land use standards for this district permit both single-family detached residential development and certain types of moderately high density single-family attached development permitted by right, and both moderately high density single-family attached development and certain types of multi-family development permitted as a conditional use, as well as a variety of related institutional land uses. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that the Residential Mixed (RM-8) District shall serve as a designation which preserves and protects the moderately high density residential community character of its area. A variety of residential development options are available in this district, with a Maximum Gross Density (MGD) of 8 dwelling units per gross acre.
Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of an area for those who want to live in a moderately high density residential environment and who retain enough land with their residence, or in their development, to ensure that the desired community character is maintained as long as the Residential Mixed (RM-8) District designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area. As such, this district is intended to provide the principal location for a wide range of single-family attached dwelling types, including twin houses, duplexes, atrium houses, and weak link townhouses.

(3) Nonresidential Districts
(a) Office Neighborhood (ON) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit high-quality office and institutional land uses at an intensity compatible with the estate community character of older portions of the City predominately developed with large homes which are desirable to maintain, where traffic volumes and adjacent land uses dictate the transition of these areas to certain nonresidential uses. In certain instances attached and multi-family housing uses may be allowed. A relatively low Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure that this effect is achieved.
Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of an area which preserves the original estate residential appearance, yet permits office and institutional land uses, and which ensures that the estate community character is maintained as long as the Office Neighborhood (ON) District designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area.

(c) Business Neighborhood (BN) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit small scale commercial development which is compatible with the desired overall suburban community character of the area in general, and with adjacent residential development in particular. This is accomplished with relatively low maximum Floor Area Ratios (FARs). Significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure that this effect is achieved. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street.
Rationale: This district is used to provide both convenience oriented goods and services and for the permanent protection of adjacent residential areas by permitting only a limited range of commercial activities. The desired suburban community character of the development is attained through the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Landscape Surface Area Ratio (LSR) requirements, and by restricting the Maximum Building Size (MBS) of all buildings within each instance of this District to 4,000 square feet. Together, these requirements ensure that the desired suburban community character is maintained as long as the Business Neighborhood (BN) District designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area.

(d) Business Regional (BR) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit large and small scale commercial development which is compatible with the desired overall suburban community character of the area in general. This is accomplished with relatively low maximum Floor Area Ratios (FARs). Significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure that this effect is achieved. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street.
Rationale: This district is intended to provide the principal zoning district for commercial development which occurs after the adoption of this Title. The standards of this district are designed to provide a clear distinction from the Business Local (BL) and Business Central (BC) Districts in terms of permitted intensity of development, treatment of outdoor sales, and required green space areas. The desired suburban community character of the development is attained through the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Landscape Surface Area Ratio (LSR) requirements. Together, these requirements ensure that the desired suburban community character is maintained as long as the Business Regional (BR) District designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area.

(e) Business Local (BL) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit both large and small scale commercial development at intensities which provide significant incentives for infill development and the continued economic viability of existing development. To accomplish this effect, maximum permitted Floor Area Ratios (FARs) are significantly higher and minimum required Green Space Ratios (GSRs) are substantially lower than those required in the Business Regional (BR) District. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street.
Rationale: This district is intended to provide an alternative, primarily infill development, designation for commercial activity to the Business Regional (BR) District. Performance standards for the Business Local (BL) District are designed to ensure the long-term economic health of strip commercial development areas, existing as of the effective date of this Ordinance, by limiting the attraction of the Business Regional (BR) District to those and uses which can afford the relatively higher development costs and rents associated with development in that district.

(f) Business Central (BC) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit both large and small scale "downtown" commercial/business development at an intensity which provides significant incentives for infill development, redevelopment, and the continued economic viability of existing development. To accomplish this effect, maximum Floor Area Ratios (FARs) permitted in this district are much higher than those allowed in the Business Regional (BR) and Business Local (BL) Districts. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. No requirements for on-site landscaping or parking are required in this district. This district is strictly limited to the central city locations.
Rationale: This district is intended to provide an alternative, primarily infill development, designation for commercial activity to the Business Regional (BR) and Business Local (BL) District are designed to assist in maintaining the long-term viability of the central city center.

(g) Manufacturing Light (ML) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit both large and small scale, high quality industrial and office development at an intensity which is consistent with the overall desired suburban community character of the community. This district is also intended to provide for planned, moderate density residential developments in the area east of IH 43 and south of STH 50 and west of North Shore Road. Beyond a relatively low maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and a relatively high minimum Green Space Ratio (GSR) and landscape requirements, the primary distinguishing feature of this district is that it is geared to indoor industrial activities which are not typically associated with high levels of noise, soot, odors and other potential nuisances for adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no non-residential development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a collector street. (C-736, 4/8/97)
Rationale: This district is intended to provide a location for suburban intensity light industrial land uses such as assembly operations, storage and warehousing facilities, offices, and light manufacturing which are protected from potential nuisances associated with certain development permitted within the Heavy Industrial (MH) District. In addition, land uses shall comply with the minimum performance standards presented in Subchapter 23-7.

(h) Manufacturing General (MG) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit both large and small scale moderate quality industrial and office development at an intensity which is consistent with existing transition and urban intensity development. Beyond a relatively high maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and a moderate minimum Green Space Ratio (GSR), the primary distinguishing feature of this district is that it is geared to industrial activities which are not typically associated with high levels of noise, soot, odors and other potential nuisances for adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential collector street.
Rationale: This district is intended to provide a location for urban intensity light industrial land uses such as assembly operations, storage and warehousing facilities, offices, and light manufacturing which are protected from potential nuisances associated with certain development permitted within the Heavy Industrial (MH) District.

(i) Manufacturing Heavy (MH) District
1. Description and Purpose
This district is intended to permit both large and small scale industrial and office
development at an intensity which provides ample incentive for infill development
and redevelopment of industrial areas existing as of the effective date of this
Ordinance. This district is designed to permit a very wide variety of industrial uses
which may occur both indoors and outdoors, including certain land uses which are
permitted in no other zoning district because of their potential to create nuisances
for adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential
development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local
residential street or a residential collector street.
Rationale: This district is intended to provide a location for both light and heavy
industrial uses in a zoning district in which the potential for nuisance complaints
from nearby properties is minimized. It must be emphasized that this is not a district
where virtually any land use is permitted, as all uses shall comply with the minimum
performance standards presented in Subchapter 23-7. In addition, certain land
uses such as extraction, junkyards and salvage operations, and freight terminals are
permitted within this district only upon the granting of a conditional use permit.

CHAPTER 23: ZONING STANDARDS
SUBCHAPTER 23-2: LAND USE REGULATIONS
Section 23.201 Purpose
The purpose of this Subchapter is to indicate which land uses may locate in each zoning district and under what requirements; and which land uses may not locate therein. A further distinction is made for land uses which may locate in a given district only upon obtaining a conditional or temporary use permit to do so. Finally, certain land uses may locate in a given district as a matter of right upon compliance with special regulations for such a land use.
Section 23.202 Interpretation of Land Use Tables
(1) The land uses listed in Sections 23.203 (Table of Land Uses) and 23.204 (Table of Land Uses Permitted in Permanently Protected Green Space Areas) are specifically designated and refer to the detailed listing of land uses contained in Section 23.206 (Detailed Land Use Descriptions and Regulations).
(2) Land Uses Permitted by Right: Land uses listed as permitted by right (designated as a "P" in Sections 23.203 and 23.204) are permitted per the general land use requirements of this Title (Section 23.205); per the general requirements of the specific zoning district in which they are located; per any additional requirements imposed by applicable overlay zoning districts as designated on the Official Zoning Map; per the general requirements of this Title including Section 24.908; and per any and all other applicable City, County, State, and Federal regulations.
(3) Land Uses Permitted as a Special Use: This category of land uses is subject to certain additional controls than apply to land uses permitted by right, while avoiding the public hearing process required of land uses permitted as conditional uses.
(a) Land uses listed as permitted as a special use (designated as an "S" in Sections
23.203 and 23.204) are permitted subject to all of the general zoning requirements
applicable to land uses permitted by right (Subsection (2), above), plus certain
additional requirements applicable to that particular land use specified in Section
23.206. (See also Section 24.904.)
(b) If a proposed land use, listed as a special use, cannot meet one of the special use
requirements of Section 23.206 for reasons directly related to the nature of the subject
property, the Petitioner of said land use may request Plan Commission and Common
Council review for approval as a conditional use, per the requirements of Section
24.905. No more than one special use requirement shall be waived in this manner for
any given land use or property. See Subsection (4)(b), below.
(4) Land Uses Permitted as a Conditional Use:
(a) Land uses listed as permitted as a conditional use (designated as a "C" in Sections
23.203 and 23.204) are permitted subject to all the requirements applicable to uses
permitted by right as listed in Subsection (2), above, plus any additional requirements
applicable to that particular land use as contained in Section 23.206 (Detailed Land
Use Descriptions and Regulations), including any additional requirements imposed as
2
part of the conditional use review process. Each application for, and instance of, a
conditional use shall be considered a unique situation and shall not be construed as
precedence for similar requests. (See also Section 24.905.)
(b) Conditional use requirements also apply to proposed special uses when one of the
special use requirements cannot be met. (See Subsection (3)(b), above.) No more
than one special use requirement shall be waived in this manner.
(5) Land Uses Permitted as an Accessory Use:
Land uses permitted as an accessory use are permitted subject to all the requirements applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in Subsection (2), above, plus any additional requirements applicable to that particular land use as contained in Section 23.206 (Detailed Land Use Descriptions and Regulations).
(6) Land Uses Permitted as a Temporary Use:
Land uses listed as permitted as a temporary use (designated as a "T" in Sections 23.203 and 23.204) are permitted subject to all the requirements applicable to uses permitted by right as listed in Subsection (2), above, plus any additional requirements applicable to that particular land use as contained in Section 23.206(9) (Detailed Land Use Descriptions and Regulations). (See also Section 24.906.)
(7) Land uses for which a blank space is shown for a specific zoning district are not permitted in such zoning district, except as legal nonconforming uses (see Section 23.207).
(8) Although a land use may be indicated as permitted by right, permitted as a special use, or permitted as a conditional use in a particular district, it does not follow that such a land use is permitted or permissible on every parcel in such district. No land use is permitted or permissible on a parcel unless it can be located thereon in full compliance with all of the standards and regulations of this Title which are applicable to the specific land use and parcel in question, or unless an appropriate variance has been granted pursuant to Section 24.910.
Section 23.203 Tables of Land Uses
This Title regulates the location of land uses to specific zoning districts through the use of the Tables of Land Uses contained in this Section. (See the following pages for these Tables.)

Section 23.204 Table of Land Uses Permitted in Permanently Protected Green Space Areas
In all developments, certain areas may be required to be set aside as permanently protected green space for the purpose of natural resources protection, to meet a Minimum Green Space Ratio (GSR) requirement, or to meet a Minimum Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR) requirement (see Subchapter 23-3, Density and Intensity Regulations and Subchapter 23-5, Natural Resource Protection Regulations). Where such permanently protected green space is required, and where the land use is also permitted per the land use regulations of the applicable conventional zoning district (see Section 23.203, Table of Land Uses), the following table shall also be employed to establish land use regulations. All land uses listed in Section 23.203 but not listed in this Section are prohibited directly within permanently protected green spaces. Within cluster developments permanently protected green space areas shall be used to protect the site features listed in Table 23.204.

12
Section 23.206 Detailed Land Use Descriptions and Regulations
The land use categories employed by this Title (particularly Sections 23.203 and 23.204) are defined in this Section. Land uses which are not listed in this Title are not necessarily excluded from locating within any given zoning district. Section 24.911 empowers the Zoning Administrator to make interpretations on matters regarding specific land use proposals which are not addressed by this Title.
(1) Residential Land Uses (Development Options)
Specific residential unit types (such as single-family detached house, duplex, apartment,
etc.) are defined in Section 23.403 and provides standards for each residential unit.
(a) Conventional Residential Development
Description: This land use includes, but is not limited to, all residential developments
which do not provide permanently protected green space areas. Property which is
under common ownership of a property owners' association is permitted, but is not a
required component of this type of development. Up to 10% of a Conventional
Residential Development's Gross Site Area (GSA) can contain natural resource areas
which must be protected (or other permanently protected green space areas), without
a reduction in Maximum Gross Density (MGD). (See note (i) below.)
1. Permitted by Right {RH-35ac, RE-5ac, RS-2, RS-3, RS-5, RM-8, RM-12, ON}.
2. Special Use Regulations: Not applicable.
3. Conditional Use Regulations: {ML east of IH 43, south of STH 50 and west of North Shore Drive}. (C-736, 4/8/97)
(b) Equestrian Residential Development
Description: This land use is a form of loose cluster residential development, (see
(b)3., below), which permits the keeping of horses on private lots or on common green
space. A minimum of 15% of the development's Gross Site Area (GSA) shall be held
under common ownership by a homeowners' association. This commonly-held area
shall be used to provide equestrian facilities which are available to all residents of the
development. These facilities may include common pasture area, group stables, riding trails, training areas, or other land uses typically associated with equestrian activities (including kennel facilities for private, non-commercial hunt club operations). With the exception of riding trails, (which may be linked to a general trail network extending beyond the area of the equestrian development) such areas shall only be used by the residents of the Equestrian Residential Development and their guests, and no facilities within an equestrian development shall be operated as a for-profit commercial venture. Up to 25% of an Equestrian Residential Development's Gross Site Area (GSA) can contain natural resource areas which must be protected (or other permanently protected green space area (per Section 23.304)), without a reduction in Maximum Gross Density (MGD). (See note (1)(i) below.)
1. Permitted by Right: Not applicable.
2. Special Use Regulations: Not applicable.
3. Conditional Use Regulations {RE-5ac}:
a. A minimum of 15% of the Gross Site Area (GSA) of the development shall be held in common ownership by a homeowner's association and shall be devoted to equestrian facilities.
13
b. Each lot shall have direct access to an equestrian trail maintained by a homeowner's association.
c. Any stable facility shall be reserved for the exclusive use of the development's residents. No stable located within an Equestrian Residential Development shall be operated as a for-profit commercial venture.
d. All stables located on individual lots shall conform to the standards of Section 23.206(8)(g).
e. All stables serving the Equestrian Residential Development as a whole shall conform to the standards of Section 23.206(4)(k).
f. Applicant shall provide appropriate deed restrictions and performance bonds to ensure the long-term maintenance and viability of common areas and the development as a whole.
g. Applicant shall comply with Section 24.905, standards and procedures applicable to all conditional uses.
(c) Loose Cluster Development
Description: This land use is a residential subdivision which requires that a minimum of
15% of the development's Gross Site Area (GSA) be protected as permanently
protected green space (per Section 23.304). This form of development permits slightly
higher Maximum Gross Densities (MGDs), and dwelling unit types which require
slightly smaller lots, than Conventional Residential Developments within the same
zoning district. This density incentive is provided because the provision of the required
common green space balances with the density increase to result in a community
character which is consistent with such Conventional Residential Developments. Up
to 25% of a Loose Cluster Development's Gross Site Area (GSA) can contain natural
resource areas which must be protected (or other permanently protected green space
area), without a reduction in Maximum Gross Density (MGD). (See note (1)(i) below.)
1. Permitted by Right: Not applicable.
2. Special Use Regulations: Not applicable.
3. Conditional Use Regulations {RE-5ac}:
a. Development clusters shall be located so as to blend with adjacent residentially zoned areas to the greatest extent possible.
b. If such adjacent areas are developed as a Conventional Residential Development, bufferyards shall be provided within adjoining portions of the Loose Cluster Residential Development (see Section 23.610).
c. Applicant shall provide appropriate deed restrictions and performance bonds to ensure the long-term maintenance and viability of common areas and the development as a whole.
d. Applicant shall comply with Section 24.905, standards and procedures applicable to all conditional uses.
(d) Moderate Cluster Development
Description: This land use is a residential subdivision which requires that a minimum of
30% of the development's Gross Site Area (GSA) be protected as permanently
protected green space (per Section 23.304). This form of development permits higher
Maximum Gross Densities (MGDs), and dwelling unit types which require smaller lots,
than Conventional Residential Developments within the same zoning district. This
14
density incentive is provided because the provision of the required common green
space balances with the density increase to result in a community character which is
consistent with such Conventional Residential Developments. Up to 50% of a
Moderate Cluster Development's Gross Site Area (GSA) can contain natural resource
areas which must be protected, (or other permanently protected green space areas),
without a reduction in Maximum Gross Density (MGD). (See note (1)(i) below.)
1. Permitted by Right: Not applicable.
2. Special Use Regulations: Not applicable.
3. Conditional Use Regulations {RE-5ac, RS-3, RM-8, RM-12}:
a. Development clusters shall be located so as to blend with adjacent residentially
zoned areas to the greatest extent possible.
b. If such adjacent areas are developed as a Conventional or Loose Cluster
Residential Development, bufferyards shall be provided within adjoining
portions of Moderate Cluster Residential Development (see Section 23.610).
c. Applicant shall provide appropriate deed restrictions and performance bonds to
ensure the long-term maintenance and viability of common areas and the
development as a whole.
d. Applicant shall comply with Section 24.905, standards and procedures
applicable to all conditional uses.
(e) Compact Cluster Development
Description: This land use is a residential subdivision which requires that a minimum of
50% of the development's Gross Site Area (GSA) be protected as permanently
protected green space (per Section 23.304). This form of development permits
substantially higher Maximum Gross Densities (MGDs), and dwelling unit types which
require substantially smaller lots, than Conventional Residential Developments within
the same zoning district. This density incentive is provided because the provision of
the required common green space balances with the density increase to result in a
community character which is consistent with such conventional residential
developments. Up to 70% of a Compact Cluster Development's Gross Site Area
(GSA) can contain natural resource areas which must be protected, (or other
permanently protected green space areas), without a reduction in Maximum Gross

following: genitals, anal area, female areola or nipple; and "sexually-oriented material"
33
includes any media which displays sexually specified area(s). NOTE: The
incorporation of this Subsection into this Title is designed to reflect the Common
Council's official finding that sexually-oriented commercial uses have a predominant
tendency to produce certain undesirable secondary effects on the surrounding
community, as has been demonstrated in other, similar jurisdictions. Specifically, the
Common Council is concerned with the potential for such uses to limit: the
attractiveness of nearby locations for new development, the ability to attract and/or
retain customers, and the ability to market and sell nearby properties at a level
consistent with similar properties not located near such facilities. It is explicitly not the
intent of this Subsection to suppress free expression by unreasonably limiting
alternative avenues of communication, but rather to balance the need to protect free
expression opportunities with the need to implement the City's Comprehensive Master
Plan and protect the character and integrity of its commercial and residential
neighborhoods.

Section 23.207 Nonconforming Use Regulations
(1) Definition: A nonconforming use is an active and actual use of land or structures, or
both; legally established prior to the effective date of this Title or subsequent applicable
amendment thereto which has continued the same use to the present, and which would
not be permitted under the current terms of this Title. The definition under the provisions
of this Section do not apply to Section 23.503 of Subchapter 23-5 of the City of Delavan
Zoning Ordinance for Natural Resources Protection. (RC-287, 3/9/10)
(2) Continuance of a Nonconforming Use: Any nonconforming use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this Title may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as specified in this Section. Any legal use under the previous Zoning Ordinance which is made nonconforming by this Ordinance shall be considered a legal use with the granting of a conditional use permit by the Common
54
Council. Any legal use under the previous zoning map which is made nonconforming by a change to the official zoning map may apply for a zoning map amendment (per Section 24.903) to an appropriate zoning district to be granted legal conforming use status. (C-735, 1/21/97)
(3) Modification of a Nonconforming Use:
(a) Except as permitted in (b), below, a nonconforming use shall not be expanded, or changed to another nonconforming use; unless such modification would make the nonconforming use have a more desirable effect in terms of implementing the purpose of this Title (as determined by the Zoning Administrator). If such a modification occurs, said use shall not be modified back to the original nonconforming use, or to any other nonconforming use which does not better accomplish the purpose of this Title.
(b) A nonconforming nonresidential use which is not served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water may be permitted to expand without being served by public sanitary sewer and/or public water if said facilities are not available within 1,000 feet of the subject property, and upon the granting of a conditional use permit per the requirements of Section 24.905.
(4) Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use: When any nonconforming use of any structure or land is discontinued for a period of 12 months, or is changed into a conforming use, any future use of said structure or land shall be in complete conformity with the provisions of this Title.
(5) Maintenance of a Nonconforming Use: The normal maintenance of a structure or land containing or related to a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary repairs and incidental alterations which do not exacerbate the adverse impacts of the nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of this Title. In no instance shall said repairs exceed over the life of the structure, 50% of the present equalized assessed value of said structure or property prior to said repairs.
(6) Nonconforming Lots, Structures, and Buildings: See Sections 23.307, 23.408 and 23.409.
(7) Wetland Nonconforming Uses: Notwithstanding Section 62.23(7)(h) of the Wisconsin Statutes, the repair, reconstruction, renovating, remodeling or expansion of a legal nonconforming structure in existence at the time of adoption or subsequent amendment of this ordinance adopted pursuant to Section 62.231 of the Wisconsin Statutes, or of an environmental control facility in existence on May 7 1982, related to that structure, is permitted pursuant to Section 62.231(5) of the Wisconsin Statutes. Section 62.23(7)(h), however, applies to any environmental control facility that was not in existence on May 7, 1982, but was in existence on the effective date of this ordinance or amendment.
(8) Conversion of Legal, Non-Conforming Uses to a Conditional Use. Upon petition of the property owner, the City Council may approve, as a conditional use, a change of a legal, non-conforming use to a conditional use provided the City Council determines that the proposed conditional use would result in no greater degree of non-conformity than existed prior to said approval, and subject to such other conditions as the City Council may impose in order to reduce the impact of said use on adjoining property owners or on the City of Delavan or such other conditions as the City Council may deem necessary in order to fulfill the intent and purpose of the City of Delavan zoning ordinance. (RC-193, 11/9/04)
55
Section 23.208 Group Developments
(1) Definition: A group development is any development containing 2 or more structures containing principal land uses (as listed in Table 23.203) on the same lot, and/or any single structure on a single lot which contains 5 or more dwelling units or 2 or more non-residential uses. Common examples of group developments include 6-unit apartment buildings, apartment complexes, condominium complexes, shopping centers, and office centers. (One- building office structures, one-building commercial strip centers, 4-unit apartment buildings, and other land uses in which each lot contains only 1 structure and where each residential building contains 4 or fewer dwelling units, are not group developments, even though such developments may contain parcels under common ownership.)
(2) Regulation of Group Developments: Group developments are permitted as conditional uses in all zoning districts. Any land use which is permitted within the applicable zoning district(s) is permitted to locate within a group development. The land use regulations of this Section, as well as Section 23.206 and all other applicable provisions of this Title shall apply to the group development. The requirements of Section 24.905 shall apply to the review of proposals for group developments.
(3) Specific Development Standards for Group Developments
(a) All required off-street parking spaces and access drives shall be located entirely within the boundaries of the group development.
(b) Each individual land use shall have a rear or side entrance that is accessible to a loading or service drive. Said service drive shall have a minimum width of 26 feet. Said service drive shall not be part of the vehicle circulation network used by customers.
(c) The development shall contain a sufficient number of waste bins to accommodate all trash and waste generated by the land uses in a convenient manner.
(d) All development located within a group development shall be located so as to comply with the intent of this Title regarding setbacks of structures and buildings from lot lines. As such, individual principal and accessory structures and buildings located within group developments shall be situated within building envelopes which serve to demonstrate complete compliance with said intent. Said building envelopes shall be depicted on the site plan required for review of group developments. The use of this approach to designing group developments will also ensure the facilitation of subdividing group developments in the future, (if such action is so desired).
(4) Discrimination Against Condominium Forms of Ownership
It is not the intent of this Section, nor any other provision of this Title, to discriminate against condominium forms of ownership in any manner which conflicts with Wisconsin Statutes 703.27. As such, the provisions of this Section are designed to ensure that condominium forms of ownership are subject to the same standards and procedures of review and development as other physically identical forms of development.

SUBCHAPTER 23-3: DENSITY AND INTENSITY REGULATIONS
Section 23.301 Purpose
The purpose of this Subchapter is to indicate the maximum permitted density (for residential projects) and maximum permitted intensity (for nonresidential projects) of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this Title (See Section 21.009.). The development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to: 1) the area of the site; 2) the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources; 3) the zoning district(s) in which the site is located; 4) the development option(s) the site is developed under; and 5) the use(s) considered for development.
Rationale: This Subchapter regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this Title. This Subchapter is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the City of Delavan Comprehensive Master Plan. (See also, Section 21.005 of this Title.) Many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques, particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities, and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments. Such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility of site design options, which in turn results in land use inefficiencies, forced site planning, and/or the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources. The approach employed by this Subchapter, relying on Maximum Gross Densities (MGDs) and minimum Green Space Ratios (GSRs) for residential development, and minimum required Landscape Surface Ratios (LSRs) in combination with maximum permitted Floor Area Ratios (FARs) for nonresidential development, (both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district) results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community goals and objectives.
Section 23.302 How to Use this Subchapter
This Subchapter contains the standards which determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site. Prior to using the provisions of this Subchapter to determine the development potential of a given property, the guidelines provided by Section 23.306(1) through (3) should be reviewed. This Subchapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses, and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners. The description of the process addressing residential development in Section 23.306(1) and (2) refers to the requirements of Section 23.304, Residential Density Standards. The description of the process addressing nonresidential development in Section 23.306(1) and (3) refers to the requirements of Section 23.305, Nonresidential Intensity Standards.

Section 23.303 Required Natural Resources Site Evaluation
(1) Purpose
An important goal of the City of Delavan Comprehensive Master Plan is the protection of natural resources which are sensitive to disruption caused by development and/or other land use activities. These resources include: Floodways, Floodway Fringes, Floodplain Conservancy Areas, Wetlands, Drainageways, Lakeshores, Steep Slopes, and Woodlands. (These resources are defined in Subchapter 23-5.) These resources serve important functions which are lost when these areas are subject to development and/or other land use activities, in the absence of correct mitigation approaches. In many instances, these functions cannot be provided by other natural or man-made features. Specific broad categories of such functions include the: protection and enhancement of air, surface water, ground water, and soil quality; habitat provision and diversification; aesthetic diversification; and buffering effects.
(2) Mitigation
In certain instances, natural features can accommodate development and/or other land use activities without a significant loss of their functional benefits if proper mitigation practices are employed. (Subchapter 23-5) Natural Resource Protection Regulations, provides detailed standards regarding permitted mitigation techniques and requirements.
Section 23.303(3) continues with the Natural Resources Site Evaluation Worksheet on the following page.

Section 23.306 Detailed Instructions for Intensity and Density Regulations
(1) For Both Residential, and Nonresidential, Development
(a) Check Planning Recommendations for the Subject Property
1. Check Comprehensive Plan Recommendations
The City's Comprehensive Plan should be checked for implications related to the subject property, particularly the: Land Use and Transportation Plan Map. (Copies of the Comprehensive Plan are available from the City.) From time to time, the Comprehensive Plan may be amended. The City's Public Work's Department should be consulted regarding changes to the Comprehensive Plan which may effect the subject property or its environs.
2. Check Official Map Recommendations
The City's Official Map should be checked for proposed capital facilities and dedication requirements including schools, parks, stormwater management facilities and street improvements) which may effect the subject property. The Official Map is on display at the City's Public Works Department. From time to time the Official Map may be amended. The City's Public Works Department should be contacted regarding changes to the Map which may effect the subject property or its environs.
(b) Check the Zoning of the Subject Property
The potential amount and type of development any given site may contain is directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located. The subject property should be identified on the City's Official Zoning Map (See Section 22.103.), and the current zoning designation should be compared with the description of that district provided in Section 22.105. The Official Zoning Map is on display at the City's Public Work's Department. From time to time, the Official Zoning Map may be amended. The Zoning Administrator should be contacted regarding potential changes in the Official Zoning Map which may effect the subject property or its environs.
(c) Complete a Natural Resources Site Evaluation for the Site
The effect of protected natural resources on the development potential of the subject property should be evaluated. All resources listed in Section 23.303, Required Natural Resources Site Evaluation, should be identified on the subject property, located on a map (or air photo) of the subject property, and the total area of the property (in acres) covered by those resources, known as Required Resource Protection Area (RPA) should be determined, as should the Gross Site Area (GSA) and the Net Developable Area (NDA) of the subject property. (Section 23.303(3) contains a worksheet to simplify these calculations.) The Zoning Administrator should be contacted if assistance is desired in completing these calculations.
(2) For Residential Development (For Steps (a) through (c), see (1), above.)
(d) Determine What Types of Dwelling Units are Permitted
Page 1 of the Table of Land Uses (Section 23.203) should be checked to determine which types of dwelling units are permitted within the zoning district for the subject property. (Section 23.503 describes each dwelling unit type.)
9
(e) Identify the Desired Permitted Development Option
Page 1 of the Table of Uses (Section 23.203) should also be checked to determine which types of development options are permitted within the zoning district for the subject property. Each development option is described in detail in Section 23.206(1). The selection of a particular development option may be related to the preponderance of sensitive natural resource areas on the site, or may reflect current or projected residential market conditions and the dwelling unit types they call for. After the desired permitted development option is identified, Section 23.304, Residential Density Standards, should be referred to for the selected development option(s) in the zoning district(s).
(f) Check Minimum Site Area Requirement Against the Gross Site Area
The required Minimum Site Area (MSA), given in Section 23.304 (Residential Density Standards) for the development option selected in (e), and in the zoning district identified in (b), should be compared with the Gross Site Area (GSA) required on the subject property as determined under the Natural Resources Site Evaluation in Step (c), above. If the GSA is less than the MSA required by the selected development option, then a different development option must be selected, or additional property should be acquired.
(g) Determine Maximum Gross Density Permitted on the Site
The Maximum Gross Density (MGD), given in Section 23.304 (Residential Density Standards) for the development option selected in (e) and the zoning district identified in (b), above, should be noted; and used in Step (h), below.
(h) Determine the Maximum Number of Units Permitted on the Site
The Maximum Gross Density (MGD), identified in (g), above, multiplied by the Gross Site Area (GSA) calculated in Step (c), above, equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property under the selected development option within the selected zoning district. The ability to actually develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the provisions of this Title. Inefficient site design, poor property configuration, and other factors may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site.
(i) Check the Minimum Permitted Lot Area Against Table 23.203
The Minimum Lot Area (MLA) requirement given in Section 23.304 (Residential Density Standards), is the smallest size lot permitted within the selected development option within the selected zoning district. The MLA must equal or be less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit proposed for the project in Step (d), above. If the MLA given in Section 23.203 is larger than the lot size requirement given in Step (d), then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size must be selected (in which case, it may be advantageous to repeat Steps (d) through (i) using a different dwelling unit type and a different development option).
(3) For Nonresidential Development (For Steps (a) through (c), see (1), above.)
Section 23.305 contains a key to assist with the procedure described below.
10
(d) Determine What Types of Land Uses are Permitted
The Table of Uses (Section 23.203) should be checked to determine which types of land uses are permitted within the zoning district present on, or proposed for, the subject property. A complete description of each land use is presented in Section 23.206.
(e) Identify the Desired Development Option (Number of Floors)
Section 23.305 (Nonresidential Intensity Standards) presents a detailed listing of the development options available for nonresidential development in each zoning district. Each development option is based on a particular combination of Maximum Number of Floors (#F), Minimum Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR), and Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The selection of a particular development option may be related to the presence of sensitive natural resource areas on the site, or may reflect current or projected nonresidential market conditions and the types of buildings they call for.
(f) Check Minimum Lot Area Requirement Against Gross Site Area Present on the Subject Property
The required Minimum Lot Area (MLA), given in Section 23.305 (Nonresidential Intensity Standards) for the development option selected in (e), and in the zoning district identified in (b), should be compared with the Gross Site Area (GSA) required on the subject property as determined under the Natural Resources Site Evaluation in Step (c), above. If the GSA is less than the MLA required by the selected development option, then additional property should be acquired. In other words, the GSA (from (c)) must be greater than or equal to the MLA (from (e)).
(g) Check Minimum Landscape Surface Ratio Requirement Against the Required Resource Protection Area Present on the Subject Property
The required Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR), given in Section 23.305 (Nonresidential Intensity Standards) for the development option selected in (c), and in the zoning district identified in (b), should be multiplied by the Gross Site Area (GSA) used in Step (f), above. The resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space. This area should be compared with the Required Resource Protection Area (RPA) required on the subject property as determined under the Natural Resource Site Evaluation in Step (c), above. If the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required in the selected development option, then a development option requiring more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site. In other words, if the RPA (from (c)) is greater than the LSR (from (5)), a taller development option may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property.
(h) Determine Maximum Floor Area Ratio Permitted on the Site
The Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR), given in Section 23.305 (Nonresidential Intensity Standards) for the development option selected in (e) and the zoning district identified in (b), above, should be noted. This number will be used in Step (i), below.
11
(i) Determine the Maximum Floor Area Permitted on the Site
The Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR), identified in (h), above, multiplied by the Gross Site Area (GSA) calculated in Step (c), above, equals the maximum square footage of gross floor area permitted on the subject property under that development option within that zoning district. The ability to actually develop this amount of floor area is not guaranteed by the provisions of this Title. Inefficient site design, poor property configuration, and other factors may result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site.
(j) Check the Maximum Building Size Requirement (BN District)
The Maximum Building Size (MBS) requirement given in Section 23.305, Nonresidential Intensity Standards, is the largest size building permitted within the selected development option within the Business Neighborhood (BN) District. The MBS must equal or be greater than the building size proposed for the project in Step (i), above. If the MBS given in Section 23.305 is smaller than the proposed building size calculated in Step (i) above, then a smaller building must be built, or the use of additional buildings should be considered.
Rationale: Each nonresidential zoning district permits a slight variation in maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) depending upon the type of development option used. As the minimum required Landscape Surface Ratio (LSR) increases within each zoning district (based on the development option selected), the FAR increases. This intensity incentive is based on two principles: First, the combinations of FAR and LSR requirements for the various development options within each zoning district are designed to result in a consistent community character of development within that district; second, the intensity incentive is designed to compensate for potential per square foot price reductions associated with smaller FARs in developments providing significant amounts of required green space. The Minimum Lot Area (MLA) requirements for each development option within each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood character within each development option is maintained and that maximum permitted Floor Area Ratios (FARs) are approachable, if not completely attainable, under efficient site design practices. Finally, the Maximum Building Size (MBS) requirements ensure that development within the Business Neighborhood (BN) District retains a neighborhood function and maintains a scale which is compatible with nearby residential development.
Section 23.307 Nonconforming Development Regulations
A variance for any and all requirements of this Subchapter is hereby automatically granted to all developments in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of the effective date of this Title. However, after the effective date of this Title, such developments shall not be permitted to enlarge, expand or extend without bringing the enlargement, expansion or extension into compliance with the provisions of this Subchapter, and unless a variance is granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals per the requirements of Section 24.910.
Rationale: The "blanket variance" provision of this Section is intended to prevent the creation of certain nonconforming developments within the jurisdiction of this Title. The adoption of the provisions of this Section ensures that developments approved prior to the adoption of this Title do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming.
1
SUBCHAPTER 23-4: BULK REGULATIONS
Section 23.401 Purpose
The purpose of this Subchapter is to indicate the requirements for building location and bulk in both residential and nonresidential developments. The provisions of this Subchapter interact closely with the provisions of Subchapter 23-3, Density and Intensity Regulations.
Section 23.402 How to Use this Subchapter
This Subchapter contains the standards which determine the location and height of buildings on any given site. Prior to using the provisions of this Subchapter to determine the potential layout of a given project, the recommendations provided below should be reviewed. This Subchapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential projects, and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners. The description of the process addressing residential property in Subsections (1) and (2) below, refers to the requirements of Section 23.403, Residential Bulk Standards. The description of the process addressing nonresidential property in Subsections (1) and (3) below, refers to the requirements of Section 23.404, Nonresidential Bulk Standards.
(1) For Both Residential, and Nonresidential, Development
(a) Identify the Zoning District and Development Option to Govern
Development of the Subject Property
For buildable lots, the Official Zoning Map should be consulted to determine
the zoning of the subject property. For proposed developments, the
operations required in Subchapter 23-3 should be performed in order to
identify the applicable zoning district and development option. Section
23.306 contains a detailed step-by-step description of the recommended
procedure for determining the applicable zoning district and development
option.
(b) Note the Identified Zoning District and Development Option Applicable
to the Subject Property
The applicable zoning district and development option identified for the
subject property per Subsection (a), above, should be noted. The
development option for residential development determines the Minimum
Lot Area (MLA) permitted within the development. This is the key item of
information for determining residential bulk regulations. The development
option for nonresidential development determines the Maximum Number of
Floors (#F) permitted within the development. This is the key item of
information for determining nonresidential bulk regulations.
(2) For Residential Development
For Steps (a) and (b), see (1), above.
(c) Determine the Type(s) of Dwelling Unit to be Used
Data for residential bulk standards are presented in a series of illustrations
in Section 23.403, with each illustration pertaining to a specific dwelling unit
type and its minimum lot size. The type(s) of dwelling unit(s) identified for
use in Subsection (a), above, should be used to identify the pertinent
subsections of Section 23.403.
2
(d) Identify the Bulk Standards for Each Dwelling Unit Type
Each page of Section 23.403 contains information for all bulk standards applicable
to each dwelling unit type. All residential development within a proposed project
must conform to the standards of Section 23.403, unless a variance is granted in
accordance with Section 24.910 of this Title.
(3) For Nonresidential Development
For Steps (a) and (b), see (1), above.
(c) Determine the Type(s) of Development Options to be Used
Data for all nonresidential bulk standards are presented in Table 23.404, with each
row of the Table pertaining to a specific zoning district and development option.
The type(s) of development option(s) identified for use in Subsection (a), above,
should be used to identify the pertinent portions of Section 23.404.
(d) Identify the Bulk Standards for Each Development Option
Each row of Table 23.404 contains information for all bulk standards applicable to
each development option. All nonresidential development within a proposed project
must conform to the standards of Section 23.404, unless a variance is granted in
accordance with Section 24.910 of this Title.
Section 23.403 Residential Bulk Standards
All residential lots created under the provisions of this Title shall comply with the standards of this Section. These standards are related to the type of development option and type of dwelling unit used, rather than to a specific zoning district. Therefore, all lots created in a subdivision under the same zoning district and development option shall have identical bulk standards, regardless of their lot size. Table 23.203 and Table 23.304 relate each dwelling unit type to each zoning district and development option. (Continued on the next page.)

Section 23.404 Nonresidential Bulk Standards
All nonresidential lots created under the provisions of this Title shall comply with the standards of this Section. These standards are related to the specific zoning district and development option used. Table 23.203 and Table 23.305 relate each use with each zoning district and development option.
The following table, 23.404, presents the standards for nonresidential bulk regulations.
The maximum permitted height restriction of 50 feet is based upon the fire-fighting equipment available to the Fire Department as of the effective date of this Title. Should fire fighting equipment be made available to effectively fight fires in structures over 50 feet tall, this maximum limit could be raised.
Prior to such time, if a structure is proposed to exceed this maximum (under the provisions of Section 23.407), it should be equipped with internal fire fighting mechanisms which are approved by the Fire Department as part of the required Conditional Use review process.

Section 23.408 Substandard Lot Regulations
(1) Upon and after the effective date of this Title, no lot shall be created which does not meet the Minimum Lot Area (MLA) requirements of Sections 23.304 or 23.305 or which does not meet the lot dimension requirements of Sections 23.403 or 23.404.
(2) A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this Ordinance in a Residential District (see Section 22.102), which does not meet the Minimum Lot Area (MLA) requirements of this Sections 23.304 or 23.305 or which does not meet the lot dimension requirements of Sections 23.403 or 23.404 may be utilized for a detached single-family dwelling unit, provided the measurements of such area and dimensions are equal to or greater than 70% of the requirements of this Title. Said lot shall not be more intensively developed (with multi-family or nonresidential uses) unless combined with one or more abutting lots (or portions thereof) so as to create a lot which meets the requirements of this Title.
Section 23.409 Nonconforming Structure and Building Regulations
(1) Any structure or building lawfully existing upon the effective date of this Title may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as hereafter specified.
(2) Nothing in this Title shall preclude the Building Inspector from remedial or enforcement actions when said structure or building is declared unsafe.
33
(3) When any lawful nonconforming structure or building in any district is modified so as to be in conformance with the provisions of this Title, any future modification of said structure or building shall be in conformance with the provisions of this Title.
(4) Whenever a lawful nonconforming structure or building has been damaged by fire, flood, wind, explosion, earthquake, war, riot, unlawful act, or Act of God, it may be reconstructed and used as before if it be reconstructed within one year after such calamity, unless the damage to said structure or building equals or exceeds 50% of its assessed value. In such cases, the reconstruction shall be limited to uses permitted by the provisions of this Title (unless the ability to re-establish a nonconforming use is specifically granted by Council).
(5) Normal maintenance of a nonconforming structure or building is permitted, including necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend, enlarge, or intensify the nonconforming structure or building.
(6) Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful nonconforming residential units, provided such alterations do not increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building, except that a conforming garage may be added if none previously existed.
(7) A legal, nonconforming garage may be enlarged or replaced provided the following requirements are met:
(a) That the proposed garage replacement or addition comply with the required
setback(s) unless a variance is granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals per the requirements of Section 24.910. (RC-4, 6/10/97)
(b) That the proposed garage addition does not locate closer to an existing residence on an adjacent parcel than the sum of the required garage setback (on the subject property) and the required house setback (on said adjacent parcel).
(c) And that precautions (determined on a case-by-case basis by the Building Inspector) are taken to reduce the possibility of fire damage to nearby structures.
(d) All garage replacements shall comply with all setback requirements.
(8) Any structure or building for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this Title, which will become nonconforming under the provisions of this Title or amendments thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans, provided construction is started within 730 calendar days of the effective date of this Title, and provided that construction is completed within 730 calendar days of the effective date of this Title or amendments thereto. Said structure or building shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming structure or building.
(9) A variance for any and all requirements of this Subchapter is hereby automatically granted
to all nonconforming residential dwellings in their configuration existing as of the effective
date of this Title. However, after the effective date of this Title, such structures shall not be
permitted to enlarge, expand or extend without bringing the enlargement, expansion or
extension into compliance with the provisions of the Subchapter unless a variance is
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals per the requirements of Section 24.910.
34
Rationale: The "blanket variance" provision of (9), above, is intended to eliminate the continued classification and/or creation of certain nonconforming residential structures within the jurisdiction of this Title. This provision addresses two different situations. First: prior to the provision of full-time inspection services, a number of residential structures were approved in the City of Delavan which did not meet setback requirements. Second: this Title requires greater side yard setback requirements for certain residential lot sizes than did previous regulations for similar sized lots. The adoption of the provisions of (9), above, ensure that residential structures approved prior to the adoption of this Title do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming uses. This "blanket variance" is not available for nonresidential structures.
Section 23.410 Minimum Living Area Requirements
Not withstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no case shall a residential dwelling constructed in the RE-5ac District, RS-2 District, RS-3 District, RS-5 District or
RM-8 District have a total minimum floor area having less than the following square footage:
Single-Family
Detached Dwelling 1,200 sq. ft.
Duplexes 1,000 sq. ft.
Townhouses 900 sq. ft.
Apartment Units Two-Bedroom-800 sq. ft.: One-Bedroom-700 sq. ft.; and
Efficiency-500 sq. ft.
This requirement shall not apply to substandard lots which are buildable within the meaning of Section 23.408 of this code. This requirement shall not apply to residential dwellings constructed prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and such dwellings subsequently damaged or destroyed may be repaired or rebuilt having its pre-existing minimum living area, as defined herein, but in no event shall it be repaired or rebuilt having a minimum living area less than its pre-existing square footage. For purposes of this minimum living area requirement, the phase “living area” shall mean the total area located within the exterior walls of a residential dwelling measured at floor level, but shall not include basement areas, garages, porches, breeze ways, decks and unfinished attics. However, the phrase “living area” shall include each separate floor of a home, except as may be excluded herein. (RC-79, 11/9/99)

SUBCHAPTER 23-5: NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION REGULATIONS
Section 23.501 Purpose
The purpose of this Subchapter is to set forth the requirements for the mandatory protection of natural resources and permanently protected green space areas within the jurisdiction of this Title (see Section 21.009). The provisions of this Subchapter interact closely with the provisions of Section 23.204 (Uses Permitted in Other Permanently Protected Green Space Areas), Subsection 23.206(10) (Natural Resource Disruption and Required Mitigation Standards), Section 23.303 (Required Natural Resources Site Evaluation), and Sections 23.304 and 23.305 which provide residential and nonresidential development standards. Section 23.306 provides a complete overview of the interrelationship between the above-listed Sections. In part, the provisions of this Subchapter are designed to ensure the implementation of the City of Delavan Comprehensive Master Plan, the environmental protection element of the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission's (SEWRPC's) Environmental Corridor Protection Program, and State of Wisconsin Statutes 62.231 and 87.30.
Section 23.502 How to Use this Subchapter
This Subchapter contains the standards which govern the protection, disturbance, and mitigation of disruption of all natural resource and other permanently protected green space areas. The provisions of this Subchapter are intended to supplement those of the City of Delavan, Walworth County, the State of Wisconsin, and the Federal Government of the United States which pertain to natural resource protection. Prior to using the provisions of this Subchapter to determine the permitted disruption of such areas, the requirements provided below should be reviewed. This Subchapter recognizes the important and diverse benefits which natural resource features provide in terms of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Each of the following sections is oriented to each natural resource type, and is designed to accomplish several objectives:
(1) First, a definition of the natural resource is provided.
(2) Second, the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing each natural resource type are provided.
(3) Third, the required method of identifying and determining the boundaries of the natural resource area is given.
(4) Fourth, mandatory protection requirements are identified.
NOTE: Protection requirements for specific land uses and natural resource types designed to minimize disruption of natural resource functions are presented in Subsection 23.206(10).

Section 23.503 Floodway, Floodfringe, and Floodplain Overlay Zoning Districts (RC-287, 3/9/10)
(1) GENERAL PROVISIONS
(a) AREAS TO BE REGULATED
This ordinance regulates all areas that would be covered by the regional flood or base flood.
Note: Base flood elevations are derived from the flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study. Regional flood elevations may be derived from other studies. Areas covered by the base flood are identified as A-Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(b) OFFICIAL MAPS & REVISIONS (RC-359, 8/11/15)
The boundaries of all floodplain districts are designated as floodplains or A-Zones on the maps listed below and the revisions in the City of Delavan Floodplain Appendix. Any change to the base flood elevations (BFE) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must be reviewed and approved by the DNR and FEMA before it is effective. No changes to regional flood elevations (RFE's) on non-FEMA maps shall be effective until approved by the DNR. These maps and revisions are on file in the office of the Public Works Department, Delavan, Wisconsin. If more than one map or revision is referenced, the most restrictive information shall apply.
(1) OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated
September 3, 2014, Volume number 55127CV000B.
(a) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), panel numbers 55127C0168D,
55127C0169D, 55127C0190D, 55127C0281D, 55127C0282D, and
55127C0301D dated October 2, 2009; panel number 55127C0302E
dated September 3, 2014; all with corresponding profiles that are based
on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 3, 2014.
(2) OFFICIAL MAPS: Based on other studies:
(a) 100-Year Dam Failure Floodplain Map, dated October 2013, prepared by
R.A. Smith National. Approved by the DNR, July 11, 2014.
(c) ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS
The regional floodplain areas are divided into three districts as follows:
(1) The Floodway District (FW) is the channel of a river or stream and those
portions of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional
floodwaters.
(2) The Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of the floodplain between the
regional flood limits and the floodway.
(3) The General Floodplain District (GFP) is those areas that have been or may
be covered by floodwater during the regional flood.
(d) LOCATING FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES
Discrepancies between boundaries on the official floodplain zoning map and actual
field conditions shall be resolved using the criteria in paragraphs (1) or (2) below. If
a significant difference exists, the map shall be amended according to Section
23.503(8). The zoning administrator can rely on a boundary derived from a profile
elevation to grant or deny a land use permit, whether or not a map amendment is
required. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for documenting actual
pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the district boundary
was determined and for initiating any map amendments required under this section.
Disputes between the zoning administrator and an applicant over the district
boundary line shall be settled according to Section 23.503(7)(c)3 and the criteria in
(1) and (2) below.
3
(1) If flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall
determine the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall
govern if there are any discrepancies.
(2) Where flood profiles do not exist, the location of the boundary shall be
determined by the map scale, visual on-site inspection and any information
provided by the Department.
Note: Where the flood profiles are based on established base flood
elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must also approve any map amendment
pursuant to Section 23.503(8)(a)6.
(e) REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM FLOODPLAIN
Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two feet above the regional or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and the map is amended pursuant to Section 23.503(8).
Note: This procedure does not remove the requirements for the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. The property owner must contact FEMA to request a Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
(f) COMPLIANCE
Any development or use within the areas regulated by this ordinance shall be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
(g) MUNICIPALITIES AND STATE AGENCIES REGULATED
Unless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies are required to comply if s. 13.48(13), Stats., applies. The construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation is exempt when s. 30.2022, Stats., applies.
(h) ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
1. This ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted under ss. 59.69, 59.692 or 59.694 for counties; s. 62.23 for cities; or s. 61.35 for villages; or s. 87.30, Stats., which relate to floodplains. If another ordinance is more restrictive than this ordinance, that ordinance shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions, but not otherwise.
2. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing deed restrictions, covenants or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
(i) INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the governing body and are not a limitation on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this ordinance.
4
(j) WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience and scientific research. Larger floods may occur or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. Nor does this ordinance create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the municipality or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(k) SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected.
(l) ANNEXED AREAS FOR CITIES AND VILLAGES
The Walworth County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These annexed lands are described on the municipality's official zoning map. County floodplain zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this section and are on file in the office of the municipal zoning administrator. All plats or maps of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the location of the floodway.
(m) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The community shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed
building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a
flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall be
designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads;
be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; be constructed by methods
and practices that minimize flood damages; and be constructed with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service
facilities designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Subdivisions shall
be reviewed for compliance with the above standards. All subdivision proposals
(including manufactured home parks) shall include regional flood elevation and
floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition of this
ordinance.
(2) GENERAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS
(a) HYDRAULIC AND HYDROLOGIC ANALYSES
1. Except as allowed in par. (3) below, no floodplain development shall:
a. Obstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by itself or with other development, increasing regional flood height; or
b. Increase regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost, which equals or exceeds 0.01 foot.
2. The zoning administrator shall deny permits if it is determined the proposed development will obstruct flow or increase regional flood heights 0.01 foot or more, based on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map, unless the provisions of sub. (3) are met.
5
3. Obstructions or increases equal to or greater than 0.01 foot may only be permitted if amendments are made to this ordinance, the official floodplain zoning maps, floodway lines and water surface profiles, in accordance with Section 23.503(8).
Note: This section refers to obstructions or increases in base flood elevations as shown
on the officially adopted FIRM or other adopted map. Any such alterations must
be reviewed and approved by FEMA and the DNR.
(b) WATERCOURSE ALTERATIONS
No land use permit to alter or relocate a watercourse in a mapped floodplain shall be issued until the local official has notified in writing all adjacent municipalities, the Department and FEMA regional offices and required the applicant to secure all necessary state and federal permits. The flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date of the watercourse alteration or relocation, the zoning administrator shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting appropriate technical or scientific data in accordance with NFIP guidelines that shall be used to revise the FIRM, risk premium rates and floodplain management regulations as required.
(c) CHAPTER 30, 31, WIS. STATS., DEVELOPMENT
Development which requires a permit from the Department, under chs. 30 and 31, Wis. Stats., such as docks, piers, wharves, bridges, culverts, dams and navigational aids, may be allowed if the necessary permits are obtained and amendments to the floodway lines, water surface profiles, BFE's established in the FIS, or other data from the officially adopted FIRM, or other floodplain zoning maps or the floodplain zoning ordinance are made according to Section 23.503(8).

offers the minimum notice required under this section to all persons in the
campground. This procedure shall include a written agreement between the
campground owner, the municipal emergency government coordinator and
the chief law enforcement official which specifies the flood elevation at which
evacuation shall occur, personnel responsible for monitoring flood
elevations, types of warning systems to be used and the procedures for
notifying at-risk parties, and the methods and personnel responsible for
conducting the evacuation.
(5) This agreement shall be for no more than one calendar year, at which time
the agreement shall be reviewed and updated - by the officials identified in
sub. (4) - to remain in compliance with all applicable regulations, including
those of the State Department of Health Services and all other applicable
regulations.
(6) Only camping units are allowed.
(7) The camping units may not occupy any site in the campground for more than
180 consecutive days, at which time the camping unit must be removed from
the floodplain for a minimum of 24 hours.
6
(8) All camping units that remain on site for more than 30 days shall be issued a
limited authorization by the campground operator, a written copy of which is
kept on file at the campground. Such authorization shall allow placement of
a camping unit for a period not to exceed 180 days and shall ensure
compliance with all the provisions of this section.
(9) The municipality shall monitor the limited authorizations issued by the
campground operator to assure compliance with the terms of this section.
(10) All camping units that remain in place for more than 180 consecutive days

30
1. Shoreland Regulations
a. Applicability. In addition to any other applicable use or site regulation, as to any
lands annexed after May 7, 1982, the following restrictions and regulations shall
apply to:
i. All lands lying within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the following
lakes:
Comus Lake
Delavan Lake
ii. All lands lying within three hundred (300) feet of the ordinary high-water mark of
navigable rivers or streams, or to the landward side of the floodplain, whichever
is greater. Rivers and streams in the City of Delavan shall be presumed to be
navigable if they are designated as either continuous or intermittent waterway on
the United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps or other zoning base
maps referenced in this Ordinance. If evidence to the contrary is presented; the
Zoning Administrator shall make the initial determination whether or not the river
or stream in question is navigable under the laws of this state. The Zoning
Administrator shall also make the initial determination of the location of the
ordinary high-water mark. When questions arise, the Zoning Administrator shall
contact the appropriate district DNR office for a determination of navigability or
ordinary high-water mark. Flood Hazard Boundary maps, or Flood Insurance
Study maps (or soil maps or other existing county maps used to delineate
floodplain areas which have been adopted by the City of Delavan) shall be used
to determine the extent of the floodplain of rivers or streams in the City of
Delavan.
b. Tree Cutting, Shrubbery Clearing, and Earth Movements shall be conducted in
accordance with the City of Delavan's erosion control standards and, except as
provided below, shall require a zoning permit and an erosion control plan. In
addition, the Zoning Administrator may, where appropriate, require an applicant to
furnish a surety to enable the City to carry out land restoration work in the event of
default by the applicant in carrying out an approved erosion control plan. The
amount of such surety shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator, and the
form and type of all sureties shall be approved by the Plan Commission. The
Zoning Administrator may, as appropriate, request a review of the proposed
cutting, clearing, or earth movement activity by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources, the USDA Soil Conservation Service, or other appropriate
agency, and await their comments and recommendations before issuing a zoning
permit but not to exceed thirty (30) days. All cutting, clearing, and earth movement
activities shall be so conducted as to prevent erosion and sedimentation and
preserve the natural beauty of the City. Paths and trails shall not exceed ten (10)
feet in width and shall be so designed and constructed as to result in the least
removal and disruption of natural ground cover and the minimum impairment of
natural beauty. In the strip of land 35 feet wide inland from the ordinary high-water
mark, no more than 30 feet in any 100 feet or the same proportion of a smaller lot
shall be clear-cut.
i. Natural shrubbery shall be preserved as far as practicable and, where
removed, it shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in
retarding runoff, preventing erosion and preserving natural beauty. These
provisions do not apply to the removal of dead or diseased trees.
31
ii. Cutting Plan: A special cutting plan allowing greater cutting may be permitted
by the Plan Commission by issuance of a Conditional Use Permit. An
application for such a permit shall include a survey of the lot providing the
following information: location of parking, topography of the land, existing
vegetation, proposed cutting, and proposed replanting. The Commission may
grant such a permit only if it finds that such special cutting plans:
(1) Will not cause undue erosion or destruction of scenic beauty, and
(2) Will provide substantial visual screening from the water of dwellings,
accessory structures and parking areas. Where the plan calls for
replacement plantings the Commission may require the submission of a
bond which guarantees the performance of the planned tree or shrubbery
replacement by the lot owner.
iii. Beyond the thirty-five (35) foot strip, a zoning permit shall be required with
erosion control plans for projects within 300 feet of the ordinary high-water
mark and which are either (1) on slopes more than 20%, (2) larger than 1,000
square feet on slopes of 12% - 20%, or (3) larger than 2,000 square feet on
slopes less than 12%.
c. Required setbacks.
i. All structure, except piers, wharfs, boat hoists, boathouses, patios, bridges,
dams, and walkways and stairways which area necessary to provide
pedestrian access to the shoreline, shall require a setback of at least seventy-
five (75) feet from the ordinary high-water mark although a greater setback may
be required where otherwise regulated by the floodplain provisions of this
ordinance or other more restrictive ordinances.
ii. Shoreyards may be reduced to the average of the shoreyards existing on the
abutting properties within a distance of 100 feet of the subject site but shall not
be reduced to less than forty (40) feet.
iii. See regulations as to setbacks for various structures herein after appearing in
e., below.
d. Structures which require authorization or permits from the DNR pursuant to
Chapters 30 and 31, Wisconsin Statutes, or which are to be located below the
ordinary high-water mark, namely bridges, dams, culverts, piers, wharfs, shoreland
riprap, navigational aids, and waterway crossings of transmission lines shall comply
with all applicable Federal, State, County, and Local Regulations, but shall not
require the issuance of a shoreland zoning permit where the standards of this
ordinance are complied with.
e. Various Structures
i. Boathouses: Boathouses shall not extend below the ordinary high-water mark
and shall be designed exclusively for the storage of watercraft and related
marine equipment and shall not be used for human habitation or commercial
purposes. A boathouse with rooms above or within, used for purposes other
than the storage of watercraft and related marine equipments, shall not be
deemed to be a boathouse. Fireplaces, patio doors, plumbing, heating, cooking
facilities, or any features inconsistent with the use of the structure exclusively as
a boathouse are not permitted in or on boathouses. The highest point of the roof
32
elevation of the boathouse shall not be more than fourteen (14) feet vertical
measurement above the ordinary high-water mark, shall not exceed 400 square
feet in horizontal area covered, and shall not be closer than three (3) feet to any

boathouse roofs be designed to provide general outdoor living space, i.e., as a
deck. Only one boathouse is permitted on a lot as an accessory structure.
ii. Patios: Patios are exempted from the shoreland setback requirements provided
that the structure shall be located so as to minimize earth disturbing activities
and shoreland vegetation removal during construction. Further, no permanent
benches or tables shall be attached to the patio; the patio shall not exceed a
height of six (6) inches above the original grade, and canopies, roofs, and
railings on such structures are prohibited. The patio must be placed within the
30 in 100 foot area that is allowed to be clear-cut and shall be no more than 150
square feet in area.
iii. Stairways, walkways, piers, and wharfs: Stairways and walkways and that
portion of piers and wharfs landward of the ordinary high-water mark are
exempted from the shoreland setback requirements provided that the structure
is necessary to access the shoreline because of steep slopes or wet, unstable
soils. Further, the structure shall be located so as to minimize earth disturbing
activities and shoreland vegetation removal during construction. The structure
shall be no more than forty-two (42) inches wide; open railings are permitted
only where required by safety concerns; canopies, roofs, and closed railing/walls
on such structures are prohibited; landings for stairways or docks are permitted
only where required by safety concerns and shall not exceed twenty-five (25)
feet in area.
iv. Retaining walls: Retaining walls and terracing shall only be allowed in the
shoreline setback area where the applicant can successfully prove to the Plan
Commission or the Department of Natural Resources that there is a current

Section 23.505 Lakeshore Overlay Zoning District
(1) Definition: Lakeshores are the land margins of navigable waters which are identified as "lakes
and other water bodies" as shown on Environmental Corridors Composite Maps for the City of
Delavan and its environs, prepared by the SEWRPC. Lakeshores are all areas within 75 feet of
the ordinary high water mark of such features. Decorative water features shall not be
considered "navigable waters" for the purposes of this Section. This meaning of "lakeshores"
shall remain distinct from the meaning of the term as employed by the State of Wisconsin
Statutes and the DNR.
(2) Purpose of Lakeshore Protection Requirements: Lakeshores serve to protect land/water
margins from erosion due to site disruption. Because of regular contact with wave action,
currents, and runoff, such areas are highly susceptible to continuous, and in some cases, rapid
erosion. Lakeshore protection also provides a natural vegetation buffer which serves to reduce
water velocities and wave energy, and filters significant amounts of water-borne pollutants and
sediments. Lakeshores also promote infiltration and groundwater recharging, and provide a
unique habitat at the land/water margin.
(3) Determination of Lakeshore Boundaries: General lakeshore boundaries are depicted on
Sheet 2 of the Official Zoning Map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property
which contains a lakeshore depicted on the Official Zoning Map, the petitioner shall prepare a
detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 23.510. This analysis shall depict the
location of all lakeshore areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of Subsection
(1), above.
(4) Mandatory Lakeshore Protection Requirements: Lakeshores shall remain in an undisturbed
state, except for the land uses permitted in Section 23.204 per the requirements of Subsection
23.206(10).
36
Section 23.506 Drainageway Overlay Zoning District
(1) Definition: Drainageways are non-navigable, above-ground watercourses, detention basins
and/or their environs which are identified by the presence of one or more of the following:
(a) All areas within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a "perennial stream" as shown on
Environmental Corridors Composite Maps for the City of Delavan and its environs, prepared
by the SEWRPC;
(b) All areas within 50 feet of the ordinary high water mark of an "intermittent stream" or "open
channel drainageway" as shown on Environmental Corridors Composite Maps for the City of
Delavan and its environs, prepared by the SEWRPC.
(2) Purpose of Drainageway Protection Requirements: Drainageways serve in the transporting
of surface runoff to downstream areas. As such, drainageways serve to carry surface waters,
supplement floodplain, wetland, and lakeshore water storage functions in heavy storm or melt
events, filter water-borne pollutants and sediments, promote infiltration and groundwater
recharging, and provide a unique habitat at the land/water margin. Drainageway protection
requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reducing the potential for soil
erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which are
susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement.
(3) Determination of Drainageway Boundaries: General drainageway boundaries are depicted
on Sheet 2 of the Official Zoning Map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any
property which contains a drainageway depicted on the Official Zoning Map, the petitioner shall
prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 23.510. This analysis shall
depict the location of all drainageway areas on the subject property as related to the provisions
of Subsection (1), above.
(4) Mandatory Drainageway Protection Requirements: Drainageways shall remain in an
undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 23.204 per the requirements in
Subsection 23.206(10). Vegetation clearing to maintain drainageway functions is permitted with
the written approval of the Director of Public Works. All areas designated as drainageways shall
be located within a public easement or dedication for maintenance purposes to preserve proper
drainage flow.
37
Section 23.507 Woodland Overlay Zoning District
(1) Definition: Woodlands are areas of trees whose combined canopies cover a minimum of 80%
of an area of one acre or more, as shown on Environmental Corridors Composite Maps for the
City of Delavan and its environs, prepared by the SEWRPC.
(2) Purpose of Woodland Protection Requirements: Woodlands provide a wide variety of
environmental functions. These include atmospheric benefits such as removing air-borne
pollutants, carbon dioxide uptake, oxygen production, and evapotranspiration returns. Water
quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates (particularly for nitrogen and
phosphorus) and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and velocities. Woodlands
provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources. Woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers,
greatly reducing runoff-related soil erosion. Woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities
which further reduces soil erosion. Finally, under proper management techniques, woodlands
serve as regenerative fuel sources.
(3) Determination of Woodland Boundaries: General woodland boundaries are depicted on
Sheet 2 of the Official Zoning Map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property
which contains a woodland depicted on the Official Zoning Map, the petitioner shall prepare a
detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 23.510. This analysis shall depict the
location of all woodland areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of Subsection
(1), above.
(4) Mandatory Woodland Protection Requirements: Woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed
state except for the land uses permitted in Section 23.204 per the requirements of Subsection
23.206(10) and areas subject to the following mitigation requirements. Selective cutting
operations are permitted as a Special Use in all woodland areas (per the requirements of
Section 23.206(2)(f)). Clear cutting is permitted as a Conditional Use in all woodland areas (per
the requirements of Section 23.206(2)(g)).
38
Section 23.508 Steep Slope Overlay Zoning District
(1) Definition: Steep slopes are areas which contain a gradient of 12% or greater, (equivalent to a
10 foot elevation change in a distance of 83 feet or less), as shown on Environmental Corridors
Composite Maps for Delavan and its environs, prepared by the SEWRPC.
(2) Purpose of Steep Slope Protection Requirements: Steep slopes are particularly susceptible
to damage resulting from site disruption, primarily related to soil erosion. Such damage is likely
to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed. Such erosion reduces the productivity of
the soil, results in exacerbated erosion downhill, and results in increased sedimentation in
drainageways, wetlands, streams, ponds and lakes. Beyond adversely effecting the
environmental functions of these resources areas, such sedimentation also increases flood
hazards by reducing the flood water storage capacity of hydrological system components, thus
elevating the flood level of the drainage system in effected areas. Beyond these threats to the
public safety, disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of slippage and slumping--unstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties, buildings, and public facilities such as roads and utilities.
(3) Determination of Steep Slope Boundaries: General steep slope boundaries are depicted on
Sheet 2 of the Official Zoning Map. Upon the proposal of development activity on any property
which contains a steep slope depicted on the Official Zoning Map, the petitioner shall prepare a
detailed site analysis per the requirements of Section 23.510. This analysis shall depict the
location of all steep slope areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of
Subsection (1), above.
(4) Mandatory Steep Slope Protection Requirements: Steep slopes shall remain in an
undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in Section 23.204 per the requirements of
Subsection 23.206(10).
39
Section 23.510 Detailed Site Analysis
(1) Purpose: The detailed site analysis required by this Subchapter is designed to provide the clear
identification of permanently protected green space areas on a site which is proposed for
development. The detailed survey work required to identify these areas accurately on a map is
not required prior to the initiation of development concept plans for an area. A detailed site
analysis shall be performed in conjunction with required land division documents or
development site plans (see Section 24.908) for any and all properties containing permanently
protected natural resource areas.
(2) Description: The detailed site analysis shall be shown on a map of the subject property which
depicts the location of all protected natural resource areas, as defined by the provisions of this
Subchapter, and as located by an on-site survey. The detailed site analysis shall meet the
following requirements:
(a) Scale: A minimum scale of one inch equals 200 feet shall be used.
(b) Topography: Topographic information is not required for any property which does not
contain steep slopes (as designated on Sheet 2 of the Official Zoning Map). For such properties, topographic information with a minimum contour interval of two feet is required.
(c) Specific Natural Resources Areas: All natural resource areas which require protection under the provisions of this Chapter shall be accurately outlined and clearly labeled. Particular care as to clarity shall be taken in areas where different resource types overlap with one-another.
(d) Development Pads:
1. All site disruption (including selective cutting) proposed to occur within permanently
protected natural resource areas shall be limited to development pads. Development
pads shall be depicted on the detailed site analysis map, site plans required for
development permits, and the recorded Plat of Subdivision or Certified Survey Map.
2. Beyond visible damage to natural resources, vegetation, soil, and drainage patterns, site
disruption activities shall not compact soil covering tree roots, or otherwise damage trees
beyond the area from which trees are to be removed. All trees with calipers exceeding 3
inches, whose canopies are located adjacent to disturbed areas, which die within a
period of five years following site disruption shall be replaced by the property owner with
a 3 inch caliper tree of the same type (canopy or understory). Therefore, care shall be
taken to ensure that equipment and actions associated with permitted site disruption
activities are limited to the area in which they are permitted. The use of snow fences
and other barriers to outline development pads during disruption activity is strongly
recommended to limit the extent of inadvertent compaction or other disturbance of earth,
and collision damage to vegetation intended for protection. Such barriers should be
placed no closer to protected trees than a point on the ground directly under their outer
canopy edge.
(e) Mitigation Areas: All mitigation areas related to the provisions of this Chapter shall be depicted on the detailed site analysis map with notations provided which describe the mitigation techniques employed.
(3) Required Procedure for Submission and Review
(a) Required Timing of Submission: The detailed site analysis map shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator for initial review prior to, or concurrently with, the submission of the
40
Preliminary Plat of Subdivision or the Certified Survey Map; or if the proposed development
does not involve a land division, then submittal is required as an attachment to a required
site plan (see Section 24.908). A concept plan of the proposed development may be
submitted prior to the submission of the detailed site analysis map, however, in no way
does the acceptance and/or general approval of the concept plan indicate the approval of
natural resource feature locations. A detailed site analysis map prepared for the subject
property which has been previously approved by City Staff, may be submitted for any
subsequent development activity on the site. However, modifications to such a previously
approved map will be required if the analysis is no longer accurate for the subject property.
(b) Review by City Staff: City staff shall review the submitted detailed site analysis map for
general compliance with the following data sources:
1. Sheet 2 of the Official Zoning Map;
2. Applicable SEWRPC Environmental Corridors Composite, Corridor Inventory, and
Planned Corridor Maps;
3. Air photos of the subject property;
4. USGS Quads and other sources of topographic information;
5. Applicable FEMA and related floodplain maps;
6. Applicable Federal and State Wetland Inventory Maps;
7. The City of Delavan Comprehensive Master Plan; and
8. Site visits. The Zoning Administrator shall provide the petitioner with a written
evaluation of the submitted detailed site analysis map which shall indicate the
acceptance by City Staff; or the need for further analysis work, discussion with the
petitioner and/or Staff-recognized experts, or a joint site visit.
(c) Modification of Detailed Site Analysis Map: If necessary, as determined by City Staff,
revised detailed site analysis maps shall be prepared and submitted for review by City Staff,
until a version is deemed acceptable. Staff review of the detailed site analysis map may be
appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals as a matter of Ordinance Interpretation. (See
Section 24.934.).
(d) Acceptance of Detailed Site Analysis Map: Upon notification of acceptance by City Staff,
(or in case of appeal, by determination of the Board of Zoning Appeals), the petitioner may
proceed with the submittal of necessary development documents.
(4) Integration of Detailed Site Analysis Information with Required Development and/or Land
Division Documents: Information contained on the detailed site analysis map relating to the
boundaries of permanently protected green space areas (including natural resource protection
areas, other permanently protected green space areas, and required mitigation areas) shall be
clearly depicted on any and all site plans required as a precondition for application for any
development permit (such as a Building Permit) and on any proposed Plat of Subdivision or
Certified Survey Map. (See also, Section 24.908 regarding required site plans.)

SUBCHAPTER 23-6: LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERYARD REGULATIONS
Section 23.601 Purpose
The purpose of this Subchapter is to indicate the minimum requirements for the landscaping of foundations, developed lots, street frontages, paved areas, permanently protected green space areas, reforestation areas, and bufferyards.
Section 23.602 How to Use this Subchapter
(1) This Subchapter contains the standards which govern the amount, size, type, installation and maintenance of required landscaping. This Subchapter recognizes the important and diverse benefits which landscaping provides in terms of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, and implementing the Comprehensive Master Plan.
(2) Each section of this Subchapter is oriented to a specific category of required landscaping. These include Landscaping Requirements for Foundations (Section 23.604), Landscaping Requirements for Developed Lots (Section 23.605) Landscaping Requirements for Street Frontages (Section 23.606), Landscaping Requirements for Paved Areas (Section 23.607), Landscaping Requirements for Permanently Protected Green Space Areas (Section 23.608), Landscaping Requirements for Reforestation (Section 23.609), and Landscaping Requirements for Bufferyards (Section 23.610).
(3) In each instance, a "landscaping point" concept is used to provide a maximum amount of
flexibility in terms of the selection of plant materials. Section 23.603 presents sample
landscape point combination alternatives used by this Ordinance. At the end of this
Subchapter, Section 23.611 provides a listing of plant species fitting into the "climax tree",
"tall deciduous tree", "medium deciduous tree", "low deciduous tree", "tall evergreen tree",
"medium evergreen tree", "low evergreen tree", "tall deciduous shrub", "medium deciduous
shrub", "low deciduous shrub", "medium evergreen shrub", "low evergreen shrub", and
"non-contributory plants" used by this Ordinance. Section 23.612 provides requirements
for the installation and maintenance of required landscaping, and Section 23.613 describes
the procedure for calculating landscaping requirements for this Subchapter.
2
Section 23.603 Landscaping Points, Sample Landscaping Schemes and Measurement for Landscaping Requirements
(1) All landscaping requirements are stated in terms of the number of landscaping points
required. The required number of landscaping points is dependent upon the type of land
use, the zoning district, and the size of the development. A different number of points is
awarded for each plant, depending upon its typical growth rate, its mature height, and
whether it is a deciduous or evergreen species. A minimum installation size is required for
each of these plant categories. These requirements are as follows:

(3) Measurement for Landscaping Requirements:
A minimum amount of landscaping points, based upon the zoning district, is required for the linear feet Building Foundations, the gross floor area of buildings on Developed Lots, the linear feet of Street Frontage, and the total combined area of Paved Areas. The following diagram illustrates the measurement techniques used to determine these requirements:
Landscaping Calculation Equations:
Paved Area = (P1 x P2) + (P3 x P4) + (P5 x P6) + (P7 x P8) + (P9 x P10)
Street Frontage = S1 + S2
Building Perimeter = F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 + F5 + F6 + F7 + F8
Building Floor Area = (B1 x B2) + (B3 x B4) + (B5 x B6)
7
Section 23.604 Landscaping Requirements for Building Foundations
(1) This Section requires that certain buildings constructed after the effective date of this Ordinance (See Section 21.011.) be accented by a minimum amount of landscaping placed near the building foundation.
(2) Landscaping required by this Section shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip line is located within 10 feet of the building foundation. Such landscaping shall not be located in those areas required for landscaping as street frontages, paved areas, protected green space areas, reforestation areas, or bufferyards, under Sections 23.605-23.609, of this Subchapter. See 23.603(2)(A) for a suggested scheme.
(3) For each 100 feet of building foundation perimeter, the following number of landscaping points (per Section 23.603) shall be provided on a prorated basis, and installed and permanently maintained per the requirements of Section 23.612.
(4) Climax trees and tall trees shall not be used to meet this requirement. The intent of this section is to require a visual break in the mass of buildings and to require a visual screen of a minimum of 6 feet in height for all exterior perimeter appurtenances (such as HVAC/utility boxes, standpipes, stormwater discharge pipes and other pipes.)

Section 23.607 Landscaping Requirements for Paved Areas
(1) This Section requires that paved areas on certain lots developed after the effective date of this Ordinance contain a minimum amount of landscaping within, or within 10 feet of, the paved area. The intent is to require a continuous visual screen of parking areas from public rights-of-way at a minimum height of 40 inches.
(2) A minimum of 360 square feet of landscaped area, which shall be located within 10 feet of the paved area, is required for the placement of every 100 landscaping points. Said area does not have to be provided in one contiguous area--sample configurations are depicted in Section 23.603, above. Plants used to fulfill this requirement shall visually screen parking, loading and circulation areas from view from public streets.
(3) All landscaping areas located adjacent to paved areas shall be separated from the paved area by a continuous minimum 4 inch tall curb which is constructed of concrete, asphalt, timber or like material approved by the Director of Public Works.
(4) For every 20 off-street parking stalls or 10,000 square feet of pavement (whichever yields the greater landscaping requirement) located in a development, the following number of landscaping points (as described in Section 23.603) shall be provided on a prorated basis, and installed and maintained per the requirements of Section 23.612. A minimum of 30% of all points shall be devoted to climax and/or tall trees and a minimum of 40% of all points shall be devoted to shrubs.

Section 23.608 Landscaping Requirements for Other Permanently Protected Green Spaces
(1) This Section requires that each acre of other permanently protected green space (See Section 23.204) approved after the effective date of this Ordinance (See Section 21.011) be planted with a minimum amount of landscaping.
(2) For every one acre of other permanently protected green space in a development, two hundred landscaping points (as described in Section 23.603) shall be provided. In addition, adequate ground cover shall be provided to stabilize the soil.
Section 23.609 Landscaping Requirements for Required Reforestation
(1) This Section requires that each area required to be reforested, be reforested and maintained in a manner appropriate to site conditions.
(2) A detailed reforestation plan shall be submitted by the property owner and approved by the City prior to clear cutting. This plan shall be reviewed by a reforestation consultant chosen by the City, with funding for consulting services provided by the Petitioner to the City.
Rationale: The provisions of this Section are designed to ensure that reforestation efforts required as part of woodland disruption mitigation standards result in the thorough and reasonably rapid replacement of the important and varied environmental functions which woodlands provide. (See Section 23.507.)
Section 23.610 Landscaping Requirements for Bufferyards
(1) Purpose
This Section provides the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this Ordinance. (See Section 21.011.) A bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier. It includes an area, together with the combination of plantings, berms and fencing, that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances. These nuisances can often occur between adjacent zoning districts. Such nuisances are dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and incompatible land uses, buildings or parking areas.
Rationale: One of zoning's most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses. The location of districts is supposed to provide protection, but in the City of Delavan, this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as single-family residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this Ordinance. Bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses.
(2) Required Locations for Bufferyards
Bufferyards shall be located along (and within) the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another. Bufferyards may be located in required setback areas. In such instances, the one-half of the bufferyard requirements of this Section shall be used instead of the street frontage landscaping required in Section 23.606, if such requirements of this Section are greater. (In such instances, the width of the right-of-way may be counted as contributing to the width requirements for a bufferyard, however, the minimum width required along the street frontage by Section 23.606 shall be provided in all cases.) Bufferyard plantings or structures shall not be located on any portion of any existing, dedicated, or officially mapped right-of-way.
12
3) Determination of Required Bufferyard
The determination of bufferyard requirements is a two-staged process. First, the required level of bufferyard opacity is determined using Table 23.610(4)(a). Opacity is a quantitatively-derived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property. The required level of opacity indicated by this Table is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts. The provisions of this Subsection indicate the minimum requirements for bufferyards located along zoning district boundaries.
(a) Identification of Required Level of Opacity
Table 23.610(4)(a) shall be used to determine the minimum level of opacity for the
required bufferyard. The required level of opacity is determined by the value given in
the cell of the Table at which the column heading along the top row of the Table
(representing the subject property's zoning district) intersects with the row heading
along the left hand side of the Table (representing the adjacent property's zoning
district). The value listed is the required level of opacity for the bufferyard on the
subject property.
(b) Identification of Detailed Bufferyard Requirements
1. If a proposed use adjoins a parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the
presence of a zoning district boundary, that use shall provide a bufferyard with
the level of the opacity indicated in Table 23.610(4)(a).
2. For each level of opacity listed in Table 23.610(4)(a), a wide variety of width,
landscaping point, berm, and structure combinations are possible. These are
listed in Table 23.610(4)(b). The requirements listed in Table 23.610(4)(b)
pertain to the number of landscaping points, the minimum bufferyard width, and
the type of berm or fencing required within every 100 feet of required bufferyard.
A variety of landscaping point options are available and may be mixed within
distinct portions of the same bufferyard. Section 23.603 describes the various
available landscaping point alternatives. Section 23.611 provides a listing of
tree and shrub species which correspond the landscaping point descriptions.
(4) Tables for Required Bufferyards: See following pages for Tables 23.610(4)(a) and (b).
Notes for Table 23.610(4)(a): For properties zoned in the Rural Holding District (RA-35ac), refer to the Comprehensive Master Plan's Future Land Use Map to determine the proposed zoning district for said property. Bufferyard requirements shall be taken from this proposal.
Caution: The required opacity levels listed in Table 23.610(4)(a) are generally different on either side of any given zoning district boundary.

may be counted as contributing to the landscaping requirements.
(d) All landscaping and bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn or native ground
cover unless such vegetation is already fully established.
(e) The exact placement of required plants and structures shall be depicted on the
required detailed landscaping plan per 24.908(3)(c) shall be the decision of each
property owner within the requirements of this Subchapter, except that the following
requirements shall be met:
1. Evergreen shrubs shall be planted in clusters in order to maximize their chance

portion of the required bufferyard on his property.
4. In no manner shall landscaping or bufferyard materials be selected and/or
located in a manner which results in the creation of a safety or visibility hazard.
(See Section 23.703.)
5. The restrictions on types of plants listed in Sections 23.604-23.607 shall apply.
(2) Maintenance
The continued and continual maintenance of all required landscaping and bufferyard materials shall be a requirement of this Title and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which said materials are required. This requirement shall run with the property and is binding upon all future property owners. Development of any and all property following the effective date of this Title shall constitute an agreement by the property owner to comply with the provisions of this Section. Upon failure to comply with these provisions, the City may enter upon the property for the purpose of evaluating and maintaining all required landscaping and bufferyard materials, and may specially assess the costs thereof against the property. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be considered a violation of this Title, and shall be subject to any and all applicable enforcement procedures and penalties. (See Section 24.936.)

(3) Use of Required Bufferyard and Landscaped Areas
Any and all required bufferyards or landscaped areas may be used for passive recreation
activities. Said areas may contain pedestrian, bike or equestrian trails provided that: no
required material is eliminated; the total width of the required bufferyard, or the total area
of required landscaping, is maintained; and all other regulations of this Title are met. In no
event, however, shall swimming pools, tennis courts, sports fields, golf courses, or other
such active recreation used be permitted in such areas. Furthermore, in no instance shall
any parking be permitted in such areas, nor shall any outdoor display of storage of
materials be permitted in such areas. Paving in such areas shall be limited to that
required for necessary access to, through, or across the subject property.
(4) Utility Easements
Landscaping materials, fences and berms which are located within a duly recorded utility
easement and/or a pedestrian easement shall not count toward meeting a landscaping
requirement. However, the width of such areas may be counted as part of a landscaping
requirement.
Section 23.613 Calculating Landscaping and Bufferyard Requirements
In calculating the number of required landscaping points under the provisions of this Subchapter, all areas and distances on which required calculations are based shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of square feet or linear feet. Any partial plant derived from the required calculations of this Subchapter (for example 23.3 canopy trees) shall be rounded up to the nearest whole plant (24 canopy trees).
Section 23.614 Depiction on Required Site Plan
Any and all proposed landscaping on the subject property, required to meet the standards of this Title, shall be clearly depicted and labeled as to its location and make-up on the site

In no instance or manner shall any off-street parking or traffic circulation area be used as a storage area, except as provided for by Section 23.706(3).
(6) Off-Street Parking and Traffic Circulation Design Standards
(a) Surfacing and Marking: All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas (including
all residential driveways -- except those within the single-family districts which exist
before the effective date of this Ordinance unless otherwise directed by the Zoning
Administrator per Section 23.702(13)) shall be paved with a hard, all-weather surface,
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator. Said surfaces intended for 5 or more
parking stalls shall be marked in a manner which clearly indicates required parking
spaces.
(b) Curbing: All off-street parking areas designed to have head-in parking within 6½ feet
of any lot line shall provide a tire bumper or curb of adequate height and which is
properly located to ensure that no part of any vehicle will project beyond the required
setbacks of this Title (see Sections 23.403 and 23.404.) Curbing within off-street
parking areas shall also be required to fully separate all required landscaped areas
from the parking lot, (see Section 23.607(4)).
(c) Lighting: All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas serving 6 or more cars shall
be lit so as to ensure the safe and efficient use of said areas during the hours of use.
An illumination level of between 0.4 and 1.0 footcandles is recommended for said
areas, and said illumination level shall not exceed the standards of Section 23.707.
(d) Access: Except for parking spaces serving single-family and two-family dwelling units,
each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway
that is wide enough and designed to provide a safe and efficient means of vehicular
access to the parking space without directly backing or maneuvering a vehicle into a
public right-of-way for all commercial, industrial, and multi-family parking lots. All off-
street parking and traffic circulation facilities shall be designed with an appropriate
means of vehicular access to a street or alley, in a manner which least interferes with
traffic movements. No driveway across public property, or requiring a curb cut, shall
exceed a width of 40 feet for commercial and industrial land uses, or 25 feet for
residential land uses. (See also Table 23.704(6)(j).) Off-street parking spaces for
residential uses may be stacked or in front of one-another for the same building unit.
Parking spaces located behind an enclosed garage and located directly off a through
aisle shall be a minimum of 30 feet deep.
(e) Fire Lanes: A fire lane shall be required to provide access to any portion of any
structure equal to or less than 40 feet tall which is more than 150 feet from the nearest
street right-of-way, and to any portion of any structure greater than 40 feet tall which is
more than 50 feet from the nearest street right-of-way. The Zoning Administrator may
also require the provision of a fire lane or lanes to any part of any structure upon a
determination that the distance of the structure from the nearest hydrant, the
configuration of development on the site, or other special characteristics of the site
otherwise inhibit effective fire extinguishment. All fire lanes shall: provide clear,
unobstructed access for vehicles and apparatus at all times through a combination of
pavement marking and signage; shall be a minimum of 18 feet wide; and shall be
surfaced as an all-weather roadway.
5
(f) Signage: All signage located within, or related to, required off-street parking or traffic
circulation shall comply with the requirements of Subchapter 23-8.
(g) Handicapped Parking Spaces: Parking for the handicapped shall be provided at a
size, number, location, and with signage as specified by State and Federal regulations.

handicapped, every and all provided off-street parking space shall comply with the
minimum requirements of Table 23.704(6)(j). The minimum required length of parking
spaces shall be 17.0 feet, plus an additional 1.5 foot vehicle overhang area at the end
of the stall. All parking spaces shall have a minimum vertical clearance of at least
seven feet.
(i) Snow Storage: Required off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall not be
used for snow storage.
(j) Parking Lot Design Standards: Horizontal widths for parking rows, aisles, and
modules shall be provided at widths no less than listed in Table 23.704(6)(j), and
shown in Diagram 23.704(6)(j) on the following page.
(7) Calculation of Minimum Required Parking Spaces
(a) General Guidelines for Calculating Required Parking Spaces
The requirements of Subsection (c), below, shall be used to determine the minimum
required number of off-site parking spaces which must be provided on the subject
property. Requirements are generally tied to the capacity of the use; the gross floor
area of the use; or the number of employees which work at the subject property during
the largest work shift. The term "capacity" as used herein means the maximum
number of persons that may be accommodated by the use as determined by its design
or by State Building Code regulations, whichever number is greater. References
herein to "employee(s) on the largest work shift" means the maximum number of
employees working at the facility during a single given day, regardless of the time
period during which this occurs, and regardless of whether any such person is a full-
time employee. The largest work shift may occur on any particular day of the week or
during a lunch or dinner period in the case of a restaurant. In all cases, one reserved
parking space shall be provided for each vehicle used by the operation during
business hours. Said spaces shall be in addition to those required by Subsection (c),
below. Where said parking needs of any land use exceed the minimum requirements
of this Title, additional parking spaces sufficient to meet the average maximum weekly
peak-hour parking space demand shall be provided by said land use.
(b) Joint Parking Facilities
1. Parking facilities which have been approved by the Director of Public Works to
provide required parking for one or more uses, shall provide a total number of
parking spaces which shall not be less than the sum total of the separate parking
needs for each use during any peak hour parking period when said joint parking
facility is utilized at the same time by said uses.
2. Each parking space designed to serve as joint parking shall not be located farther
than 400 feet from the access to all of the various areas it is designated to serve.

Section 23.721 Administration & Enforcement of Performance Standards
(1) Determinations necessary for administration and enforcement of performance standards set forth herein range from those which can be made with satisfactory accuracy by a reasonable person using normal senses and no mechanical equipment, to those requiring great technical competence and complex equipment for precise measurement. It is the intent of this Title that:
(a) Where determinations can be made by the Zoning Administrator using equipment
normally available to the City or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such
determinations shall be so made before notice of violations is issued.
(b) Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable for the
City to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual
determinations, procedures shall be available for causing corrections or apparent
violations of performance standards, for protecting individuals from arbitrary,
capricious, and unreasonable administration and enforcement of performance
standard regulations, and for protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for
administration and enforcement.
1. The Zoning Administrator shall give written notice, by Certified mail or other
means, ensuring a signed receipt for such notice to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violations. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the Zoning Administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.
2. The notice shall state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply or to correct
the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the administrative official within the time limit set constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this Title. The notice shall further state that upon request of those to whom it is directed, technical determination as described in this Title will be made, and that if violations as alleged are found, costs of such determinations shall be charged against those responsible for the violation, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is determined that no violation exists, the cost of the determination will be paid by the City.
(2) Enforcement of the provisions of this Subchapter shall be per Section 24.936.

SUBCHAPTER 23-8: SIGNAGE REGULATIONS (RC-391, 3/20/18)
Section 23.801: Purpose
(1) The purpose of this Chapter is to establish standards for the fabrication, erection, and use of signs, and to regulate the location, type, size, and height of signage for all properties within the City of Delavan. The adoption of this Chapter reflects the formal finding of fact by the City of Delavan Plan Commission and Common Council that regulation of signage advances the following compelling governmental interests:
(a) Reduce signage that the City has determined to be a cause of unsafe traffic and visibility conditions for pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and passengers.
(b) Protect pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and passengers from injury caused by the faulty and uncontrolled construction and use of signs within the City.
(c) Protect pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and passengers from injury caused by distractions, obstructions, and hazards created by certain signs or by cluttered, distracting, or illegible signage.
(d) Promote the public welfare, health, and safety of all persons using public thoroughfares and rights-of-way within the City of Delavan in relation to the signage displayed thereon, or overhanging, or projecting into such public spaces.
(e) Preserve the value of private property by assuring the compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses.
(f) Assure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of public streets and other public structures and spaces are protected by exercising reasonable controls over character and design of signage.
(g) Advance the aesthetic goals of the City throughout the community and ensure the effectiveness and flexibility in the design, creativity, or use of signage without creating a detriment to the general public.
(2) Furthermore, this Chapter leaves ample and adequate alternative channels of commercial speech communication for the messages portrayed on advertising signs – namely, distributed print media, broadcast media, and point-of-purchase display – and is narrowly defined so as to limit said prohibition to commercial speech on exterior signage and signage intended to be viewed from beyond the boundaries of a site.
(3) The penalties of the City of Delavan Municipal Code may be applicable to violations of the provisions of this Chapter.
(4) Any sign authorized by this Chapter may contain a noncommercial message.
(5) Signs that fail to comply with the requirements in this Chapter are subject to the penalties found in Section 24.936.

Section 23.815: Sign Setback, Height, Measurement, and Flexibility
(1) Sign Setbacks. Freestanding signs shall be set back a distance greater than or equal to 1 foot in the Business Central, Business Local, Business Neighborhood, and Institutional Zoning Districts, and 12 feet in the Business Regional, Office Neighborhood, Office Park, Manufacturing General, and Manufacturing Heavy, and Manufacturing Light Zoning Districts.
(2) Sign Height.
(a) The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from the average ground level adjacent at the base of the sign to the top of the highest attached component of the sign, or from the centerline grade of the nearest adjacent public road, if such information is supplied with the permit application and confirmed by the Zoning Administrator, whichever is higher.
(b) The average ground level is defined as the average elevation of the ground upon which the sign supports are placed, except when the sign supports rest upon a berm or other area elevated above the surrounding ground. In such cases, the average elevation of the base of such berm or other area shall be considered as the ground level.
(3) Minimum Ground Clearance. All Awning, Canopy, Marquee, Blade, and Suspended Signs shall have a minimum clearance of 14 feet above a drive, alley, or street and a minimum of 10 feet above a sidewalk, path, trail, or other ground-level surface.
(4) Measurement of Sign Area: The measurement of sign area is based on the arrangement of sign copy and sign background:
(a) In the case of a freestanding sign (including three-dimensional objects), sign area shall include the total sign area(s) that can be viewed from any single vantage point. i.e., for a typical freestanding sign that faces two directions, only the largest sign face visible from any single vantage point shall count toward the total permitted sign area. Sign area shall not include any elements of the sign structure designed solely for support of the sign structure and located below or to the side of the sign message. Examples of parts of a freestanding sign structure which are exempt from the sign area include the sign base and the supporting columns, posts, or poles.
(b) For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy which are attached to a background surface with one or more neutral surface colors, sign area shall be measured as the sum of the smallest rectangle or as the sum of the irregular shapes enclosing each letter or related copy. (See Example 1 in Figure 23.815.)
1. If an exact sign area calculation is not provided by the sign manufacturer, then the sign shall be measured using the smallest rectangles method.
2. If an exact sign area calculation is provided by the sign manufacturer, then the applicant has the option to use the sum of the irregular shapes enclosing each letter or related copy to calculate the sign’s total area.
(c) For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy which are attached to a background surface with one or more non-neutral background colors, sign area shall be measured as the sum of the smallest rectangles and right triangles enclosing entire sign message and any and all non-neutral background color areas. (See Example 2 in Figure 23.815.)
(d) For signs comprised of letters and related copy surrounded by one or more sign background colors on a single panel, frame, or cabinet, the sign area shall be measured as the smallest single rectangle enclosing the entire sign message and any and all background color areas. (See Example 3 in Figure 23.815.)
20
(e) For signs comprised of individual letters and related copy surrounded by one or more sign background colors on individual panels, sign area shall be measured as the smallest single rectangle enclosing the entire sign message and any and all background color areas. (See Example 4 in Figure 23.815.)
(f) Groupings of related smaller signs may be counted as one sign. In such cases, sign area shall be measured as the smallest single rectangle enclosing the individual signs and any and all background color areas. (See Example 4 in Figure 23.815.)
(g) For signs comprised of one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane.
21

(1) Applicability.
(a) No Permanent Business Signs listed under Section 23.805(1) or Optional Miscellaneous Signs listed under Section 23.805(3)(b) shall be erected, installed, constructed, or maintained without the granting of a permit from the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
(b) For signs requiring a permit in Subsection (a), above, this Section shall apply and be construed to require a permit for a change of copy on any sign or for any conversions or changes in the sign structure.
(c) This Section shall not apply to repainting or re-facing with the same sign copy, cleaning, repair, or other normal maintenance of the sign or sign structure.
(d) No new permit is required for signs which are in place as of the effective date this Chapter, and such signs may remain as legal nonconforming signs. Any alteration or relocation of such signs shall conform to the requirements of this Chapter. Refer to Section 23.835 for rules pertaining to nonconforming signs.
(e) Any sign permit granted hereunder shall not be assigned or transferred to any other sign, including a modified sign face or modified sign structure.
(f) The owner or tenant may request all such signs at one site be included under one permit.

At a minimum, the site plan shall include the following:
1. Location, type, height, width, and area of the proposed sign.
2. Location, type, height, width, and area of all existing signs on the property and indication of whether existing sign(s) will remain or be removed/replaced.
3. All property lines and buildings on the property and within 50 feet of the proposed sign.
4. All parking areas, driveways, and public roads.
5. Method of attachment, structural support, method of illumination, and sign materials.
6. The total area of all signs on the subject property both before and after installation of the proposed sign.
7. Approximate value of the sign to be installed, including cost of installation.
23
(h) Payment of the sign permit fee, as established from time to time by the Common Council.
(i) A written statement that all temporary signs will be removed per the limits.
(j) Any other information that may reasonably be requested by the Zoning Administrator for the purpose of application evaluation.
(k) Any existing or proposed sign on property abutting a State Highway, United States Highway, or Interstate Highway may also require approval from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation or the Federal Highway Administration.
(3) Granting and Issuance.
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall review the application to ensure it is complete per the requirements of Subsection (2), above.
(b) In cases where no other review or approvals are required under this Chapter, the Zoning Administrator shall review said application for compliance with Subsection (4), below, and shall, in writing, either approve or deny said sign permit within 10 working days of the acceptance of the complete application and payment of the required fee.
(c) When a proposed sign is associated with any development that requires a Site Plan, a sign permit shall not be granted prior to the approval of a Site Plan. In such cases, the Zoning Administrator shall review said application for compliance with Subsection (4), below, and shall schedule the item on the appropriate meeting agenda(s) within 10 working days of the acceptance of the complete application and payment of the required fee. Within 10 working days of recommendation or action by the body with recommending or approval authority, the Zoning Administrator shall approve or deny said sign permit based on such recommendation or action.
(d) Denial of a sign permit shall not result in total or partial reimbursement of permit fees paid.
(e) A granted sign permit shall expire, and shall be null and void, if the sign is not attached or erected within 180 days after the issuance of the sign permit.
(4) Basis for Granting a Sign Permit. In deciding whether or not to grant a sign permit, the Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the proposed sign is in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. In such review, the Zoning Administrator may also consider the following factors:
(a) Whether the sign is designed, constructed, installed, or maintained in such a manner that it does not endanger public safety or traffic safety.
(b) Whether the sign is in compliance with all provisions of the City of Delavan Municipal Code and Building Code, including those related to traffic safety, traffic visibility, sign setbacks, and structural integrity.
(5) Enforcement and Revocation of Sign Permit.
(a) A sign permit may be revoked if the applicant has failed to comply with the provisions of this Chapter or any conditions that may have accompanied the permit at the time of issuance. Revocation requires written notice by either the Zoning Administrator for Zoning Ordinance violations or the Building Inspector for Building Code or other construction code violations.
(b) In the event that construction, installation, or manufacture of a sign for which a permit has been issued has not commenced within 180 days from the date of the issuance of such permit, said permit shall be null and void and automatically revoked. If work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 90 days any time after the work is commenced, the original permit shall become null and void. In such cases, a new permit shall be obtained to complete the work and a new permit fee shall be required.
24
(c) Any sign subject to a revoked permit shall be removed by the licensee, sign owner, or property owner within 45 days of such revocation.
(d) Revocation shall not result in total or partial reimbursement of permit fees paid.
(6) Appeals. Any person affected by a decision of the Zoning Administrator may petition for a hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals. The filing of such petition automatically stays removal of any sign involved and already legally erected until the Board of Zoning Appeals decides whether to sustain, modify, or withdraw the notice.
(7) Removal of Signs in Violation of this Chapter.
(a) If the Zoning Administrator determines that any sign exists in violation of this Chapter, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the sign permit holder or the owner of the property on which the sign is located. Said notification shall indicate that such violation shall be corrected within 60 days of receipt of said notice on penalty of automatic revocation of any sign permit, and that removal of the sign by the City may occur at the expense of the owner of the property.
(b) If notification is sent and the violation is not corrected within 60 days, the Zoning Administrator shall revoke the permit for any sign which is in violation of this Chapter. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to cause removal of such sign.
(c) The expense of removing such sign shall be charged to the owner of the property on which the sign is located. If the owner fails to pay such expense within one month of being billed therefore, or has not made arrangement for payment satisfactory to the City Attorney, then such expense shall become a lien on the property and shall be placed upon the tax roll.
(d) Any sign illegally placed in a public right-of-way shall be subject to immediate removal and confiscation without notice by the Zoning Administrator.

notice shall also be mailed not less than five (5) five days prior to the hearing to the fee
owners of record of all land within 300 feet of any part of the subject building or
premises involved in the appeal.
(6) Hearings: Hearings on appeals shall be public and shall be conducted according to the
rules of procedure adopted by the Board. At the hearing, the appellant or applicant
may appear in person, by agent or by attorney. Decisions of the Board following
public hearing may be made either in public or closed session as the Board shall
determine.
(7) Findings
(a) Findings of fact and reasons for all actions taken shall be reduced by the Board
to writing in the minutes of the proceedings.
(b) In the case of appeal based on variance, for the same to be granted the findings
shall affirmatively show the following together with the fact and the grounds
therefor:
1. A literal enforcement of the terms of the Zoning Code would result in
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship to the appellant.
2. The variance is not contrary to the public interest and will not endanger
public safety.
3. The variance is in accord with the spirit of the Zoning Code.
4. The variance will cause substantial justice to be done.
5
(c) Further to be considered by the Board in case of appeal based on variance, in
arriving at its reasons and grounds for the above required findings, are the
following:
1. Preservation of Intent: No variance shall be granted that is not consistent
with the purpose and intent of the regulations for the district in which the
development is located. No variance shall have the effect of permitting a use
in any district that is not a stated permitted use, accessory use, or conditional
use in that particular district.
2. Exceptional Circumstances: There may be exceptional, extraordinary, or
unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel, structure,
use or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in
the same district and the granting of the variance would not be of so general
recurrent nature as to suggest that the Zoning Code should be changed.
3. Economic Hardship and Self-Imposed Hardship Not Grounds for
Variance: No variance shall be granted solely on the basis of economic gain
or loss. Self-imposed hardships shall not be considered as grounds for the
granting of a variance.
4. Preservation of Property Rights: Such variance may be necessary for the
preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other
properties in the same district and same vicinity.
5. Absence of Detriment: Such variance should not create substantial
detriment to adjacent property and shall not materially impair or be contrary to
the purpose and spirit of this Code or the public interest.
(d) Additional Requirements in Floodland Districts. No variance shall be granted
when it is found:
1. Filling and development contrary to the purpose and intent of the Floodway
District (FW) and the Floodplain District (FP) would result.
2. A change in the boundaries of the Floodway District (FW), Floodplain District
(FP), or the Floodfringe District (FF) would result.
3. A lower degree of flood protection than a point two (2) feet above the 100-
year recurrence interval flood for the particular area would result.
4. Any action contrary to the provisions of Subchapter NR-116 of the Wisconsin
Administrative Code would result.
(8) Wetland Mapping Disputes (RC-287, 3/9/10)
(a) Wetland Disputes: Whenever the Board of Appeals is asked to interpret a
shoreland-wetland overlay district boundary where an apparent discrepancy
exists between the City's Final Wetland Inventory Map and actual field conditions,
the City shall contact the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to
determine if the wetland inventory map is in error. If the DNR staff concurs that
the particular area was incorrectly mapped as a wetland, the Board of Appeals
shall direct the City Plan Commission to initiate appropriate action to rezone the
property within a reasonable amount of time.
(9) Decision: The Zoning Board of Appeals shall decide all appeals and applications
within 30 days after the public hearing and shall transmit a signed copy of the Board's
decision to the appellant or applicant, Zoning Administrator, and City Plan Commission.
(a) Conditions may be placed upon any Zoning Permit ordered or authorized by this
Board.
(b) Variances, substitutions, or use permits granted by the Board shall expire within
six (6) months unless substantial work has commenced pursuant to such grant.
6
(c) Applicants receiving variances in floodlands shall be notified, in writing, by the
Board of Appeals that increased flood insurance premiums and risk to life or
property may result from the granting of the variance. The Board shall keep a
record of the notification in its files.
(10) Notice to the DNR: The Zoning Board of Appeals shall transmit a copy of each
application for a variance to conservancy regulations in the lakeshore portion of the
shoreland-wetland overlay district and a copy of all shoreland-wetland appeals, to the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for review and comment at least
10 days prior to any public hearings. Final action on the application shall not be taken
for 30 days or until the DNR has made its recommendation, whichever comes first. A
copy of all decisions relating to variances to shoreland-wetland regulations and a copy
of all decisions to shoreland-wetland appeals, shall be transmitted to the DNR within
10 days of the date of such decision. (RC-287, 3/9/10)
(11) Review by Court of Record: Any persons aggrieved by any decision of the Board of
Appeals may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such
decision is illegal and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the offices of the
Board.

conformity with the Comprehensive Plan;
b. A mistake was made in mapping on the Official Zoning Map. (That is, an
area is developing in a manner and purpose different from that for which it
is mapped.) NOTE: If this reason is cited, it must be demonstrated that the
discussed inconsistency between actual land use and designated zoning is
not intended, as the City may intend to stop an undesirable land use
pattern from spreading;
c. Factors have changed, (such as the availability of new data, the presence
of new roads or other infrastructure, additional development, annexation, or
other zoning changes), making the subject property more appropriate for a
different zoning district;
d. Growth patterns or rates have changed, thereby creating the need for an

of the proposed map amendment. If the Common Council wishes to make
significant changes in the proposed map amendment, as recommended by the Plan
Commission, then the procedure set forth in Section 62.23(7)(d) of the Wisconsin
Statutes shall be followed prior to Council action. (RC-325, 10/9/12)
7
(c) When the Common Council takes action on the application, it shall state in the minutes and/or the recitals to the amending ordinance, its conclusion and any findings of facts supporting its conclusion as to the following: that the potential public benefits of the proposed map amendment outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed map amendment, as identified in Subsections (4)(c)1.-3. above, after taking into consideration the proposal by the Applicant and the recommendation of the Plan Commission. Any action to amend the zoning map requires a majority vote of the Council. The Common Council's approval of the proposed map amendment shall be considered the approval of a unique request, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other amendment to the Official Zoning Map.
(7) Effect of Denial: No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be
resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on
grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning
Administrator.
(8) Fee: A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 24.935(1)(b).
(9) Floodland District Boundary Changes Limited: The Common Council shall not permit changes to the floodland district boundaries that are inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance or in conflict with the applicable rules and regulations of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
(a) Changes in the Floodway Overlay District boundaries shall not be permitted where
the change will increase the flood stage elevation by 0.1 foot or more, unless the
applicant has made appropriate legal arrangements with all affected units of
government and all property owners affected by the stage increase. The only way
the 1.0 foot limit may be exceeded is through obtaining a waiver from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for a specific project that necessarily exceeds the
one foot increase in flood elevation. Applications for Floodway Overlay District
changes shall show the affects of the change within the associated floodfringe, and
shall provide adjusted water surface profiles and adjusted floodland limits to reflect
the increased flood elevations.
(b) Changes in the Floodplain Conservancy Overlay District boundaries shall not be
permitted where the change will increase the flood stage elevation by 0.1 foot or
more, unless the application has made appropriate legal arrangements with all
affected units of government and all property owners affected by the stage increase.
In no event shall a change be permitted that would increase the flood stage
elevation by more than 1.0 foot. Applications for Floodplain Conservancy Overlay
District changes shall show the affects of the change within the associated
floodfringe, and shall provide adjusted water surface profiles and adjusted water
surface profiles and adjusted floodland limits to reflect the increased flood
elevations.
(c) Removal of land from the floodland districts shall not be permitted unless the land
has been filled to an elevation at least two feet above the elevation of the regional
flood and provided that such land is contiguous to lands lying outside of the
floodlands.
(d) Amendment of floodlands which were delineated by approximate methods shall not
be permitted unless the Applicant provides the City with engineering data showing
the flood profile, necessary river cross-sections, flood elevations, and any effect the
establishment of a floodway/floodfringe will have on flood stages. The effects shall
be limited as set forth above for changes in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above. If the
proposed development is less than five acres in area, and where the cost of the
proposed development is estimated to be less than $125,000.00, the Department of
8
Natural Resources (DNR) will assist the Applicant in determining the required flood
elevations.
(e) No river or stream shall be altered or relocated until a floodland zoning change has
been applied for and granted in accordance with the requirements of this Section,
and until all adjacent communities have been requested to review and comment on
the proposed alteration or relocation. The flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated watercourse shall not be reduced to less than the flood carrying capacity
before the water-course was altered or relocated. All necessary state and federal
permits shall be obtained.
(f) Notice to and approvals by DNR and FEMA. A copy of all notices for amendments
or rezoning in the Floodland Districts shall be transmitted to the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) at least 10 days prior to the public hearing. No amendments to the
floodland district boundaries or regulations shall become effective until approved by
the DNR and reviewed by the FEMA. In the case of floodland district boundary
changes, an official letter of map amendment from the FEMA may also be required.
(10) Amendments to Shoreland-Wetland Districts
(a) The City shall transmit a notice of any change (text or map) in the Shoreland-
Wetland Overlay Zoning District to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
(DNR). Notice requirements shall be as follows:
1. A copy of every application for a text or map change mailed within five days of
filing with the City Clerk.
2. At least 10 days prior notice of any public hearing on a shoreland C-l zoning
amendment.
3. Notice of a City Plan Commission recommendation no later than 10 days
following the recommendation.
4. Notice of a Common Council decision no later than 10 days following the
decision.
(b) No wetland in the Shoreland-Wetland Overlay District shall be rezoned if the
rezoning may result in a significant adverse impact on storm or floodwater storage
capacity; maintenance of dry season stream flow, the discharge of groundwater
from the wetland to another area, or the flow of groundwater through a wetland;
filtering or storage of sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, or organic compounds that
would otherwise drain into navigable waters; shoreline protection against soil
erosion; fish spawning, breeding, nursery or feeding grounds; wildlife; habitat; or
areas of special recreational, scenic or scientific interest, including scarce wetland
types.
(c) If the DNR has notified the City Plan Commission that an amendment to the
Shoreland-Wetland Overlay Zoning District may have a significant adverse impact
upon any of the criteria listed in subparagraph (b) above, that amendment, if
approved by the Common Council, shall contain the following provision:
"This amendment shall not take effect until more than 30 days have elapsed
since written notice of the Common Council's approval of this amendment was
mailed to the Department of Natural Resources. During this 30-day period, the
Department of Natural Resources may notify the Common Council that it will
adopt a superseding shore land ordinance for the City pursuant to Section 62.231
of the Wisconsin Statutes. If the Department does so notify the Common Council,
the effect of this amendment shall be stayed until the Section 62.231 adoption
procedure is completed or otherwise terminated."

Section 24.904 Special Use Review and Approval
(1) Purpose
(a) The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of proposed special uses.
(b) Special uses are those uses which have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this Title. In order to prevent this from occurring, all special uses are required to meet certain requirements applicable only to special uses, in addition to the general requirements of this Title and the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is located.
(c) Land uses proposed which fail to meet one of the requirements for special uses of Section 23.206, may be reviewed as a conditional use. (See Section 23.202(3)(b).)
(2) Regulations Applicable to All Special Uses: No public hearing is required to develop a special use, however, a demonstration that the developer proposes to meet all special use requirements of this Subchapter and Subchapter 23-4 must be made at time of site plan application (see Section 24.908). Furthermore, no Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for any development which does not comply with all requirements of this Title (see Section 24.909). Any special use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this Title shall be considered in violation of this Title and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties.
(3) Application Requirements: All applications for proposed special uses, shall be approved as complete by the Zoning Administrator prior to the formal initiation of this procedure. Said complete application shall be comprised of all of the following:
(a) A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the special use is proposed, and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property. Said map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided;
(b) A map, such as the Land Use Plan Map, of the generalized location of the subject property in relation to the City as a whole;
(c) A written description of the proposed special use describing the type of activities, buildings, and structures proposed for the subject property and their general locations; and,
(d) A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site plan shall conform to any and all the requirements of Section 24.908(3).
(4) Fee: A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 24.935(1)(c).
10
Section 24.905 Conditional Use Review and Approval
(1) Purpose
(a) The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which govern the procedure
and requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of proposed conditional
uses.
(b) Certain uses in situations which are of such a special nature, or are so dependent
upon actual contemporary circumstances, as to make impractical the
predetermination of permissibility, or the detailing in this ordinance of specific
standards, regulation, or conditions which would permit such determination in each
individual situation, may be permitted as conditional uses.
(c) Conditional uses are also those proposed uses which are listed as special uses, but
fail to meet one of the requirements for special use approval listed in Section
23.206. (See Section 23.202(3)(b).)
(d) Under this Ordinance, a proposed Conditional Use shall be denied unless the
Applicant can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the City, that the proposed
Conditional Use will not create undesirable impacts on nearby properties, the
environment, nor the community as a whole.
(e) Limited Conditional Uses: Limited conditional uses are the same as regular
conditional uses excepting that further, in the considered findings of the Common
Council and the granting thereof, because of any of the following: Their particularly
specialized nature, their particular locations within a district, the peculiar unique
relationships or needed compatibility of uses to involved individuals, or any other
reason(s) the Common Council deems specially relevant and material to delimit the
scope thereof.. should be of lesser permanence than regular conditional uses and
the duration or term of existence may be established until time certain or be limited
to a future happening or event at which time the same shall terminate.
(2) Initiation of Request for Approval of a Conditional Use: Proceedings for approval of a conditional use may be initiated by an application of the owner(s) of the subject property.
(3) Application Requirements: All applications for proposed conditional uses shall be approved as complete by the Zoning Administrator prior to the initiation of this procedure. The submittal of an application to the City Clerk to initiate this procedure shall not occur until the Zoning Administrator has certified acceptance of the complete application to the City Clerk. No placement of the application on any agenda, as an item to be acted upon, shall occur unless said certification has occurred. The item may be placed on any agenda as a discussion-only item, with the permission of the Zoning Administrator, without an application. Prior to the submittal of the Official Notice regarding the application to the newspaper by the City Clerk, the Applicant shall provide the City Clerk with 12 copies of the complete application as certified by the Zoning Administrator. Said complete application shall be comprised of all of the following:
(a) A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the conditional use is
proposed, and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject
property, together with the names and addresses of the owners of all lands on said
map as the same appear on the current records of the Register of Deeds of
Walworth County (as provided by the City of Delavan). Said map shall clearly
indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the
jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and
attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a
photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals 800 feet.
All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be
provided;
11
(b) A map, such as the Future Land Use Map from the Comprehensive Plan, of the
generalized location of the subject property in relation to the City as a whole;
(RC-325, 10/9/12)
(c) A written description of the proposed conditional use describing the type of activities,
buildings, and structures proposed for the subject property and their general
locations;
(d) A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site plan shall
conform to any and all the requirements of Section 24.908(3). If the proposed
conditional use is a cluster development (per Section 23.206(1)(b) through (f)) or a
group development (per Section 23.208) a proposed preliminary plat or conceptual
plat may be substituted for the required site plan, provided said plat contains all
information required on said site plan per Section 24.908;
(e) As an optional requirement, the Applicant may wish to provide written justification for
the proposed conditional use consisting of the reasons why the Applicant believes
the proposed conditional use is appropriate, particularly as evidenced by compliance
with the standards set forth in Subsection (4)(c)1.-6. and (4)(d)1.-7., below.
(4) Review by The Zoning Administrator: The proposed conditional use shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator as follows:
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and
fulfills the requirements of this Ordinance. If the Zoning Administrator determines
that the application is not complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this
Ordinance, he shall return the application to the Applicant. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that the application is complete, he shall so notify
Applicant.
(b) Upon notifying the Applicant that his application is complete the Zoning
Administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written
justification for the proposed conditional use which may be provided in the
application per Subsection (3)(a)-(e), above.
(c) Criteria for granting conditional use permits. In granting a conditional use permit, the
Common Council shall consider the advice and recommendations of the Plan
Commission and the effect of the proposed use upon the health, safety, morals, and
general welfare of occupants and/or surrounding lands. The Plan Commission, in
arriving at its recommendations to Council, shall consider, and the Council, among
other things and prior to taking action on granting such permit, shall determine
whether it can make affirmative findings on what it considers a sufficient number of,
such of the following criteria as are deemed pertinent to the particular application
under consideration:
1. The use will not create an excessive burden of existing parks, schools, and
other public facilities and utilities which serve or are proposed to serve the
area.
2. The property and proposed structures will have proper ingress and egress with
particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience,
traffic flow and control and access in case of fire or catastrophe.
3. The use will be sufficiently compatible or separated by distance or screening
from adjacent agricultural or residentially zoned or used land so that existing
homes will not be depreciated in value and there will be no deterrence to
development of vacant land.
12
4. The use is consistent with the purposes of the Zoning Code and the purposes
of the zoning district in which the applicant intends to locate the proposed use.
5. The use will not cause traffic hazard or congestion.
6. Existing business nearby will not be adversely affected because of curtailment
of customer trade brought about by intrusion of noise, glare or general
unsightliness.
(d) Additional Conditions. In permitting a new conditional use or the alteration of an
existing conditional use, the Plan Commission may recommend, and the Common
Council may impose, in addition to the standards and requirements expressly
specified by the Zoning Code, additional conditions which the Plan Commission and
Common Council consider necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding
area or the City as a whole. These conditions may include, but are not limited to the
following:
1. Increasing the required lot size or yard dimension.
2. Limiting the height, size or location of buildings.
3. Controlling the location and number of vehicle access points.
4. Increasing the street width.
5. Increasing the number of required off-street parking spaces.
6. Limiting the number, size, location of lighting signs.
7. Requiring diking, fencing, screening, landscaping or other facilities to
protect adjacent or nearby property.
(e) The Zoning Administrator shall forward the report per (4)(b) to the Plan Commission
for the Commission's review and use in making its recommendation to Common
Council. Included in this report shall be a recommendation as to whether the
proposed conditional use should be a regular or a limited conditional use. If the
Zoning Administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the
provisions of the City's Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Administrator shall
note this determination in the report. (RC-325, 10/9/12)
(5) Review, Public Hearing, and Recommendation by the Plan Commission: Common
Council shall not approve a conditional use without allowing for a recommendation from the
Plan Commission per the provisions of this Subsection. (RC-325, 10/9/12)
(a) The Plan Commission shall schedule a public hearing to consider the application within a reasonable time after receipt of the written recommendation from the Plan Commission. The Applicant may appear in person, or by agent, and/or by
attorney. Notice of the proposed conditional use and the public hearing shall conform to the requirements of Section 62.23(7)(d) of the Wisconsin Statutes. Said notice shall contain a description of the subject property and the proposed conditional use per Subsections (3)(a) and (c), above. In addition, at least ten days before said public hearing, the City Clerk shall mail an identical notice to the Applicant; to all property owners within 300 feet of the boundaries of the submit property as identified in Subsection (3)(a), above; and to the Clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any portion of the jurisdiction of this Title. Failure to mail said notice, to said clerk(s) of such neighboring municipalities, provided it is unintentional, shall not invalidate proceedings under this Section. (RC-325, 10/9/12)
(b) Within 60 days after the public hearing (or within an extension of said period
requested in writing by the Applicant and granted by the Plan Commission), the Plan
Commission may make a written report stating to the Common Council, and/or shall
state in the minutes, its findings regarding Subsections (3) and (4), above, and its
recommendations regarding the application as a whole and, if for issuance, whether
as regular or limited conditional use. Said report may include a formal finding of
facts developed and approved by the Plan Commission concerning the requirements
of (4)(c)1.-6. and (4)(d)1.-7., above. (RC-325, 10/9/12)
13
(c) If the Plan Commission fails to make a report within 60 days after the filing of said
complete application (and in the absence of an Applicant-approved extension per
(5)(b), above), then the Common Council proceed under Section (6). Failure to
receive said written report from the Plan Commission per Subsection (5)(b), above,
shall not invalidate the proceedings or actions of Common Council.
(d) If the Plan Commission recommends approval of an application, it shall state in the
minutes or in the subsequently issued written report to the Common Council, its
conclusion and any finding of facts supporting its conclusion as to the following: that
the potential public benefits of the proposed conditional use permit outweigh any and
all potential adverse impacts of the proposed conditional use, as identified in
Subsections (4)(c)1.-6. and (4)(d)1.-7. above, after taking into consideration the
proposal by the Applicant.
(6) Review and Action by Common Council: Common Council shall consider the Plan Commission's recommendation regarding the proposed conditional use. (RC-325, 10/9/12)
(a) The Council may request further information and/or additional reports from the Plan
Commission, the Zoning Administrator, and/or the Applicant. (RC-325, 10/9/12)
(b) The Common Council may take final action on the application at the time of its initial
meeting and will allow public input, or may continue the proceedings. Common
Council may, by amending ordinance, adopt the amendment to the Official Zoning
Map as originally proposed, may adopt the proposed map amendment with
modifications (per the recommendations of the Zoning Administrator, the Plan Commission, authorized outside experts, or its own members) or may deny adoption
of the proposed map amendment. If the Common Council wishes to make
significant changes in the proposed map amendment, as recommended by the Plan
Commission, then the procedure set forth in Section 62.23(7)(d) of the Wisconsin
Statutes shall be followed prior to Council action. (RC-325, 10/9/12)
(c) When the Common Council takes affirmative action on the application, it shall state
in the adopting resolution, its conclusion and any finding of facts supporting its
conclusion as to the following: that the potential public benefits of the proposed
conditional use sufficiently outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the
proposed conditional use, as identified in Subsections (4)(c)1.-6. above, after taking
into consideration the proposal by the Applicant and the recommendation of the Plan
Commission. Any action to approve or allow the proposed conditional use requires a
majority vote of the Council. The Common Council's approval of the proposed
conditional use shall be considered the approval of a unique request, and shall not
be construed as precedent for any other proposed conditional use.
(7) Effect of Denial: No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence, or proof of change of factors, is found to be valid by the Zoning Administrator.
(8) Termination of an Approved Conditional Use: Upon approval by Common Council, the Applicant must demonstrate that the proposed conditional use meets all general and specific conditional use requirements in the site plan required for initiation of development activity on the subject property per Section 24.908. Once a conditional use is granted, no Erosion Control Permit, Site Plan approval (per Section 24.908), Certificate of Occupancy (per Section 24.909), or Building Permit shall be issued for any development which does not comply with all requirements of this Title. Any conditional use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this Title shall be considered in violation of this Title and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties. A conditional use may be revoked for such a violation by majority vote of the Common Council, following the procedures outlined in Subsections (2) through (7), above.
14
(9) Time Limits on the Development of Conditional Use: The start of construction of any and all conditional uses shall be initiated within 365 days of their approval by Common Council and shall be operational within 730 days of said approval. Failure to initiate development within this period shall automatically constitute a revocation of the conditional use. For the purposes of this Section, "operational" shall be defined as the granting of a Certificate of Occupancy for the conditional use. Prior to such a revocation, the Applicant may request an extension of this period. Said request shall require formal approval by Common Council and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification (as determined by Common Council).
(10) Discontinuing an Approved Conditional Use: Any and all conditional uses which have been discontinued for a period exceeding 365 days shall have their conditional use invalidated automatically. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to conclusively demonstrate that the subject conditional use was operational during this period.
(11) Change of Ownership: All requirements of the approved conditional use shall be continued regardless of ownership of the subject property, except where limited explicitly by the Common Council. Modification, alteration, or expansion of any conditional use in violation as approved per (6), above, without approval by Common Council, shall be grounds for revocation of said conditional use approval per (8), above. For Bed and Breakfast land uses the granting of a Conditional Use Permit shall be valid while said property is owned by the owner at time of conditional use approval.
(12) Recording of Conditional Use Requirements: Except for conditional use approvals for temporary uses, a certified copy of the authorizing resolution, containing identifiable description and any specific requirements of approval, shall be recorded by the City with the County Register of Deeds office.
(13) Notice to the DNR: The Plan Commission shall transmit a copy of each application for a
conditional use for conservancy regulations in the Shoreland-Wetland, Floodway,
Floodplain, or Floodfringe Overlay Zoning Districts to the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) for review and comment at least 10 days prior to any public hearings.
Final action on the application shall not be taken for 30 days or until the DNR has made its
recommendation, whichever comes first. A copy of all decisions relating to conditional
uses for shoreland-wetland conservancy regulations or to floodland regulations shall be
transmitted to the DNR within 10 days of the date of such decision.
(14) Uses Now Regulated as Conditional Uses which were Approved as Legal Land Uses -- Permitted by Right or as Conditional Uses -- Prior to the Effective Date of this Ordinance: A use now regulated as a conditional use which was approved as a legal land use -- either permitted by right or as a conditional use -- prior to the Effective Date of this Ordinance shall be considered as a legal conforming land use so long as the previously approved conditions of use and site plan are followed. Any modification of the previously approve conditions of use or site plan shall require application and City consideration under this Section. (C-735, 1/21/97)
(15) Fee: One or more fees are required for this procedure. Refer to Section 24.935(1)(d). (C-
735, 1/21/97)

Section 24.906 Temporary Use Review and Approval
(1) Purpose
(a) The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which govern the procedure
and requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of proposed temporary
use.
(b) Temporary uses are those uses which have the potential to create undesirable
impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general
requirements of this Title. In addition to such potential, temporary uses also have
the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially
cannot be determined except on a case by case basis. In order to prevent this from
occurring, all temporary uses are required to meet certain procedural requirements
applicable only to temporary uses, in addition to the general requirements of this
Title and the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is
located. A public hearing process is not required to review a request for a
temporary use.
(c) Land uses proposed which fail to meet one of the requirements for temporary uses
of Section 23.206, may be reviewed as a conditional use. (See Section
23.202(3)(b).)
(2) Regulations Applicable to All Temporary Uses: No public hearing is required to develop a temporary use, however, a demonstration that the developer proposes to meet all temporary use requirements of this Subchapter and Subchapter 23-4 must be made at time of site plan application (see Section 24.908). Furthermore, no Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for any development which does not comply with all requirements of this Title (see Section 24.909). Any temporary use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this Title shall be considered in violation of this Title and shall be subject to all applicable procedures and penalties.
(3) Application Requirements: All applications for proposed temporary uses, shall be approved as complete by the Zoning Administrator prior to the formal initiation of this procedure. Said complete application shall be comprised of all of the following:
(a) A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the temporary use is
proposed, and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject
property. Said map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property
and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and
all its parts and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly
reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one
inch equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and
a north arrow shall be provided;
(b) A map, such as the Land Use Plan Map, of the generalized location of the subject
property in relation to the City as a whole;
(c) A written description of the proposed temporary use describing the type of activities,
buildings, and structures proposed for the subject property and their general
locations; and
(d) The Zoning Administrator may require a site plan of the subject property when, in his
estimation, a clear public purpose will be achieved. Said site plan shall conform to
any and all the requirements of Section 24.908(3). (C-735, 1/21/97)
(4) Approval by Zoning Administrator. Approval of a temporary use shall be by the Zoning Administrator following review of said complete application per (3) above.
(5) Fee: A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 24.935(1)(c).
16
Section 24.908 Site Plan Review and Approval
(1) Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to specify the requirements and procedures for the review and approval of site plan applications. The provisions of this Section are designed to ensure that all proposed land use and development activity complies with the requirements of this Ordinance. Specifically, this Section requires that the initiation of all development activity (including building permits, zoning certificates, occupancy permits for a change of use of an existing lot or structure where there is contemplated a site plan revision, clear cutting, grading or filling) require the approval of site, building and operational plans by the City staff before the building, occupancy, and zoning permits can be issued -- except, however, that development activity associated with an approved final plat of subdivision or certified survey map for single-family and/or duplex dwelling units, and development activity associated with the full and complete implementation of a project approved within the PID phase of the Planned Infill Development District [PID] is exempt from this requirement; however, a survey prepared and certified by a registered surveyor shall be prepared for any proposed development activity for such uses. (C-735, 1/21/97)
(2) Procedure
(a) Initiation of Request for Approval of a Site Plan: Proceedings for approval of a
site plan shall be initiated by the owner(s) of the subject property, or their legally
authorized representative(s).
(b) Pre-Application Meeting: The petitioner shall first meet with the Zoning
Administrator and other applicable City Staff to discuss preliminary concepts and
plans for the development. Guidance will be provided to the Petitioner on technical
requirements and procedures, and a timetable for project review may be discussed.
(c) Application for Site Plan Review and Review by Zoning Administrator: The
petitioner shall apply to the Zoning Administrator for the scheduling of an
appearance before the City staff. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the petitioner
of the date and time of the applicable meeting. The meeting with the City staff shall
not be scheduled unless the application is approved as complete by the Zoning
Administrator per the requirements of Subsection (3), below. The review of the
submitted application shall be completed within ten working days of application
submittal. Once the application is approved as complete by the Zoning
Administrator, the Zoning Administrator may schedule a meeting with City staff a
minimum of two weeks from the date of complete application acceptance. At time of
acceptance and meeting scheduling, the Zoning Administrator shall forward copies
of the complete application (as provided by the Petitioner) to all of the pertinent City

and development activity on the subject property may not proceed until the revised
application has been approved by one of the two above procedures as directed by the Plan
Commission.
(5) Initiation of Land Use or Development Activity: Except with the written permission of the
Zoning Administrator, absolutely no land use or development activity, including site
clearing, grubbing, or grading shall occur on the subject property prior to the approval of the
required site plan. Any such activity prior to such approval shall be a violation of this
Ordinance and shall be subject to all applicable enforcement mechanisms and penalties.
(6) Modification of an Approved Site Plan: Any and all variation between development
and/or land use activity on the subject property and the approved site plan is a violation of
this Ordinance. An approved site plan shall be revised and approved via the procedures of
Subsections (2) and (4), above, so as to clearly and completely depict any and all
proposed modifications to the previously approved site plan, prior to the initiation of said

Section 24.909 Certificate of Occupancy
(1) Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations governing the review and approval of Certificates of Occupancy. This procedure is required to ensure completed development complies with the approved site plan (per the requirements of Section 24.908), and the requirements of this Title as a whole. In the event the property is located in the floodplain as defined in Section 23.503 of Subchapter 23-5 of the City of Delavan Zoning Ordinance for Natural Resources Protection, said application must comply with Section 23.503. (RC-287, 3/9/10)
(2) Land Uses and Development Requiring a Certificate of Occupancy: Certificates of
Occupancy shall be required for any of the following:
(a) Occupancy and use of a building or structure hereafter erected or structurally
altered.
(b) New occupancy and use of an existing building when the new use is of a different
land use classification (a different line in Table 23.203).
(c) Occupancy and use of vacant land.
(d) New use of vacant land when the new use is of a different land use classification (a
different line in Table 23.203).
(e) Any change in the use of a nonconforming use. No such occupancy, use of change
of use shall take place until a Certificate of Occupancy therefor shall have been
issued by the Building Inspection Superintendent.
(3) Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy
(a) Every application for a Building Permit shall also be deemed to be an application for
a Certificate of Occupancy for a new building or for an existing building which is to
be substantially altered or enlarged as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
Such Certificate shall be issued within ten working days after a written request for
the same has been made to the Building Inspector after the erection or alteration of
such building or part thereof has been completed in conformity with the provisions of
this Title.
(b) Written application for a Certificate of Occupancy for the use of vacant land or for a
change in the use of land or of a building, or for a change in a nonconforming use,
as herein provided, shall be made to the Building Inspector; if the proposed use is in
conformity with the provisions of this Title, the Certificate of Occupancy shall be
issued within ten working days after the application therefor has been made.
(c) Every Certificate of Occupancy shall state that both the building, and the proposed
use of a building or land, substantially complies with all provisions of this Title. A
record of all Certificates of Occupancy shall be kept on file in the office of the
Building Inspector and copies shall be furnished on request to any person having
proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land affected.
(4) Certificate of Occupancy for Legal Nonconforming Uses: Upon application, a
Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for all lawful nonconforming uses of land or
buildings created by adoption of this Title, or in existence at the effective date of this Title
(see Section 21.011). Application for such Certificate of Occupancy for nonconforming use
shall be filed with the Building Inspector by the owner or lessee of the building or land
occupied by such nonconforming use within one year of the effective date of this Title. It
shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to issue a Certificate of Occupancy for a legal
nonconforming use.
21
(5) Termination of a Certificate of Occupancy: It shall constitute a violation of this Title for
any person, firm, corporation, or voluntary association, either owner or agent, to do any of
the things mentioned in Subsection (2), above, without having first obtained a Certificate of
Occupancy. Any Certificate issued upon a false statement of any fact which is material to
the issuance thereof shall be void. Whenever the fact of such false statement shall be
established to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector, he shall forthwith revoke the
Certificate of Occupancy, by notice in writing to be delivered by him to the holder of the void
Certificate upon the premises where the violation has occurred, or if such holder be not
found there, by mailing the said notice of revocation by Certified Letter to his last known
address. Any person who shall proceed thereafter with such work or use without having
obtained a new Certificate of Occupancy shall be deemed guilty of violation of this Title.
(6) Fee: A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 24.935(1)(h).
22
Section 24.910 Variances
(1) Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which enable the City to
hear and decide requests for permitted variation from the terms of this Title as will not be
contrary to the public interest; where owing to special factors, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this Title would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that
the spirit of this Title shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial
justice done; as provided for by Wisconsin Statutes 62.23(7)(e)(7).
(2) Initiation of Request for Approval of a Variance: Proceedings for approval of a
requested variance shall be initiated by:
(a) an application of the owner(s) of the subject property
(3) Application Requirements: All applications for requested variances shall be approved as
complete by the Zoning Administrator a minimum of two weeks prior to the initiation of this procedure. In the event the property is located in a floodplain as defined in Section 23.503 of Subchapter 23-5 of the City of Delavan Zoning Ordinance for Natural Resources Protection, the applicant and the City must comply with the variance requirements set forth therein. The submittal of an application to the City Clerk to initiate this procedure shall not occur until the Zoning Administrator has certified acceptance of the complete application to the City Clerk. No placement of the application on any agenda, as an item to be acted upon, shall occur unless said certification has occurred. The item may be placed on any agenda as a discussion-only item, with the permission of the Zoning Administrator, without an application. Prior to the submittal of the Official Notice regarding the application to the newspaper by the City Clerk, the Applicant shall provide the City Clerk with 12 copies of the complete application as certified by the Zoning Administrator. Said complete application shall be comprised of all of the following:
(a) A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the variance is proposed,
and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject property, together
with the names and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the same
appear on the current records of the Register of Deeds of Walworth County (as
determined by the City of Delavan). Said map shall clearly indicate the current
zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which
maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be submitted
in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale
which is not less than one inch equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject
property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided;
(b) A map, such as the Land Use Plan Map, of the generalized location of the subject
property in relation to the City as a whole;
(c) A written description of the proposed variance describing the type of specific
requirements of the variance proposed for the subject property;
(d) A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site plan shall
conform to any and all the requirements of Section 24.908(3); and;
(e) Written justification for the requested variance consisting of the reasons why the
Applicant believes the proposed variance is appropriate, particularly as evidenced by
compliance with the standard set out in Subsection (4)(c) 1.-6, below. (RC-287, 3/9/10)
23
(4) Review by The Zoning Administrator: The requested variance shall be reviewed by the
Zoning Administrator as follows:
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and
fulfills the requirements of this Ordinance. If the Zoning Administrator determines
that the application is not complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this
Ordinance, he shall return the application to the Applicant. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that the application is complete, he shall so notify
Applicant.
(b) Upon notifying the Applicant that his application is complete, the Zoning
Administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written
justification for the proposed variance provided in the application per Subsection
(3)(a)-(e), above.
(c) The Zoning Administrator may also evaluate the application to determine whether
the requested variance is in harmony with the recommendations of the City of
Delavan's Comprehensive Master Plan, particularly as evidenced by compliance
with the standards of Subsection (4)(c)1.-6., below:
1. What exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or special factors are
present which apply only to the subject property? The response to this
question shall clearly indicate how the subject property contains factors which
are not present on other properties in the same zoning district. Specifically:
a. The hardship or difficulty shall be peculiar to the subject property and
different from that of other properties, and not one which affects all
properties similarly. Such a hardship or difficulty shall have arisen
because of the unusual shape of the original acreage parcel; unusual
topography or elevation; or because the property was created before the
passage of the current, applicable zoning regulations, and is not
economically suitable for a permitted use or will not accommodate a
structure of reasonable design for a permitted use if all area, yard, green
space, and setback requirements are observed;
b. Loss of profit or pecuniary hardship shall not, in and of itself, be grounds
for a variance;
c. Self-imposed hardship shall not be grounds for a variance. Reductions resulting from the sale of portions of a property reducing the remainder of said property below buildable size or cutting-off existing access to a public right-of-way or deed restrictions imposed by the owner's predecessor in title are considered to be such self-imposed hardships;
d. Violations by, or variances granted to, neighboring properties shall not justify a variance;
e. The alleged hardship shall not be one that would have existed in the absence of a zoning ordinance. (For example, if a lot were unbuildable because of topography in the absence of any or all setback requirements.)
2. In what manner do the factors identified in 1., above, prohibit the development
of the subject property in a manner similar to that of other properties under the
same zoning district? The response to this question shall clearly indicate how
the requested variance is essential to make the subject property developable
so that property rights enjoyed by the owners of similar properties can be
enjoyed by the owners of the subject property.
24
3. Would the granting of the proposed variance be of substantial detriment to
adjacent properties? The response to this question shall clearly indicate how
the proposed variance will have no substantial impact on adjacent properties.
4. Would the granting of the proposed variance as depicted on the required site
plan (see (3)(d), above), result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on
the character of the neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors,
parking, public improvements, public property or rights-of-way, or other
matters affecting the public health, safety, or general welfare, either as they
now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the
implementation of the intent, provisions, and policies of this Title, the
Comprehensive Plan, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted
or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the City or other
governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and development?
The response to this question shall clearly indicate how the proposed
variance will have no substantial impact on such long-range planning matters.
5. Have the factors which present the reason for the proposed variance been
created by the act of the Applicant or previous property owner or their agent
(for example: previous development decisions such as building placement,
floor plan, or orientation, lotting pattern, or grading) after the effective date of
this Title (see Section 21.011.) The response to this question shall clearly
indicate that such factors existed prior to the effective date of this Title and
were not created by action of the Applicant, a previous property owner, or
their agent.
6. Does the proposed variance involve the regulations of Section 23.203 (Table
of Land Uses)? The response to this question shall clearly indicate that the
requested variance does not involve the provisions of this Section.
(d) The Zoning Administrator shall forward the report per (4)(b), and if prepared the
report per (4)(c), to the Zoning Board of Appeals for the Board's review and action.
If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the
provisions of the City's Zoning Ordinance and Comprehensive Master Plan, the
Zoning Administrator shall note this determination in the report.
(5) Review and Determination by Zoning Board of Appeals
(a) Within 30 days after filing of the complete application as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing. Notice of the
requested variance and the public hearing shall conform to the requirements of Section
62.23(7)(d) of Wisconsin Statutes. Said notice shall contain a description of the
subject property and the proposed variance per Subsections (3)(a) and (c), above. In
addition, at least ten days before said public hearing, the City Clerk shall mail an
identical notice to the Applicant of the proposed variance; to the Clerk of any
municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000 feet of any portion of the subject
property; and to all property owners within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject
property as identified in Subsection (3)(a), above. Failure to mail said notice, to said
clerk(s) of such neighboring municipalities, provided it is unintentional, shall not
invalidate proceedings under this Section.
25
(b) Within 30 days after the holding of the public hearing (per (5)(a), above, (or, within an
extension of said period approved by the Applicant and granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals), the Zoning Board of Appeals make its findings per Subsection (4), above,
and its determination regarding the application as a whole. The Zoning Board of
Appeals may request further information and/or additional reports from The Zoning
Administrator and/or the Applicant. The Zoning Board of Appeals may take final action
on said request for approval of the requested variance at time of its initial meeting, or
said proceedings may be continued from time-to-time for further consideration. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall make a written report of its findings and determinations
following its determination.
(c) If the Zoning Board of Appeals fails to make a determination within 30 days after said
public hearing, then the request for the variance shall be considered denied.
(d) Said report shall include a formal findings of facts developed and approved by the
Zoning Board of Appeals concerning the requirements of (4)(c)1.-6., above.
(6) Effect of Denial: No application for a variance which has been denied (either wholly or in
part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial,
except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning
Administrator.
(7) Limited Effect of a Variance: Where the Zoning Board of Appeals has granted a variance,
such approval shall neither change the use classification of the building or premises, nor
give it any status as a nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the
variance. Granting of a variance shall be considered as unique to the variance granted,
and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed variance.
(8) Stay of Proceedings: An application for a variance shall stay all legal proceedings
furthering enforcement of any provisions of this Title from which the Applicant is requesting
a variance, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals after
the request for the variance has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals, or by a Court of Record on application, on notice
to the Zoning Administrator, and on due cause shown. State Law Reference: Section
62.23(7)(e)5., Wisconsin Statutes.
(9) Notice to the DNR: The Zoning Board of Appeals shall transmit a copy of each application
for a variance to conservancy regulations in the Shoreland-Wetland, Floodway, Floodplain,
or Floodfringe Overlay Zoning Districts, and a copy of all Shoreland floodland appeals, to
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for review and comment at least
10 days prior to any public hearings. A copy of all decisions relating to variances to
shoreland-wetland conservancy regulations or to floodland regulations, and a copy of all
decisions to shoreland-wetland conservancy and floodland appeals, shall be transmitted to
the DNR within 10 days of the date of such decision.
(10) Fee: A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 24.935(1)(i).
26
Section 24.911 Interpretations
(1) Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to assign responsibility for the official interpretation
of the provisions of this Title, and to describe the required procedure for securing such
interpretation.
(2) Initiation of Request for an Interpretation: Proceedings for an interpretation may be initiated by any of the following four methods:
(a) an application of the owner(s) of the subject property;
(b) a recommendation of the Plan Commission;
(c) by action of the Common Council, or;
(d) by a request by The Zoning Administrator.
(3) Application Requirements: All applications for interpretations, regardless of the party of
their initiation per (2) above, shall be approved as complete by the Zoning Administrator a
minimum of two weeks prior to the initiation of this procedure. The submittal of an
application to the City Clerk to initiate this procedure shall not occur until the Zoning
Administrator has certified acceptance of the complete application to the City Clerk. No
placement of the application on any agenda, as an item to be acted upon, shall occur
unless said certification has occurred. The item may be placed on any agenda as a
discussion-only item, with the permission of the Zoning Administrator, without an
application. Prior to the submittal of the Official Notice regarding the application to the
newspaper by the City Clerk, the Applicant shall provide the City Clerk with 12 copies of the
complete application as certified by the Zoning Administrator. Said complete application
shall be comprised of all of the following:
(a) All requests for interpretations shall clearly indicate the part of the text of this Title for
which the interpretation is requested and the specific questions the Applicant has
regarding said text.
(b) If the requested interpretation relates to the application of this Title to a specific
property, the additional following information shall be required:
1. A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the interpretation is
requested, and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of the subject
property, together with the names and addresses of the owners of all lands on
said map as the same appear on the current records of the Register of Deeds
of Walworth County as provided by the City of Delavan. Said map shall
clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs,
and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and all its parts
and attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible
with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch
equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale,
and a north arrow shall be provided;
2. A map, such as the Land Use Plan Map, of the generalized location of the
subject property in relation to the City as a whole;
3. A written description of the reason for the requested interpretation and how
the proposed interpretation relates to type of activities, buildings, and
structures currently located on, and proposed for, the subject property; and,
27
4. A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site
plan shall conform to any and all the requirements of Section 24.908(3).
(c) If the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular
land use under the provisions of this Title, a series of written responses to the
following questions:
1. How is the subject land use (in general) in harmony with the purposes, goals,
objectives, policies and standards of the City of Delavan Comprehensive
Plan, this Title, and any other plan, program, or ordinance adopted, or under
consideration pursuant to official notice by the City?
2. How is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives,
policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the
interpretation is being sought?
3. Do the potential public benefits of the proposed interpretation outweigh any
and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed interpretation?
(4) Review by Zoning Administrator
(a) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and
fulfills the requirements of this Ordinance. If the Zoning Administrator determines
that the application is not complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this
Ordinance, he shall return the application to the Applicant. If the Zoning
Administrator determines that the application is complete, he shall so notify
Applicant.
(b) Upon notifying the Applicant that the application is complete, and within 30 days of
such filing, the Zoning Administrator shall review the application and shall evaluate
and comment on the written justification for the proposed interpretation provided in
the application per Subsection (3), above. This review shall also take into
consideration the standards for review presented in Subsection (5), below. The
Zoning Administrator shall also evaluate the application to determine whether the
requested is in harmony with the recommendations of the City of Delavan's
Comprehensive Master Plan.
(c) The Zoning Administrator shall forward a report to the Applicant indicating the
interpretation of the Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator determines
that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of the City's Comprehensive
Master Plan, the Zoning Administrator shall note this determination in the report.
(5) Standards for Review of Requested Interpretations: This Title shall be interpreted in a
manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the City of Delavan Common
Council as noted in this Title and the Comprehensive Plan. The intent of the standards
and supporting definitions of this Title is to protect both individual property owners and the
general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed, modified, or existing
land use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this Title shall proceed as follows:
(a) Articulate certain public purpose(s) underlying the standard(s) for which an
interpretation is required.
Rationale: Before any zoning interpretation is made, there must be an explicit
discussion of certain purpose(s) for which the regulation was initially imposed. Each
zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future
neighbors and the general public. Each standard is developed as a regulatory
response to an identifiable potential negative impact. A sound interpretation of any
standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end
toward which it is directed. It is understood that there may be other public purposes
underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated.
28
(b) Articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations, permitting flexibility
in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the
public.
Rationale: There is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a
greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use, and an
interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use, or which allows a
use to be enlarged, or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in
the Title. Design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of
this Title is to be prohibited.
(c) Determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between
the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that person's land
use proposal.
Rationale: If an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly
different from the one expressly stated or permitted, and if it would result in a same
or greater degree of protection to any affected party (either the adjoining
landowners, the public at large, and/or a future property owner or renter), such an
interpretation may be appropriately made. Any interpretation which would result in
any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to
the spirit of this Title. Similarly, any interpretation which would either increase the
nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was
adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this Title. Any
interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity
beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this Title
has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements and exercise this
power in order to protect the public.
(d) This Title has been carefully designed by the Common Council to combine
maximum achievement of public goals, and the protection of adjoining property
owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of
uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan for the City
of Delavan. Great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups
while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options.
Persons interpreting this Title should not substitute their own judgements for the
legislative acts of the Common Council.
(e) In addition to the Applicant's response to the questions required by Subsection (3)
above, the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested
interpretation on land use interpretation matters:
1. No interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was
previously considered and rejected by the Common Council on an application
for an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, the Official Zoning Map, or a
previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation.
2. No interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right, a
special use, or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed
as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property (see Section 23.203).
3. No interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is
presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all
regulations applicable to development in the subject property's zoning district
(see Sections 23.203 and 23.206).
4. No interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless
such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and
is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said
district, or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district
category (see Sections 22.102 and 23.203).
29
5. If the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a
conditional use in the subject property's district than to a use permitted by right,
then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the
approval of a Conditional Use pursuant to Section 24.905.
(6) Effect of a Favorable Land Use Interpretation: No interpretation finding a particular land
use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize
either the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction,
alteration or moving of any building or structure. A favorable interpretation merely
authorizes the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and
approvals which may be required by this Title. These permits and approvals include, but
are not limited to required site plans, special use permits, conditional uses, and Certificates
of Occupancy.
(7) Limitations on Favorable Land Use Interpretation
(a) No interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally
permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365
days from the date of issuance of the interpretation, unless a Building Permit is
issued and development is actually begun within that period, and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion, or a Certificate of Occupancy is obtained and a use
commenced within that period.
(b) An interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally
permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that
particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued. The
interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a
separate interpretation has not been issued. A favorable interpretation shall
automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for
which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of 365
consecutive days or more.
(8) Fee: A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to Section 24.935(1)(j).

and place for a public hearing to consider the application. Notice of the appeal and
said public hearing shall conform to Section 63.23(7)(d) of the Wisconsin Statutes.
Said notice shall contain a description of the issue per Subsection (4)(b), above. At
least ten days before said public hearing, the City Clerk shall mail an identical notice
to the Applicant; to the Clerk of any municipality whose boundaries are within 1,000
feet of any portion of the jurisdiction of this Title; and to any property owner within
300 feet of the subject property. Failure to mail said notice, provided it is
unintentional, shall not invalidate proceedings under this Section.
(b) Within 60 days after the filing of the complete application as determined by the
Zoning Administrator (or, within an extension of said period requested in writing by
the Applicant and granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals), the Zoning Board of
Appeals make its findings per Subsection (3) above. The Zoning Board of Appeals
may request further information and/or additional reports from The Zoning
Administrator and/or the Applicant. The Zoning Board of Appeals may take final
action on the application for appeal at the time of its initial meeting, or may continue
the proceedings at Applicant's request. Said final action shall be followed by a
written report which shall include a formal finding of facts developed and approved
by the Zoning Board of Appeals concerning the request.
(c) If the Zoning Board of Appeals fails to make a determination within 60 days after the
filing of said complete application, then the request for the appeal shall be
considered denied.
(7) Effect of Denial: No application for an appeal which has been denied (either wholly or in
part) shall be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial,
except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the Zoning
Administrator.
(8) Limited Effect of a Favorable Ruling on an Appeal
(a) No ruling by the Zoning Board of Appeals on an appeal finding a particular land use to
be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a
period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the ruling on the appeal,
unless a building permit is issued and development is actually begun within that
period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a Certificate of
Occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period.
(b) A ruling by the Zoning Board of Appeals on an appeal finding a particular land use to
be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed
to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the ruling was
issued. The ruling shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for
which a separate ruling has not been issued. A favorable ruling shall automatically
expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was
issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or
more.

(9) Downtown Design Standards
(a) Overall Design Theme: The design theme for the Downtown area is based on historic
commercial and residential architectural styles which dominated the economic growth
period from 1890 through the 1920s, as treated in detail on page 38 of the 1991 City
of Delavan Comprehensive Master Plan and also in the Downtown Plan Summary
Concept Design Handbook.
1. Nonresidential Development: The design theme varies by location.
a. Walworth Avenue Frontage (RC-354, 6/9/15): Along the Walworth Avenue
frontage, from Main Street to Fifth Street, the nonresidential design theme is
characterized by a variety of architectural styles popular at the time, including
Italianate, Romanesque and Neoclassical, in a two story format with office,
storage or residential located over commercial. The façades of these
buildings have a traditional main street storefront appearance, are relatively
small in scale, have street-yard and side-yard setbacks of zero feet, have
prominent horizontal and vertical patterns formed by regularly-spaced
window and door openings, detailed cornice designs, rich detailing in
masonry coursing, window detailing and ornamentation, and are
predominantly of brick, stone or wood. Exterior building materials are of
high-quality. Exterior appurtenances are minimal. Exterior colors are
harmonious, simple and muted. Exterior signage blends, rather than
contrasts with buildings in terms of coloring (complementary to building),
location (on-building), size (small) and number (few).
b. Remainder of Downtown Design Overlay Zoning District: In this area, the
nonresidential design theme is characterized by a variety of architectural
styles popular throughout the entire 20th Century. Building styles, heights,
setbacks and details vary significantly. In the desired theme, exterior
building materials are of high-quality. Exterior appurtenances are minimal.
Exterior colors are harmonious, simple and muted. Exterior signage blends,
rather than contrasts with buildings in terms of coloring (complementary to
building), location (on-building), size (small) and number (few).
2. Residential Development: This theme is characterized by a variety of
architectural styles popular at the time, including Queen Anne, Gothic, High
Victorian, Georgian, and Prairie. These homes have generous street-yard, side-
yard and rear-yard setbacks, and are well-landscaped with a mixture of canopy
and understory yard trees, and foundation shrubs and/or flower beds. For
illustrative purposes, examples of architectural styles which tend to have
elements incompatible with Downtown historic styles include (with no attempt to
be inclusive) Spanish Mission, Scandinavian Modern, Bavarian, and California
Contemporary.
(b) Non-Residential Construction
1. General: Nonresidential construction, including new structures, building additions,
building alterations, and restoration or rehabilitation shall correspond to the
Downtown Design Guidelines of the Downtown Plan Summary Concept Design
Handbook as determined by the Plan Commission and as evidenced by certain
existing structures within the Downtown and by the following requirements for
building setback; height; building mass; horizontal rhythms (created by the
placement and design of façade openings and related elements such as piers,
columns); vertical rhythms (created by the placement and design of façade details
such as sills, transoms, cornices and sign bands); roof forms; exterior materials;
exterior surface features and appurtenances; exterior colors; exterior signage; on-
site landscaping; exterior lighting; parking and loading area design; and the use of
screening.
39
2. Building Setback: Throughout the district, the setback of buildings from street-
yard and side-yard property lines shall be compatible with existing buildings in the
immediate area which conform to the general design theme noted in Subsection
(9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as determined by the Plan Commission.
3. Building Height: Throughout the district, the height of buildings
shall be compatible with existing
buildings in the immediate area
which conform to the general
design theme noted in Subsection
(9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as
determined by the Plan Commission.
In no instance shall buildings be more
than one story taller or shorter than
the height of a building of similar use
on one of the immediately adjoining
properties, which conform to the
general design theme noted in
Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2.,
above, as determined by the Plan
Commission.
4. Building Mass: Throughout the
district, the mass of buildings
shall be compatible with existing
buildings in the immediate area which
conform to the general design theme Figure 1
noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b.,
and 2., above, as determined by the Plan Commission. The characteristic
proportion (relationship between façade height and width) of the general design
theme shall be maintained. Building mass for large structures (with a façade area
exceeding 5,000 square feet) shall be disguised through the use of façade
articulations, or through the use of exterior treatments which give the impression of
directly
adjoining individual buildings, as determined appropriate by the Plan Commission.
(See Figures 2 and 3.)
5. Horizontal Rhythms: Along Walworth Avenue between Main Street and Fifth
Street, the horizontal pattern of exterior building elements formed by patterns of
building openings for windows and doors, and related elements such as piers and
columns shall be spaced at regular intervals across all visible façades of the
building, and shall be compatible with those of existing buildings in the immediate
area which conform to the general design theme noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a.,
1.b., and 2., above, as determined by the Plan Commission. (See Figures 2 and 3.)
40
6. Vertical Rhythms: Along Walworth
Avenue between Main Street and Fifth
Street, the floor heights on main façades
shall appear visually in proportion to those
of adjoining buildings. The rhythm of the
ground floor shall harmonize with the
rhythm of upper floors. The vertical
pattern of exterior building elements
formed by patterns of building openings
for windows and doors, and related
elements such as sills, headers, transoms,
cornices and sign bands shall be
compatible in design and elevation with
those of existing buildings in the immediate
area which conform to the general design
theme noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b.,
and 2., above, as determined by the Plan
Commission.

Figure 3
7. Roof Forms: Along Walworth Avenue between Main Street and Fifth Street, flat or
gently sloping roofs which are not visible from the street shall be used. Mansards or
other exotic roof shapes not characteristic of the general design theme noted in
Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as determined by the Plan Commission,
shall not be used. Throughout the District, roof shapes not characteristic of the
general design theme noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as
determined by the Plan Commission, shall not be used.
8. Exterior Materials: Selected building materials shall be compatible with those of existing
buildings in the immediate area which conform to the general design theme noted in
Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as determined by the Plan Commission. In
addition:
41
a. Masonry: Along Walworth Avenue between Main Street and Fifth Street, stone
or brick facing should be of even coloration and consistent size. Cinder block,
concrete block, concrete slab, or concrete panel shall not be permitted.
b. Siding: Along Walworth Avenue between Main Street and Fifth Street, wood or
thin board textured vinyl or textured metal clapboard siding may be appropriate –
particularly if the proposed non-masonry exterior was used on a building which
conforms to the general design theme noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and
2., above, as determined by the Plan Commission. In certain instances
clapboard, board and batten may be in keeping with the general design theme.
Asphalt shingles shall not be permitted.
c. Glazing: Along Walworth Avenue between Main Street and Fifth Street, clear, or
slightly tinted glass or related glazing material shall be used. Mirrored glass,
smoked glass, or heavily tinted glass shall not be permitted.
9. Exterior Surface Appurtenances: Exterior surface appurtenances shall be
compatible with those of existing buildings in the immediate area which conform to
the general design theme noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as
determined by the Plan Commission. In addition:
a. Along Walworth Avenue between Main Street and Fifth Street, the traditional
storefront design theme (characterized by strong horizontal and vertical rhythms
formed by building openings, storefront columns, storefront cornices, upper cornices,
kickplates, signbands, large display windows, and transom windows) shall be
employed for all new nonresidential buildings – including retail, office,
professional service, personal service, maintenance, lodging, entertainment, and
storage uses. (See Figure 3, above, and pages 15-18 of the Downtown Plan
Summary Concept Design Handbook for visual examples.)
b. Throughout the district, avoid cluttering building façades with brackets, wiring,
meter boxes, antennae, gutters, downspouts and other appurtenances.
Unnecessary signs shall also be avoided. Where necessary, such features shall
be colored so as to blend in, rather than contrast, with the immediately adjacent
building exterior. Extraneous ornamentation which is inconsistent with the
general design theme noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as
determined by the Plan Commission, is also prohibited.
c. Awnings: Throughout the district, awning size, color and placement should
complement the architectural character of the building, as determined by the
Plan Commission. Soft, weather-treated canvas or vinyl materials which allow
for flexible or fixed installation shall be used. Aluminum or suspended metal
canopies shall be prohibited. Signage applied to awnings shall be simple and
durable. Backlit awnings are prohibited.
10. Exterior Colors: Selected exterior colors for structures and appurtenances
including fixtures, but not including exterior signage which is regulated per
(9)(b)11., below, shall be compatible and harmonious with those of existing
buildings in the immediate area which conform to the general design theme
notes in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as determined by the Plan
Commission. Specifically, throughout the district: (C-735, 1/21/97)
a. Primary (red, blue, green, and yellow) colors, black, and fluorescent, "day
glow", and/or "neon" colors shall not be permitted. Where such colors
constitute a component of a standardized corporate theme or identity,
muted versions of such colors shall be used.
b. High gloss paints, lacquers, varnishes or other "shiny" non-glazing surfaces
shall not be used.
42
c. Color combination schemes shall be limited to no more than three different
colors for all the structures and appurtenances on a property. (Varying
shades, tints or intensities of a color shall count as a different color for this
purpose.)
d. Color schemes shall be used consistently throughout the property, including
on both the upper and lower portions of buildings, and on all façades of a
building or structure.
11. Exterior Signage: All signage which is visible from any point outside of the building or
structure shall be compatible and harmonious with the general design theme noted in
Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as determined by the Plan Commission.
Signage regulations are provided in Subchapter 23-8. In addition:

signs shall be regulated per Section 23.807 of this ordinance. (C-735, 1/21/97)
d. Group Development Signs: Group Development signs may be wall, projecting,
awning or freestanding signs. Such freestanding signs shall be limited to one per
lot, shall not exceed the height of the principle building on the subject property,
shall be limited in area to a maximum of one square foot of sign area for every
two feet of frontage along the public street located closest to the freestanding
sign, and shall in no instance exceed the area allocated in Table 23.806(6). The
base of freestanding signs shall be fully landscaped per the requirements of
Subsection 12. d. below. The supports of freestanding signs shall be
constructed of materials and in a style which is consistent with the materials and
style of the principle structure on the site, and with the Downtown Design
Guidelines of the Downtown Plan Summary Concept Design Handbook as
determined by the Plan Commission.
e. Sign Colors: Fluorescent shall not be permitted. Where, however, fluorescent
colors constitute a component of a standardized corporate theme or identify,
muted versions of such colors shall be used. Color combination schemes shall
be limited to no more than five different colors for all the structures and
appurtenances on a property. (Varying shades, tints or intensities of a color shall
count as a different color for this purpose.) Color schemes and lettering styles
shall be used consistently on all signage used throughout the property. (C-735,
1/21/97)
f. Sign Materials: Permitted sign materials include glass, plastic, wood, brass,
metal leaf, metal plates, canvass or related fabric, or etched glass, stone or
concrete. (C-735, 1/21/97)
g. Sign Illumination: Illumination of exterior signage shall be limited to shielded
spotlight. The lighting element of such fixtures shall not be visible from public
rights-of-way or adjoining properties. Flashing signs (including illuminated
awnings with or without messages) are not permitted, including neon and related
illumination systems.
43
h. Sign Location: Wall signs, canopy signs and projecting signs shall not be
located on any portion of upper stories. The location of signs shall fit the
building. (See Figure 4, below.)
Figure 4
i. Removal of Signs: Illegal nonconforming signs, poorly maintained signs, and
obsolete signs pertaining to a closed business, shall be removed. The property
owner shall be responsible for the removal of such signs.
12. On-Site Landscaping and Screening: On-site landscaping is not required within
portions of the Downtown Design Overlay Zoning District located along Walworth
Avenue between Main Street and Fifth Street, except to provide vegetated ground
cover for pervious (non-paved/roofed) surfaces, and to provide screening and shading
of on-site paved areas.
a. Groundcover: All areas which are not covered by impervious paving or structures shall be covered with vegetative groundcover. Appropriate groundcover includes grasses, forbs, and shrubs.
b. On-Site Paved Areas: On-site landscaping shall also be provided for on-site paved areas used for outdoor seating, vehicular parking, or loading, except for pedestrian and vehicle walks and drives which connect such areas to public rights-of-way (such as driveways and walks to building entrances).
i. Required Screening: On-site paved areas, including parking lots, loading
areas, circulation drives, and patios shall be partially screened from the view
of public rights-of-way and adjoining properties by, at minimum, a continuous
vegetated hedge with a minimum width of five feet, and a height of between
40 and 60 inches. This hedge may be supplemented by trees and/or
compatible iron, masonry, or wood fencing, and/or berming.
ii. Required Shading: In addition, one canopy tree (with a minimum installed
breast height caliper of 2½ inches) shall be provided within, or within five feet
of the edge of, on-site paved areas for every 2,000 square feet (or fraction
thereof) of paved area.
44
c. Exterior Storage and Utility Areas: Trash storage areas, air conditioning units, and related storage and utility areas and components shall be fully screened from the view of adjoining properties, public rights-of-way, and customer areas.
d. Freestanding Signs: The base of freestanding signs shall be fully concealed by plants to a minimum height of twenty-four inches.
e. Additional landscaping standards are found in Subchapter 23-6.
13. Exterior Lighting: Throughout the district, on-site exterior lighting shall be compatible
and harmonious with the general design theme noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b.,
and 2., above, as determined by the Plan Commission. Specifically:
a. Pedestrian Lighting: The design, color, height, location and light quality of on-site pedestrian lighting shall be consistent with the pedestrian lighting fixtures recommended as a component of Downtown Plan Summary Concept Design Handbook.
b. Vehicular Circulation Lighting: The design, color, height, location and light quality of on-site vehicular circulation lighting shall be consistent with the lighting fixtures recommended as a component of the Downtown Plan Summary Concept Design Handbook.
c. Additional lighting standards are found in Section 23.707.
14. Rehabilitation and Restoration: New projects, building additions, and new
appurtenances and features shall comply with the provisions of 1-13, above. The
following standards shall apply where existing construction is proposed for
rehabilitation and/or restoration:
a. In General (RC-354, 6/9/15): Buildings shall be restored relying on physical
evidence (such as photographs, original drawings, and existing architectural
details) to the extent possible and practicable, in keeping with the design themes
noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b. and 2., above, and the more specific standards
provided in Subsections i. through ix., below. In determining the extent possible
and practicable, the Plan Commission shall be guided by the recommendations
of City Staff, and may also seek the recommendations of outside experts in
historic preservation and building restoration. Specifically, throughout the
Downtown Design Overlay Zoning District:
i. Exterior Materials and Surface Features (RC-354, 6/9/15): Materials and
features identical to the original shall be used. Where such knowledge is
lacking, materials and features in common use at the time of building
erection, as determined by the Plan Commission, shall be used. Significant
architectural features, including cornices, moldings and coursings shall be
preserved or replaced with identical features and materials where possible
and practicable. The following potential flexibility may be considered for any
portion of a building façade that faces toward an interior side yard, rear yard,
or alley: Where an exterior material is deteriorating, or is at risk of deteriorating
significantly, the Plan Commission may grant approval to protect and conceal said exterior area with an approved exterior material which is similar in
appearance to a material found elsewhere on the building. Approved
exterior materials may include: thin-profile masonry; stucco or EIFS
equivalent; wood siding or cement board, smart board; thick vinyl equivalent;
modern exterior metals, glass and acrylics; and wood, cement, and composite
composite equivalents for cornices, lintels, pilasters, and other exterior
details.
ii. Windows and Doors: The size, proportion and rhythm of original windows
and doors shall not be altered. Original window and door openings shall not
be blocked, except with a dark opaque panel placed behind the window or
door to preserve the appearance of the opening. Where now blocked in
another manner, blocked window and doors shall be restored using said
45
method. Window and door features, including lintels, sills, architraves,
shutters, pediments, hoods and hardware, shall be preserved where possible,
or replaced with identical features and materials. Dark frames (ie. anodized
bronze) shall be used to replace storefront and upper story windows. Clear
aluminum finishes and mill finish aluminum storm windows are prohibited.
Real shutters and awnings shall be used if there is evidence that they were a
component of the original building design. Vinyl and plastic shutters and
awnings shall be prohibited.
iii. Shop Fronts: Shop fronts should fit inside the original shop front in terms of
all three dimensions (vertical, horizontal and front to back articulation);
iv. Display Windows: Display windows should be restored to their original
appearance.
v. Entrances and Porches: Original porches and steps shall be retained,
except as required to meet accessibility standards. Porches, steps and
related enclosures which do not comply with the architectural design theme,
as determined by the Plan Commission, shall be removed.
vi. Roofs: The original roof shape and character of visible materials shall be
retained. Original architectural features which give the roof its essential
character, including dormer windows, cupolas, cornices, brackets, chimneys
and weathervanes, shall be preserved if in keeping with the architectural
design theme as determined by the Plan Commission.
vii. Painting and Color: See Subsection (b) 10., above.
viii. Signage: Any and all signage, existing upon the adoption date of this
Ordinance, which does not comply with the standards of Subsection (b) 11.,
above may be continued so long as well maintained. However, the
maintenance of such legal nonconforming signs shall be limited to repair of
the sign structural or lighting elements, and to the repainting or replacement
of the sign face with identical new material, message, and original
appearance. Should a change in material, message, or original appearance
be desired, the legal nonconforming sign shall be removed.
ix. Cleaning: Structural components and exterior materials shall be cleaned when
necessary, and with only the gentlest possible methods. Low pressure water and
soft natural bristle brushes are acceptable. Sandblasting is never acceptable.
Other methods shall be pre-approved by the Plan Commission.
(c) Residential Construction: Proposed residential construction, located on properties
having frontage on Walworth Avenue between Beloit Street and Seventh Street,
including new structures, building additions, building alterations, and restoration or
rehabilitation shall be reviewed per Section (5) above and shall correspond to the
Downtown Design Guidelines of the Downtown Plan Summary Concept Design
Handbook as determined by the Plan Commission. The building setback, height,
mass, roof form, exterior materials, exterior surface appurtenances, exterior colors,
landscaping and lighting shall be compatible and harmonious with the general
design theme noted in Subsection (9)(a)1.a., 1.b., and 2., above, as determined by
the Plan Commission.
(d) Designated Historic Structures (Reserved.)

Section 24.914 Planned Infill Development District Procedures
(1) Purpose
(a) The purpose of this Section is to provide regulations which govern the procedure
and requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of proposed Planned Infill
Developments, and to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development
standards pertaining to the underlying standard zoning district.
(b) Planned Infill Developments are intended to provide more incentives for infill
development and redevelopment in areas of the community which are experiencing
a lack of significant reinvestment. Furthermore, Planned Infill Developments are
designed to forward both the aesthetic and economic development objectives of the
City by controlling the site design and the appearance, density or intensity of
development in terms of more flexible requirements for land uses, density, intensity,
bulk, landscaping, and parking requirements. In exchange for such flexibility, the
Planned Infill Development shall provide a much higher level of site design,
architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than
normally required for other developments.
(c) Planned Infill Developments have the potential to create undesirable impacts on
nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this
Title. In addition to such potential, Planned Infill Developments also have the
potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially cannot
be determined except with a binding site plan, landscape plan and architectural plan,
and on a case by case basis. In order to prevent this from occurring, all Planned
Infill Developments are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable
only to Planned Infill Developments, in addition to the general requirements of this
Title. A public hearing process is required to review a request for a Planned Infill
Development. This process shall essentially combine the process for a zoning map
amendment with that required for a conditional use, with several additional
requirements.
(2) Provision of Flexible Development Standards for Planned Infill Developments
(a) Permitted Location: Planned Infill Developments shall be permitted with the approval of
a Planned Infill Development Overlay Zoning District, specific to the approved Planned
Infill Development, within the Residential Single Family (RS-3), Residential Mixed
(RM-8), Residential Multi-family (RM-12), Office Neighborhood (ON), Business Local
(BL), Business Central (BC), Manufacturing General (MG), Manufacturing Heavy
(MH), Manufacturing Light (ML), Office Park (ON), Business Neighborhood (BN), and
Business Regional (BR) Zoning Districts. (RC-159, 6/10/03)
(b) Flexible Development Standards: The following exemptions to the development
standards of the underlying zoning district may be provided with the approval of a
Planned Infill Development:
1. Land Use Requirements: All land uses listed as "Residential", "Institutional",
or "Commercial" in Section 23.203, and permitted in the base zoning district,
may be permitted within a Planned Infill Development.
2. Density and Intensity Requirements: All requirements listed in Sections
23.304 and 23.305 for residential density and nonresidential intensity may be
waived within a Planned Infill Development.
3. Bulk Requirements: All requirements listed in Sections 23.403, 23.404, 23.405,
23.406 and 23.407 may be waived within a Planned Infill Development.
4. Landscaping Requirements: All requirements listed in Sections 23.604,
23.605, 23.606, 23.607, 23.608, 23.609 and 23.610 may be waived within a
Planned Infill Development.
5. Parking and Loading Requirements: All requirements listed in Sections
23.704 and 23.705 may be waived within a Planned Infill Development.
48
(c) Requirements to Depict All Aspects of Development: Only development which is
explicitly depicted on the required site plan approved by the Common Council as
part of the approved Planned Infill Development, shall be permitted, even if such
development (including all aspects of land use, density and intensity, bulk,
landscaping, and parking and loading), is otherwise listed as permitted in Section
23.403-23.407. Requested exemptions from these standards shall be made explicit
by the Applicant in the application, and shall be recommended by the Plan Commission and approved explicitly by the Common Council. If not so requested and approved, such exemptions shall not be permitted.
(3) Initiation of Request for Approval of a Planned Infill Development: Proceedings for
approval of a Planned Infill Development shall be initiated by:
(a) an application of the owner(s) of the subject property;
(b) a recommendation of the Plan Commission; or
(c) by action of the Common Council.
(4) Application Requirements: All applications for proposed Planned Infill Developments,
regardless of the party of their initiation per (3) above, shall be approved as complete by
the Zoning Administrator a minimum of two weeks prior to the initiation of this procedure.
The Zoning Administrator shall forward copies of said complete application to the office of
the City Clerk. Said application shall apply to each of the process steps in (5) through (8)
below.
(5) PID Process Step 1: Pre-Application Conference
(a) The Applicant shall contact the Zoning Administrator to place an informal discussion
item for the PID on the Plan Commission agenda.
(b) No details beyond the name of the Applicant and the identification of the discussion
item as a PID is required to be given in the agenda.
(c) At the Plan Commission meeting, the Applicant shall engage in an informal
discussion with the Plan Commission regarding the potential PID. Appropriate topics
for discussion may include the location of the PID, general project themes and
images, the general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses being considered,
approximate residential densities and non-residential intensities, the general
treatment of natural features, the general relationship to nearby properties and public
streets, and relationship to the Master Plan.
(d) Points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the process shall be in no
way be binding upon the Applicant or the City, but should be considered as the
informal, non-binding basis for proceeding to the next step.
(6) PID Process Step 2: Concept Plan
(a) The Applicant shall provide the Zoning Administrator with a draft PID Concept Plan
Submittal Packet for a determination of completeness prior to placing the proposed
PID on the Plan Commission agenda for Concept Plan review. This submittal packet
shall contain all of the following items, prior to its acceptance by the Zoning
Administrator and placement of the item on a Plan Commission agenda for Concept
Plan review:
1. A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at 11" x 17", as depicted
on a copy of the City of Delavan Land Use Plan Map;
2. A general written description of proposed PID including:
a. general project themes and images;
b. the general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses;
49
c. approximate residential densities and non-residential intensities as
described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio and impervious
surface area ratio;
d. the general treatment of natural features;
e. the general relationship to nearby properties and public streets;
f. the general relationship of the project to the Master Plan;
g. an initial draft list of zoning standards which will not be met by the
proposed PID and the location(s) in which they apply and, a complete
list of zoning standards which will be more than met by the proposed
PID and the location(s) in which they apply. Essentially, the purpose
of this listing shall be to provide the Plan Commission with information
necessary to determine the relative merits of the project in regard to
private benefit versus public benefit, and in regard to the mitigation of
potential adverse impacts created by design flexibility; and,
3. A written description of potentially requested exemption from the requirements
of the underlying zoning district, in the following order:
a. Land Use Exemptions;
b. Density and Intensity Exemptions;
c. Bulk Exemptions;
d. Landscaping Exceptions;
e. Parking and Loading Requirements Exceptions;
4. A conceptual plan drawing (at 11" x 17") of general land use layout and
general location of major public streets and/or private drives. Applicant may
submit copies of a larger version of the plan in addition to the 11" x 17"
reduction.
(b) Within ten working days of receiving the draft PID Concept Plan Submittal Packet,
the Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the submittal is complete. Once
the Zoning Administrator has received a complete packet, the proposed PID
Concept Plan shall be placed on the Plan Commission agenda.
(c) At the Plan Commission meeting, the Applicant shall engage in an informal
discussion with the Plan Commission regarding the conceptual PID. Appropriate
topics for discussion may include any of the information provided in the PID
Concept Plan Submittal Packet, or other items as determined by the Plan
Commission.
(d) Points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the process shall in no
way be binding upon Applicant or the City, but should be considered as informal,
non-binding basis for proceeding to the next step. The preferred procedure is for
one or more iterations of Plan Commission review of the Concept Plan to occur
prior to introduction of the formal rezoning petition which accompanies GDP
application.
(7) PID Process Step 3: General Development Plan (GDP)
(a) The Applicant shall provide the Zoning Administrator with a draft GDP Plan
Submittal Packet for a determination of completeness prior to placing the proposed
GDP on the Plan Commission agenda for GDP review. This submittal packet shall
contain all of the following items, prior to its acceptance by the Zoning Administrator
and placement of the item on a Plan Commission agenda for GDP review:
1. A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at 11" x 17", as depicted
on a copy of the City of Delavan Land Use Plan Map;
50
2. A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the planned infill
development is proposed, and all other lands within 300 feet of the boundaries of
the subject property, together with the names and addresses of the owners of all
lands on said map as the same appear on the current records of the Register of
Deeds of Walworth County (as provided by the City of Delavan). Said map shall
clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the
jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and
attachments shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a
photocopier, and shall be at a scale which is not less than one inch equals 800
feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow
shall be provided;
3. A general written description of proposed PID including:
a. general project themes and images;
b. the general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses;
c. approximate residential densities and non-residential intensities as
described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio and impervious
surface area ratio;
d. the general treatment of natural features;
e. the general relationship to nearby properties and public streets;
f. the general relationship of the project to the Master Plan,
g. a Statement of Rationale as to why PID zoning is proposed. This shall
identify barriers that the Applicant perceives in the form of
requirements of standard zoning districts and opportunities for
community betterment the Applicant suggests are available through
