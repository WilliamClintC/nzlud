EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adaption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self- identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Fairmont City Code was either
ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the City Code without any history indicate that
such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In the
following table, the disposition of all source material in the Fairmont City
Code is indicated.

subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title. The enacting clause
shall be “the City of Fairmont hereby ordains ............” .  Any ordinance
which repeals or amends an existing ordinance or part of the City Code shall
set out in full the ordinance, sections, or subsections to be repealed or
amended, and shall include the matter to be omitted by enclosing it in brackets
or by strikeout type and shall indicate new matter by underscoring or by
italics.
   (b)    Procedure.  An ordinance may be introduced by any member at any
regular or special meeting of the Council. Upon introduction of any ordinance,
the City Clerk shall read fully and distinctly the proposed ordinance in its
entirety. When the introducer of an ordinance considers it to be of such
technical nature, or of such length that the intent will be more fully
understood in synopsis form the Council member may request the Clerk to read
the synopsis in lieu of the entire ordinance. Provided however, the ordinance
will be read in its entirety instead of in synopsis upon request of the
majority of the Council members present. The City Clerk shall distribute a copy
to each Council member and to the Manager, shall file a reasonable number of
copies in the office of the City Clerk, and shall publish the ordinance
together with a notice setting out the time and place for a public hearing
thereon and for its consideration by the Council. At the commencement of the
public hearing the Clerk shall read the title only of the proposed ordinance,
unless a request is made by any person present at the public hearing that the
proposed ordinance be read, upon which request the Clerk shall read fully and
distinctly the proposed ordinance in its entirety. Copies of the proposed
ordinance shall be made available to those in attendance at the public hearing.
The public hearing shall follow the publication by at least seven days, may be
held separately or in connection with a regular or special Council meeting and
may be adjourned from time to time; all persons interested shall have an
opportunity to be heard. After the hearing, the Council may adopt the ordinance
with or without amendment or reject it, but if it is amended as to any matter
of substance, the Council may not adopt it until the ordinance or its amended

ordinance shall be published and printed as prescribed for other adopted
ordinances. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it
may specify. Every emergency ordinance except one made pursuant to subsection
5.09 (b) shall automatically stand repealed as of the 61st day following the
date on which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent re-enactment of the
ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still
exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing
ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of
emergency ordinances.
SECTION 2.15  Codes of Technical Regulations.
   The Council may adopt any standard code of technical regulations by
reference thereto  in an adopting ordinance. The procedure and requirements

to include copies of the code of technical regulations as well as of the
adopting ordinance, and

ordinance and resolution having the force and effect of law and each amendment
to this Charter to be copied promptly following its adoption, and the said

times thereafter, the ordinances, resolutions and Charter amendments shall be
reproduced in substantially the same style as the Code currently in effect and
shall be suitable in form for integration therein. The Council shall make such
further arrangements  as it deems desirable with respect to reproduction and
distribution of any current changes in or additions to the provisions of the

   The City Manager shall have the power to fill all vacancies.  A person

105.04  PERSONNEL RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The personnel rules and regulations proposed by the City Manager having been
seen and inspected, are hereby adopted by reference.  These rules provide for,
and shall continue to provide for, notwithstanding any amendment:
   (a)   The classification of all City positions, based on the duties,

City service which are not specifically placed in the exempt service by the
personnel rules and regulations. These rules shall cover all employees in the
classified service.
   Although the employees in the exempt service are not conditionally subject
to these rules, they shall be considered regular employees and shall be covered
by all except where, by virtue of their content, they would logically be
construed as concerning only the classified service.
   Pursuant to Section
3.04 (6) of the City Charter, the rules may, from time to time, be amended only
by proposal of the City Manager, and may be adopted by ordinance.
   Any officer, employee or citizen who feels that the rules are working or are
apt to work any unnecessary hardship on him, or that the efficiency of the City
service can be improved by amendment to the rules and regulations, may consult
with the City Manager and be granted a hearing. Employees of the City, however,
shall be governed in their actions by the grievance procedures hereinafter
established.
   Any employee holding a position at the time this section takes effect, or
when the Charter took effect, who was serving in the same or comparable
position after the adoption hereof, shall not be subject to competitive tests

107.01  DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials
and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that
governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and
that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In
recognition of these goals there is hereby established a code of ethics for all
officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The
purpose of this code, hereinafter referred to as "this article", is to
establish ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by
setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best
interest of the City and by directing disclosure of such officials and
employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the
City. The provisions and the purpose of this article and such rules and
regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best
interest of the City.
(Ord. 471. Passed 8-1-78.)
107.02  RESPONSIBILITIES OF PUBLIC OFFICE.
   Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office
for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the
United States and the Constitution of the State of West Virginia and to carry
out impartially the laws of the nation, State, and Municipality and thus to
foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe in their acts the
highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their
office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public
interest shall be their primary concern. Their conduct in both their official
and private affairs should be above reproach. (Ord. 471. Passed 8-1-78.)
107.03  AVOIDANCE OF IMPRESSION OF CORRUPTIBILITY.
   Public officials and employees, whether appointed or elected, full-time or
part-time, paid or unpaid, should conduct their official duties with integrity,
impartiality and in the public interest. They also should conduct both their
official and private affairs so as not to give a reasonable basis for the
impression that any such official or employee can be improperly influenced in
the performance of his/her official duties. Such officials or employees should
so conduct themselves as to maintain public confidence in their performance of
their public trust and in the government they represent. They should not be a
source of embarrassment to that government and should avoid even the appearance
of conflict between their public duties and private interest.
(Ord. 471. Passed 8-1-78.)
107.04  DEDICATED SERVICE.
   All officials and employees of the City should be loyal to the political
objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain
those objectives. Appointive officials and employees should adhere to the rules
of work performance established as the standard for their positions by the
appropriate authority.
   Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law
or ask others to do so, and should work in full cooperation with other public
officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by officially
recognized confidentiality of their work. 
(Ord. 471. Passed 8-1-78.)
107.05  FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT.
   (a)    Interest in Appointments.  Canvassing of members of Council, directly
or indirectly, in order to obtain preferential consideration in connection with
any appointment to the Municipal service shall disqualify the candidate for
appointment except with reference to positions filled by appointment by
Council.
   (b)    Use of Public Property.  No official or employee shall request or
permit the use of City-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for
personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the
public generally or are provided as Municipal policy for the use of such
officials or employees in the conduct of official business or except as may
otherwise be provided specifically by Council.
   (c)    Obligation to Residents.  No official or employee shall grant any
special consideration, treatment or advantage to any resident beyond that which
is available to every other resident.
   (d)    Discrimination in Appointments.  No person shall be appointed to or
removed from, or in any way favored or discriminated against with respect to
any appointive administrative office because of his/her race, religion, sex,
national origin or political opinions or affiliations, if otherwise qualified
for the position or office. However, this provision does not impair
administrative discretion in determining the requirements of a position or in a
job assignment of a person holding such position, subject to review by the
merit system authority established for that purpose.
   (e)    Ex Parte Communications.  No official or employee should encourage,
make or accept any ex parte or other unilateral application or communication
that excludes the interest of other parties in a matter under consideration
when such application or communication is designed to influence official
decision or conduct or the official himself, herself or other officials,
employees or agencies in order to obtain favored treatment or special
consideration to advance the personal or private interest of himself/herself or
others. The purpose of this provision is to guarantee that all interested
parties to any matter have equal opportunity to express and represent their
interests. Any written ex parte communication received by an official or
employee in matters where all interested parties should have equal opportunity
for a hearing should be made part of the record by the recipient.
   An oral ex parte communication received under such conditions should be
written down in substance by the recipient and also made part of the record.
   A communication concerning only the status of a pending matter is not
regarded as an ex parte communication.
(Ord. 471. Passed 8-1-78.)
107.06  CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   No Council member or other official or employee, whether paid or unpaid,
shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or other
personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper
discharge of his/her official duties in the public interest or would tend to
impair his/her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his/her
official duties. Personal, as distinguished from financial, interest includes
an interest arising from blood or marriage relationships or close business or
political association.
   Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated below for the guidance of
officials and employees:
   (a)    Incompatible employment: holding a position in addition to a public
position which interferes, or may interfere, with the proper discharge of the
public duty. No Council member or other official or employee shall engage in or
accept  private employment or render services for private interests when such
employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his/her
official duties or would tend to impair his/her independence of judgment or
action in the performance of his/her official duties.
   (b)    Use of confidential information obtained as a result of public
position for personal gain.
No Council member or other official or employee shall, without proper legal
authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, 
government or affairs of the City. Nor shall he/she use such information to
advance the financial or other private interest of himself/herself or others. 
   (c)    Acceptance of or soliciting of gifts and favors by a public official
or employees. No Council member or other official or employee shall accept any
valuable gift, whether in the form of service, loan, thing or promise, from any
person, firm  or corporation which to his/her knowledge is interested directly
or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the City; nor
shall any such official or employee accept any gift, favor or thing of value
that may tend to influence him/her in the discharge of his/her duties, or grant
in the discharge of his/her duties any improper favor, service or thing of
value.
   (d)    Any use of official position for personal gain.
   (e)    Holding investments which interfere, or tend to interfere, with the
proper discharge of public duty.
   (f)   Representation by public officials or employees of private interests
before government agencies, courts or legislative bodies, and participation in
the profits from such representation. No Council member or other official or
employee whose salary is paid in whole or in part by the City shall appear in
behalf of private interests before any agency of the City. He/she shall not
represent private interest in any action or proceedings against the interests
of the City in any litigation to which the City is a party. A Council member
may appear before City agencies on behalf of constituents in the course of his/
her duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of
public or civic obligation. However, no Council member or other official or
employee shall accept a retainer or compensation that is contingent upon a
specific action by a City agency. 
   (g)    Participation in transaction as a public representative with a
business entity in which the public official or employee has a direct or
indirect financial or other personal interest.
   (h)    Personal interest in legislation to the extent that private interest
takes precedence over public interest and public duty. A Council member who has
a financial interest, and who participates in discussion with or gives an
official opinion to Council, shall disclose on the records of Council or other
appropriate authority the nature and extent of such interest.
   (i)    Entry into contracts or other conduct of business for profit by a
business in which a public official or employee has a substantial or
controlling interest, especially when the public official or employee can
influence such contract or business because of his public position. Any Council
member or other official or employee who has a substantial or controlling
financial interest in any business entity, transaction or services to the City,
shall make known to the proper authority such interest in any matter on which
he/she may be called to act in his/her official capacity. He/she shall refrain
from voting upon or otherwise participating in the transaction or the making of
such contract or sale. A Council member or other official or employee shall not
be deemed interested in any contract or purchase or sale of land or other thing
of value unless such contract or sale is approved, awarded, entered into or
authorized by him/her in his official capacity.
   (j)    Soliciting or accepting future employment with a business with the
government over which the public official has some control in his/her official
capacity at the time of the transaction.
      (Ord. 471. Passed 8-1-78.)
107.07  POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
   No appointed official or employee in the administrative service shall use
the prestige of his/her position in behalf of any political party.
   No appointed official or employee in the administrative service shall
orally, by letter, or otherwise, solicit or be in any manner concerned in
soliciting any assessment, subscription or contribution to any political party;
nor shall he/she be a party to such solicitation by others. Such appointed
officials and employees shall not take an active part in local partisan
political campaigns for local (City) candidates.
   No official or employee, whether elected or appointed, shall promise an
appointment to any Municipal position as a reward for any political activity.
(Ord. 471. Passed 8-1-78.)
107.08  APPLICABILITY.
   When a Council member or other official or employee has doubt as to the
applicability of a provision of this article to a particular situation, he/she
should apply to the Board of Ethics for an advisory opinion and be guided by
that opinion when given. The Council member or other official or employee shall
have the opportunity to present his/her interpretation of the facts at issue
and of the applicable provision(s) of this article before such advisory
decision is made. This article shall be operative in all instances covered by
its provisions except when superseded by an applicable statutory or Charter
provision and statutory or Charter action is mandatory, or when the application
of a statutory or Charter provision is discretionary but determined to be more
appropriate or desirable.
(Ord. 471. Passed 8-1-78.)
107.09  BOARD OF ETHICS.
   (a)    There is hereby established a Board of Ethics consisting of three
members  appointed by the City Manager with approval of Council. There shall be
two public  members, in whose selection the City Manager shall take care to
appoint persons unlikely to use the Board for partisan political ends. One
member shall be appointed to serve only in the consideration of cases of
alleged violation of this article involving persons in the regular member's
department or agency.
   (b)    The members shall serve staggered three-year terms, with one position
falling vacant on December 31 each year. 
   (c)    Two members of the Board shall constitute a quorum and affirmative
vote by a majority of the entire membership of the Board shall be necessary for
any action. Members may not nominate an alternate or representative to attend
meetings or vote in their behalf. Members of the Board shall serve without
salary but shall be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses incurred
in the performance of their duties.
   (d)    The powers and duties of the Board shall be as follows:
      (1)    Initiating actions.

appointed official or employee of the City, and the Board shall conduct an
investigation.

writing an advisory opinion from the Board with respect to the scope,
applicability and interpretation of this article, and the Board shall respond.
         C.   Any elected or appointed official or employee who wishes to
ascertain in advance whether a particular personal action contemplated by
himself or herself or a subordinate might be a violation of this article may
request in writing an advisory opinion from the Board, and the Board shall
respond.
      (2)    Conduct of actions.
         A.    The Board may conduct hearings prior to rendering an opinion or
report in any particular matter. The Board shall conduct hearings whenever an
official or City employee who may be substantially affected by the opinion or
report in the matter requests in writing a hearing. Hearings shall be informal
and private, and shall be conducted by a quorum of the Board.
         B.    All parties shall have the right to be represented by legal

member of his or her immediate family, have no knowledge.
Failure to report the holdings of or the source of income of any trust referred

certified public accountant, a broker or an investment adviser, who (in the
case of a financial institution or investment company, any officer or employee
involved in the management or control of the trust):
         A.   Is independent of or unassociated with any interested party so
that the trustee cannot be controlled or influenced in the administration of
the trust by any interested party;

      (2)   Any asset transferred to the trust by an interested party is free
of any restriction with respect to its transfer or sale unless such restriction
is expressly approved by the Ethics Commission;
      (3)   The trust instrument which establishes the trust provides that:
         A.   Except to the extent provided in subsection (c)(3)F. hereof, the
trustee in the exercise of this authority and discretion to manage and control

         B.   The trust shall not contain any asset the holding of which by an

party in the trust or the net income or loss of the trust or any reports
necessary to enable the interested party to complete an individual tax return
required by law, but such report shall not identify any asset or holding;
         F.   Except for communications which solely consist of requests for
distribution of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust, there shall be
no direct or indirect communication between the trustee and an interested party
with respect to the trust unless such communication is in writing and unless it
relates only:
            1.   To the general financial interest and needs of the interested
party (including, but not limited to, an interest in maximizing income or long
term capital gain);
            2.   To the notification of the trustee of a law or regulation
subsequently applicable to the reporting individual which prohibits the
interested party from holding an asset, which notification directs that the
asset not be held by the trust; or
            3.   To directions to the trustee to sell all of an asset initially
placed in the trust by an interested party which in the determination of the
reporting individual creates a conflict of interest or the appearance thereof
due to the subsequent assumption of duties by the reporting individual (but
nothing herein shall require any such direction); and
         G.   The interested parties shall make no effort to obtain information
with respect to the holdings of the trust, including obtaining a copy of any
trust tax return filed or any information relating thereto except as otherwise

117.01  INTRODUCTION.
   It is the intent of this plan to make a commitment toward insuring equal
opportunity for all residents and to provide atmosphere for achievement and
advancement based upon the major criteria of quality of performance.
(Ord. 909.  Passed 12-8-92.)
117.02  LEGAL BACKGROUND.
   There are three major federal laws and one executive order that delineate
the legal requirements which companies must meet to comply with equal
employment regulations.  They are:
   (a)   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964;
   (b)   Equal Pay Act of 1963;
   (c)   Age Discrimination in Employment Act;
   (d)   Executive Order 11246.
 
   State and local governments had previously been exempt from Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
was amended by the Equal Employment Act.  By this act, public employment is
subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   Affirmative action does not mean giving preferential treatment to minority
groups or women.  Reinforcement of merit employment concepts is the goal of
this affirmative action plan, so that anyone may have the opportunity to enter
this work force on the basis of open competition or to advance in this work
force according to their relative abilities.
   This plan accomplishes this goal in a positive and constructive manner by
eliminating barriers which hinder equal employment opportunity such as
inadequate advertising of job openings, inadequate opportunity for advancement,
testing procedures which lack validity or unrealistic job requirements.
   Therefore, the development, implementation and regular evaluation of this
affirmative action plan is one way by which equal opportunity is provided to
all residents.
(Ord. 909.  Passed 12-8-92.)
117.03  POLICY STATEMENT.
   The City is committed to the concept of equal employment opportunity.  The
City has both a legal and moral responsibility to remove barriers which exclude
any one person or any groups of persons from enjoying equal employment or free
access to any public facilities.
   Therefore, it shall be the policy of the City to eliminate discrimination on
the basis of race, religion, sex, national origin, age or handicap in
employment and all matters related to employment including pay rate increases,
promotions, transfers, terminations, disciplinary actions and layoff
procedures.
(Ord. 909.  Passed 12-8-92.)
117.04  IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Appointment of Affirmative Action Officer.  At the adoption of this
plan, the City shall appoint an Affirmative Action Officer (AAO).
 
   (b)   Appointment of Affirmative Action Committee.  Within thirty days from
adoption of this plan, the City Manager shall appoint an Affirmative Action
Committee (AAC).  The Affirmative Action Committee shall provide assistance and
advice to the AAO and Council on all matters relating to this plan.
 
   (c)   Analysis of Work Force.  Within sixty days from adoption of this plan,
the AAO shall prepare and present to the City Manager and AAC an analysis of
utilization of minorities, women and handicapped persons in the various job
classifications in the present work force.  If this analysis reveals that these
groups are underutilized, the AAO, in conjunction with the  AAC and City
Manager, shall develop strategy for correcting underutilization within thirty
days after the analysis is submitted.  This strategy shall be disseminated to
all departments for implementation.
 
   (d)   Annual Updating of Work Force Analysis.  Not less often than annually,

179.05  ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGN REVIEW.
   (a)   Before any certificate of appropriateness may be issued in any of the
circumstances hereinafter enumerated, the Historic Preservation Review
Commission shall submit a proposal to the City of Fairmont Planning Commission
for the establishment of design review in an historic district, or any part
thereof, which district has been established in accordance with the provisions
of Section
178.04 of this Article, which proposal shall be in form similar to a request
for a zoning map amendment.  The Planning Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the proposal to establish design review in such historic district or
part thereof and any proposed regulations and requirements applicable thereto. 
Notice of the hearing shall be published at least two (2) times in the
principal newspaper of general circulation within the municipality in which the
properties to be designated are located; and written notice of the hearing
shall be mailed by certified mail with signed return receipt required to the
owners and occupants of such properties.  All the notices shall be published or
mailed not less than ten (10) nor more than (20) days prior to the date set for
the public hearing.  Following the public hearing, unless fifty percent of the
ownership interests in the territory to be subject to design review object to
the establishment of design review or the regulations and requirements within
thirty days following the public hearing, the Planning Commission may 
recommend to Council for the City of Fairmont the establishment of design
review for the historic district or such part thereof as may have been
proposed, and may recommend the approval, amendment or rejection of the
proposed regulations or requirements.
   (b)   If design review is proposed for more than one historic district, a
separate proposal and public hearing shall be held for each historic district.
   (c)   Council may, as in the case of an amendment to the zoning map, act
upon said recommendations. 
   (d)   If Council, by ordinance, adopts the recommendations of the Planning
Commission regarding said proposal to establish design review in an historic
district or any portion thereof, the boundaries of the district subject to
design review shall be indicated on the Official Zoning Map for the City of
Fairmont. 
   (e)   Within thirty days following the adoption of the aforementioned
ordinance,  the owners and occupants of each property subject to design review
shall be given written notification of the establishment of design review  by
the Council for the City of Fairmont, which notice shall apprise said owners
and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness
from  the Historic Preservation Review Commission prior to undertaking any
material change within an historic district or so much thereof as has been
subject to design review.   
(Ord. 1280.  Passed 8-24-04.)
179.06  CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   The Historic Preservation Review Commission shall exercise authority to
issue a certificate of appropriateness to regulate the erection, modification,
alteration, management, and restoration, demolition or removal of buildings,
sites or structures within an historic district or individually designated as
an historic landmark in accordance with the following provisions:
   No private building, site or structure shall be erected, modified, altered,
managed, restored, demolished or removed until after an application for a
certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been
submitted to and approved by the Historic Preservation Review Commission in
accordance with rules, regulations and standards set out on the matrix entitled
“WORK REQUIRING CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS” appended to and made a part of
this ordinance.  “Exterior architectural features” shall include such portion
of the exterior of a structure as is open to view from a public street, way or
place.  Similarly, if earthworks  of historical or archaeological importance
exist in the historic district there shall be no excavating or moving of earth,
rock or subsoil or any development upon or around earthworks without a
certificate of appropriateness.  The style, material, size and location of
outdoor advertising signs and bill posters shall be under the control of such
commission. 
   (a)   The Historic Preservation Review Commission may review all plans,
elevations, specifications, drawings, photographs, and other information as may
be reasonably deemed necessary by the Commission to enable it to make a
determination on the application for the certificate of appropriateness.
   (b)   The Historic Preservation Review Commission shall hold a public
hearing upon each application for a certificate of appropriateness.  Notice of
time and place of said hearing shall be given by publication in a newspaper

seven (7) days before such hearing and by posting notice on or near the main
entreat of any hall or room where the commission usually meets.  The Commission
shall take action as required to inform the owners of any property likely to be
affected by the application and shall give the applicant and such owners an
opportunity to be heard.
   (c)   The Historic Preservation Review Commission shall approve or reject an
application for a certificate of appropriateness within forty-five days after
filing of an application.  Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of
appropriateness issued by the Commission.  The certificate should be signed by
the chairman, and transmitted to the Building Inspector for the City of
Fairmont.  Said Commission shall keep a record of all Certificate of
Appropriateness issued. The failure of the Historic Preservation  Review
Commission to approve or disapprove an application within forty-five days from
the date of application, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant
and said Commission, shall be deemed to constitute approval and the applicant
shall be authorized  to proceed  without regard to a certificate of
appropriateness.
   (d)   In passing upon the appropriateness of a proposed action, the Historic
Preservation Review Commission shall consider, in addition to any other
pertinent factors, the historical and architectural integrity and significance;
architectural style; design; arrangement; texture and materials of exterior
architectural features; and the relationship and general compatibility thereof
to the historical value and exterior architectural style and pertinent features
of other structures in the surrounding area.
   (e)   The Historic Preservation Review Commission shall not consider
interior arrangement or use, but shall consider with relationship of the
exterior of the building or structure concerned with all others in the historic
preservation district, so as to avoid incongruity and to preserve the overall
character of the area.  New buildings need not necessarily be in any one
historical style, as long as the scale and design of the building, and the
materials used, are in harmony with the overall character of the historic area.
   (f)   The Historic Preservation Review Commission shall approve the
application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the
proposed action would be appropriate.  In the event said commission rejects an
application, such commission shall place upon its records and shall transmit a
record of such action and reasons therefore, in writing, to the applicant.  In
such written record, the commission may make recommendations relative to
design, arrangement, texture, material and similar features.  The applicant, if
he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the
application at any time after doing so.

prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to a
fair determination of whether a permit should be issued.  Applications shall be
filed not less than five days before the time intended for such parade,
procession or assemblage.
   The permit may be refused or canceled if:
   (a)   The time, place, size or conduct of the parade including the assembly
areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
   (b)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of police
officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and areas
contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the Municipality.
   (c)   The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
   (d)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for which

   (e)   The information contained in the application is found to be false,
misleading or incomplete in any material detail.

route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which
may be used or occupied.

portion thereof except drivers of vehicles having business or whose residence
are within such closed area, and then any such driver shall exercise the
greatest care in driving upon any such street or highway or portion thereof.
(1968 Code §15-14)
311.05  PROHIBITION OF OPERATION AND USE OF MOTORIZED RECREATIONAL APPARATUS.
   (a)   Definition.  For the purpose of this section, the term “motorized
recreational apparatus” shall include but not be limited to the following: all
terrain vehicle (ATV) as defined by West Virginia Code 17A-1-1(ii); go-cart;
golf cart; unregistered off road motorized dirt bike, whether two or three
wheeled, snowmobile as defined by West Virginia Code 17A-1- 1(mm); or, given
the City’s terrain and climate, any other such motorized apparatus which would
appear to be used for the principal purpose of recreation and not for the
general transportation of persons or goods.
   (b)   Prohibition.
(1)   No person shall operate, ride upon or use any motorized recreational
apparatus for transportation or recreational purposes, within or upon the
public streets, roads, alleys, ways, sidewalks and crosswalks or upon any other
real property, which is publicly owned, leased or controlled, within the
corporate limits of the City of Fairmont.
      (2)   No person shall knowingly permit another person to operate, ride
upon or use any motorized recreational apparatus for transportation or
recreational purposes, within or upon the public streets, roads, alleys, ways,
sidewalks and crosswalks, or upon any other real property, which is publicly
owned, leased or controlled, within the corporate limits of the City of
Fairmont.
      (3)   A parent, custodian or guardian of a minor commits an offense
hereunder if said parent, custodian or guardian knowingly permits or by
insufficient control allows said minor to operate, ride upon or use any
motorized recreational apparatus for transportation or recreational purposes,
within or upon the public streets, roads, alleys, ways, sidewalks and
crosswalks or upon any other real property, which is publicly owned, leased or
controlled, within the corporate limits of the City of Fairmont.  The term
“knowingly” includes knowledge that the parent, custodian or guardian should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of said minor in his
or her custody.  This requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or careless
parent, custodian or guardian up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test.  It shall, therefore, be no defense
that the parent or guardian was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct of such minor.
   (c)   Penalty. 
      (1)   Any violation of the prohibitions contained in this section shall
constitute the commission of a misdemeanor offense, and the Police Department
for the City of Fairmont, or any other law enforcement officer of any other
policing agency exercising proper jurisdiction within the corporate limits of
the City of Fairmont, is hereby authorized and empowered to issue a citation
and to charge any person who violates the prohibitions contained in this
section, jurisdiction thereof being in the Municipal Court for the City of
Fairmont.
      (2)   A person convicted of violating the prohibitions contained in this
section shall be punished as follows:
         A.   First offense conviction.  Any person convicted of a first
offense shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00), nor more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) together with all applicable court costs;
         B.   Second offense conviction.  Any person convicted of a second
offense shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00), nor more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) together with all applicable court costs;
         C.   Third offense conviction.  Any person convicted of a third or
subsequent offense shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00)
nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) together with all applicable court
costs.
   (d)   Exceptions.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it
shall not be an offense for any person to use, ride, or operate a motorized
recreational apparatus within the corporate limits of the City of Fairmont as
follows:
      (1)   Upon a designated parade route, when such person or persons is a
duly registered and recognized participant in a parade which has been duly
permitted by the City of Fairmont in accordance with the provisions of Section
311.02 of this Code;
      (2)   Upon private property;
      (3)   Upon property otherwise restricted as to such use, when such person
or persons are participants in a duly organized exhibition or competition which

provisions of Section
311.02 of this Code; or
      (4)   In a natural disaster, emergency or in a situation requiring
immediate action so as to prevent death or serious bodily injury or property
damage.
   (e)   Disclaimer.  Nothing contained herein is intended to nor shall it be
construed so as to create or form the basis for any civil or administrative
liability whatsoever on the part of the City of Fairmont, or any of its
officers, agents, insurers, for any injury or damage sustained by any person
whomsoever as a consequence of any action or inaction on the part of the City
of Fairmont as related in any manner to the enforcement or nonenforcement of
the provisions of this section.
   (f)   Severability.  In any portion of this section, or its application to
any person or circumstance is held unconstitutional or invalid, such
unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not effect the remaining portions of
this section.  City Council hereby declares that it would have enacted the
remaining portions regardless of whether any part of this section is declared
unconstitutional or invalid.

and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)    Green alone or "go":
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including

the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)    Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that the City
Manager may prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at any
intersection which regulation shall be effective when a sign is erected at such
intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)    A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one- way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that the City Manager may prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which regulation shall be

can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)    Red with green arrow:
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)    No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
 
313.04  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.

which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs,
   (b)    Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other

(e), (f), (g) or (h) hereof or the prior enactment of this section for an
offense which occurred within the ten year period immediately preceding the
date of arrest in the current proceeding;
      (2)     Any conviction under a municipal ordinance of this State or any
other state or a statute of the United States or a statute of this state or of
any other state or an offense which has the same elements as an offense
described herein, which occurred within the ten year period immediately
preceding the date of arrest in the current proceeding; and
      (3)    Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to Section
 333.01B of this Code for violation of subsection (e) hereof, which violation
occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in
the current proceeding.
   (o)   A person may be charged in a warrant or indictment or information for
a second or subsequent offense under this section, if the person has been
previously arrested for or charged with a violation of this section which is
alleged to have occurred within the applicable time periods for prior offenses,
notwithstanding the fact that there has not been a final adjudication of the
charges for the alleged previous offense.  In that case, the warrant or
indictment or information must set forth the date, location and particulars of
the previous offense or offenses.  No person may be convicted of a second or
subsequent offense under this section unless the conviction for the previous

(c), (d), (e) (f) or (g) hereof, or any person permitted to drive as described

alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug shall not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e),  (f), (g), (h)
or (i) hereof.
   (q)    For purposes of this section, the term "controlled substance" shall
have the meaning ascribed to it in West Virginia Code §60A-1-101 et seq.
   (r)    The sentences provided herein upon conviction for a violation of this
article are mandatory and shall not be subject to suspension or probation;
provided, that the court may apply the provisions of §62-11A-1 et seq.  of this
code to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for a
first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may impose
a term of conditional probation pursuant to §17C-5-2b of this code to persons
adjudicated thereunder, or provide for  a deferral of any sentence pursuant to
the provision of City Code 333.01B to persons adjudicated thereunder.  An order
for home detention by the court pursuant to the provision of §62-11B-1 et seq.,
of this code, may be used an alternative sentence to any period of
incarceration required by this article for a first or subsequent offense;
provided further, that for any period of home incarceration ordered for a
person convicted of a second offense under this section, electronic monitoring
shall be required for no fewer than five days of the total period of home
confinement ordered and the offender may not leave home for those five days
notwithstanding the provisions of 62-11B-5 of this code; and provided further,
that for any period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a
third or subsequent violation of this section, electronic monitoring shall be
included for no fewer than ten days of the total period of home confinement
ordered and the offender may not leave home for those ten days notwithstanding
§62-11B-5 of this code.

article, the words “drives a vehicle in this City” do not mean or include
driving or operating a vehicle solely and exclusively on one’s own property.
   (t)    In as much as the West Virginia Code limits the powers of a Municipal
Judge and the jurisdiction of a Municipal Court, violations of subsections
providing for second, third or subsequent offenses or enhanced penalties or
penalties or fines beyond the scope of the municipal court's jurisdiction,
power or authority shall be prosecuted in the Magistrate Court of Marion County
or the Circuit Court of Marion County pursuant to State warrants or upon
information or indictment.  (Ord.  1834.  Passed 10-8-19.)
333.01B  DEFERRAL OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS FOR CERTAIN FIRST OFFENSES UPON
CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM;
PROCEDURE ON CHARGE OF VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, whenever any
person who has not previously been convicted of any offense under this section
or under any statute of the United States or of any state or any other
ordinance relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled
substance or any other drug:
      (1)    Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)   Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under Section
333.01A(c), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the
consent of the accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding
any provisions of any code to the contrary, the accused shall have an
opportunity to participate in and successfully complete the Motor Vehicle
Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in W.Va. Code 17C-5A-3a.
   (b)   A defendant’s election to participate in a deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in W.Va. Code 17C-5A-2.
   (c)   (1)   If the City Attorney files a motion alleging that the defendant
during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock program has been
removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) of this section, the court may issue such process as is
necessary to bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subdivision (c)
(1) must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time after
the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard.  If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. 
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provisions, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (d)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges.  This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program.  A copy of the motion shall be
served on the City Attorney who shall within 30 days after service advise the
judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such objections on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.  If there are no objections filed within
the 30-day period, the court shall thereafter dismiss the charges against the
defendant.  If there are objections filed with regard to the dismissal of
charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in subsection (c) of this
section.
   (e)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of this Code, discharge
and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is
not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by
law upon conviction of a crime except as otherwise provided by law.  Except as
otherwise provided by law regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the
dismissal and discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law
to the status he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial.  No person as to
whom a dismissal and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to
be guilty of perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by
reason of his or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or
trial in response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than
the inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as that term by law.
   (f)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (g)   No person shall be eligible for dismissals and discharge under this
section:
      (1)   In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision of
City Code
333.01A has been charged;
      (2)   If the person holds a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicle(s), or
      (3)   The person has previously had his or her driver’s license revoked
under any statute of the United States, the State of West Virginia or of any
state relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled
substance or any other drug.
   (h)   Any person who has been subject to dismissal and discharge under this
section may apply to the Circuit Court of Marion County for an order of
expungement pursuant to and as provided by the provisions of W.Va. Code 17C-5-
2b.
   (i)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the contrary, any person
prosecuted for a violation of subsection (c) of City Code
333.01A, whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be liable for any fine and court costs assessable against a person
convicted of a violation of subsection (i), of City Code
333.01A.  Payment of such fine and costs may be made a condition of deferral. 
The costs assessed pursuant to this subsection, whether as a condition of
deferral or not, shall be distributed as other court costs in accordance with
law.  (Ord. 1487.  Passed 6-8-10.)
333.02  PHRASES SYNONYMOUS WITH DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL;
VALIDATION OF WARRANT AND INDICTMENTS.
   (a)   When used in this Traffic Code, the terms or phrases “driving under
the influence of intoxicating liquor,” “driving or operating a motor vehicle
while intoxicated,” “for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating
liquor to drive any vehicle,” or any similar term or phrase shall be construed
to mean and be synonymous with the term or phrase “while under the influence of
alcohol... drives a vehicle” as the latter term or phrase is used in Section
333.01.
 
   (b)   From and after the effective date of this section, a warrant or
indictment which charges or alleges the offense prohibited by the provisions of
Section
333.01 and which warrant or indictment uses any of the terms or phrases set
forth in subsection (a) hereof shall not thereby be fatally defective if such
warrant or indictment otherwise informs the person so accused of the charges
against him. 
(Ord. 539.  Passed 7-7-81.)
333.03  IMPLIED CONSENT TO TEST; ADMINISTRATION OF DIRECTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICER; DESIGNATION OF TYPE OF TEST; DEFINITION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
   (a)   Any person who is licensed to operate a motor vehicle in this City and
who drives a motor vehicle in this state shall be deemed to have given his
consent by the operation thereof, subject to the provisions of this article, to
a preliminary breath analysis and a secondary chemical test of either his
blood, breath or urine for the purposes of determining the alcoholic content of
his blood.
 
   (b)   A preliminary breath analysis may be administered in accordance with
the provisions of Section
333.04 whenever a police officer has reasonable cause or a reasonable
articulatable suspicion to believe a person to have been driving a motor
vehicle in this City while under the influence of alcohol, controlled
substances or drugs as prohibited by Section
333.01. 
 
   (c)   A secondary test of blood, breath or urine shall be incidental to a
lawful arrest and shall be administered at the direction of the arresting law
enforcement officer having reasonable grounds or a reasonable articulatable
suspicion to believe the person to have been driving a motor vehicle in this
City while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs as
prohibited by Section
333.01. 
 
   (d)   The Police Chief shall designate which one of the aforesaid secondary
tests shall be administered.  Provided, that if the test so designated is a
blood test and the person so arrested refuses to submit to such blood test,
then the law-enforcement officer making such arrest shall designate in lieu
thereof, either a breath or urine test to be administered.
 
   (e)   Any person to whom a preliminary breath test is administered who is
then arrested shall be given a written statement advising him or her that his
or her refusal to submit to the secondary chemical test authorized by this
article, will result in the revocation or his or her license to operate a motor
vehicle in this state of a period of at least one year and up to life.
 
   (f)   Any law-enforcement officer who has been properly trained in the
administration of any secondary chemical test authorized by this article,
including, but not limited to, certification by the division of health in the
operation of any equipment required for the collection and analysis of a breath
sample, may conduct the test at any location in the city wherein the arrest is
made; provided, that the law-enforcement officer may conduct the test at the
nearest available properly functioning secondary chemical testing device
outside the City pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-4.
 
   (g)    If the arresting officer lacks proper training in the administration
of a secondary chemical test, then any other law-enforcement officer who has
received training in the administration of the secondary chemical test to be
administered may, upon the request of the arresting law-enforcement officer and
in his or her presence, conduct the secondary chemical test.  The results of a
test conducted pursuant to this subsection may be used in evidence to the same
extent and in the same manner as if the test had been conducted by the
arresting officer.
   (h)   Only the person actually administering or conducting a test conducted
pursuant to this article is competent to testify as to the results and the
veracity of the test.
(Ord. 1270.  Passed 5-25-04.)
333.04  FIELD SOBRIETY TEST AND PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF BREATH.
   When a police officer has reason to believe a person to have been driving a
motor vehicle upon the public streets or highways, of this City while under the
influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, the police officer may
require such person to submit to any number of police department approved field
sobriety tests and/or preliminary breath analysis for the purpose of
determining the influence of alcohol upon such person or such person’s blood
alcohol content.  Such field sobriety tests and/or breath analysis must be
administered as soon as possible after the police officer has a reasonable
belief that the person has been driving while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs.  Any preliminary breath analysis required under
this section must be administered with a device and in a manner approved by the
State Department of Health for that purpose.  The results of a preliminary
breath analysis shall be used solely for the purpose of guiding the officer in
deciding whether an arrest should be made.  When a driver is arrested following
a preliminary breath analysis, the tests as hereinafter provided in this
article, shall be administered in accordance with the provisions thereof.
(Ord. 1270.  Passed 5-25-04.)
333.05  ADMINISTRATION OF TESTS.
   Only a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, registered nurse or trained medical
technician at the place of his employment acting at the request and direction
of the law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining the alcoholic content thereof.  These limitations shall not apply
to the taking of a breath test or a urine specimen.  In withdrawing blood for
the purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof, only a previously
unused and sterile needle and sterile vessel may be utilized and the withdrawal
shall otherwise be in strict accord with accepted medical practices.  A
nonalcoholic antiseptic shall be used for cleansing the skin prior to
venapuncture.  The person tested may, at his own expense, have a doctor of
medicine or osteopathy, registered nurse or trained medical technician at the
place of his employment, of his own choosing, administer a chemical test in
addition to the test administered at the direction of the law enforcement
officer.  Upon the request of the person who is tested, full information
concerning the test taken at the direction of the law enforcement officer shall
be made available to him.  No person who administers any such test upon the
request of a law enforcement officer as herein defined, no hospital in or which
such person is employed or is otherwise associated or in which such tests is
administered, and no other person, firm or corporation by whom or with which
such person is employed or is in any way associated, or in which such test is
administered, and no other person, firm or corporation by whom or with which
such person is employed or is in any way associated shall be in anywise
criminally liable for the administration of such test, or civilly liable in
damages to the person tested unless for gross negligence or wilful or wanton
injury.
(Ord. 1270.  Passed 5-25-04.)
333.06  REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO TESTS; LICENSE REVOCATION.
   (a)   If any person under arrest as specified in Section
333.01 refuses to submit to any secondary chemical test, the tests shall not be
given; provided, that prior to such refusal, the person is given a written
statement advising him that his refusal to submit to the secondary test finally
designated shall result in the revocation of his license to operate a motor
vehicle in this State for a period of at least one year and up to life.  If a
person initially refuses to submit to the designated secondary chemical test
after being informed in writing of the consequences of such refusal, he shall
be informed orally and in writing that after fifteen minutes such refusal shall
be deemed to be final and the arresting officer shall after such period of time
expires have no further duty to provide the person with an opportunity to take
the secondary test.  The officer shall within forty-eight hours of such
refusal, sign and submit to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles a written
statement of the officer that:
      (1)   He had reasonable grounds to believe such person has been driving a
motor vehicle in this State while under the influence of alcohol, controlled
substances or drugs;
      (2)   Such person was lawfully placed under arrest for an offense
relating to driving a vehicle in this City while under the influence of
alcohol, controlled substances or drugs;
      (3)   Such person refused to submit to the secondary chemical test
finally designated in the manner provided in Section
333.03; and
      (4)   Such person was given a written statement advising him that his
license to operate a motor vehicle in this State would be revoked for a period
of at least one year and up to life if he refused to submit to the secondary
test finally designated in the manner provided in this article.
   (b)   Such report shall include the specific offense with which the person
is charged, and, if applicable, a copy of the results of any secondary tests of
blood, breath or urine.  The signing of the statement required to be signed by
this section shall constitute an oath or affirmation by the person signing such
statement that the statements contained therein are true and that  any copy
filed is a true copy.  Such statement shall contain upon its face a warning to
the officer signing that to willfully sign a statement containing false

   (a)   Upon the trial for the offense of driving a motor vehicle on the
public streets or highways of this City while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs, or upon the trial of any civil or criminal
action arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while
driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, controlled
substances or drugs, evidence of the amount of alcohol, in the person’s blood
at the time of the arrest or of the acts alleged, as shown by a chemical
analysis of his blood, breath or urine, is admissible, if the same or specimen
was taken within two hours from and after the time of the arrest or of the acts
alleged.  The evidence shall give rise to the following presumptions or has the
following effect:
      (1)   Evidence that there was, at the time, five hundredths of one
percent (.05%) or less, by weight, of alcohol, in his blood shall be prima-
facie evidence that the person was not under the influence of alcohol;
      (2)   Evidence that there was, at the time, more than five hundredths of
one percent (.05%) and less than eight hundredths of one percent (.08%) by
weight, of alcohol in the person’s blood, is relevant evidence, but is not to
be given prima-facie effect in indicating whether the person was under the
influence of alcohol;
      (3)   Evidence that there was at the time, eight hundredths of one
percent (.08%) or more, by weight, of alcohol in his blood, shall be admitted
as prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of intoxicating
liquor.
   (b)   A determination of the percent, by weight, of alcohol in the blood
shall be based upon a formula of:
      (1)   The number of grams of alcohol per one hundred cubic centimeters of
blood;
      (2)   The number of grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of
breath;
      (3)   The number of grams of alcohol per sixty-seven milliliters of
urine; or
      (4)   The number of grams of alcohol per eighty-six milliliters of serum.
   (c)   A chemical analysis of a person’s blood, breath or urine in order to
give rise to the presumption or to have the effect provided for in subsections
(a) hereof must be performed in accordance with method and standards approved
by the State Division of Health.  A chemical analysis of blood or urine to
determine alcoholic content of blood shall be conducted by a qualified
laboratory or by the State Police Scientific Laboratory of the Criminal
Identification Bureau of the Department of Public Safety.
   (d)   The provisions of this article shall not limit the introduction in any
administration or judicial proceeding of any other competent evidence bearing
on the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs.

shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers
and shall be open to inspection by any police officer.
   No holder of a permit issued by the Commissioner of Highways shall be
required to obtain any local permit or license or pay any local fee or charge

such operation is necessary to load or unload property, to go to or from the

within the Municipality shall confine such deviation to that required in order
to accomplish the purpose of the departure.
   (c)    Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the

   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Commissioner of Highways for the movement of the vehicle or combination of
vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction; however, the approval
of the Commissioner of Highways shall be required for movement upon State
routes as provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   The City Manager may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such
period of time, not to exceed one year, as the City Manager in his discretion
deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project. The City
Manager may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such
vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or
such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public
peace, property, health and safety. The City Manager may require the posting of
bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or
road structure.
   For each such permit, the City Manager shall charge five dollars ($5.00),

supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
ten dollars ($10.00).
   Signs shall be posted indicating "no thru trucks - gross weight 5 tons" or
words of similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this
section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit

violation shall also subject the violator to the penalty prescribed by Section
303.99.

violations may issue citations for violations of this section and shall
reference the number on the vehicle’s license plate, since the driver normally
will not be present.
      (5)   The City of Fairmont may establish a program to use trained
volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces.  If the City of
Fairmont establishes a program shall provide for workers’ compensation and
liability coverage.  The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by the City of Fairmont Police
Department, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle.  The photographs must show the
vehicle in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate.

form, to the owner of the illegally parked vehicle.  Volunteers shall be
trained on the requirements for citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned
or designated accessible parking areas by the City of Fairmont Police

Otherwise any moneys collected as fined shall be collected for and remitted to
the state.

741.02  APPLICATION FOR LICENSE CERTIFICATE.
   Every person desiring to obtain a City license shall apply for a certificate
therefor to the City Clerk, except as otherwise provided by this Code or other
ordinance of the City.
(1968 Code §14-1)
741.03  LICENSE CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE.
   When a license for any of the purposes mentioned in this article has been
granted, the City Clerk shall issue a certificate of license.  Such license
shall be turned over by the City Clerk to the Finance Director as prescribed in
the case of certificates in other cases, and the Finance Director’s receipt for
such tax on the certificate shall, with the certificate, constitute a license
while it remains in force, to the person and for the purpose specified in the
certificate, except insofar as otherwise provided in this article.
(1968 Code §14-2)
741.04  FEES.
   Whenever anything, for which a license from the State is required, is
licensed by the City by this Code or any ordinance now in effect in the City,
or which may hereafter be passed and made effective in the City, the fee
required for such City license will be equal to the fee charged by the State
for a similar State license, and the fee schedules now set forth by proper acts
of the State legislature, and those fee schedules hereafter properly adopted by
the State for such licenses are hereby adopted by this City as if herein
specifically set forth and all fee provisions of this Code or other ordinances
now in effect in this City not in accordance with State fee requirements are
hereby nullified and declared void and of no effect and are superseded by the
State fee schedules.
(1968 Code §14-2.1)
741.05  TERM; PRORATING; MINIMUM FEE.
   The term for all annual licenses named in this article shall begin on July 1
of each year and end with the following June 30.  Every City license for any
purpose named in this article, except as otherwise provided, shall expire on
June 30.  If any such license is granted for less time than a year, the tax
thereon shall be computed from the annual tax in proportion to such time as the
license has to run, except as otherwise provided; except, that no license for
any purpose or any length of time shall be issued for less than two dollars
($2.00).
(1968 Code §14-3)

this article shall keep such license posted in a conspicuous position in the

effect unless made in the manner prescribed in this section
   For every alteration or assignment of a license, the City Clerk shall
collect a fee of fifty cents ($.50). Such fee shall be paid by the person on
whose application the license alteration or assignment is made and shall be
turned into the City treasury. No certificate fee shall be required to be paid
on any original license.
(1968 Code §14-5)
741.08  CONDITIONS PREREQUISITE TO DOING BUSINESS.
   The granting of a license to any person to carry on any business for which a

construed to authorize him to carry on such business, unless he has complied
with all the provisions of law requiring him to make any payment, obtain any
certificate or permit, or to do any act as a condition of carrying on any such
business.
(1968 Code §14-6)
741.09  APPEALS FROM ASSESSMENT OF LICENSE TAX.
   If any person desiring a City license of any kind is dissatisfied with the

which relief is asked.
(1968 Code §14-7)

tax and penalty prescribed by this article and due the City is paid.

thereon to the City; but it shall also be the duty of every person to apply to
the City Clerk and cause himself to be properly listed and licensed.
   The City Clerk shall deliver to the Finance Director from time to time lists
of licenses issued by him, specifying in such lists the date of every
certificate, the name of the person to whom issued, the amount of the City tax,
for what the license is to be obtained, and such other particulars as may be

such person's personal property subject to such distress as may be necessary to

the effective period of any such license, shall, in addition to paying the

default; and if the license fee aforesaid is for the doing of a single act, ten

other ordinances of this City for the assessment and collection of such license
fee; except, that the certificate of license issued therefor and the report
thereof made to the Finance Director shall indicate separately the amount of
the license fee and the penalty. It shall be the duty of the City Clerk, or the
officer who issues the certificate of license, to state therein the full amount
of the tax thereof and the penalty separately; and it shall be the duty of the
Director to collect the full amount thereof and the penalty.

755.01  FINDING AND DECLARATION.
   In the judgment of Council, the public health, safety, welfare and well-
being of the residents of the City demands the continuance, maintenance and
improvement of the essential service of fire protection within the City, and as
the public revenues of the City are not sufficient for the purpose of providing
adequate fire protection within the City, it therefor appears necessary under
the provisions of West Virginia Code 8-13-13, that in order to provide for the
continuance, maintenance and improvement of the essential and special service
of fire protection within the City, it is necessary that there be imposed upon
the users of such special service such rates, fees and rentals as are required
to pay the cost of the special service of fire protection.
(1968 Code §10-27)
   It is hereby found that commercial buildings are more likely to require fire
protection services and therefore the fee shall be based upon the size of the
building to be protected.  It is further found that the size of commercial
buildings varies while dwellings, in comparison to commercial buildings, are of
a similar size, therefore, it is equitable and fair to apportion fees on a
square footage basis for commercial buildings and on a flat rate for dwellings.
(Ord. 636.  Passed 7-3-84.)
755.02  LEVIED.
   (a)   Commercial Buildings. There is hereby imposed and levied upon the
respective owners of all commercial buildings as users of fire protection
service a fee of two and four tenths cents ($.024) per square foot of the

      (1)   There is hereby imposed and levied upon the respective owners of
all dwellings as users of fire protection service a fee of forty-seven and 82/
100 dollars ($47.82) per six months.
      (2)   There is hereby imposed and levied upon the respective owners of
all multi-family dwellings, as users of fire protection service a fee of forty-
seven and 82/100 dollars ($47.82) per unit per six months.  Provided, however,
that owners of multi-family dwellings, may elect, upon filing an application
with the City Manager, to pay the forty-five and 54/100 dollars ($45.54) fee on
one dwelling unit in the building and to have the remaining building area
treated as a commercial building for the imposition of fees hereunder.
         (Ord. 1737.  Passed 5-9-17.)
755.03  COLLECTIONS.
   The fees levied by this article shall be collected from each owner and user

755.04  COLLECTIONS FOR SERVICE RENDERED.
   The fees imposed and levied by this article shall be collected as aforesaid
and shall be for services rendered commencing July 1, 1984 and thereafter.
(Ord. 636.  Passed 7-3-84.)
755.05  DELINQUENT PAYMENT; DISCOUNTS.
   (a)   The rates and fees assessed pursuant to the provisions of this article
shall be a debt due the City and may be collected by proceedings instituted in
courts of appropriate jurisdiction, or in such manner as provided by West
Virginia Code 8-13-15.  A penalty of ten percent (10%) of the rate or fee shall
be added for any default for a period of thirty days or less in payment of such
rate or fee, and for each succeeding thirty days elapsing thereafter before
payment, there shall be an additional penalty of one and one-half percent
(1.5%) provided that a discount of five percent (5%) shall be allowed on each
semi-annual, bi-monthly or monthly installment if paid within twenty days of
the billing date.
   (b)   The Finance Director shall collect any principal, interest, and
penalty due and unpaid by civil litigation, instituted in either Magistrate
Court or the Circuit Court of Marion County, if the accrued sum is more than
one hundred dollars ($100.00) and a balance due is outstanding for more than
120 days and the Finance Director is of the opinion that the user is solvent.
(Ord. 1183.  Passed 3-12-02.)
755.06  USE OF FUNDS.
   (a)   The funds, moneys and revenues received from the collection of the
rates, fees, and rentals provided for by this article shall be used only for
the continuance, maintenance or improvement of the essential or special service
of fire protection within the City and no part of such funds, moneys or
revenues shall be used for any other Municipal purpose except as provided in
subsection (b) hereof.  (1968 Code §10-32)
   (b)   A sum not to exceed five percent (5%) of all fees, rates and rental
collected annually shall be used for the installation or maintenance, repair

the payment thereof shall be a condition precedent to the use and enjoyment of
the special and essential service of fire protection within the City.
(1968 Code §10-33)
755.08  REFUSAL TO PAY.

production of the business showing the gross proceeds or equivalent in

time jobs provided in the corporate city limits.  As set forth below, the
period of years and percentages for which a credit will be allowed is directly
related to the minimum number of said jobs guaranteed by the taxpayer.  The
period of the credit will not be extended if the taxpayer hires more employees
than he has guaranteed the City unless there is an additional qualified
investment to expand the business.  The extension of time granted for such an
expansion will be based only on the number of new and additional full-time jobs
created by the expansion, not by the total number of employees.

The allowable tax credit year(s) are calculated upon the business's operational
year(s), beginning with the first taxable period after the commencement or
expansion of business operations.
If a taxpayer should expand operations and provide at least two new jobs while
operating under a pre-existing credit period there is no carryover of the new
credit allowance to the expiration date of the existing credit.  It is possible
for two or more credits to operate concurrently; however, any credit in excess
of the tax liability is not refundable and cannot be carried over into the next
tax year.
   (d)   Qualified Investments:
      (1)    "Qualified Investments" with respect to any taxable year means the
greater of either: (1) The aggregate of the applicable percentage of the cost
of each property purchased for the purpose of a new business or business
expansion, as defined in subsection (d)(2) hereof in the City, which is placed
in service or use in this City by a taxpayer during such taxable year; or  (2)
Payroll costs related to each new job created and payable in the first twelve
month period from the date the new jobs were created.   
      (2)    "Property purchased for  the purpose of a new business or
business  expansion" means real property and improvements thereto and tangible
personal property but only if such property is constructed or purchased for use
as a component part of a new or expanded business of a taxpayer and such
property is located within the City.  The term does not include replacement
property, motor vehicles licensed by the West Virginia Department of Motor
Vehicles, airplanes, off-premises transportation
equipment or property that is used primarily for business outside this City,
property purchased or contracted for prior to the operative date of this
section as defined in subsection
761.12.5(a) hereof, property acquired or purchased incident to the purchase of
the stock or assets of a taxpayer which had been used by the transferor or
seller in such business in this City, nor such property which had previously
designated property purchased for expansion and so used to qualify for the tax
credit provided by this section.
      (3)    "Cost" when used in relationship to property shall not include the
value of any property given in trade or exchange for such new property
purchased for expansion.
      (4)    Property acquired by capital lease, as that term is defined by the
Internal Revenue Code,  if used as a component part of a new or expanded
business of a taxpayer shall be considered property purchased for expansion and
the cost of such property shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the rent
reserved for the primary term of the lease not to exceed seven years.  Lease
renewals subleases, or assignments shall not be considered property purchased
for expansion. 
      (5)    The cost of property purchased for multiple business use including
use as a component part of a new or expanded business of a taxpayer together
with some other business or occupation not qualifying under this section shall
be apportioned between such business and occupations and the proportion shall
be allocated to qualifying businesses shall be considered a qualified
investment subject to the conditions and limitations of subsection (d)(1) and
(2) hereof.  The allocations shall be based on the percentage of square feet of
the total available space allocated to each business in the case of real
property and buildings.  In the case of tangible personal property, the
allocation should be based on the amount of time of actual use devoted to each
business.
   (e)   Forfeiture of Credit:    If during any taxable year, property with
respect to which a tax credit has been allowed is disposed of or ceases to be
used in a business of a taxpayer in this City, or if the taxpayer ceases
operation of such business before expiration of the period of the credit, then
the unused portion of such credit shall be forfeited for the taxable year in
which such event occurs and all ensuing taxable years.  The employment of fewer
workers than guaranteed to the City will cause the credit period, dating from
the first day property was placed in service, to be shortened in relation to
the lowest level of employment maintained, or terminated if the applicable
credit period for the decreased employment level has run out . Work stoppage
and lay-offs approved by the Collector and caused by forces majeure or severe
economic depressions which last less that three months will not affect the
taxpayer's credit periods.  However, systematic lay-offs by any taxpayer that
for all essential purposes result in employment below the guaranteed level, as
determined by the City Collector, will result in termination of all credit
periods for that taxpayer.

penalties and interest due and unpaid for prior periods, at the time of
application for such permit and prior to or upon issuance thereof.
   (f)   Severability.  If any section, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
ordinance shall be declared invalid for any reasons whatsoever, such decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of this ordinance which shall continue
in full force and effect, and to this end the provisions of this ordinance are
hereby declared severable.
(Ord. 1765.  Passed 4-10-18.)
761.15  RETURN AND REMITTANCE BY TAXPAYER.
   On or before the expiration of one month after the end of the tax year each
taxpayer shall make a return for the entire year showing the gross proceeds of
sales or gross income of business, trade or calling, and compute the amount of
tax chargeable against him in accordance with the provisions of this article
and deduct the amount of quarterly payments, as hereinbefore provided, if any,
and transmit with his report a remittance in the form required by Section
761.21 covering the residue of the tax chargeable against him to the office of
the Collector.  Such return shall be signed by the taxpayer, if made by an
individual, or by the president, vice president, secretary or treasurer of a
corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation.  If made on behalf of a
partnership, joint venture, association, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit, any individual delegated by such firm,
copartnership, joint venture, association, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit shall sign the return on behalf of the taxpayer. 
The Collector, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making the annual
return on the application of any taxpayer and grant such reasonable additional
time within which to make the same as may, by him, be deemed advisable.
(1968 Code §24-17)
761.16  ERRONEOUS COMPUTATION.
   If the taxpayer makes any clerical error which is apparent on the face of
the return in computing the tax assessable against him under the provisions of
this article, the Collector shall correct such error  or reassess the proper
amount of taxes, and notify the taxpayer of his action by mailing to him
promptly a copy of the corrected assessment, and any additional tax for which
such taxpayer may be liable shall be paid within fifteen days after the receipt
of such statement.  If the taxpayer fails to make payments within such fifteen
day period, the Collector shall proceed under Section
761.22 et seq.  to collect the amount due.
   If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the
basis of the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately
refunded to the taxpayer upon the requisition of the Collector, and shall be
payable out of any funds available for the purpose.  The taxpayer may, at his
election, apply an overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing
hereunder. 
(1968 Code §24-18; Ord.  563.  Passed 6-1-82.)
761.17  ASSESSMENT OF TAX WHEN INSUFFICIENTLY RETURNED.
   If the Collector believes that the tax imposed by this article is
insufficiently returned by a taxpayer, either because the taxpayer has failed
to properly remit the tax or has failed to make a return, or has made a return
which is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to
investigate and determine or estimate the tax liability of the taxpayer and
make an assessment from any information available.  If the collection of any
tax administered under this article will be jeopardized by delay he shall
thereupon make an assessment of tax, noting that fact upon the assessment.  The
amount assessed shall be immediately due and payable.
   The Collector may, at any time before the assessment becomes final, amend,
in whole or in part, any assessment whenever the Collector ascertains that such
assessment is improper or incomplete in any material respect.
   The Collector may, at any time within the period prescribed for assessment,
make a supplemental assessment whenever he ascertains that any assessment is
imperfect or incomplete in any material respect. 
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.171 INVESTIGATION OF RECORDS.
   For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any tax return or
assessment and for the purpose of making an estimate of any taxpayer’s
liability for any tax administered under this article, the Collector shall have
the power to examine, audit, or cause to be examined or audited, by any agent
or representative designated by the Collector, any books, papers, records,
memoranda, inventory or equipment bearing upon the matters required to be
included in the tax return, may make test checks of tax yield, and may require
the attendance of the person rendering the tax return or the attendance of any
other person having knowledge of the matters contained therein.  At least five
days notice of such examinations or audit shall be given to all taxpayers to be
examined, but such notice may be of an informal nature, such as by telephone or
general mail. 
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.172 SUBPOENA POWER.
   For the efficient administration of the powers vested in the Collector by
Section
761.171, the Collector shall have the power to issue subpoenas and subpoenas
duces tecum, in the name of his agency, and compel the attendance of witnesses
and the production of books, papers, records, documents, and testimony at the
time and place specified.  Every such subpoena or subpoena duces tecum shall be
served at least five days before the return date thereof by personal service
made by any person over eighteen years of age.  Such service shall be the
responsibility of the Collector or his delegate.  Any person, except a person
in the employ of the Finance Department who serves such subpoena or subpoena
duces tecum shall be entitled to the same fee as sheriffs who serve witness
subpoenas for the Circuit Courts of the State. 
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.18  CORRECTION OF ASSESSMENT.
   If any person assessed or reassessed under Section
761.17, having made the return and paid the tax as provided by this article,
feels aggrieved by the assessments so made upon him for any year by the
Collector he shall apply to the Finance Director by petition in writing, within
twenty days after notice of a jeopardy assessment or within sixty days after
notice of a general assessment or reassessment has been served upon him by the
Collector, for a hearing and a correction of the amount of the tax assessed
upon him by the Collector, in which petition shall be set forth the reasons why
such hearing should be granted and the amount such tax should be reduced. 
Unless the petition is made within the allotted amount of time, twenty days for
a jeopardy assessment or sixty days for a general assessment, such assessment
shall become final.  The Finance Director shall promptly consider all such
punctual petitions, and may grant such hearing or deny the same.  If denied,
the petitioner shall be forthwith notified thereof.  If granted, the Finance
Director shall notify the petitioner of the time and place so fixed for such
hearing.  After such hearing the Director may make such order in the matter as
may appear to be just and lawful, and shall furnish a copy of such order to the
petitioner.  Any person improperly charged with any tax, and required to pay
the same may recover the amount paid, together with interest, in such proper
action or suit against the Collector, as may be authorized by law. 
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.181 APPEAL.
   An appeal may be taken by the taxpayer to the Circuit Court of Marion County
within thirty days after he has received notice from the Director of Finance of
his determination as provided in Section
761.18.  The petition for appeal and notice thereof shall be served on the City
in the manner provided by the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure for the
service of original process.
   The appellant shall file with such Clerk of the Circuit Court a bond for the
use of the appellee, with sureties approved by the Clerk, the penalty of the
bond to be not less than the total amount of the tax and penalties appealed
from, and conditioned that the appellant performs the orders of the Court;
except that in lieu of such bond, the Director may upon proper showing find and
certify to the Clerk that the properties of the appellant subject to the liens
imposed by Sections
761.22 and
761.24 are adequate to secure the performance or the orders of the Court.  Any
discretionary decision respecting an appellant’s appeal bond made by the
Director of Finance is subject to full judicial review if an application for
such review is filed with the Circuit Court within thirty (30) days of such
decision.
   The Court shall hear the appeal upon the record made before the hearing
examiner and no additional evidence shall be taken unless otherwise required. 
The Court shall render its decree thereon and the Director shall then conform
the assessment to the decree.  An appeal may be taken by the taxpayer or the
Director to the Supreme Court of Appeals of this State.
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.19  TAX YEAR.
   The assessment of taxes made under the provisions of this article and the
returns required therefor shall be for the year ending on December 31.  If the
taxpayer, in exercising a privilege taxable under this article, keeps the books
reflecting the same on a basis other than the calendar year, he may, with the
assent of the Collector, make his annual returns and pay taxes for the year
covering his accounting period, as shown by the method of keeping his books.
   To accommodate the transition from a fiscal year to a calendar year, the
following procedures will be used.  The six months from July 1, 1981, through
December 31, 1981, shall constitute a short year and the returns submitted for
the two quarters covered by that period will not be used in computing the taxes
for any other time period.  The first calendar year will begin January 1, 1982,
and will end December 31, 1982.  Any returns submitted for the first three
quarters of calendar year 1982 will be credited, as provided in Section
761.14 to the total tax due at the end of the calendar year.
(Ord.  563.  Passed 6-1-82.)
761.20  TAX TO BE CUMULATIVE.
   The tax imposed by this article shall be in addition to all other licenses
and taxes levied by law as a condition precedent to engaging in any business,
trade or calling.  A person exercising a privilege taxable under this article,
subject to the payments of all licenses and charges which are conditions
precedent to exercising the privilege taxed, may exercise the privilege for the
current year upon the condition that he shall pay tax accruing under this
article. 
(1968 Code §24-22)
761.21  FORM OF PAYMENT; PENALTY FOR NONPAYMENT.
   (a)   Every remittance of taxes imposed by this article shall be made in
lawful money of the United States or by bank draft, certified check, money
order or certificate of deposit, to the Collector who shall issue his receipt
therefor to the taxpayer and pay the moneys into the City Treasury to be kept
and accounted for as provided by law.
   (b)   If any taxpayer fails to make the return required by this article, or
makes his return but fails to remit in whole or in part the proper amount of
tax, there shall be added to the amount of the tax unpaid, from the date such
tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount of five percent (5%) of the
tax for the first month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency and one percent
(1%) of the tax for each succeeding month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency;
provided, however, that if such failure is due to reasonable cause, the
Collector may waive or remit in whole or in part these penalties.
   (c)   If the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to evade this article
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be added an
additional penalty of twenty- five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties.
   (d)   The penalties so added shall be collected at the same time and in the
same manner and as a part of the tax.
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.211 INTEREST.
   (a)   In the case of an underpayment of estimated tax by a person who is
taxable under the provisions of this article, there shall be added to the
amount of tax due, from the date such tax should have been paid, interest in
the amount of eight percent (8%) per annum.  An underpayment of estimated tax
means the application of rates set forth in this article against estimated
values of gross income which constitutes less than eighty percent (80%) of
actual receipts.  The due date for payment of the tax to avoid accumulation of
the interest is one month after the end of the taxpayer’s tax year or one month
after the end of the taxpayer’s estimate period for which a return must be
filed under Section
761.14, unless otherwise stated in this article.
   (b)   If any refund is made upon an erroneous claim for refund, interest on
such amount refunded or credited at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum
shall be paid by the claimant from the date the claim for refund was made to
the date such amount is recovered.  There will be no interest paid on credits
as they begin to apply the first day of the next taxable period.
   (c)   Interest prescribed under this section shall be collected and paid in
the same manner as taxes.
   (d)   No interest under this section shall be imposed on the interest
provided by this section.
   (e)   Interest shall be imposed on any assessable penalty or addition to tax
only if such penalty or addition to tax is not paid within fifteen days from
the date of notice and demand therefor, and in such case interest shall be
imposed only for the period from the date of the notice and demand to the date
of payment.
   (f)   The interest imposed by this section cannot be waived.
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.22  TAX A DEBT; LIEN; RECORDATION.
   A tax due and unpaid under this article shall be a debt due the City.  It
shall be a personal obligation of the taxpayer and shall be a lien upon the
property of the taxpayer; provided, that such lien shall be subject to the
restrictions and conditions embodied in West Virginia Code Article 38-10C, and
any amendment made or which may hereafter be made thereto.  The assessment made
on the unpaid tax pursuant to Section
761.17 shall be recorded as a lien on real and personal property and, when paid
released in accordance with Section
761.26. 
(1968 Code §24-24; Ord.  563.  Passed 6-1-82.)
761.23  COLLECTION BY SUIT.
   The Collector may by himself, or a duly appointed agent mentioned in Section
761.28 collect taxes due and unpaid under this article, together with all
accrued penalties under the power conferred on the Collector by law.  In
addition to all other remedies available for the collection of debts due this
City, the Collector may proceed by foreclosure of the lien provided in Section
761.22 or by distraint and sale under Section
761.27.  After delinquency has continued sixty days, the Collector may proceed
by himself or his agent, in the Circuit Court of the County, to obtain an
injunction restraining the further exercise of the privilege, until full
payment has been made of all taxes and penalties due under this article.  In
any proceeding under this section, upon judgment or decree for the plaintiff,
he shall be awarded his costs.
(1968 Code §24-25; Ord.  563.  Passed 6-1-82.)
761.24  PAYMENT WHEN PERSONS SELLS OUT OR QUITS; LIEN; LIABILITY OF SUCCESSOR.
   (a)   Any person exercising any privilege taxable under this article who
sells out his business or stock of goods, or ceases doing such business, shall
file the return prescribed by Section
761.15 and remit the entire tax that may be chargeable against him because of
all business done, within thirty days after selling out his business or stock
of goods, or ceasing to do such business.  The tax imposed by this article
shall be a lien upon the property of such person.
   (b)   The successor in business of any such person shall withhold so much of
the purchase money as will satisfy the taxes and penalty which may be due until
the former owner produces a receipt from the Collector evidencing the payment
of such taxes and penalty.  If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods
fails to withhold purchase money as herein provided, and the taxes and penalty
shall remain unpaid after expiration of the thirty-day period allowed for
payment thereof, he shall be personally liable for the payment of all such
taxes and penalty, and the same shall be recoverable by the Collector by action
or suit as provided by law.
(1968 Code §24-26)
761.25  CERTIFICATE OF PAYMENT.
   All officers and agents making contracts on behalf of the City shall
withhold payment in the final settlement of such contract until the receipt of
a certificate from the Collector to the effect that all taxes levied or accrued
under this article against the contractor with respect to such contracts have
been paid.
(1968 Code §24-27)
761.26  RECORDATION OF ASSESSMENT; NOTICE OF LIEN; RELEASE.
   The Collector for the more effective collection of the tax imposed by this
article may file with the Clerk of the County Court a certified copy of the
assessment of taxes under this article for recordation.  A certificate so filed
shall be recorded in the book in which similar certificates of the State are
recorded and thereafter constitute binding notice of the lien created by this
article upon all lands of the taxpayer located within the City as against all
parties whose interest arose after such recordation.  Upon payment of the taxes
delinquent under this article the lien of which shall have been recorded the
Collector shall certify in duplicate the fact and amount of payment and balance
due, if any and shall forward the certificates, one to taxpayer, and one to
Clerk of the County Court.  The Clerk of the County Court shall record such
certificates in the book in which releases are recorded.  From the date that
such certificate is admitted to record the land of the taxpayer in the City
shall be free from any lien for taxes under this article accrued to the date
that the certificate was issued.
(1968 Code §24-28)
761.27  COLLECTION BY DISTRAINT.
   The Collector may distrain upon any goods, chattels or intangibles
represented by negotiable evidences of indebtedness, of any taxpayer delinquent
under this article for the amount of all taxes and penalties accrued and unpaid
hereunder.  The lien created by this article on real estate may be enforced by
suit in equity and other means provided by law.
(1968 Code §24-29)
761.28  ADMINISTRATION OF ARTICLE.
   The administration of this article is vested in, and shall be exercised by
the Collector who shall prescribe forms and reasonable rules in conformity with
this article for the making of returns and for the ascertainment, assessment
and collection of the taxes imposed hereunder and the enforcement of any
provision of this article in any of the state courts shall be under the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Collector who shall require the assistance of and
act through the City Attorney.
   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, the Director of Finance may execute and
deliver binding agreements with other municipalities to carry out the
provisions of this article respecting cooperation and tax administration,
including sourcing of gross income for municipal business and occupation tax
purposes and may execute and deliver binding agreements with the West Virginia
State Tax Commissioner respecting exchange of taxpayer information.
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.29  LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   General Rule.  The amount of any tax, additions to tax, penalties and
interest imposed by this article or any of the other articles of this chapter
to which this article is applicable shall be assessed within three years after
the date the return was filed (whether or not such return was filed on or after
the date prescribed for filing); provided, that in the case of a false or
fraudulent return filed with the intent to evade tax, or in case no return was
filed, the assessment may be made at any time.
   (b)   Time Return Deemed Filed.
Early return.  For purposes of this section, a return filed before the last day
prescribed by law, or by regulations promulgated by the Director of Finance for
filing thereof, shall be considered as filed on such last date.
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.30  REFUNDS AND CREDITS.
   Any taxpayer claiming to have overpaid any tax, interest or penalty imposed
by this article shall file his claim with the Director of Finance within three
years after the due date of the return determined by including any written
authorized extension of time for filing, in respect of which the tax was
imposed or within one year from the date the tax was paid, whichever of such
periods expires the later, or if no return was filed by the taxpayer, within
two years from the time the tax was paid, and not thereafter.
   If, on such petition and the proofs filed in support thereof, the Director
of Finance shall be of the opinion that the tax, interest and penalty, or any
part thereof, was overpaid, he shall refund the same to the taxpayer.  If the
Director of Finance shall be in doubt as to whether or not there exists an
overpayment, he may institute against the taxpayer a declaratory judgment
proceeding in the Circuit Court of the County to ascertain whether or not there
exists an overpayment of tax, interest and penalty, or any part thereof.  If
the Director of Finance is of the opinion that there exists no overpayment of
tax, interest or penalty, or any part thereof, he shall notify the taxpayer. 
Taxpayer’s failure to abide by express procedures contained in this section
precludes taxpayer’s claim for refund or credit.
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.31  CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE OF RETURNS.
   (a)   General Rule.  Except when required in an investigation by the
Director of Finance or his or her delegate or agent into the amount of tax due
under any section administered under this article or in any proceeding in which
the Director or his duly authorized representative is a party before a court of
competent jurisdiction to collect or ascertain the amount of such tax or
pursuant to lawful process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, no
officer or employee of this City shall divulge or make known in any manner the
tax return, or any part thereof, of any person or disclose information
concerning the personal affairs of any individual or the business of any single
firm or corporation, or disclose the amount of income, or any particulars set
forth or disclosed in any report, declaration or return required to be filed
with the Director by any section of this article or by any rule or regulation
of the Director issued thereunder, or disclosed in any audit or investigation
conducted under this article.
   (b)   Definitions.  For purposes of this section, “disclosure” means the
making known to any person in any manner whatsoever a return or return
information.
(Ord.  1216.  Passed 1-28-03.)
761.32  EFFECTIVE DATE OF AMENDMENTS.
   Except as otherwise provided, the amendments adopted January 28, 2003, are

return, with the intent to defraud the City or evade the payment of the tax, or
any part thereof, imposed by this article; or shall aid or abet another in any

manner provided by law.  Any corporation for which a false return, or a return
containing a false statement as aforesaid, shall be made shall be fined not

January, two thousand five, and continuously thereafter to and including the
effective date of annexation of the territory in which the hotel is located
pursuant to West Virginia Code §8- 6-1 et seq.  Provided further, that in the

be collectible as such by the hotel operator who shall account for, and remit
to the City, all taxes paid by consumers.  The hotel operator shall separately
state the tax authorized by this article on all bills, invoices, accounts,
books of account records relating to consideration paid for occupancy or use of
a hotel room. The hotel operator may commingle tax collected hereunder with the
proceeds of the rental of hotel accommodations.  The City’s claim shall be
enforceable against, and shall be superior to, all other claims against the
moneys so commingled excepting only claims of the State for moneys held by the
hotel pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code Article 11-15.  All
taxes collected pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be deemed to
be held in trust by the hotel until the same shall have been remitted to the
taxing authority as hereinafter provided.

manner, directly or indirectly, that it will absorb all or any part of the tax
or that the tax is not considered an element in the price to be collected from
the consumer.

   In the distribution, voluntary or compulsory, in receivership, bankruptcy or
otherwise, of the property or estate of any person, all taxes due and unpaid
authorized under this article shall be paid from the first money available for
distribution in priority of all claims and liens except taxes and debts due to
the United States which under Federal law are given priority over the debts and
liens created by this article for this tax and taxes and debts due to the
State.  Any person charged with the administration or distribution of such
property or estate who violates the provisions of this section shall be
personally liable for any taxes accrued and unpaid which are chargeable against
the person whose property or estate is in administration or distribution.
(Ord.  700.  Passed 1-7-86.)
762.10  FAILURE TO COLLECT OR REMIT TAX; LIABILITY OF HOTEL OPERATOR.
   If any hotel operator fails to collect the tax authorized by and levied
pursuant to this article or fails to properly remit such tax to the taxing
authority, he shall be personally liable for such amount as he failed to
collect or remit; provided, that such hotel operator shall not be held liable
for failure to collect such tax if the hotel operator can by good and
substantial evidence prove the refusal of the purchaser to pay this tax despite
the diligent effort in good faith of the hotel operator to collect the tax.
(Ord.  700.  Passed 1-7-86.)
762.11  TOTAL AMOUNT COLLECTED TO BE REMITTED.
   No profit shall accrue to any person as a result of the collection of the
tax authorized under this article.  Notwithstanding that the total amount of
such taxes collected by a hotel operator may be in excess of the amount for
which a consumer would be liable by the application of the levy of six percent
(6%) for the occupancy of a hotel room or rooms, the total amount of all taxes
collected by any hotel operator shall be remitted to the taxing authority as
hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 700.  Passed 1-7-86; Ord. 1331.  Passed 12-13-05.)
762.12  TAX RETURN AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   The tax authorized by this article shall be due and payable in monthly
installments on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month next
succeeding the month in which the tax accrued; provided, that for credit in
which the tax authorized by this article is not collected by the hotel operator
at the time of such sales, such tax shall not, for purposes of this article, be
regarded as having accrued until the date on which it is either received by the
hotel operator or upon the expiration of the thirty days payment period set
forth in Section
762.08, whichever shall first occur.  The hotel operator shall, on or before
the fifteenth of each month, prepare and deliver to the Finance Director a
return for the preceding month, in the form prescribed by the Director.  Such
form shall include all information necessary for the computation, collection
and subsequent distribution of the tax as the City may require.  A remittance
for the amount of the tax due shall accompany such return.  Each return shall
be signed by the hotel operator or his duly authorized agent.
   (b)   For the first month that the tax is delinquent, there shall be
assessed by the Director a penalty in the amount of five percent (5%) of the
tax due for the delinquent period.  For each additional month that the tax
remains delinquent, there shall be further assessed an additional one percent
(1%) penalty per month until the tax is paid.  No payment for a subsequent
period shall be collected until all prior delinquent taxes have been paid in
full with all penalties assessed thereto.

sales and of charges, together with a record of the tax collected thereon, and

shall require that they be kept for a longer period.
(Ord.  700.  Passed 1-7-86.)

actually participating in the management or operation of the association or

additions to tax or penalties which may be imposed by Municipal ordinance, may

913.02  RECONSTRUCTION.
   Streets, avenues, roads or alleys not meeting minimum standards of

in its nature, in that it confers a general benefit and advantage on the
property of the whole community to the same extent substantially as on the
property abutting upon or in close proximity to the improvement, or on property
in the area to be assessed, it shall be regarded as a general, as distinguished
from a local improvement, and such improvement shall not be subject to local
assessment.

street, or where a number of cross trenches are laid in close proximity to one
another, or where the equipment used may cause such damage, he may require a
negotiated contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing, in place of
patching of such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probable
damaged area exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the total pavement surfacing
between concrete gutter edges in any block. Such negotiations shall be carried

   (e)    After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the
same be prosecuted with due diligence.

all work accomplished under the provisions of the permit. A certificate of
final inspection shall be issued by the Engineer to each permittee no sooner
than one year after the permanent restoration of the excavation has been made,
provided the work authorized by the permit has been performed according to City
specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the Engineer shall make
a final inspection of the restoration to determine whether City specifications
have been adhered to.
   (h)    If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of one
year from date of completion of the permanent restoration, any expense incurred
by the City in correcting such settlement shall be paid by the permittee or
recovered from his bond, unless the permittee submits proof satisfactory to the
Engineer that the settlement was not due to defective backfilling.
   (i)    In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be considered in the
charge or care of the City, or any of its officers or employees, and no officer
or employee is authorized in any way to take or assume any jurisdiction over
any such opening, except in the exercise of the police power, when it is

all costs, the permittee, shall, upon demand, pay to the City an amount equal
to the deficiency. If the permittee fails or refuses to pay such deficiency,
the City may institute an action to recover the same in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in full, no additional permits
shall be issued to such permittee.
   (d)    Yearly Deposit.  Whenever any public utility, if it does not elect to
file a corporate bond as provided in subsection (a) hereof, or municipal
authority anticipates more than one street opening, sidewalk and curb opening
or excavation, it shall deposit in an amount and form as above for the calendar
year or part thereof to cover the cost of any and all work.
   (e)    Refund.  Upon notification by the permittee that all work authorized
by the permit has been completed, and after restoration of the opening, the
City upon approval by the Engineer shall refund to the permittee his deposit
less all costs incurred by the City in connection with the permit. In no event
shall the permit fee be refunded.

accordance with the requirements of this article. Public utilities and
authorities may submit annually such evidence of insurance coverage in lieu of
individual submissions for each permit.

by reason of such installation of a sewer connection or a sewer before such a
permit is issued. The Director of Public Works shall determine the amount of
such bond.
   (c)    All costs and expenses incidental to the installation, connection and

person approved by the Manager under whose supervision the installation shall
be made.
   (d)    A separate and independent customer service line shall be provided
for every building or series of buildings located on a single parcel of land
owned by the applicant. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new
customer's service lines only when they are found on examination by the
Manager, to meet all requirements of this article.
   (e)    The slope, alignment and materials of construction of a customer
service line, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe,
jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the
requirements of the sanitary sewer specifications used by the Board.  All
customers’ service lines must be a minimum of four inches in diameter and must
be of standard strength vitrified clay pipe provided with ASTM C-425 type
special joints, medium weight ductile iron pipe with o-ring rubber joints,
Class 2400 asbestos-cement pipe, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe meeting
ASTM Specification 2729. Adequate soil cover to protect the service line from
crushing or frost action is required. No customer service line shall be laid in
the same trench with any gas and/or water lines and must be separated by at
least ten feet from any water line. The slope of the customer service line
shall be no less than one-eighth inch per foot. All excavations for customer
service line installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways
and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored

designated by the Manager and shall be made by the Board employees under the
supervision of the Manager.

the same or higher elevation than the invert of the sewer.
   (g)    No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation,
drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a
customer service line or lateral sewer which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a sanitary sewer. Upon determination that this type of connection
has been made, the Board shall cause the owner to  be notified by certified
mail that he shall remove such connections within thirty days. Should the owner
fail to do so, penalties called for under Section
921.99(b) shall be invoked.
   (h)    The applicant for the sewer service permit shall notify the Manager
when the customer service line is ready for inspection and connection to the
public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made by the Manager or his
representative.
   (i)    Except as otherwise provided in this article, each improved property
shall be connected separately and independently with a lateral through an
independent customer service line. Grouping of more than one improved property
on one customer service line shall not be permitted except under special
circumstances and for good sanitary reasons or other good causes shown and then
only after special permission of the Manager as may be prescribed by the Board;
provided, however, a single customer service line may be permitted to multiple
unit property.
   (j)    Where an improved property, at the time connection to a public sewer
is required, is served by its own sewage disposal system or device, the
existing sewer line shall be broken on the structure side of such sewage
disposal system or device and attachment shall be made, with proper fittings,
to continue such sewer line as a customer service line. The Manager may, at his
discretion, permit the utilization of an existing sewer line provided an
inspection discloses that it is reasonably true to grade and alignment and in
good condition. In case of an existing sewer line utilizing a type of sewer
pipe not specified herein, the Manager shall have the right to require the
owner to uncover the full extent of the pipe to determine its condition and may
require its replacement with approved pipe as outlined herein if the inspection
discloses such pipe to be deteriorated in any manner. The cost of replacing the
pipe where necessary, shall be the sole responsibility of the owner thereof.
   (k)    No customer service line shall be covered until it has been inspected
and approved by the Manager or his representative. Every customer service line
shall be maintained in a sanitary and safe operating condition by the owner of
such improved property.
(Ord. 578.  Passed 10-5-82.)
921.07  PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   (a)    Where a sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of
Section
921.03, the customer service line shall be connected to a private sewage
disposal system complying with the provisions of this section.
 
   (b)    Before commencement of construction of a private sewage disposal
system the owner shall first obtain a written permit signed by the Manager. The
application for such permit shall be made on a form furnished by the Board,
which the applicant shall supplement by any plans, specifications and other
information as are deemed necessary by the Manager. A permit and inspection fee
of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be paid to the Board at the time the
application is filed.
 
   (c)    A permit for a private sewage disposal system shall not become
effective until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the
Manager.  He shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction,
and in any event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the Manager when
the work is ready for final inspection and before any underground portions are
covered. The inspection shall be made within forty-eight hours of the receipt
of notice by the Manager.
   (d)    The type, capacities, location and layout of a private sewage
disposal system shall comply with all recommendations of the West Virginia
Department of Health. No permit shall be issued for any private sewage disposal
system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area of the
lot is less than 15,000 square feet. No septic tank or sewage from other
private sewage disposal system shall be permitted to discharge to any sewer or
natural outlet.
   (e)    At any time as a sanitary sewer becomes available to a property
served by a private sewage disposal system, as provided in Section
921.03, a direct connection shall be made to the sanitary sewer in compliance
with this article and any septic tanks or other private sewage disposal
facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable material.
   (f)    The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal
facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the Board.
   (g)    No statement contained in this rule shall be construed to interfere
with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Health Officer
having jurisdiction over private sewage disposal systems.
(Ord. 578. Passed 10-5-82.)
921.08  SEWER USER CHARGES.
   (a)    Sewer user charges or rates, are imposed upon and shall be collected
from the owner of each improved property which shall be connected with the
sanitary sewer system, for use of the sewer system, which such use shall be
direct or indirect. The sewer user charges shall commence and shall be
effective as of the date of connection of each such improved property to the
sewer system, and shall be payable as provided herein.
   (b)    The Manager is authorized to bill the customer for the cost of
services performed at the request of the customer if the solution to the
problem is known or found to be the responsibility of the customer.
   (c)    Every owner of improved property which is connected to the sewer
system shall provide the Board with, and thereafter shall keep the Board
advised of, his or her correct address. Failure of any person to receive bills
for sewer user charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor
shall such failure result in an extension of the period of time during which
the net bill shall be payable.
(Ord. 578.  Passed 10-5-82.)
921.09  DEPOSITS FROM CUSTOMERS.
   (a)    The Board shall require the applicant or customer to make a deposit
initially as a guarantee of the payment for sewer services. Such deposit shall
be one-sixth of the annual estimated charges for service to secure the Board
from loss. The Board shall not be bound to supply sewer service until these
conditions are fulfilled, and it may terminate the service if the guarantee is
not given when required. After the customer has paid bills for service for
twelve consecutive months, the Board shall promptly and automatically refund
the deposit plus accrued interest. Calculation of the twelve month period shall
commence from the first regular payment or following the payment of past-due
bill or bills. Simple interest of eight percent (8%) per annum will be paid at
date of discontinuance of service or at the end of the above return period
provided the deposits remain with the City for a period of six months or
longer. The Board shall have a reasonable time to read and remove meters as
necessary and to ascertain that the obligations of the customer have been fully
performed before being required to return any deposit in any case where there
has been an automatic refund.
   (b)    Concurrently with receiving a cash deposit, the Board shall deliver
to the applicant or customer for service, a receipt showing:
      (1)    The date thereof;
      (2)    The name of the applicant or customer and the address of the
premises to be served or being served;
      (3)    The service to be furnished or being furnished; and
      (4)    The amount of the deposit and the rate of interest to be paid
thereon.

shall discharge to the User's pretreatment facility before connecting with the
POTW. 
   (b)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
      (1)   Compliance. Users must comply with the Categorical Pretreatment
Standards at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N; Parts 405-471 and any amendment
thereto and the same are incorporated herein by reference. 
         A.   Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Utility Manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with Section
923.02(b)(1)E. and F.
         B.   When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Utility Manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
Industrial Users.
         C.     When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard
is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the Utility
Manager shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
         D.   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical
Pretreatment Standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this
Section. 
            1.   Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect
the presence of pollutants in the Industrial User's intake water in accordance
with this Section. Any Industrial User wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the City. Upon request of the Industrial
User, the applicable Standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of subsection (b)(1)D.2. hereof.
            2.   Criteria.
               a.   Either:
                  i.   The applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards
contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be
applied on a net basis; or
                  ii.   The Industrial User demonstrates that the control
system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical Pretreatment
Standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the Standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
               b.   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be
granted unless the Industrial User demonstrates that the constituents of the
generic measure in the User's effluent are substantially similar to the
constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate
additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall
or elsewhere.
               c.   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to
meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), up to a maximum value
equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to
determine eligibility for credits and compliance with Standard(s) adjusted
under this Section.
               d.   Credit shall be granted only if the User demonstrates that
the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the
POTW discharges. The City may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
         E.   When a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in
terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the City
convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Utility
Manager.  The City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial
User meets all the conditions set forth in subsection (b)(1)E.1.a. through e.
hereof.
            1.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User
must:
               a.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water
conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use
during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;
               b.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate
to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard,
and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
               c.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
               d.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the Discharge; and
               e.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User's request
for equivalent mass limits.
            2.   An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must:
               a.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
               b.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the
use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
               c.   Continue to record the facility's production rates and
notify the Utility Manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than twenty percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in
subsection (b)(1)E.1.c. hereof.  Upon notification of a revised production
rate, the Utility Manager will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise
the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
               d.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water
conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant subsection
(b)(1)E.1.a. hereof so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
            3.   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Utility Manager:
               a.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the Industrial
User by the concentration-based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average Standard for
the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
               b.   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will
reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
               c.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the Industrial User's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to
subsection (c)(5)hereof. 
         F.    The Utility Manager may convert the mass limits of the
categorical Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual Industrial Users.  The conversion is at the discretion of the
Utility Manager.  When converting such limits to concentration limits, the
Utility Manager will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts
of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being
substituted for treatment as prohibited by subsection (c)(5) hereof (see 40 CFR
403.6(d)).  In addition, the Utility Manager will document how the equivalent
limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits, or vice
versa, and make this information publicly available (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)).
         G.    Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply
with the equivalent limitations developed in this Section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived.
         H.    Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
         I.    Any Industrial User operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
Standard shall notify the Utility Manager within two (2) business days after
the User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying the
Utility Manager of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate.
   (c)   Local Limits.
      (1)   Authority. The Utility Manager is authorized to establish Local
Limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c).
      (2)   Limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect
against Pass Through and Interference.  No person shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of the following:
   Flow  mgd->0.1 0.1   Limit Basis (lb/day or mg/l) mg/l      lbs/d
 
   BOD5                  300
   Total suspended solids or TSS      300

   Total identifiable chlorinated         1.0
     hydrocarbons
   Total phenols                0.7
   Oil & Grease (Petroleum and/or Mineral)    80.0
   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to
the POTW.  All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal
unless indicated otherwise.  Individual mass limitations for Molybdenum are
fractional amounts of the listed total of 0.38 lbs/day and are based on the
individual industry's contributions.
      (3)   State requirements.  State requirements and limitations on
discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than the
Federal requirements and limitations or those in the article.
      (4)   City's right of revision.  The City reserves the right to establish
by ordinance or in conjunction with the issuance of an individual wastewater
discharge permit more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the
POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives and purposes of this
Article. 
      (5)   Dilution.  No user shall ever increase the use of process water or,
in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in
the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-
specific limitation developed by the City or State.
      (6)   Best management practices. The Utility Manager may develop Best
Management Practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge
permits to implement Local Limits and the requirements of subsection (a)
hereof.  (Ord. 1509.  Passed 11-23-10.)

   (a)   Pretreatment Facilities.  Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this Article and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical Pretreatment Standards, Local Limits, and the prohibitions set out
in Section
923.02(a) within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the
Utility Manager, whichever is more stringent.  Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and  maintained at the User's expense. 
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Utility Manager for review, and shall be acceptable to the
Utility Manger before such facilities are constructed or placed in operation. 
The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the
User from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to
produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this
Article.
   (b)   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Utility Manager may require Users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the User's compliance with the requirements of this article.
      (2)   The Utility Manager may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow.  An
individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Utility Manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users.  All

Manager and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.  Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired as
directed by the Utility Manager by the User at the User's sole cost and
expense.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (c)   Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plans.  The Utility
Manager shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug
discharge control plan or other action to control Slug Discharges.  The Utility
Manager may require any User to develop, submit for approval, and implement
such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control Slug
Discharges.  Alternatively, the Utility Manager may develop such a plan for any
User.  An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a
minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Utility Manager of any
accidental or Slug Discharge, as required by Section
923.06(f); and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug
Discharge.  Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (d)   Hauled Wastewater.
      (1)   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the Utility Manager, and at such times as are established by the
Utility Manager.  Such waste shall not violate Section
923.02 of this Article or any other requirements established by the City.  The
Utility Manager may in his discretion require septic tank waste haulers to
obtain individual wastewater discharge permits.
      (2)   The Utility Manager may in his discretion require haulers of
industrial waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits.  The
Utility Manager may in his discretion require generators of hauled industrial
waste to obtain individual wastewater discharge permits.  The Utility Manager
in his discretion also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. 
The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements
of this article.
      (3)   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the Utility Manager.  No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the Utility Manager.  The Utility Manager may collect samples of
each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable Standards.  The Utility
Manager may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of
any load prior to discharge.
      (4)   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste tracking form for
every load.  This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste.  The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
         (Ord. 1509.  Passed 11-23-10.)
923.04  INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   (a)   Wastewater Analysis.  When requested by the Utility Manager, a User
must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater
within thirty (30) days of the request.  The Utility Manager is authorized to
prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require Users to update
this information.
   (b)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement.
      (1)   No Significant Industrial User shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit  from
the Utility Manager, except that a Significant Industrial User that has filed a
timely application pursuant to subsection (c) hereof may continue to discharge
for the time period specified therein.
      (2)   The Utility Manager in his discretion may require other Users to
obtain individual wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the
purposes of this Article.
      (3)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual
wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this Article and
shall subject the wastewater discharge permittee to the penalties and sanctions
hereinafter set out in this Article.  Obtaining an individual wastewater
discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with
all Federal and State Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or with any other
requirements of Federal, State, and local law.
   (c)   Individual Wastewater Discharge; Permitting: Existing Connections. 
Any User required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who was
discharging wastewater into the POTW pursuant to an individual wastewater
discharge permit issued pursuant to provisions of the prior enactment of this
Article may continue such discharges; provided however, that after the
effective date of this Article and upon expiration of  said individual
wastewater discharge permit, no User shall cause or allow any discharges to the
POTW except in accordance with the provisions of this Article and pursuant to
an individual wastewater discharge permit issued by the Utility Manager
hereunder.   
   (d)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permitting: New Connections.  Any User
required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who proposes to
begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to
the beginning or recommencing of such discharge.  An application for this
individual wastewater discharge permit in accordance with subsection (e)
hereof, must be filed at least 180 days prior to the date upon which any
discharge will begin or recommence.

compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
            3.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the User should measure
the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment
Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the Control Authority;
            4.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
Section
923.06(j) and
923.06(k);
            5.   The Utility Manager may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures;
            6.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
Discharges to the POTW.
         C.   Compliance certification.  A statement, reviewed by the User's
Authorized Representative as defined in Section

and operation of additional pretreatment required for the User to meet the
applicable Pretreatment Standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
      (3)   The User shall submit a progress report to the Utility Manager no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the User to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Utility Manager.
   (c)   Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline.  Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case of a New Source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
User subject to such Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to
the Utility Manager a report containing the information described in Sections
923.04(e)(1)F. and G. and
923.06(a)(2)B.  For Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in Section
923.02(b), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long
term production rate.  For all other Users subject to categorical Pretreatment
Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
User's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.  All
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection
(n)(1) hereof. All sampling will be done in conformance with subsections (j)
and (k) hereof.
   (d)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   All Users must, at a frequency determined by the Utility Manager
submit no less than twice per year (June and December, or on the dates
specified), reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.  In cases
where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management
Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit
documentation required by the Utility Manager or the Pretreatment Standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the User
      (2)   The City may authorize an Industrial User subject to a categorical
Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the Industrial User. (see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)) This
authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
         A.   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         B.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than 5 years.  The User must submit a new request for the waiver before
the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge
permit. See Section
923.04(e)(1)H.
         C.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
         D.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with Section
923.01(e)(2)C., and include the certification statement in subsection (n)(1)
hereof (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)). 
         E.   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
         F.   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Utility Manager must be
included as a condition in the User's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Utility Manager for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.
         G.   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's
permit by the Utility Manager, the Industrial User must certify on each report
with the statement in subsection (n)(3), that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User.
         H.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User's operations,
the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of
subsection (d)(1) hereof, or other more frequent monitoring requirements
imposed by the Utility Manager, and notify the Utility Manager.
         I.   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.
      (3)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with subsection (n)(1) hereof.
      (4)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User's
discharge.  Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times.  The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (5)   If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Utility Manager, using the procedures
prescribed in subsection (j) and (k) hereof, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in the report.
      (6)   Users that send electronic (digital) documents to the City to
satisfy the requirements of this Section must comply with the provisions of
West Va. Code 39A-3-1 et seq., the Digital Signature State Electronic Records
Transaction Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of
State of West Virginia thereunder.
   (e)   Reports of Changed Conditions.  Each User must notify the Utility
Manager of any significant changes to the User's operations or system which
might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ninety
(90) days before the change.
      (1)   The Utility Manager may require the User to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section
923.04(e).
      (2)   The Utility Manager may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit under Section
923.05(g) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section
923.05(d) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
   (f)   Reports of Potential Problems, Accidental Discharges,  Notice to
Employees.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately telephone and
notify the Utility Manager and the POTW treatment plant Superintendent of the
incident.  This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by
the User.
      (2)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall,
unless waived by the Utility Manager, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
User to prevent similar future occurrences.  Such notification shall not
relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might
be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of
any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
article. 
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (f)(1) hereof.  Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Utility
Manager immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for
a Slug Discharge. 
   (g)   Reports from Unpermitted Users.   All Users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Utility Manager as he may require.
   (h)   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting.  If sampling
performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Utility
Manager within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation.  The
User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Utility Manager within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violation. Resampling by the Industrial User is not required if
the City performs sampling at the User's facility at least once a month, or if
the City performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial
sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the City receives the
results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling and
analysis in lieu of the Industrial User.
   (i)   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
      (1)   Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the Utility Manager, the  POTW treatment plant Superintendent, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste
authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which,
if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. 
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in
40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other).  If the User discharges more than 100 kilograms
of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall
contain the following information to the extent such information is known and
readily available to the User:  an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be
discharged during the following twelve (12) months.  All notifications must
take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences.  Any
notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged.  However, notifications of changed conditions must
be submitted under subsection (e) hereof.  The notification requirement in this
Section does not apply to pollutants already reported by Users subject to
categorical Pretreatment Standards under the self monitoring requirements of
subsections (a), (c) and (d) hereof.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1)
hereof, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of  hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).  Discharge of more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one time notification.  Subsequent months during which
the User discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must notify the Utility
Manager, the POTW treatment plant Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of
the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date
of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the User
shall certify that it  has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Article, a permit issued
hereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
   (j)   Analytical Requirements.  All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard.  If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the Utility Manager or other parties approved by EPA.
   (k)   Sample Collection.  Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
      (1)   Except as indicated in subsections (k)(2) and (3) hereof, the User
must collect wastewater samples using 24 hour flow proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Utility Manager.  Where time proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must
be representative of the discharge.  Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24 hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
Instantaneous Limits. 
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90 day
compliance reports required in subsections (a) and (c) hereof (40 CFR 403.12(b)
and (d)), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the Utility Manager may authorize
a lower minimum. For the reports required by  subsection (d) hereof (40 CFR
403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to collect the number
of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. 
   (l)   Date of Receipt of Reports.  Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked.  For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (m)   Recordkeeping.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this article, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under
Section
923.02(c)(6).  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses.  These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years.  This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User
or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Utility Manager. 
   (n)   Certification Statements.
      (1)   Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial
monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to be
signed and submitted by Users submitting permit applications in accordance with
Section
923.04(g); Users submitting baseline monitoring reports under subsection (a)
(2)E.; Users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical Pretreatment
Standard deadlines under subsection (c) hereof; Users submitting periodic
compliance reports required by subsection (d)(1) to (4) hereof;  and Users
submitting an initial request to forego sampling of a pollutant on the basis of
subsection (d)(2)D. hereof. The following certification statement must be
signed by an Authorized Representative as defined in Section
923.01(e)(2)C.
      I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments

      (3)   Certification of pollutants not present.  Users that have an
approved monitoring waiver based on subsection (d)(2) must certify on each
report with the following statement that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the User.
      Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR _______ (specify
applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)), I certify that, to the best
of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of ______
(list pollutant(s)) in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility
since filing of the last periodic report under subsection (d)(1) hereof.
            (Ord. 1509.  Passed 11-23-10.)
923.07  COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (a)   Right of Entry:  Inspection and Sampling.  The Utility Manager shall
have the right to enter the premises of any User to determine whether the User
is complying with all requirements of this article and any individual
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.  Users shall allow the
Utility Manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a User has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the User shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Utility Manager shall be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The Utility Manager shall have the right to set up on the User's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the User's operations.
      (3)   The Utility Manager may require the User to install monitoring
equipment as necessary.  The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the User
at its own expense. 
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
User at the written or oral request of the Utility Manager and shall not be
replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the User.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Utility Manager access to the
User's premises shall be a violation of this Article.
      (6)   The location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in
or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples and analysis and whether constructed on public or private property, the
monitoring facilities should be provided in accordance with the Utility
Manager's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications, and such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such
manner so as to enable the Utility Manager to perform independent monitoring
activities.
   (b)   Search Warrants.  If the Utility Manager has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
Article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with
this Article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, the Utility Manager with
the assistance of the City of Fairmont Police Department may seek issuance of a
search warrant from the Municipal Court for the City of Fairmont or the
Magistrate Court of Marion County.
(Ord. 1509.  Passed 11-23-10.)
923.08  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a User obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the Utility Manager's inspection and sampling
activities, shall be deemed public records as defined by West Va. Code 29B-1-2,
unless the User specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Utility Manager, that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets under West Va. Code 29B-1-4(a)(1).  Any such request must be
asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.  When requested
and demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such information should
be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental
agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.  Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR
2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be
available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. 1509.  Passed 11-23-10.)
923.09  PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Utility Manager shall cause to be published annually, in a newspaper of
general circulation in Marion County, West Virginia,  a list of the Users
which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in Significant
Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.  The
term “Significant Noncompliance” shall be applicable to all Significant
Industrial Users (or any other Industrial User that violates paragraphs (c),
(d) or (h) of this Section) and shall mean:
   (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
Instantaneous Limits as defined in Section
923.02;
   (b)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6 ) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including
Instantaneous Limits, as defined by Section
923.02 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (c)   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by Section
923.02 (Daily Maximum, long term average, Instantaneous Limit, or narrative
standard) that the Utility Manager determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, Interference or Pass Through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (d)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Utility Manager’s
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (e)   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
   (f)   Failure to provide within forty five (45) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic self monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (g)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (h)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best
Management Practices, which the Utility Manager determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
      (Ord. 1509.  Passed 11-23-09.)
923.10  ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Notification of Violation.  When the Utility Manager finds that a User
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Utility Manager may serve upon that
User a written Notice of Violation.  Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the User to the Utility Manager.  Submission of such a plan in
no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the Notice of Violation.  Nothing in this Section shall limit
the authority of the Utility Manager to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of
Violation.
   (b)   Consent Orders.  The Utility Manager may enter into Consent Orders,
assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include
specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document.  Such documents shall have the same
force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections
923.10(d) and
923.10(e) and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing.  The Utility Manager may order a User which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Utility Manager and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  Notice
shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. 
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the
hearing.  Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the
User as defined in Section
 923.01(e)(2)C. and required by Section
923.04(f)(1).  A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the User.
   (d)   Compliance Orders.  When the Utility Manager finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Utility Manager may issue an order to
the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into
compliance within a specified time.  If the User does not come into compliance
within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated.  Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer.  A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation.  Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   (e)   Cease and Desist Orders.  When the Utility Manager finds that a User
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User's past violations are
likely to recur, the Utility Manager may issue an order to the User directing
it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.  Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
   (f)   Emergency Suspensions.  The Utility Manager may immediately suspend a
User's discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably
appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons.  The Utility Manager may also immediately suspend
a User's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution.  In the event of a User's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Utility Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals.  The Utility Manager
may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Utility Manager that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (g) hereof are
initiated against the User.
      (2)   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Utility Manager prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under subsections (e) or (g) hereof.
   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any Emergency Suspension under this Section.
   (g)   Termination of Discharge.  In addition to the provisions in Section
923.05(f), any User who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section
923.02.
   Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) hereof why the
proposed action should not be taken.   
(Ord. 1509.  Passed 11-23-10.)
923.11  JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Injunctive Relief.  When the Utility Manager finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Utility Manager may petition the
Circuit Court of Marion County, West Virginia through the City's or Sanitary
Board's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by
this article on activities of the User.  The Utility Manager  may also seek
such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation. 
   (b)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be liable to
the City for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
violation per day.  In the case of a monthly or other long term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
      (2)   The Utility Manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the City.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the User's violation, corrective
actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
   (c)   Criminal Prosecution.
      (1)   A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not of not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day of violation or
by imprisonment in jail for a period not exceeding six months, or by both such
fine and imprisonment.
      (2)   A User who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by  a fine of not less than two thousand five hundred
dollars ($2,500) nor more than twenty-five thousand  dollars ($25,000) per day
of violation or by imprisonment in jail not exceeding one year, or by both such
fine and imprisonment. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of
action for personal injury or property damage available under State law.
      (3)   A User who knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article,
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who
falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device
or method required under this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punished
by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000)  nor more than ten
thousand dollars ($10,000), or by imprisonment in jail not exceeding six
months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
   (d)   Remedies Non-cumulative and Nonexclusive.  The remedies provided for
in this Article are not exclusive.  The Utility Manager may take any, all, or
any combination of these actions against a noncompliant User.  Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City's
enforcement response plan.  However, the Utility Manager may take other action
against any User when the circumstances warrant.  Further, the Utility Manager
is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
User.  Use of any one particular remedy shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action or utilizing any other remedy against
any User which may otherwise be available. 
(Ord. 1509.  Passed 11-23-10.)
923.12  SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (a)   Late fee.  A late fee shall be assessed to any User for each day that
a report required by this Article, a permit or order issued hereunder is late,
beginning five days after the date the report is due. Actions taken by the
Utility Manager to collect late reporting penalties shall not limit the Utility
Manager's authority to initiate other enforcement actions that may include
penalties for late reporting violations.
   (b)   Performance Bonds.  The Utility Manager may decline to issue or
reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any User who has failed to
comply with any provision of this Article, a previous individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard
or Requirement, unless such User first files a satisfactory bond, with or
without corporate surety, payable to the City, in a penal sum not to exceed a
value determined by the Utility Manager to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
   (c)   Liability Insurance.  The Utility Manager may decline to issue or
reissue an individual wastewater discharge to any User who has failed to comply
with any provision of this Article, a previous individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, unless the User first submits proof that it has obtained financial
assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its
discharge.
   (d)   Payment of Outstanding Fees and Penalties.  The Utility Manager may
decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any
User who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as
a result of any provision of this Article, a previous individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder.
   (e)   Water Supply Severance.  Subject to the Rules and Regulations for the
Government of Sewer Utilities promulgated by the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia, whenever a User has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this Article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, water
service to the User may be terminated.  Service will recommence, at the User's
expense as provided in the City's approved water and sewer tariffs, only after
the User has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   (f)   Public Nuisances.  A violation of any provision of this Article, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Utility Manager. 
   (g)   Contractor Listing.  Users which have not achieved compliance with
applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements are not eligible to receive
a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the City.  (Ord.
1509.  Passed 11-23-10.)
923.13  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this Section, “upset” means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the User.  An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the
requirements of subsection (a)(3) hereof, are met.
      (3)   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         B.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         C.   The User has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset [if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five (5) days]:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (b)   Prohibited Discharge Standards.  A User shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in Section
923.02(a)(1) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that
its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
would cause Pass Through or Interference and that either:
      (1)   A Local Limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the Pass Through
or Interference; or
      (2)   No Local Limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge when
the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
Interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (c)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this Section,
         A.   “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a User's treatment facility.
         B.   Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.  Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of subsections (c)(3) and (4) hereof.
      (3)   Bypass notifications.
         A.   If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Utility Manager, at least ten (10) days before the
date of the bypass, if possible. 
         B.   A User shall submit oral notice to the Utility Manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within
twenty four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.  A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User
becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The Utility Manager
may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has
been received within twenty four (24) hours.
      (4)   Bypass.
         A.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Utility Manager may take an
enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The User submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3)
hereof.
         B.   The Utility Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Utility Manager determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)A. hereof.

established, the minimum charge for sanitary sewer service shall be ten dollars
and thirty-one cents ($10.31) per month.
      (5)   Delayed payment penalty.  The above rates are net.  On all current
usage billings not paid within twenty (20) days ten percent (10%) will be added
to the net current amount unpaid.  This delayed penalty payment is not interest
and is to be collected only once for each bill where it is appropriate.
The Finance Director shall insure and provide for collection in the following
manner:
         A.   The manner provided for the collection of delinquent water
utility service charges shall be the manner in which delinquent sanitary sewer
service charges shall be collected, to-wit, discontinuing water after notice.
         B.   All sanitary sewer service fees shall be billed simultaneously
and upon the same bill as water utility service.
         C.   No customer shall be permitted to pay for only water utility
service in order to avoid termination of sewer coverage.
         D.   No person, firm or corporation shall receive sewer service
without paying the lawful charges therefor, and it shall be the duty of the
Director to institute appropriate criminal proceedings in the Municipal Court
for all violations.
      (6)   Service connection charge.  A fee of two hundred and fifty dollars
($250.00) shall be charged new customers connecting to the sewage system.  The
increase in the service connection charge shall become effective 60 days after
the date of the adoption of this section.
      (7)   Re-connection service charge.  In the event water service is
terminated due to nonpayment of a sanitary sewer bill, a twenty-five dollar
($25.00) re-connection fee shall be paid in addition to the delinquent sanitary
sewer charges prior to restoration of water service.  Customers of the Fairmont
Water Department shall be exempt from such re-connection fee.
      (8)   Bimonthly or quarterly billing.  The above rates and charges may be
adjusted to a bimonthly or quarterly basis, providing no lower charges.
      (9)   Alternative measurement of sewage.  Customers having water use
which results in a substantial portion of the water purchased not being
discharged into the sanitary sewer system shall be entitled, at the option and
sole cost of the customer, to request the Sanitary Sewer Board to purchase and
install special meters to measure the volume of waste water discharged into the
sanitary sewer system.  The customer shall advance to the Sanitary Sewer Board
on demand, the Sanitary Sewer Board’s estimated cost of purchasing and
installing the meter and upon installation of such waste discharge meter the
rates of such customer shall be based upon the volume of waste discharged into
the system rather than upon the volume of water purchased by the customer.
   (b)   Industrial Service, Schedule 2.
      (1)   Applicability.  Applicable in the entire territory or area served.
      (2)   Availability.  Available for non-connected industrial service.
      (3)   Rate.  The charge for the treatment of industrial waste shall be
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
Ci = VoVi - BoBi + SoSi
Ci = charge to industrial users per year.
Vo = average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume in
dollars per gallon.
Vi = volume of waste water from industrial users, in gallons per year.
Bo = average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen Demand
(BOD), in dollars per pound.
Bi = weight of BOD from industrial users, in pounds per year.
So = average unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment) chargeable to
total solids, in dollars per pound.
Si = weight of total solids from industrial users, in pounds per year.
   When an industrial user is to be served, a preliminary study of its waste,
and the cost of transport and treatment thereof, shall be made.  Waste
containing materials, which in the judgment of the Sanitary Sewer Board should
not be introduced into the sewer system need not be handled by it.  The results
of this preliminary study shall be used to determine the feasibility of the
proposed sewer service and the charge therefor, based upon the formula set out
above.  Thereafter, industrial sewage shall be monitored on a regular basis and
at the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the aforesaid investigation and
audit of the Sanitary Sewer Board records, new cost figures shall be calculated
for use on the above formula.  The cost of establishing the monitoring
facilities shall be paid by the industrial user.  Based on these audited
figures, additional billings covering the past fiscal year shall be made for
payment by each industrial user, or refund given by the Sanitary Sewer Board,
as the case may be.  Such audited figures shall then be used for the
preliminary billing for the next fiscal year, at the end of which an adjustment
shall be made as aforesaid.
   (c)   Bulk Service, Schedule 3.
      (1)   Applicability. Applicable in the entire territory or area served.

become effective 60 days from the date of the adoption of this section and
shall continue until changed by subsequent ordinance.
   (d)   Effective Date.  The rates, fees and charges herein established shall
become effective 60 days from the date of adoption of this section and shall
continue until changed by subsequent ordinance.
   (e)   Severability.  The provisions of this section are severable, and if
any provisions or part thereof shall be deemed invalid or unconstitutional or
inapplicable to any person or circumstances, such invalidity,
unconstitutionality or inapplicability shall not affect or impair the remaining
provisions of this section.
   (f)   Savings Clause.  The provisions of Ordinance No. 1200 duly adopted on
the 12th day of November, 2002, and the rates, fees and charges for sanitary
sewer services established thereby for the Meredith Springs/Dakota Extension be
and are hereby saved and the same shall remain in full force and effect and the
provisions of said section shall in no way be altered or amended by this
section. 
(Ord. 1339.  Passed 3-14-06.)
925.03  FREE SERVICES PROHIBITED.
   The City shall not render or cause to be rendered any free services of any
nature by the sewer facilities, nor shall any preferential rates be established
for users of the same class; and in the event the City or any department,
agency, instrumentality, officer or employee thereof shall avail itself or
themselves of the facilities or services provided by the sewer facilities, or
any part thereof, the same rates, fees or charges applicable to other customers

925.05  NO LIABILITY OF CITY; RIGHT TO RESTRICT SERVICES.
   The City shall not be liable for any damage resulting from bursting or
breakage of any sewer main, pipe, valve, equipment or part, or from
discontinuance of the operation of any part of the sewer facilities, or from
failure of any part thereof for any cause whatsoever.  In case of emergency,
the City shall have the right to restrict the use of any part of the sewer
facilities in any reasonable manner for the protection of the City, the
inhabitants thereof and the sewer facilities.

pressure vacuum breaker, reduced pressure principle assembly, and residential
dual check.
      (1)   Air gap:  A physical separation sufficient to prevent backflow
between the free flowing discharge end of the potable water system and any
other system. Physically defined as a distance equal to twice the diameter of
the supply side pipe diameter but never less than one (1) inch.
      (2)   Atmospheric vacuum breaker: A device which prevents backflow by
creating an atmospheric vent when there is either a negative pressure or sub-
atmospheric pressure in a water system.
      (3)   Barometric loop:  A fabricated piping arrangement rising at least
thirty- five (35) feet at its topmost point above the highest fixture it
supplies. It is utilized in water supply systems to protect against back-
siphonage.
      (4)   Double check valve assembly:  An assembly of two (2) independently
operating spring loaded check valves with tightly closing shut-off valves on
each side of the check valves, and properly located test cocks for the testing
of each check valve.
      (5)   Double check valve with intermediate atmospheric vent: A device
having two (2) spring loaded check valves separated by an atmospheric vent
chamber.
      (6)   Hose bibb vacuum breaker:  A device attached to a hose bibb and
which acts as an atmospheric vacuum breaker.
      (7)   Pressure vacuum breaker:  An assembly containing an independently
operated spring loaded check valve and an independently operated spring loaded

connection to which drinking water is delivered by a public water system. A
customer may also be identified as an owner.
   (n)   Degree of Hazard:  The degree of hazard is the potential risk to
health and the potential adverse effects upon the public water system based on
the probability of backflow occurring and the type or nature of the
contaminant. A health hazard is any condition, device or practice which creates
or may create a danger to health and well being of the water consumer. A severe
health hazard is any health hazard (contaminant) that could be expected to
result in significant morbidity or death. A non-health hazard (pollutant) is
any condition that could degrade the quality or adversely affect the public
water system.

protected by containment, the owner shall be responsible for the installation
and maintenance of the required backflow preventer assembly(blies) and for
water quality beyond the outlet end of the containment assembly(blies) and
could utilize fixture isolation protection for that purpose. The owner may also
seek local public health officials, or personnel from the Water Purveyor, or
their designated representatives, or certified /licensed private sector
personnel to assist in the survey of their facility(ties) and to assist in the
selection of proper containment assemblies and/or fixture isolation devices,
and the proper installation of these assemblies/devices.
(Ord. 1305.  Passed 5-10-05.)
931.06  REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Water Purveyor.
      (1)   On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide an on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer assembly(blies), if any, that will be required based on
actual or potential cross-connections and the degree of health hazards.
      (2)   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the Water
Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises for
actual and potential cross-connections and backflow conditions and inform the
owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the method of
achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made.
Ordinarily, ninety (90) days will be allowed; however, this time period may be
shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the
device(s)/ assembly(blies) already in place.
      (3)   The Water Purveyor will not allow any actual or potential cross-
connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved air gap or backflow
preventer assembly(blies) and which must be regularly tested or inspected to
insure satisfactory operation.
      (4)   The Water Purveyor shall inform the owner by letter, of any failure
to comply, prior to a re-inspection. The Water Purveyor will allow an
additional fifteen (15) days for the correction(s). In the event the owner
fails to comply with the necessary correction(s) by the time of a second re-
inspection, the Water Purveyor will inform the owner by letter, that the water
service to the owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to
exceed five (5) days. In the event that the owner informs the Water Purveyor of
extenuating circumstances as to why the correction(s) has not been made, a time
extension may be granted by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will it exceed
an additional thirty (30) days.
      (5)   If the Water Purveyor determines at anytime that a serious threat
to the public health exists, water service will be terminated immediately.
      (6)   The Water Purveyor will conduct initial and follow-up premise
inspections to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards. The main
focus will be on high hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (7)   The Water Purveyor must report any backflow incident(s) occurring
in the public water system as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four
hours (24) after the incident to the WVBPH.
   (b)   Owner.
      (1)   The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
all actual or potential cross-connections and/or backflow conditions on said
owner’s premises.
      (2)   The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Water
Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested,
any and all backflow preventer assemblies on the premises.
      (3)   The owner shall correct within thirty (30) days any malfunction of
an air gap or backflow preventer assembly(blies) which is revealed by periodic
inspection or testing.  This may also involve the removal and/or replacement of
the backflow preventer assembly(blies).
      (4)   The owner shall inform the Water Purveyor of any proposed or
modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the
owner is aware, but have not been found by the Water Purveyor.
      (5)   The owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow preventer
assembly unless there is a backflow preventer assembly of the same type on the
bypass.  Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the assembly
(blies) must supply additional assemblies necessary to allow testing to take
place.
      (6)   The owner shall install only backflow preventer assemblies approved
by the Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
      (7)   The owner shall install backflow preventer assemblies in a manner
approved by the Water Purveyor and general industry standards.
      (8)   Any owner having a private well or other auxiliary water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor's system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer assembly at the service entrance if a private water source is
maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor's system.
      (9)   In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor's side of a backflow
preventer assembly, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer assembly
installed.
      (10)   The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
service, permits, periodic assembly testing, re-testing in the case that a
backflow preventer assembly fails to operate correctly, and follow up re-
inspections for non-compliance with Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
      (11)   The owner must maintain for a minimum of three (3) years records
of installation and removal, all testing, repair and maintenance for all
assemblies/devices in the owner's water distribution system(s).
      (12)   The owner will report any backflow incident(s) occurring in their
facility(ties)/building(s) as soon as possible but no later then twenty-four
hours (24) after the incident to the Water Purveyor and to the WVBPH. Also, the
owner must maintain for a minimum of three (3) years all records and reports of
all backflow incidents occurring in their facility(ties)/building(s). These
records and reports are to be made available to the Water Purveyor and/or WVBPH
upon request.
         (Ord. 1305.  Passed 5-10-05.)
931.07  DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross-connections and backflow conditions. All threats will be classified
by degree of hazard which will determine the requirements for the installation
of approved backflow preventer assemblies. 
(Ord. 1305.  Passed 5-10-05.) 
931.08  EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing approved backflow preventer assembly shall be allowed by the
Water Purveyor to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to
supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer assembly, or
there is an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard
has increased as in the case of a residential installation converting to a
business establishment, any existing backflow preventer assemblies must be
upgraded to a reduced pressure principle assembly, or a reduced pressure
principle assembly must be installed in the event that no backflow preventer
assembly is present.
(Ord. 1305.  Passed 5-10-05.)
931.09  PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)   Backflow preventer assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
   (b)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This
testing will be done at the owner's expense.
   (c)   Any backflow preventer assembly which fails during a periodic test
will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of
the repair, the assembly will be retested at the owner's expense to insure
correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue
unprotected if the backflow preventer assembly fails the periodic test and
cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than thirty (30) days after the test date may be established. The owner is
responsible for the costs of all testing, repair service, replacement parts, or
a replacement assembly. Parallel installation of two (2) assemblies is an
effective means of the owner insuring uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of one of the assemblies and is strongly recommended when the
owner desires such continuity.
   (d)   Backflow preventer assemblies will be tested more frequently than
specified in subsection (a)  above in cases where there is a history of test
failures and the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard involved
additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by
the owner.
(Ord. 1305.  Passed 5-10-05.)
931.10  RECORDS.
   (a)   The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain (update) the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer evaluations and/or inspections of cross-
connections and backflow conditions;
      (2)   Master files on all customer backflow preventer assemblies;
      (3)   Master files on customer backflow preventer tests, repairs and
replacements. Records for replaced backflow preventer assemblies shall be
maintained for a period of one (1) year after date of removal from service;
      (4)   Records and reports of any backflow incident(s) occurring in the
public or consumer water systems shall be maintained for at least three (3)
years after the date of the incident; and
      (5)   Copies of any of the above and other records and/or reports
supplied to the WVBPH. This Material shall be maintained for at least three (3)
years after submission.
   (b)   Upon request, the Water Purveyor will submit records of inspection and
noncompliance, surveys, tests results and/or corrective actions, and backflow
incident reports to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health.

required under Federal and/or State law as well as a reduction of  the average
post-development total suspended solids and phosphorus load that may be
determined by the Director.
   (g)    No activity shall be conducted in a manner that will negatively
impact the water environment in the vicinity of such activity or in other
areas, regardless of whether this impact is manifested by flow restrictions,
increased runoff, diminishing channel or floodplain storage capacity, harm to
aquatic life or any other manifestation of negative impact. 
   (h)    New construction or reconstruction shall be permitted only after
temporary or permanent erosion and sediment control management practices have
been placed and are operational to the satisfaction of the Director.  The
Director may halt construction, void a permit, or take other enforcement
actions consistent with this article upon a finding of inadequate erosion and
sediment control management practices upon a site or property subject to the
provisions of this article. 
   (i)    All active construction sites shall be inspected by the owner no less
than weekly and within 24 hours after any on-site rain event to ensure and
verify effective erosion and sediment control.  The owner shall maintain
records of these inspections.  The Director may halt construction on properties
that do not provide satisfactory documentation of compliance with this
requirement and may increase inspection frequency where noncompliance is
suspected with applicable requirements.
   (j)    Waivers for Providing Stormwater Management.
      (1)   Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required
by this article unless a written waiver is granted by the Director.  A written
request for waiver must be submitted to the Director on the prescribed form.
      (2)   Any stormwater management requirement beyond that described in
Section
941.15(g) may be waived by the Director, if the Director finds that meeting the
minimum on-site stormwater requirement is not feasible due to the unique nature
or existing physical characteristics of a site, or that the property owner
would suffer an undue hardship if required to meet the full measure of any such
requirement.  To be eligible for a waiver, the Applicant must also demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Director that the waiver will not result in any of
the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
         A.     Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
         B.     Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         C.     Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or
         D.     Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and/or
property.
      (3)   Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site stormwater
management is waived, the Applicant shall satisfy stormwater management
requirements by: (1) accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the
Director; or (2) making a payment in accordance with subsection (k) (Fee in
Lieu of Stormwater Management) below.  Mitigation measures may include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.    Alternative means for on-site management of stormwater
discharges that have been established in a stormwater management plan that has
been approved by the Director.
         B.     The creation of appropriately designed and constructed
stormwater management facility or drainage improvements on other properties,
public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities.  This
alternative facility must provide a level of stormwater control that is equal
to or greater than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices
and there must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long- term
operation and maintenance of the off-site practice.  The Director shall, to the
maximum extent practicable, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site 
practice shall be realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management
practice. 
         C.     The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City
of Fairmont or the grant of an easement to the City of Fairmont or the Sanitary
Board for the City of Fairmont, to be dedicated to preservation, reforestation,
and/or the creation of green space, wetlands, or permanent buffer areas to
protect water quality and aquatic habitat.   
   Any mitigation measure shall provide a level of environmental protection
and/or improvement that is, in the sole discretion of the Director,
approximately equal to or greater than that which would have been provided by
the waived practice.
   (k)    Fee in Lieu of Stormwater Management Practices.  Where all or a part
of the minimum stormwater management requirements have been waived, and the
Applicant does not complete an approved mitigation project, the Applicant shall
be required to pay a fee in lieu of stormwater management practices, in an
amount as determined by the Director.  This amount shall be equal to the cost
of stormwater management and based on sound engineering practices and on the
cubic feet of storage required for stormwater management of the development in
question.  All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an
appropriate storm water capital improvement program project, and shall be made
by the Applicant prior to the issuance of any stormwater permit for the
development.

      (6)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the residents, real property
owners and its governmental units by preventing the unwise design and
construction of development in areas subject to flooding.
   (b)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  This ordinance supersedes any
other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas.  However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and
effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive.  If there is
any conflict between any of the provisions of this Ordinance, the more
restrictive shall apply.
   (c)   Applicability.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any contractor, person, partnership,
business, or corporation to undertake or cause to be undertaken, any
development, new construction, substantial improvement, repair of substantial
damage, other repairs, or the placement or relocation of any structure
(including manufactured homes) within the City of Fairmont unless a permit
application has been completed and a permit has been obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator.  In addition, where land is partially or fully in the
Floodplain is to be developed, subdivided, utilized for a manufactured home
park or subdivision or otherwise developed, a site plan with elevation data
must be submitted to, and approved by, the Floodplain Administrator prior to
any development.
      (2)   Provision of all other codes, ordinances, and regulations shall be
applicable insofar as they are consistent with the provisions of this Ordinance
and the City's need to minimize the hazards and damage resulting from flooding.
   (d)   Matters Not Provided for Specifically.  Where conditions are
encountered that are not specifically provided for herein, the Floodplain
Administrator shall determine the applicability of the provisions of this
Ordinance in accordance with its intent and shall require the applicant to take
appropriate measures pursuant to such determination.
(Ord.  1803.  Passed 3-12-19.)
   1765.02   INTERPRETATIONS AND DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Definitions.  Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases
used in this Ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give this Ordinance it's
most reasonable application.
      (1)   "Adjacent Property"
Adjacent Property includes any surface tract, regardless of whether such
surface tract is entirely within City of Fairmont, so long as a portion of said
surface tract is located within City of Fairmont, which shares an immediate and
common boundary up or down stream to the property that is the subject of the
application for Floodplain Permit.  Adjacent property also includes all other
property that may be affected by flooding.
      (2)   "Adversely Affect Adjacent Properties"
To adversely affect a property the increase in the elevation of the 100-year
base flood elevation must be more than 1 foot at any point.  Stated conversely,
if the effect is that the 100-year flood base flood elevation rises 1 foot or
less the property is not "affected".  This standard does not apply to the
Floodway.  If prior permit(s) has/have been approved in the same area of the
Floodplain, the above definition would include the cumulative impact to the
base flood elevation.
      (3)   Appurtenant Structure
A structure on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the
use of which is incidental and used for storage only to the use of the
principal structure.  This does not include a gas or liquid storage tank. These
structures cannot be used as living space.
      (4)   Base Flood 
Means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year.
      (5)   Base Flood Elevation (BFE)
The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the datum
specified on the County's Flood Insurance Rate Map.  For the purposes of this
Ordinance, the one hundred (100) year flood or 1% or greater chance of flooding
in any given year. (See 100 year flood also)
      (6)   Basement
Any area of the building having its floor sub grade (below ground level) on all
sides.
      (7)   Certificate of Compliance
A certification that the entire development, including the elevation of fill or
the lowest floor of a structure is in compliance with all the provisions of
this Ordinance.
      (8)   Compensatory storage
An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent volume of storage within
the special flood hazard area used to balance the loss of natural flood storage
when artificial fill or structures are placed within the special flood hazard
area.
      (9)   Contractor - W.Va. Code §21-11-3(c)

another, undertakes, offers to undertake, purports to have the capacity to
undertake, or submits a bid to construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from,
improve, move, wreck or demolish any building, highway, road, railroad,
structure or excavation associated with a project, development or improvement,
or to do any part thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other
structures or works in connection therewith, where the cost of undertaking is
two thousand five hundred dollars or more.  Contractor includes a construction
manager who performs management and counseling services on a construction
project for a professional fee.
         Contractor does not include:
         A.   One who merely furnishes materials or supplies without
fabricating or consuming them in the construction project;
         B.   A person who personally performs construction work on the site of
real property which the person owns or leases whether for commercial or
residential purposes;

of this Ordinance, or if full compliance is not possible, to reduce the adverse
impact of the non-compliance to the greatest extent feasible.
      (39)   Special Flood Hazard Area
The land in the Floodplain Area subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood Insurance Studies and on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30, and A99.  The term includes
areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically listed or
otherwise described in this Ordinance.
      (40)   Start of Construction
(The definition for start of construction is to be used only when calculating
the starting time for expiration of a Floodplain Permit.)
The date the Floodplain Permit was issued, including Floodplain Permit for
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the Floodplain Permit
date.  The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.  Although
a Floodplain Permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For an alteration, the
actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.
      (41)   State Coordinating Office
The West Virginia Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
      (42)   Stream
As defined in West Virginia Code §7-1-3u, any watercourse, whether natural or
man-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of its size, through
which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of its volume.
      (43)   Structure
A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is
principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (44)   Subdivision
Development that includes a creation of individual land parcels for future
sale.  It does not include development where rights-of-way or easements are
obtained and recorded.
      (45)   Subject Property
"Subject property" includes the surface tract(s) upon which the proposed
development is planned and for which the Floodplain Permit Application is
submitted.
      (46)   Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to its before damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of
the fair market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
      (47)   Substantial Improvement
Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the fair market
value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed.  The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation(s) of State or Local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code
Specifications which have been identified by the Local Code Enforcement
Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all Ordinance
requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.  Documentation that a specific Ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer.  Any exemption from
Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences whether or not the alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (48)   Top of Bank
The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of a stream indicate
the top of the bank.  In the field a professional familiar with fluvial
geomorphology should document the top of the bank.  When a professional is not
employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is followed by at least
50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (49)   Variance
A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management
regulation.
      (50)   Violation
The failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant with all
requirements of this Ordinance.  A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required by this Ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided. No future improvements or developments can be
made to structures found to be in violation unless the development is to bring
the structure into compliance with the current ordinance.  (Ord.  1803.  Passed
3-12-19.)
   1765.03   ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Fairmont which are subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and
described in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for City of Fairmont by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated June 19, 2012, and April
05, 2019 or the most recent revision thereof including all digital data
developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas which have been identified as flood hazard areas by
City of Fairmont by use of historic or other technical data and shown on an
officially recognized "FIRM or the West Virginia Flood Hazard Determination
Tool Specifically Advisory Flood Height data. These areas shall be designated
as appropriate with the level of technical data described below and shall be
managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas.  The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area. 
      (3)   The AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided
      (5)   The AO and AH floodplain those areas identified as Zones AO and AH
on the FIRM and in the FIS.  These areas are subject to inundation by 1-
percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and
three feet.  In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by City of Fairmont where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes.  However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   The City of Fairmont's base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions.  As
soon as practical but, not later than six months from the date such information
becomes available, the City shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting
technical or scientific data.
      (3)   City of Fairmont may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
ponding areas.  These areas shall be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map"
using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high-water marks and/or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is at
or above the Base Flood Elevation, and the following is provided to the
Floodplain Administrator:
         A.   elevation information and a site plan demonstrating that all
proposed development will occur above the Base Flood Elevation or,
         B.   a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA removing the site from
the SHFA then the site shall be considered to be outside the Floodplain Area
and shall not be required to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation, the site shall be considered to be within the
Floodplain Area and the proposed structure shall be required to conform to all
appropriate provisions of this Ordinance.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals  sitting as the "Floodplain Appeals Board."  The burden of proof shall
be on the appellant/applicant.
(Ord.  1803.  Passed 3-12-19; Ord.  1811.  Passed 4-23-19; Ord.  1816.  Passed
5-14-19.)
   1765.04   UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.  Within any Floodway Area (F1), no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property due to
their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere.  In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the Floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (4)   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant  amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the City
of Fairmont Floodplain Manager, be determined to be the channel of the stream
and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special
flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the
upland limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   AE Zone Without Floodway Area .  Within any AE Zone Without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point
   (c)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).  Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the
specific flood risk at the site.  The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
and adjacent properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be
reasonably safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques.  When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable Federal and State Laws, Ordinances and Regulations.
      (4)   Within any apportioned Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, City of Fairmont's Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream.  Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.  In addition prior to issuing the local permit the
Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from
those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval
      (2)   The developer shall also assure City of Fairmont in writing that
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained.  The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment.  If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The resulting study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings.  The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage.  These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City of Fairmont a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings.  It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
the agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred.  A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator.  Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section 8.4 of this Ordinance.
      (6)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.

   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information.  All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. 
Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation
of the lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this Ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.

sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor.  If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification.  The
elevation certificate must confirm the structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.

All applicants shall meet or exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements
contained herein.  Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the level of flood proofing above the height required by this
Ordinance.  In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood insurance rate on
dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above
the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits, certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in (1) above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities are designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
- used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage (Appurtenant
Structures only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor.  The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.  The location of the
Floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a Floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An Elevation Certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications.  This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               i.   A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
               ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
               iii.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-Conversion Agreement
and notify prospective purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion
Agreement.  It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
Non-Conversion Agreement to any purchaser at closing through notarized
signature.  A signed copy of the transferred Non-Conversion Agreement shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator.  Failure to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1765.08(d).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.  Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. 
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to Floodplain Areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
utilities and building sites.  All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify
the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include Base Flood Elevation data and shall
delineate the Floodway.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the Base Flood
Elevation.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study.  This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts
   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the Approximated
Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed
Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary.  In these cases the site plan
for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two (2) or five
(5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed
and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled from the FEMA
map.  A registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord.  1803.  Passed 3-12-19.)

entry and exit of floodwaters.
            2.   In addition, a Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this Ordinance.  The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement.  It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature.  A copy of the Non-
Conversion Agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
Failure to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1765.08(d).
      (4)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.  Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days.  Or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use.  A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnected utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions.  Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   Fill.  City of Fairmont officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and transportation of water
during floods.  Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is
discouraged and should be minimized.
Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area shall be
restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill shall
only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
currently accepted technical    standards that the proposed fill will not
result in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
         All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed
the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties.  When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.  In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.  During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall
consider the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact
to the subject property and adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and
adjacent properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst
topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with pre-construction conditions.  This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
Ordinance and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access.  For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection 5 below.  For non-residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
         E.   At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25)
percent of the perimeter of a non-residential structure.
         F.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only.  Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         G.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         H.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         I.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         J.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued.  After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
can be issued.  The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, "Overview &
Concurrence Form" or other form as may be required by FEMA.
         K.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of structures and other development.  All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses.  Specifically, as for oil and gas wells and
well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100 feet from any
perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or wetland.  [See
W.Va. Code §22-6A-12(b)].  To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be
maintained in this area.  Where natural vegetation does notexist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the Flood
Protection Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback Area.  The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other State environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage.     Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within
zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures
      (12)   Backflow Preventers.  Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area Floodplain Area.

inspect the premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance
with the information provided on the Floodplain Permit Application, this
Ordinance and with all applicable Federal, State, County and City laws,
Regulations and Ordinances.
         B.   If the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the Floodplain Permit Application, this Ordinance or that there has
been a false statement(s) or misrepresentation(s) by any applicant in the
permitting process, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a "Stop Work Order
Notice," revoke the permit and may request a temporary injunction in the
Circuit Court of Marion County, West Virginia, if there is non-compliance with
the Stop Work Order Notice. The Floodplain Administrator shall notify any
appropriate agency or authority if the Floodplain Administrator finds a
violation of any non-Floodplain Law, Regulation or Ordinance.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized City, County,
State or Federal Government Officials may inspect any development covered by
this or previous Floodplain Ordinances to determine whether any portion of the
development has been altered to be non-compliant with the requirements of this
or other Ordinances.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to occupy, or
to permit the use of occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.  Occupying or
using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1765.08(d).
      (2)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect
and approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until

the violator to the penalties described in Section
1765.08(d).
      (3)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.  Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1765.08(d).
      (4)   A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in the special
flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the Certificate of Compliance shall be based upon the

construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing certificate,
or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a condition of the
Floodplain Permit approval process.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   Flood Plain Determination fee of ten dollars ($10.00), payable to

by the Floodplain Administrator.
         B.   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing
the City of Fairmont for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development.  Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs.  Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services such as (but not
limited to) court reporting, surveying, engineering, etc.
         C.   The fee schedule and additional costs reimbursement schedule is
attached as Addendum 1
      (2)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the City of Fairmont for the additional
cost of processing permits for work already underway.  To more fully recover
this cost the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by
the same person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.
         (Ord.  1803.  Passed 3-12-19.)
   1765.08   APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals.
      (1)   Whenever a person or entity is aggrieved by a decision of the

is the right of that person or entity to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals
for the City of Fairmont sitting as the Floodplain Appeals Board.  Such appeal
must be filed with the City of Fairmont Planning Department, in writing, within
thirty (30) days after notification of the decision of the Floodplain
Administrator as announced at a regularly scheduled City of Fairmont Council
Meeting.  Said Appeal shall be served by the aggrieved person by regular mail
on all interested parties on the date that said Appeal is filed.  Upon receipt
of such appeal, the Floodplain Appeals Board shall set a time, date and place
not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) calendar days for the purpose
of hearing the appeal.  Notice of the time, date and place of the hearing shall

hearing not sooner than 10 calendar days from said announcement date, at which
time all may appear and be heard.  The determination by the Floodplain Appeals
Board shall be final in all cases, subject to any Appeal to the Circuit Court
of Marion County, West Virginia.
      (2)   In the event an Appeal is filed wherein a Floodplain Permit has
been granted by the Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator
shall immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall remain in effect
until a resolution of said appeal.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.  All appeals contesting only the permit fee,
the cumulative substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback
requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Floodplain Appeals Board.
   (c)   Variances.   If compliance with any of the requirements of this
Ordinance would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder,
developer or landowner, the City of Fairmont may, upon request, grant relief
from the strict application of the requirements.   
      (1)   Considerations for the issuance of Variances to this Ordinance
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
         B.   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief.  Financial hardship, used as sole
criteria, shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.
         C.   An affirmative decision granting a Floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
         D.   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in
writing and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the
issuance of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base
Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and
(ii) such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life
and property.  Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all
decisions as required in this Ordinance; and
         E.   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for issuance of a
Floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within
any Floodway Area that would cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (d)   Penalties.  Any person, who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this Ordinance or direction or Order of the
Floodplain Administrator, or any other authorized employee of, shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the Prosecuting Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Fairmont of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. Each day
during which any violation of this Ordinance continues shall constitute a
separate offense.  In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this Ordinance.  The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or
non-compliance with, this Ordinance shall not excuse the violation or non-
compliance with the Ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within
a reasonable time.  Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in non-compliance with this Ordinance may be declared by the City
of Fairmont to be a public nuisance and abated as such subject to other
applicable laws and exhaustion of appellate rights.

1.4 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Existing patterns of urban development have
seriously compromised sustainable growth, the
quality of life, and economic viability of cities. The
practices of land use segregation and auto
dependent design criteria have resulted in widespread
loss of open space and forest cover;
increased traffic congestion and air pollution;
environmental degradation with increased water
runoff, soil erosion, and water supply
contamination; increased housing and

infrastructure costs; inadequate provision of
schools and public services; and growing areas of
declining property values, crime, and poverty. The
resultant loss of community identity adds to these
problems by discouraging citizen awareness of, and
participation in, community affairs. Under this
model, a majority of a municipality’s time and
money is spent replacing and extending
infrastructure and mitigating the negative impacts
of development. Assessed on a project-by-project
basis the total effects and subsequent costs are
hidden by immediate tax base increases and owner
profits. However, if assessed at the community
level, long term, all additional development of the
model described above becomes a burden on a
community. Low-density development increases the
cost of living in order to finance, maintain, and
replace infrastructure. Eventually, the increased
cost of building and living in such areas prevents
growth from continuing. This occurs long before an
area reaches full economic potential and physical
build out. A development model which addresses
these problems must treat a community as a highly
complex entity, not merely as a collection of
individual market segments or an opportunity for
real estate speculation.
The most basic viable unit of our complex economic
region is the neighborhood. Neighborhoods provide
the daily essential needs of all its residents in an
area that is easily definable and pedestrian friendly.
Neighborhoods interconnect to form town centers.
Traditionally, commercial development respected
this neighborhood scale, and therefore integrated
itself into the fabric of the neighborhood through
appropriate building design and its center. This
Code represents the return to traditional and
sustainable planning. It differs from conventional
planning because it focuses on physical change of
the urban environment through the traditional
design elements of town making; public space,
infrastructure, buildings, and parks. It combines
these elements to construct places beyond the
autonomy of the individual project, interest, or
property.
1. The City.
A. The City of Fairmont is a finite place with
specifically designated geographic
boundaries. The City is comprised of
multiple community centers, some with
their own identifiable center and edges
derived from topography and rivers or
streams. These community centers should
form a fundamental economic unit of the
contemporary world. Governmental
cooperation, public policy, physical
planning, and economic strategies must
foster and promote the development and
redevelopment of these identifiable
community centers.
B. The City also has a necessary and fragile
relationship with the outlaying rural
unincorporated areas of Marion County
and the natural landscape. This
relationship is environmental, economic,
and cultural. Farmland and nature are as
important to the City as the garden is to the
house.
C. Development and re-development patterns
should not blur or eradicate the edges of
the City. Infill development, redevelopment,
reuse and preservation of
green spaces within the City all conserve
environmental resources, economic
investment, and social fabric, while
reclaiming, redeveloping and revitalizing
marginal and abandoned areas. The City
should develop strategies to encourage
such infill development, re-development,
reuse and preservation over peripheral
expansion.
D. Where appropriate, new development with
the City should be organized as
neighborhoods and districts, and be
integrated with the existing urban pattern.
Development and redevelopment should
respect historical patterns, precedents,
and boundaries.
E. The City should bring into proximity a broad
spectrum of public and private uses to
support an economy that benefits people
of all incomes. Affordable housing should
be distributed throughout the City to match
job opportunities and to avoid
concentrations of poverty.
F. The physical organization of the City should
be supported by a framework of
transportation alternatives. Transit,
pedestrian, and bicycle systems should
maximize access and mobility throughout
the City while reducing dependence upon
the automobile.
G. Revenues and resources should be used to
promote rational coordination of
transportation, recreation, public services,
housing, and community institutions
throughout the City.

2. The Neighborhood, the District, and the
Corridor.
A. The neighborhood, the district, and the
corridor are the essential elements of
development and redevelopment in the
City. They form identifiable areas that
encourage citizens to take responsibility for
their maintenance and evolution.
B. Neighborhoods should be compact,
pedestrian-friendly, and mixed-use.
Districts generally emphasize a special
single use, and should follow the principles
of neighborhood design when possible.
Corridors are regional connectors of
neighborhoods and districts; they range
from boulevards and rail lines to rivers and
parkways.
C. Many activities of daily living should occur
within walking distance, allowing
independence to those who do not drive
especially the elderly and the young.
Interconnected networks of streets should
be designed to encourage walking, reduce
the number and length of automobile trips,
and conserve energy.
D. Within neighborhoods, a broad range of
housing types and price levels can bring
people of diverse ages, races, and incomes
into daily interaction, strengthening the
personal and civic bonds essential to an
authentic community.
E. Transit corridors, when properly planned
and coordinated, can help organize
municipal structure and revitalize the
municipality's community centers. In
contrast, highway corridors should not
displace investment from the municipality's
existing community centers.
F. Appropriate building densities and land
uses should be within walking distance of
transit stops, permitting public transit to
become a viable alternative to the
automobile.
G. Concentrations of civic, institutional, and
commercial activity should be embedded in
neighborhoods and districts, not isolated in
remote, single-use complexes. Schools,
when possible and economically feasible,
should be sized and located to enable
children to walk or bicycle to them
H. The economic health and harmonious
evolution of neighborhoods, districts and
corridors can be improved through graphic
urban design codes that serve as
predictable guides for change.
I. A range of parks, green spaces and
community gardens, should be distributed
within neighborhoods. When possible,
open lands should be used to define and
connect different neighborhoods and
districts.
3. The Block, the Street, and the Building.
A. A primary task of all urban architecture and
landscape design is the physical definition
of streets and public spaces as places of
shared use.
B. Individual architectural projects should be
seamlessly linked to their surroundings.
C. The revitalization of urban places depends
on safety and security. The design of
streets and buildings should reinforce safe
environments, but not at the expense of
accessibility and openness.
D. In the contemporary city, development
must adequately accommodate
automobiles. It should do so in ways that
respect the pedestrian and the form of
public space.
E. Streets and squares should be safe,
comfortable, and interesting to the
pedestrian. Properly configured, they
encourage walking and enable neighbors
to know each other and protect their
communities.
F. Architecture and landscape design should
grow from local climate, topography,
history, and building practice.
G. Civic buildings and public gathering places
require important sites to reinforce
community identity and the culture of
democracy. They deserve distinctive form
because their role is different from that of
other buildings and places that constitute
the fabric of the city.
H. All buildings should provide their
inhabitants with a clear sense of location,
weather and time. Natural methods of
heating and cooling can be more resourceefficient
than mechanical systems.
I. Preservation and renewal of historic
buildings, districts, and landscapes affirm
the continuity and evolution of urban
society.

and existing community centers within the City of
Fairmont. This type of planning increases collective
security and community identity by promoting civic
awareness and responsibility and enhancing the
quality of life for the entire town to ensure the
greatest possible economic and social benefits for
all residents.

The City Center district is coded to encourage the development and expansion of the City's traditional central
business district and downtown historic district. This center is intended to serve as the civic, cultural, and
governmental hub of activity for the entire City of Fairmont. The population density within walking distance of
the City Center should be much higher than in other areas of the City. Minimum building heights are
established along main corridors to ensure proper spatial definition and encourage strong pedestrian
spaces. Transitions from Neighborhood Residential areas should be accomplished through architectural
design and streetscape treatment. Individual buildings are encouraged to be mixed vertically with street
level commercial and upper level residential. This area is supported by the continued development of a
coherent street network constructed to support the traffic demands of both the auto and the pedestrian.
Minimum parking requirements may be satisfied using on-street parking, shared rear-lot parking areas, or
small scale parking lots adjacent to buildings.

The Main Corridor Commercial district is coded to encourage the development of large-scale mixed-use
districts that complement the surrounding neighborhoods and are supported by existing and planned
transportation networks constructed to support the traffic demands of both the auto and the pedestrian.
Main Corridor Commercial districts traditionally form near the convergence of large, coherent
neighborhoods. The pedestrian can therefore walk to services and shopping within one of the Main Corridor
Commercial centers within 10-15 minutes. Minimum building heights are established to ensure proper
spatial definition, encourage strong pedestrian spaces, and promote mixed use within buildings. The Main
Corridor Commercial center provides for the sale of general merchandise and limited office employment with
neighborhood service areas of two to five miles. Higher densities of residential development are
encouraged.

district caters to information technology and other similar high technology research and development
industries requiring the benefits that accompany this zoning classification and protects these industries
from encroachment by commercial, residential and other land uses adverse to the locations and expansion
of such development.
1. These Technology district regulations are intended to promote the physical and mental health, safety,

3.1.12 Planned Development Area
A. PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of the Planned Development Area
(PDA) is to encourage flexibility in the development
of land in order to promote its most appropriate
use; to improve the design, character and quality of
new developments; to provide and promote
redevelopment and reuse opportunities; to
encourage a harmonious and appropriate mixture
of uses and/or housing types; to facilitate the
adequate and economic provision of streets,
utilities and city services; to preserve critical natural
environmental and scenic features of the site; to
encourage and provide a mechanism for arranging
improvements and sites so as to preserve desirable
features; and to mitigate the problems which may
be presented by specific site conditions.
It is anticipated that a Planned Development Area
will offer one or more of the following advantages:
1. Serve to implement the goals, objectives, and
strategies of the City of Fairmont
Comprehensive Plan, in general, and with
specificity to the district or neighborhood in
which the proposed PDA is to be located;
2. Apply the design principles of new urbanism,
neo-traditionalism, and other emerging smart
code principles, urban development patterns
and best management practices;
3. Promote development patterns that maximize
compatibility of differing adjacent land uses;
4. Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by
conserving areas of special natural beauty,
steep slopes, ecological importance, flood
prone areas, and natural green spaces where
appropriate, while understanding that land
within urban areas is best suited for urban
densities and development patterns;
5. Counteract poor urban design and mitigate
congestion on streets;
6. Promote architecture that is compatible with
the vernacular examples of architecture
common to the City of Fairmont and/or its
surroundings;
7. Promote design principles that allow differing
types of land uses to coexist while preserving
property values and minimizing potential
negative consequences;
8. Promote appropriate urban densities that will
promote pedestrianism and which will help
make alternative forms of transportation
economically and socially feasible; and
9. Promote and protect the environmental
integrity of the site and its surroundings by
providing suitable design responses to the
specific environmental constraints of the site
and surrounding area.
B. MINIMUM AREA AND SINGLE
OWNERSHIP REQUIRED FOR A
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT;
EXCEPTION
A Planned Development Area shall consist of a
parcel or tract of land comprising an area of at
least four (4) acres. All land comprising the
proposed Planned Development Area shall be
titled in the name of a single owner; provided
however, multiple ownership shall be permissible
if each and every ownership interest is a coapplicant
for the Planned Development Area
designation and all ownership interests have
executed a written agreement, in duplicate, in
recordable form, the covenants of which shall run
with the land and shall be binding upon any
transferees, which shall identify one legal entity
responsible for representing the application and
which entity shall have authority to act as agent for
all owners for all aspects of the Planned
Development Area and the Planned Development
Area process. An executed original agreement
shall accompany the application for any Planned
Development Area designation.
C. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. A Planned Development Area Outline Plan
shall indicate all land uses, development
standards, and all other applicable
specifications which shall govern the Planned
Development Area. If the Outline Plan is silent
on a particular land use, a development
standard, or any other applicable
specification, the use, standard or
specification established by the City of
Fairmont Zoning Ordinance for the underlying
district or any other applicable regulations
shall apply.
2. Prior to any approval, a Planned Development
Area map shall show the location and
designation of all improvements. The location
of a Planned Development Area shall be
designated on the Official Land Use Map or
Zoning Map for the City of Fairmont and shall
be adopted pursuant to rules and regulations
governing amendments of this Zoning
Ordinance.

3. The Planned Development Area must comply
with all required improvements, construction
standards, design standards, and all other
engineering standards adopted and enforced
by the City of Fairmont, and any other
pertinent regulations, except where
specifically varied through the provisions of
this section of the Zoning Ordinance.
4. Designation and Conveyance or Ownership of
Permanent Open Space.
A. Designation. Within all Planned
Development Areas, a minimum of ten
(10) percent of the land of the proposed
Planned Development Area shall be
designated as permanent open space. No
plan for a single-family or multi-family
residential Planned Development Area
shall be approved unless such plan
provides for permanent landscaped or
natural open space.
B. Proximity.
i. In the case of a mixed-use Planned
Development Area, permanent open
space shall be allocated to the
property in proportion to the uses
assigned to the Planned
Development Area and shall be
located within reasonable proximity
(within one-quarter of a mile) to those
uses. Provided, however, the
permanent open space need not be
located in proximity to the use in the
case of preservation of existing
features.
ii. As an alternative, a payment in lieu of
the open space provision may be
made to the City for the purchase or
provision of permanent open space
on a separate parcel within one
quarter of a mile of any Planned
Development Area.
C. Proportion. If the Outline Plan provides for
the Planned Development Area to be
constructed in stages, open space must
be provided for each stage of the Planned
Development Area in proportion to that
stage.
D. Conveyance. Permanent open space shall
be owned by or conveyed to one of the
following:
i. To a municipal or public corporation;
ii. To a nonprofit corporation or entity
established for the purpose of
benefiting the owners and tenants of
the Planned Development Area or,
where appropriate and where
approved by the Municipal Planning
Commission and the City Council,
adjoining property owners, or both. All
conveyances hereunder shall be
structured to insure that the grantee
has the obligation and the right to
affect maintenance and improvement
of the common open space; and that
such duty of maintenance and
improvement is enforced by the
owners and tenants of the Planned
Development Area and, where
applicable, by adjoining property
owners;
iii. To owners other than those specified
in subsections 3.1.12.4D.i. and ii.
above, and subject to restrictive
c o venan t s desc r i b ing and
guaranteeing the open space and its
maintenance and improvement,
running with the land for the benefit of
residents of the Planned Development
Area or adjoining property owners, or
both; or
iv. Included in single-family residential
lots under the individual control of lot
owners.
5. Uses permitted in a Planned Development Area
may be any use that is found in the Zoning
Ordinance in any district, subject to the
approval of the City of Fairmont Planning
Commission and City Council; however, the City
reserves the right to require that a PDA shall
consist of only residential uses when
circumstances warrant. Examples of such
circumstances may include, but are not limited
to:
A. Significant infrastructure constraints that
could cause practical difficulties in
supporting nonresidential uses;
B. The character and land use pattern of
surrounding neighborhoods; or
C. Possible deleterious changes in traffic
circulation patterns in the immediate area.
A developer may also initiate a request to limit
his or her Planned Development Area to
residential uses.

6. For purposes of determining overall project
size, two or more parcels of land owned or
controlled by the applicant that are wholly or
partially separated by a public street or other
right-of-way may be considered contiguous
and thus may be counted in fulfilling the
minimum acreage requirement of a Planned
Development Area, provided that the use and
development of the public street or other right
of way is incorporated into, and is an integral
part of the project plans; and provided that
there is no other property not owned by the
applicant separating the parcels in question.
Where there is uncertainty in determining a
parcel's qualification to be included in the
Planned Development Area, the Planning
Commission shall resolve the issue and make
a determination as to the project boundaries,
after considering the advice of the Planning
Director and the request by the applicant.
D PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT AREA
Applications for a Planned Development Area shall
be accompanied by all plans, descriptions,
narratives, documents, and exhibits required by
subsection E hereof. A three-step application
process shall be used. The steps in the process
are:
 Pre-application Conference;
 Outline Plan Approval; and
 Development Plan Approval.
1. Pre-application Conference. Prior to filing a
formal application for approval for a Planned
Development Area, the applicant shall
schedule a pre-application conference with
the Planning Department. The purposes of the
pre-application conference shall be to:
A. Allow the applicant to present a general
concept and to discuss characteristics of
the development concept in relation to
adopted municipal plans and policies;
B. Allow the Planning Department to inform
the applicant of pertinent policies,
s t a n d a r d s , p r o c e dures and
recommendations for the Planned
Development Area; and
C. The pre-application conference is
intended only for the above purposes;
neither the developer nor the City of
Fairmont is bound by any decision made
during a pre-application conference.
2. Outline Plan Approval.
A. Based upon the pre-application
conference, the applicant shall develop
and submit an Outline Plan for the
proposed Planned Development Area.
B. The Outline Plan and application for the
Planned Development Area shall be
submitted to the Planning Department,
and the Director, who, after certifying the
application package to be complete, shall
initiate a review of the proposed
development.
C. The application and the results of the
review shall then be forwarded to the
Planning Commission for i ts
consideration, public hearing and
recommendations together with the
Planning Department's report and such
other documents as may be pertinent to
the Planned Development Area.
D. The Planning Commission shall hold a
special public meeting in the district
where the proposed Planned
Development Area project is located. If
the project crosses district boundaries,
the meeting shall be held in the district
where the majority of the property is
located. The hearing shall be conducted
at least seven (7) days prior to the
regularly scheduled Planning Commission
meeting at which the formal public
hearing will be held. The Planning
Department will place a Class I
advertisement in the newspaper
specifying the time and location of the
special public meeting, at least five (5)
days prior to meeting.
E. Where there are environmentally sensitive
features on the site or the subsequent
Development Plan is expected to be
complex, or there are other important
planning implications involved, the
Planning Commission may reserve the
right to review the subsequent
Development Plan. Where the Planning
Commission recommends denial of an
Outline Plan and the City Council approves
the plan, the Planning Commission shall
review the subsequent Development Plan.

Planning Commission shall forward the
application to the City Council with
i. A favorable recommendation,
ii. An unfavorable recommendation, or
iii. No recommendation.
G. Effect of Approval of Outline Plan:
i. When an Outline Plan for a Planned
Development Area has been
approved by the City Council, by
Ordinance, the Plan shall become
effective and its location shall be
shown on the Zoning Map or Land
Use Map. The Zoning Map or Land
Use Map shall be amended to
designate the site as a Planned
Development Area (PDA).
ii. Upon such amendment of the Zoning
Map or Land Use Map, the use and
development of the site shall be
governed by the Planned
Development Area Outline Plan,
subject to approval of a subsequent
Development Plan.
iii. Notwithstanding approval of an
Outline Plan no permit of any kind
shall be issued until the Development
Plan has been approved.
3. Development Plan Approval:
A. Purpose of Development Plan Approval.
The purpose of the Development Plan is
to designate the controls for development
of the Planned Development Area. The
Development Plan shall show the exact
location of each building and
improvement to be constructed and a
designation of the specific internal use or
range of uses for each building.
B. Time Limit for Approval of Development
Plan. The Development Plan shall be
submitted to the Planning Department not
more than eighteen (18) months following
City Council approval of the Outline Plan.
The Outline and Development Plans may
be submitted as a single plan if all
requirements of Section 3.1.12 are
satisfied. The Development Plan may be
submitted and approved in stages, with
each stage representing a portion of the
Outline Plan, at the discretion of the
Municipal Planning Commission. The time
limit for submitting each stage for approval
may be set forth in the Outline Plan, in
which case that schedule shall control the
timing of development, rather then the
time period contained in this paragraph.
The City of Fairmont Planning Commission
may extend the time for application for
approval of the Development Plan for good
cause, consistent with the purposes of the
Zoning Ordinance.
C. Expiration of Time Limit. Periodically, the
Planning Director shall report to the City of
Fairmont Planning Commission on Planned
Development Areas with expired time
limits. The original applicants or current
developers of the Planned Development
Area shall be notified by the Planning
Director. The Municipal Planning
Commission shall determine whether to
consider extending the time or to initiate
action to amend the Land Use Map to
rescind the Planned Development Area
designation.
D. Relationship of Development and Outline
Plan. The Development Plan shall conform
to the Outline Plan as approved.
E. Procedure for Approval of a Development
Plan: The applicant must have the
Development Plan approved prior to
issuance of any building permit.
i. Development Plan Submission. The
Development Plan and supporting data
shall be filed with the planning staff.
ii. Review. The Planning Director shall
review the Development Plan to
include site plan review, in accordance
with the requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance.
iii. Staff Approval. It shall generally be the
responsibility of staff to review
Development Plans unless the City of
Fairmont Planning Commission
reviews the Development Plans, or
where no Development Plan is
required.

7 enforcement Subdivision
6 Regulations Development

Planned Development Area 3.1.12
1. The extent to which the Planned Development
Area meets the purposes of the Zoning
Ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan, and any
other adopted planning objectives of the City
of Fairmont;
2. The extent to which the proposed plan meets
the requirements, standards, and stated
purpose of the Planned Development Area
regulations;
3. The extent to which the proposed plan departs
from the zoning and subdivision regulations
otherwise applicable to the subject property,
including but not limited to, the density,
dimension, bulk, use, required improvements,
and construction and design standards and
the reasons why such departures are or are
not deemed to be in the public interest;
4. The proposal will not be injurious to the public
health, safety, and general welfare;
5. The physical design of the Planned
Development Area and the extent to which it
makes adequate provision for public services,
provides adequate control over vehicular
traffic and promotes alternative forms of
transportation, provides for and protects
designated permanent open space, and
furthers the amenities of urban ambience,
light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment;
6. The relationship and compatibility of the
proposed plan to the adjacent properties and
neighborhood, and whether the proposed plan
would substantially interfere with the use or
diminish the value of adjacent properties and
neighborhoods;
7. The desirability of the proposed plan to the
City of Fairmont's physical development, tax
base and economic well-being. At the
discretion of the Planning Commission and
City Council, special consideration in the form
of increased development flexibility may be
given to projects that are intended to
rehabilitate or replace dilapidated areas,
brownfields, or other areas of general visual or
economic blight. Such special consideration
shall not be granted to projects intended for
construction on lands that consist of sixty
percent (60%) or more of greenfield or
previously undeveloped lands.
8. The proposal will not cause undue traffic
congestion, and can be adequately served by
existing or programmed public facilities and
services.
9. The proposal preserves significant ecological,
natural, historical, and architectural resources
to the extent possible.
10. The proposal will enhance the appearance,
image, function, and economic sustainability of
the community at large.
11. Projects which are designed to a more human
scale, support multi-modal transportation
options, promote pedestrianism, reserve useful
open space, provide significant amenities to
residents, and incorporate architectural
detailing, massing and scale that is consistent
with historical community norms shall have a
significant advantage in the review process
over those that merely seek to maximize
inappropriate forms of density, circumvent
customary development standards, or promote
a pattern of development that can be generally
recognized as “urban sprawl,” as defined in the
definition section of the Zoning Ordinance.
Projects that fail to achieve these objectives
will likely result in a recommendation for denial
by the Planning Department and/or Planning
Commission.
12. The proposal makes reasonable
accommodations in housing, recreational
amenities, and pedestrian facilities for
individuals with disabilities.
13. The proposal dedicates and provides a
percentage of the total number of dwelling
units to be offered at sale or rental prices
deemed affordable to individuals of low and
moderate income, as defined by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
development. Generally, between three to five
percent (3% - 5%) of all units should meet this
goal.
14. For any PDA containing only residential uses,
clustering of units should be utilized (and may
be required by the City) in order to preserve
meaningful open space and/or recreational
amenities for the residents. In addition, such
projects shall be required to provide a mixture
of different dwelling types and sizes. Examples
of dwelling types include townhouses, row
houses, patio homes, zero lot line houses,
single-family detached housing, apartments,
duplexes, condominiums, etc.

5.1 EXTERIOR LIGHTING.
1. Purpose and Intent. It is the goal of this Section
to provide guidance to developers in
implementing minimum requirements for
lighting for all non-residential projects and multi
-family developments. The requirements of this
Section will serve to provide direction in
controlling light spillage, glare and intensities
so as not to adversely affect motorists,
pedestrians, and land uses of adjacent
properties. To ensure appropriate lighting while
minimizing its undesirable side effects, the
following regulations are established.
2. Applicability. Lighting facilities shall be required
for all off-street parking areas and off-street
loading areas and for all driveways providing
ingress and egress thereto for all nonresidential
and multi-family developments. In
the approval of any development plan, the
Planning Director or Board of Zoning Appeals
shall have the authority to require lighting to be
incorporated for other uses or locations where
in their reasonable discretion such lighting is
warranted.
3. Outdoor Lighting Standards. All outdoor lighting
shall conform to the following standards:
A. All exterior lighting, including free-standing,
canopy, pole, and building mounted, shall
be fully shielded and directed downward to
prevent off-site glare. Canopy lighting shall
be fully recessed.
B. The intensity of light within a site shall not
exceed ten (10) footcandles within any part
of the site and one (1) footcandle at any
property line, except where it abuts a
residential district or use where a
maximum of .5 footcandles is permitted.
The only exception is with vehicle service
use canopies and new or used vehicle
sales lighting, where a maximum of twenty
(20) footcandles is permitted within the
site but the above requirements shall apply
to intensity at the property line.
C. Footcandles is the unit of light density
incident on a horizontal plane and
measurable with an illuminance meter,
a.k.a. light meter.
D. Outdoor lighting fixtures shall be designed,
located and mounted at heights no greater
than eighteen (18) feet above grade for
non-cut-off lights, or thirty five (35) feet
above grade for cut-off lights; and located
at least ten (10) feet from property lines
defining rear and side yards or required
perimeter landscaped areas required by
this Code.
E. When the light source is located adjacent
to a residential neighborhood the height of
the fixture may not exceed eighteen (18)
feet.
F. All non-essential lighting will be required to
be turned off after business hours, leaving
only the necessary lighting for security. Non
-essential lighting applies to display,
aesthetic, parking and sign lighting.
G. Fixtures should be placed to provide
uniform distribution of light and to avoid
intense lighting that produces excessive
glare. Fixture locations should be chosen
to minimize the hazards of glare.
H. Lighting fixtures in scale with pedestrian
activities shall provide for uniform
distribution of lighting to produce minimal
shadows.
I. Uplighting of any architectural feature of a
building or of a sign is permitted, but such
lighting may consist only of low wattage
fixtures (designed for bulbs not exceeding
seventy-five (75) watts) trained directly
onto the surface intended to be
illuminated. Internally lit signs are
acceptable in certain zoning districts
provided that they meet the requirements
of this ordinance.
J. Light sources should not be located within
any perimeter-landscaped areas except on
pedestrian walkways.
K. The internal illumination of buildingmounted
awnings is prohibited.
L. All lights must emit either white or orange
yellow illumination.
M. When outdoor lighting installation or
replacement is part of a development
proposal for which site plan approval is
required under these regulations, the
Planning Director shall review and approve
the lighting installation as part of its site
plan approval.

and community appearance. With these
purposes in mind, it is the intent of this
ordinance to authorize the use of signs that
are:
A. Compatible with their surroundings;
B. Appropriate to the activity that displays
them;

C. Additional Parking
i. To minimize excessive areas of
pavement which depreciate aesthetic
standards and contribute to high rates
of stormwater runoff, no parking lot
shall exceed the minimum parking
space requirements by ten (10)
percent greater than required except
as approved by the Planning Director.
In granting additional spaces, the
Planning Director shall determine that
the parking will be required based on
documented evidence of actual use
and demand provided by the applicant.
ii. Off-site parking facilities shall be

agreement duly executed and
acknowledged, which specifies that
the land upon which the off-site
parking facility is located is
encumbered by the parking use. Said
instrument shall specify and bind the
time period to the anticipated life of
the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. Said
instrument shall be filed in the
applicable site plan approval files of
the Department of Planning, and
placed on public record in the Office of
the Clerk of the County Commission of
Marion County, WV.
iii. It is the responsibility of the business
owner to maintain current and valid
parking as required by this Ordinance.
Evidence of such parking is required
prior to approval and proof of current
leases shall be made available at the
request of the Planning Director.
Each leased space shall have a sign
noting the business for which the
space is reserved. Signs shall be
twelve (12) inches wide by eighteen
(18) inches tall and shall be mounted
between three (3) feet and five (5) feet
above the finish surface of the parking
stall.

F. Collective/Cooperative (Shared) Parking.
The collective provision of off-street
parking for two (2) or more buildings or
uses is permitted subject to the following:
i. Where a mix of land uses creates
staggered peak periods of parking,
shared parking agreements that have
the effect of reducing the total amount
of needed parking spaces are
encouraged. In these cases the
required number of parking spaces
may be reduced. Retail, office,
institutional, and entertainment uses
may share parking areas. Except as
otherwise provided in this Ordinance,
shared parking shall not include the
parking required for residential uses.
ii. Provisions for collective off-street
parking would be made by contract
between two (2) or more adjacent
property owners. The parking area
provided on any one (1) lot could be
reduced to not less than one-half (1/2)
the number of required spaces for the
use occupying the lot. The lots shall be
interconnected for vehicular passage.
iii. Written easements which provide for
the continued use and maintenance of
the parking shall be submitted to the
City for approval. Any agreement shall
include provisions to address any
changes in use which shall be
reviewed.
iv. Whenever possible, collective or
cooperative parking arrangements
shall utilize shared driveways, shared
service drives, cross access drives,
and frontage roads to minimize
driveways that access an arterial or
collector street. Cross access
easements, if necessary, shall be
submitted to the City for approval.
G. Parking and Storage of Certain Vehicles.
Commercial Vehicles on Private Property.
The parking of a commercial vehicle in
residential zoned districts shall be
prohibited, except that one commercial
vehicle of not more than three (3) tons
capacity may be parked on any lot on
which there is located a principal building
and is used by an occupant of the
premises. This requirement shall not be
interpreted to prohibit commercial vehicles
from temporary loading and unloading in
any residential district.
H. Loading Requirements. Uses and buildings
with a gross floor area of 5,000 square
feet or more shall provide off-street loading
spaces in accordance with the following
table provided that loading spaces shall
not be required for uses which do not
receive or transmit goods or wares by truck
delivery.
i. Location. All required off-street loading
berths shall be located on the same lot
as the use to be served, and no portion
of the vehicle shall project into a street
or alley. No permitted or required
loading berth shall be located within
thirty (30) feet of the nearest point of
intersection of any two streets, nor
shall it be located in a required front
yard or side yard adjoining a
residential use or district.
ii. Each required off-street loading space
shall be of a size not less than that
required for an off-street parking space
but scaled larger to delivery vehicles
expected to be used, logically and
conveniently located for bulk p ickups
and deliveries, and accessible to such
vehicles when required off-street
parking spaces are filled, provided that
the off-street area required for the
receipt or distribution by vehicles of
materials or merchandise is held to be
as follows:
a. For local pick-up and delivery
trucks: twelve (12) feet in width by
thirty (30) feet in length with a
forty-five (45) foot maneuvering
apron, and a twelve (12) foot
height clearance.
b. For over-the-road tractor-trailers:
fourteen (14) feet in width by sixty
(60) feet in length with a sixty (60)
foot maneuvering apron, and a
fourteen (14) foot height
clearance.
iii. Paving regulations for loading areas
shall be in accordance with the paving
regulations for parking areas as set
forth in the Development Standards
Section. Drainage regulations shall be
in accordance with the City’s
Stormwater Management Ordinance
and other City ordinances.

The landscape requirements of this Section are
considered the minimum necessary to achieve
the intent noted above. In several instances,
the standards or requirements are intentionally
flexible to encourage adaptability to specific
circumstances and creative design. Applicants
are encouraged to provide additional
landscaping to improve the function,
appearance and value of their property.
2. General Provisions/Applicability
A. These landscape regulations shall apply to
two-family, multi-family, commercial, office,
industrial, and institutional development.
Previously approved development need not
comply unless new site development
approval is being sought.
B. If a proposed addition or renovation to an
existing structure equals or exceeds 150%
of the gross square feet of the structure,
the site must be brought into compliance
with the landscaping requirements of this
Section; provided, that where it is clearly
demonstrated that compliance with this
Section will reduce the minimum number
of required parking spaces for the use,
compliance with this Section shall be
required only to the degree that the
minimum parking requirement can still be
met.
3. Enforcement
A. Wherever site plan review is required by
this Ordinance, a Landscape and
Screening Plan shall be a required part of
such site plan. No permanent Certificate of
Occupancy shall be issued without
completion of all landscaping shown on an
approved Landscape and Screening Plan.
I. Barrier Free Parking. Disabled parking
shall conform to all requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
5.5 LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS
1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Section
is to establish minimum standards for the
provision, installation, and maintenance of
landscape plantings in order to achieve a
healthy, beautiful, and safe community.
These landscape requirements have been
established to achieve the following:
A. Conserve the value of land and building.
B. Integrate various elements of a site to
attain and maintain attractive properties.
C. Blend harmonious land uses, buffer
incompatible land uses and define outdoor
and architectural spaces.
D. Control soil erosion by slowing or
constraining the effects of wind and water.
E. Minimize visual pollution; minimal
screening provides an impression of
separation of spaces and more extensive
screening can entirely shield the visual
effects of an intense land use from a less
intense land use.
F. Establish a greater sense of privacy from
visual or physical intrusion of intense land
uses, the degree of privacy varying with the
intensity of the screening.
G. Safeguard the public health, safety and
welfare, and preserve the aesthetic
qualities and enhance character of the City
of Fairmont.

B. In the event that the season is not
appropriate, a temporary Certificate of
Occupancy may be issued for a period of
one (1) year when weather conditions do
not permit landscape installation at the
time of occupancy.
C. Failure to implement an approved
Landscape and Screening Plan, including
preservation of existing features, or to
maintain the landscaping as long as
incompatibility of adjoining uses exists,
shall be a violation of this Ordinance
subject to the penalties outlined in this
Ordinance.
4. Landscaping and Screening Plan. As a
component of a required site plan, a
Landscape and Screen Plan shall show the
entire lot to scale (minimum 1”=50’) contain
the following elements:
A. The name, address, and phone number of
the owner, developer, and plan preparer as

planting materials;
C. Planting and installation details as
necessary to ensure conformance with all
required standards and planting
specifications; and
D. If applicable, the design of fencing and
other significant accessory structures used
for screening.
5. Preservation of Existing Features
A. Trees and shrubs already existing on land
subject to the provisions of this Article
should be preserved wherever feasible.
B. Existing trees that are preserved will
contribute to the required landscaping. For
each tree that is preserved that is greater
than eight (8) inch caliper and is found on
the approved list, the amount of new trees
to be installed shall be reduced by two (2)
trees.
C. Tree protection barriers shall be specified
on the Landscape and Screening Plan and
shall be placed at or beyond the drip line
of trees to be protected. These barriers
shall remain in place during heavy
construction on the site, and no vehicle,
machinery, tools, chemicals, construction
materials, or temporary soil deposits may
be permitted within the barriers, nor may
any notice or other object be nailed,
stapled, or posted on protected trees.
6. General Landscaping Requirements
A. All land areas that are not covered with
buildings and pavement or used for
agricultural purposes shall be appropriately
landscaped in accordance with the
requirements of this Section. Landscaping
shall be provided in the areas specified

8. Buffer Yard Landscaping Requirements
A. New non-residential and/or multi-family
development adjacent to single-family
residential property (existing or zoned)
shall provide a landscape buffer yard ten
(10) feet wide planted with five (5) medium
to large trees and fifteen (15) shrubs per
100 linear feet of buffer yard between the
non-residential or multi-family uses and
single-family residential uses. Nothing shall
be construed that this requirement shall
dictate layout of landscaping material. The
entire length shall be evaluated and
required material provided. This
requirement may supersede the minimum
setback requirement for the zoning district.
Preservation of existing vegetation is
preferred.
B. The use of a ten (10) foot landscaped
buffer area shall remain the preferred
method of buffering non-residential and
multi-family residential developments from
single-family residential uses. However,
where a natural buffer strip is considered
to be impracticable or inappropriate, an
opaque fence at least six (6) feet in height
so as to continually restrict a clear view
beyond said buffer yard may be substituted
in whole or in part for a natural buffer
provided its specifications are approved by
the Planning Official.
C. Non-residential or multi-family
developments existing at the time of
adoption of this Ordinance are exempt
from this requirement except when
expansions to those facilities meeting the
criteria noted under Section 5.5.2.B above.
D. An earth berm may be used in combination
with any of the above types of screening,
but not more than two‑thirds (2/3) of the
required height of such screening may be
provided by the berm. The berm shall be
installed with a slope of 1:3 and a
minimum crest of two (2) feet.
E. All screening shall follow the lot line of the
lot to be screened or be so arranged within
the boundaries of the lot as to substantially
hide from adjoining properties the building,
parking, loading areas or other activity
required to be screened
F. In all districts, garbage cans and trash
receptacles must be suitably screened
from view from adjacent streets or
properties prior to garbage pick‑up.
9. Modifications. Under conditions where a strict
interpretation of requirements may be either
physically impossible or create practical
difficulties, an alternative compliance
procedure may be used to maintain the spirit—
rather than the letter—of the law. The proposed
solution must equal or exceed standard
landscaping requirements as a percentage
landscaped area. Requests to the Planning
Director for use of alternative landscaping
schemes may be justified only when one (1) or
more of the following conditions apply:
 The sites involve space limitations or
unusually shaped parcels.
 Topography, soil, vegetation, or other site
conditions are such that full compliance is
impossible or impractical.
 Due to a change of use of an existing site,
the required buffer yard is larger than can
be provided.
 Existing utility lines or easements
complicate the placement of required
plant materials.
 Low impact development designs to meet
Stormwater requirements are being used
on the site. These may include items such
as rain gardens, bio-swales and similar
treatments.
 The applicant must provide a justification
statement that describes which of the
requirements established by the
Landscaping Ordinance will be met with
modifications, which project conditions
justify using alternatives, and how the
proposed measures equal or exceed
normal compliance.
A. Where compliance is required as a result of
change in use or expansion of an existing
building and compliance with this Section
will necessitate removal of existing
pavement, the Planning Director may
approve a reduction of minimum planting
areas, provided that proposed plantings,
screens, and other landscape features are
substantially equivalent to the minimum
requirements in terms of landscaping.

B. After initial approval of the landscape plan
the Planning Director may approve any
substitute landscape proposal that he/she
deems to be equivalent to the approved
landscape.
Occasionally, plant substitutions for species
specified on approved landscape plans are
required due to seasonal planting problems
and a lack of plant availability. Minor revisions
to planting plans can be approved by the
Planning Director if there is no reduction in the
quantity of plant material, no significant change
in size or location of plant materials, and if the
substitute plants are of the same general
category and have the same general design
characteristics as the plants originally
approved. Proposed materials must also be
compatible with the microclimate of the site to
ensure healthy plant growth.
10. Installation and Maintenance
A. Plant materials used in conformance with
the provision of this Chapter shall conform
to the standards of the American
Association of Nurserymen and shall have
passed any inspection required under state
regulations. Trees shall be balled and
burlapped or in containers. Shrubs, vines
and ground covers can be planted as bare
root as well as balled and burlapped or
containers. All trees shall be measured
from the top of the root ball to the top of
the tree mass.
i. Deciduous Trees. Deciduous trees
shall have a minimum caliper of at
least two and one-half (2½) inches
with a single central leader, for large
and medium trees, conforming to
acceptable nursery industry
procedures at the time of planting. If
deciduous trees are to be used for
screening purposes, additional
materials listed in this Section must be
used to create a dense screen.
ii. Evergreen Trees. Evergreen trees
shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in
height at the time of planting and shall
be unsheared, full and branched to the
ground. Evergreen plantings shall be
designed to provide an effective,
dense screen within four (4) years of
planting. It is recommended that
evergreen trees be planted no
further than ten (10) feet on center to
assure an effective screen.
iii. Shrubs and Hedges. Shrubs and
hedges to be used for off-street
parking and screening purposes shall
be at least twenty-four (24) inches in
height at the time of planting. Shrubs
and hedges used for landscaping
purposes shall be at least eighteen
(18) inches in height at the time of
planting. All shrubs and hedges shall
be designed to provide an effective,
dense screen and mature height of at
least five (5) feet within four (4) years
after the date of the final approval of
each planting. The height at
installation of the planting shall be
measured from the level of the surface
of the plant base at the edge closest to
the screening.
iv. Grass or Ground Cover. Grass shall be
planted in species normally grown as
permanent lawns. In swales or other
areas subject to erosion, solid sod,

7.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. Policy and Purpose. It is declared to be the
policy of Council and the Municipal Planning
Commission of the City, to consider land
subdivision plats as part of a plan for the
orderly, efficient and economical development
of the City. This means, among other things,
that land to be subdivided shall be of such
character that it can be used safely for building
purposes without danger to health, or peril from
fire, flood or other menace, such as location on
the active trace or in the currently active zone
or zones of faults or other soil conditions which
would lead to structural defects or damage to
land improvements. It also means that proper
provisions should be made for drainage, water
supply, sewage and other needed
improvements. All proposed lots shall be so laid
out and of such size as to be in harmony with
the development pattern of the neighboring
properties. The proposed streets shall compose
a convenient system conforming to the Official
Map, if such exists, and shall be properly
related to the proposals shown on the
Comprehensive Plan, and shall be of such
width, grade and location as to accommodate
the prospective traffic and to facilitate fire
protection. Proper provisions shall also be
made for open space for parks and
playgrounds.
2. Scope. These Subdivision Regulations apply to
the division of land into two or more lots for the
purpose of transfer of ownership or building
development, to the redevelopment and
replatting of land, to the design, construction
and improvements on the land in subdivisions
and to land composed of adjacent parcels or
lots when such are replatted, changed as to
dimension or size or used collectively for
subdivision purposes or, if a new street is
involved, any division of a parcel of land.
3. Approving Agency. In accordance with West Va.
Code 8A-5-1, a certified copy of the
Comprehensive Plan and any ordinance and
amendments thereto containing provisions for
subdivision control and the approval of plats
and replats shall be filed with the Clerk of the
County Commission; thereafter the Municipal
Planning Commission shall have exclusive
control over the approval of all plats involving
land covered by such municipal plan and
ordinance. The Commission shall have a seal
and when affixed to a final plat shall indicate
the approval of the City of all subdivided land
from the effective date of this Section. Nothing
herein shall be construed as affecting the
validity of subdivisions heretofore approved
and so indicated by the signature of the Mayor.
4. Application of Regulations. No owner shall
subdivide any tract of land which is located
within the City and adjoining area over which it
may lawfully exercise any jurisdiction except in
conformity with the provisions of these
Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 1639. Passed 4-28-15.)
7.2 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
1. Recording of Plat. No plat of any subdivision is
entitled to be recorded in the County Clerk's
office or have any validity until it has been
approved in the manner prescribed herein. In
the event any such unapproved plat is recorded
it shall be considered invalid and proceedings
shall be instituted to have the plat stricken
from the County records by the City Planner
through the City Attorney.
2. Sale of Land in Subdivision. No owner or agent
of the owner of any land located within a
subdivision shall transfer, sell, agree to sell or
negotiate to sell any land by reference to,
exhibition of, or by the use of a plan or plat of a
subdivision before such plan or plat has been
approved and recorded in the manner
prescribed herein. The description of such lot or
parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument
of transfer or other documents used in the
process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the transactions from the provisions of
these Subdivision Regulations.
3. Public Improvements. Council hereby defines
its policy to be that the City shall withhold all
public improvements of whatever nature,
including the furnishing of sewage facilities and
water service from all subdivisions created
after the effective date of this Section which
have not been accepted by the Planning
Commission in the manner prescribed herein
4. Inclusion and Relationship to Other Ordinances
A. The Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance shall be interpreted to include
any and all other provisions of the Fairmont
City Code which are necessary for an
understanding of this Ordinance and the
attainment of its purposes. The City Council

the City of Fairmont that are vested with
the duty or authority to issue permits,

6. Variance Procedure. Council may, only when
recommended by the Planning Commission,
and pursuant to Section 7.2.7 authorize a
variance from these Subdivision Regulations
when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result
from strict compliance. In granting any
variance, Council shall prescribe only
conditions that it deems necessary to or
desirable for the public interest and that shall
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purpose of the Comprehensive Plans or these
Regulations. In granting variances and
modifications Council shall require such
conditions as shall, in its opinion and judgment,
secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or regulations so varied or modified.
No variances shall be granted unless Council
finds:
A. That there are special circumstances or
conditions affecting such property such
that the strict application of provisions of
these Regulations would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of this
land.
B. That the variance is necessary for the
preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the petitioner.
C. That the granting of the variance shall not
be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to other property in the territory in
which such property is located.
7. Variance Application. The application for any
variance shall be made in writing by the
subdivider at the time when the final plat is
denied by the Planning Commission. Such
application for any variance shall state fully and
clearly all facts relied upon by the petitioner as
defined by Section 7.2.6 and shall be
supplemented with maps, plans or other
additional data which may aid Council in the
analysis of the proposed variance
8. Enforcement, Guarantees and Penalty
A. The Planning Commission is vested with all
the necessary authority to administer and
enforce conditions attached to the final
plat approved for a development project,
including, but not limited to the authority
to:
i. Order, in writing, the remedy for any
noncompliance with the conditions;
ii. Bring legal action to ensure
compliance with the conditions,
including injunction, abatement, or
other appropriate action or proceeding;
and
iii. Require a guarantee satisfactory to the
Planning Commission in an amount
sufficient for and conditioned upon the
construction of any physical
improvements required by the
conditions, or contract for the
construction of the improvements and
the contractor's guarantee, in like
amount and so conditioned, which
guarantee shall be reduced or
released by the Commission upon
satisfactory evidence that construction
of the improvements has been
completed in whole or in part.
B. Failure to meet all conditions attached to
the final plat approved for a development
project shall constitute cause to deny the
issuance of any of the required use,
occupancy or improvement location
permits, as may be appropriate.

A. Conformity. The arrangement, location,
extent, character, width and grade of all
streets shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan and shall be
considered in their relation to existing
streets and to planned streets approved by

public safety and convenience and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of land to be served by such streets. Where
such is not shown in the Comprehensive
Plan the arrangement of streets in a
subdivision shall:
i. Provide for the continuation or
appropriate projection of existing
principal streets in surrounding areas;
or
ii. Conform to a plan for the
neighborhood approved or adopted by
the City to meet a particular situation
where topographical or other
conditions make continuance or
conformance to existing street
impracticable.
B. Street Right-of-Way Width.
i. Street right-of-way widths shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan
and where not shown therein shall be
not less than the following:
ii. A hillside turnaround shall be a
minimum of fifty-eight (58) feet in
diameter and fifty (50) feet diameter
paving at minimum.
C. Minor Streets. Minor streets shall be laid
out so that their use by through traffic is
discouraged.
D. Half Streets. Half streets shall not be
used, except where essential to the
reasonable development of a subdivision
in conformity with other requirements of
these Subdivision Regulations and where
the City finds it practicable to require the
dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever
a half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street
shall be platted within such tract.
E. Dead-End Streets. Dead-end streets
designed to be so permanently shall not be
longer than 500 feet and shall be provided
at the closed end with a turn-around having
an outside roadway diameter of at least
eighty (80) feet and a street property line

1,000 feet, unless one of the following
conditions is found to exist:
i. The extension is impractical because
of topography, the dimensions of the
property subdivided, or other natural
features, including but not limited to,
regulated woodlands and wetlands;
ii. The extension will result in the creation
of undesirable traffic patterns not
customarily found in residential areas.
iii. Subject to Planning Commission
approval, this requirement may be met
by extension of an unimproved right-ofway
if the Commission finds that an
unnecessary hardship will occur in
following the strict enforcement of this
Section and that the public health,
safety and welfare will not be harmed.
G. Minor streets shall be laid out so that their
use by through traffic will be discouraged.
H. The arrangement of streets shall make
provision for the continuation of principal
existing streets in adjoining or adjacent
subdivisions, insofar as they may be of a
width as great as that of the street so
continued or projected. The center line of
such streets shall continue with the center
line of existing streets.
I. There the plat submitted covers only a part
of the subdivider's tract, a sketch of the
proposed future street system as a part of
an overall development plan of the unsubmitted
part shall be considered in light
of adjustments and connections with the
street system of the part not submitted.
J. Proposed streets shall be so arranged in
relation to existing topography as to
produce desirable lots and streets of
reasonable gradient.
K. The street layout plan shall be designed to
provide safe and convenient traffic
circulation within the subdivision and in
relation to access streets. Traffic access to
the subdivision shall be designed to
prevent vehicular congestion or other
impairment of traffic resulting from access
to and from the site.
L. The street layout plan shall provide more
than one point of external access to the
subdivision. A boulevard street entrance
shall not be considered as providing
multiple points of access. Multiple access
points shall be as remote from one another
as is feasible. The requirement for
secondary access may be satisfied by
access to an adjacent subdivision.
Secondary access shall not be required
under the following circumstances:
i. When each lot in the subdivision is no
farther than 800 feet in street length
from the point of external access to
the subdivision.
ii. When the property has limited frontage
along external arterials, or topographic
conditions on the external arterials
reduce sight line distances, so that a
secondary access point cannot be
established which will provide safe
ingress and egress. In such cases, the
City shall require access roads for
emergency vehicles where feasible.
Emergency access roads shall be of all
-weather construction and designed to
support vehicles of twenty-five (25)
tons. To discourage nonemergency
vehicles, emergency access roads
shall be designated by signage as for
emergency access only, shall be
separated from other roadways by
mountable curbs, and shall utilize
entrance radii designed to permit
emergency vehicles while discouraging
nonemergency traffic.
iii. When a stub street is provided to
adjacent property at a location feasible
and practical for the development of a
future connecting street. Where
feasible, the City shall require access
roads for emergency vehicles for use
until such time as the adjacent
property is developed so as to provide
secondary access. Emergency access
roads shall be of all-weather
construction and designed to support
vehicles of twenty-five (25) tons. To
discourage non-emergency vehicles,
emergency access roads shall be
designated by signage as for
emergency access only, shall be
separated from other roadways by
mountable curbs, and shall utilize
entrance radii designed to permit
emergency vehicles while discouraging
nonemergency traffic.

8. Standards of Design for Hillside Subdivisions
A. Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of
this Section is to provide regulation of
subdivisions and minor land division in
hillside areas in a manner that shall adapt
the improvements and lot design to natural
terrain features for the best possible
development. The principal objectives are
to preserve the natural characteristic of the
hill areas by good design practices,
including cluster development where
practical, protect watersheds and natural
watercourses, maintain open space,
preserve trails, and encourage construction
of the highest quality improvement
commensurate with economic feasibility.
B. Lot Design. Each lot shall have an area
equal to or greater than that required by
the Zoning Ordinance or as allowed or
required under other applicable
regulations, such lot area to be sufficient
for the house, setbacks, yards, any
necessary cuts or fills and drainage
facilities. The size and shape shall be such
that any necessary permits can be issued
under normal review procedures based
upon application of ordinance
requirements and accepted design
principles. Future street openings and
street extensions for traffic circulation shall
be provided. Lots typically shall have
frontage on only one (1) street where
practicable, but may have double frontage
when necessary because of natural terrain
features.
All lots shall be designed to provide the
maximum in safety and human enjoyment
while taking advantage of the best natural
building sites. Trees of significant value
and the natural contours of the land shall
be preserved as much as possible.
Where lots have frontage on a roadway
which is not designed to permit parking, off
-street parking shall be provided. Either
individual lot or common parking areas
may be used. Common parking areas to
serve several dwelling units shall be
designed for three (3) spaces per dwelling
unit, exclusive of garage or carport. If
common parking areas are not used, each
lot shall be improved to provide off-street
parking spaces for four (4) cars in addition
to parking provided within garages or
carport. Driveways may be used to provide
this parking.
Appendage type parcels, i.e. flag lots,
corridor lots, etc. may be approved where
this design provides the most practicable
means of access to building sites. Up to
ten (10) percent of the lot area may be
composed of land in the appendage. The
maximum length of the appendage shall be
300 feet. Appendages for single lots shall
not be less than twenty (20) feet wide and
have an all weather driveway surface of not
less than twenty (20) feet. If the length is
over 150 feet, turnouts shall be provided
as required by the advisory agency. No
more than two (2) adjacent appendages
shall be allowed. The combined width of
two (2) adjacent appendages shall be at
least thirty (30) feet, with a paved driveway
surface width of not less than twenty (20)
feet. Reciprocal easements shall be
provided. Lesser width and greater length
appendages may be approved when
sufficient evidence is presented to show
that the above requirements are not
practicable. In all cases, the building site
exclusive of the appendage shall meet the
requirements of this Section and other
applicable regulations.
Lot widths have a significant effect on
aesthetics and improvement costs. To
avoid undesirable narrow, deep lots and
improvement costs, lots widths, except
cluster developments shall be equal to or
greater than:
C. Development in Hazardous Areas.
Development on or adjacent to known
potentially hazardous areas shall be
discouraged. Any proposed subdivision or
minor land division known to be on the
active trace or in the currently active zone
or zones of faults or in the immediate
vicinity or areas which have critically
expansive soils or other soil conditions
which if not corrected would lead to
building structural defects or damage to

land improvements, may be allowed only
after submission to and approval by the
Planning Commission of a soil engineering
report prepared by a recognized authority.
Such report shall specify the remedial
measures, if any are necessary, that shall
make a safe development. Adequate
guarantee shall be provided prior to
recording of the final map or parcel map
that such measures as are necessary shall
be taken before construction of any
buildings or acceptance of any
improvements by the County.
D. Street and Drainage Improvements.
Streets shall be designed to take
advantage of the natural contour of the
land to provide the best possible access to
building sites, reduce cuts and fills and
establish desirable grades. Split level or
one-way design shall be used where
necessary and practical to achieve these
objectives.
E. Since road rights-of-way in hill areas shall
provide adequate space for safe driveway
approaches, pathways, utilities, and
roadway cuts and fills, a forty (40) foot
width will be required. Additional widths or
slope easements shall be provided when
necessary for the construction of split level
roads. Rights-of-way of less than forty (40)
feet may be approved when sufficient
evidence is presented to show that this
width is not practical.
F. Cul-de-sacs normally shall not be designed
to serve more than twenty-four l(24) ots
and the length shall not be more than 750
feet unless justified by topographic
conditions to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer and the Planning Commission.
One-way loop streets shall be considered
when justified by detailed engineering
studies submitted by the subdivider. If oneway
loop streets are used, emergency
pullout areas shall be provided at
approximately 500 foot intervals. The
Planning Commission may require a
second means of access where a dead-end
road is more than 300 feet in length.
Street and drainage improvements shall be
as specified by the City Engineer and he is
authorized to modify these standards as
required by varying topographic conditions.
Stage construction shall be deemed
practical by the City Engineer.
G. Landscaping of streets shall be
encouraged where appropriate especially
on unsightly cuts and fills. Erosion control
plantings shall be provided where
necessary to prevent serious erosion.
H. Water Supply. Domestic water shall be
provided as required for all lots approved
for development.
I. Fire Protection. Fire protection facilities
and water supply for fire protection shall be
provided to the satisfaction of the Fire
Department to reduce the risk of fire loss
or damage. All land division shall meet any
additional standards for fire protection
facilities and water supply for fire
protection adopted by ordinance of
Council.
7.6 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Prior to the granting of final approval of the final
plat, the subdivider shall have installed or shall
have furnished adequate bond for the ultimate
installation of the following:
1. Monuments. Monuments shall be placed at all
block corners, angle points, points of curves in
streets and at intermediate points as shall be
required by the City Engineer. The monuments
shall be of such material, size and length as
may be required by the City Engineer.
2. Streets.
A. Grading. All streets shall be uniformly
graded to full right-of-way width and in
accordance with lines and grades given
conditional approval by the City. All
watercourses crossed by a street or other
open way shall be provided with permanent
culverts of adequate size and of a type and
size meeting City specifications.
B. Construction. All streets shall be fully
constructed and surfaced in accordance
with City specifications for the particular
types of roadways and pavements in the
subdivision; and such construction shall be
subject to inspection and approval of the
City Engineer.
C. Curbs and gutters. Curbs and gutters shall
be constructed in accordance with City
specifications and installed in all
subdivisions. Such construction shall be
subject to inspection and approval by the
City Engineer.

3. Sidewalks. Sidewalks where required shall be
constructed in accordance with the West
Virginia specifications for Highways and Bridge
Section 609, adopted by reference.
4. Water Supply. A water supply system with
mains of ductile iron, at least eight (8) inches in
diameter and having a sufficient number of
outlets to furnish adequate domestic water
supply for each lot of the subdivision and to
provide adequate fire protection to meet local
neighborhood needs shall be provided by the
subdivider subject to statutory provisions
governing such construction.
5. Sanitary Sewer System. Where a public sanitary
sewer is reasonably accessible, each lot within
the subdivision shall be provided with a
connection thereto which shall be extended to
the main part of the building lot. All
connections shall conform to the requirements
of the Sanitary Board, City of Fairmont, and
shall be subject to the approval of such Board.
All sanitary sewer lines shall be a minimum of
eight (8) inches in diameter.
A. Sewer planned. When the public sanitary
sewer system is not reasonably accessible,
but where plans for the installation of
sanitary sewers in the vicinity of a
subdivision have been prepared by the City
Sanitary Board, the subdivider may be
required to install sewers in conformity with
such plans. In such cases, until a
connection can be made with the public
sewer system, the use of individual
disposal devices shall be permitted,
provided such disposal devices are
approved by the Sanitary Sewer Board and
are within the requirements of the State
Department of Health.
B. Sewer not accessible. Where a public
sanitary sewer system is not accessible
and no plans for sewers have been
prepared, the subdivider may be required
to install sewer lines and a disposal system
meeting all applicable state and local
statutory requirements. Provided, that if
the subdivision has been platted into lots
of more than 10,000 square feet, the
subdivider may install individual disposal
devices for each lot at the time
improvements are erected thereon. All
such individual sewage disposal devices
and systems shall be constructed in
accordance with Sanitary Board and State
Department of Health requirements.
C. No combination sewer. In no case shall
connections be made with a sanitary sewer
line within or without a subdivision for the
disposal of surface or ground water, storm
water or water from roof drains of any
structure.
6. Storm Sewer.
A. Public storm sewer accessible. When a
public storm sewer is reasonably
accessible, the subdivider shall provide a
system of storm sewers, separate and
apart from sanitary sewers, and of
sufficient size and capacity and with an
adequate number of catch basins to
handle neighborhood need in the
subdivision.
B. Public storm sewers not accessible. When
a public storm sewer is not reasonably
accessible, the subdivider shall provide a
system of storm sewers, separate and
apart from sanitary sewers, and of
sufficient size and capacity and with an
adequate number of catch basins to
handle neighborhood need in the
subdivision providing the City has plans for
a public storm sewer connection within, or
in the vicinity of, the subdivision, or when
the City can provide a suitable watercourse
or drainage way pending the availability of
a storm sewer.

PERMIT
Nothing in this Ordinance shall require any change
in the plans, construction, or designed use of any
building or structure for which a building permit was
secured prior to the adoption of this Ordinance,
providing the building permit remains valid.
8.2 RESTORING UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any
part of a building or structure declared unsafe by
the City.
8.3 NON-CONFORMITIES
1. Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of this
Article is to regulate and limit the continued
existence of uses and structures established
prior to the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance (or any amendment subsequent
thereto) that do not conform to this Zoning
Ordinance. Any non-conformity created by a
change in the classification of property or the
text of these rules and regulations shall be
regulated by the provisions of this Article. Many
non-conformities may continue, but the
provisions of this Section are designed to
curtail substant ial investment in
nonconformities and to bring about eventual
elimination and/or lessen their impact upon
surrounding conforming uses in order to
preserve the integrity of the area in which it is
located and the intent of this Zoning Ordinance.
2. Non-Conforming Uses
A. Non-conforming uses of land or structures,
and non-conforming structures that contain
non-conforming uses, may continue only in
accordance with the provisions of this
Article, but this Article shall only apply to
the extent said non-conformities fully and
clearly meet the definition of “nonconforming
use” in Section 2.2.
B. Normal structural repair and maintenance
may be performed to allow the
continuation of a non-conforming use.
C. A non-conforming use may be enlarged or
increased to occupy a greater area of a
building than was occupied at the effective
date of the adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance after review and approval by the
Board of Zoning Appeals upon reaching a
determination that the proposed
enlargement, increase, or greater area;
i. Shall not have a substantial
detrimental effect on the use and
enjoyment of adjacent uses or lots;
ii. Shall comply with all parking, sign,
landscaping, or other applicable
regulations to the area affected by the
proposed enlargement, increase, or
greater area as evidenced on an
approved site plan;
iii. No land beyond what was original to
the use will be occupied or used by the
non-conforming use. Where
permissible, additional land may be
added to the development but can only
be constructed and used in
accordance with the regulations of this
Ordinance and shall not act to enlarge
a non-conforming use, building, or
structure.
D. An existing non-conforming residential use
located in a non-residential district may,
however, be enlarged or altered. Any such
enlargement or alteration shall be in
compliance with all yard requirements of
such structures as required in the specific
district.
E. Upon authorization by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, a non-conforming use may be
changed to another equal or less intense
non-conforming use.
F. Once a non-conforming use has been
changed or converted to a conforming use,
it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming
use.
G. If a use of a property that does not conform
to this Zoning Ordinance has ceased and
the property has been vacant for one (1)
year, abandonment will be presumed and
the non-conforming use shall not be
allowed to re-establish. If the property has
been abandoned, then any future use of
the land, buildings, or structures shall
conform to and be in accordance with all
applicable rules, regulations and
requirements of the particular district
wherein the property is located as provided
in this Zoning Ordinance, unless the
property is a duly designated historic
landmark, historic site, or historic district.

for the zoning district in which it is located. No
non-conforming accessory use or structure
shall become or replace any terminated
principal non-conforming use or structure.
5. Non-conforming Lots
A. Except as provided in b and c of this
Section, a nonconforming vacant lot
existing and of official record as of the
effective date of this Ordinance may be
developed for any of the uses permitted by
these regulations in the zoning district in
which it is located, provided that the use
meets all applicable yard and setback
requirements for the zoning district in
which the lot is located.
B. A non-conforming vacant lot shall not be
developed if it could be combined with an
adjoining lot (said lot being owned by the
same person and any or all future assigns)
on or after the effective date of these
regulations in order to create a single lot.
Where an owner owns adjoining property,
construction may occur across the lot lines
if that is the only way the yard
requirements may be met without a
variance. If said combination, however,
results in the creation of a single lot that is
more than one and one-half (1 ½) times
the minimum lot width or area required in
the zoning district, then the single lot may
be divided into two lots of equal width and
area without being further classified as non
-conforming. For the purposes of this
Section, "adjoining" shall be deemed to
mean the sharing of one or more common
lot lines and access to both lots can be
provided by the same street without
crossing that street.
C. Notwithstanding subsection (b) hereof, a
non-conforming lot may be developed if, at
the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance
or any subsequent date upon which the lot
became non-conforming,

comply with all applicable parking and
loading area landscaping and screening.
B. Expansion of buildings by more than fifty
percent (50%) of the original structure shall
require all landscaping, lighting, and
screening requirements to be met.
7. Non-Conforming Limited Video Lottery and
Private Clubs. Limited video lottery and private
clubs which are legal non-conforming uses as
defined by this Ordinance may continue
according to this Section but shall not be
permitted to expand within the building it
occupies.
8. Burden of Establishing Status. The burden of
establishing legal, pre-existing non-conforming
status rests on: the property owner or party
seeking to continue the non-conforming use or
occupancy; any person applying for a Building
Permit or, any other person asserting such
status. Such persons shall provide sufficient
proof in a form acceptable to the Planning
Director of the following:
A. The date of construction of the building or
structure or the date the use was
established;
B. The continuous operation of the
nonconforming use; and,
